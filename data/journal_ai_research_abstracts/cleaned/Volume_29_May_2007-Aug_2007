2011 ijcaijair best paper prize

a major achievement of mechanism design theory is a general method for the construction of truthful mechanisms called vcg vickrey  clarke  groves when applying this method to complex problems such as combinatorial auctions a difficulty arises vcg mechanisms are required to compute optimal outcomes and are therefore computationally infeasible however if the optimal outcome is replaced by the results of a suboptimal algorithm the resulting mechanism termed vcgbased is no longer necessarily truthful the first part of this paper studies this phenomenon in depth and shows that it is near universal  specifically we prove that essentially all reasonable approximations or heuristics for combinatorial auctions as well as a wide class of cost minimization problems yield nontruthful vcgbased mechanisms we generalize these results for affine maximizers
the second part of this paper proposes a general method for circumventing the above problem we introduce a modification of vcgbased mechanisms in which the agents are given a chance to improve the output of the underlying algorithm when the agents behave truthfully the welfare obtained by the mechanism is at least as good as the one obtained by the algorithms output we provide a strong rationale for truthtelling behavior our method satisfies individual rationality as well



j  c beck 2007 solutionguided multipoint constructive search for job shop scheduling volume 29 pages 4977

solutionguided multipoint constructive search sgmpcs is a novel constructive search technique that performs a series of resourcelimited tree searches where each search begins either from an empty solution as in randomized restart or from a solution that has been encountered during the search a small number of these elite solutions is maintained during the search we introduce the technique and perform three sets of experiments on the job shop scheduling problem first a systematic fully crossed study of sgmpcs is carried out to evaluate the performance impact of various parameter settings second we inquire into the diversity of the elite solution set showing contrary to expectations that a less diverse set leads to stronger performance finally we compare the best parameter setting of sgmpcs from the first two experiments to chronological backtracking limited discrepancy search randomized restart and a sophisticated tabu search algorithm on a set of wellknown benchmark problems results demonstrate that sgmpcs is significantly better than the other constructive techniques tested though lags behind the tabu search




c  orasan and r  j evans 2007 np animacy identification for anaphora resolution volume 29 pages 79103

in anaphora resolution for english animacy identification can play an integral role in the application of agreement restrictions between pronouns and candidates and as a result can improve the accuracy of anaphora resolution systems in this paper two methods for animacy identification are proposed and evaluated using intrinsic and extrinsic measures the first method is a rulebased one which uses information about the unique beginners in wordnet to classify nps on the basis of their animacy the second method relies on a machine learning algorithm which exploits a wordnet enriched with animacy information for each sense the effect of word sense disambiguation on the two methods is also assessed the intrinsic evaluation reveals that the machine learning method reaches human levels of performance the extrinsic evaluation demonstrates that animacy identification can be beneficial in anaphora resolution especially in the cases where animate entities are identified with high precision



m  surdeanu l  marquez x  carreras and p  r comas 2007 combination strategies for semantic role labeling volume 29 pages 105151

this paper introduces and analyzes a battery of inference models for the problem of semantic role labeling one based on constraint satisfaction and several strategies that model the inference as a metalearning problem using discriminative classifiers these classifiers are developed with a rich set of novel features that encode proposition and sentencelevel information to our knowledge this is the first work that a performs a thorough analysis of learningbased inference models for semantic role labeling and b compares several inference strategies in this context we evaluate the proposed inference strategies in the framework of the conll2005 shared task using only automaticallygenerated syntactic information  the extensive experimental evaluation and analysis indicates that all the proposed inference strategies are successful they all outperform the current best results reported in the conll2005 evaluation exercise but each of the proposed approaches has its advantages and disadvantages several important traits of a stateoftheart srl combination strategy emerge from this analysis i individual models should be combined at the granularity of candidate arguments rather than at the granularity of complete solutions ii the best combination strategy uses an inference model based in learning and iii the learningbased inference benefits from maxmargin classifiers and  global feedback 



p  f felzenszwalb and d  mcallester 2007 the generalized a architecture volume 29 pages 153190

we consider the problem of computing a lightest derivation of a global structure using a set of weighted rules  a large variety of inference problems in ai can be formulated in this framework  we generalize a search and heuristics derived from abstractions to a broad class of lightest derivation problems  we also describe a new algorithm that searches for lightest derivations using a hierarchy of abstractions  our generalization of a gives a new algorithm for searching andor graphs in a bottomup fashion




j  huang and a  darwiche 2007 the language of search volume 29 pages 191219

this paper is concerned with a class of algorithms that perform exhaustive search on propositional knowledge bases we show that each of these algorithms defines and generates a propositional language specifically we show that the trace of a search can be interpreted as a combinational circuit and a search algorithm then defines a propositional language consisting of circuits that are generated across all possible executions of the algorithm in particular we show that several versions of exhaustive dpll search correspond to such wellknown languages as fbdd obdd and a preciselydefined subset of ddnnf by thus mapping search algorithms to propositional languages we provide a uniform and practical framework in which successful search techniques can be harnessed for compilation of knowledge into various languages of interest and a new methodology whereby the power and limitations of search algorithms can be understood by looking up the tractability and succinctness of the corresponding propositional languages



r  vieira a  f moreira m  wooldridge and r  h bordini 2007 on the formal semantics of speechact based communication in an agentoriented programming language volume 29 pages 221267

research on agent communication languages has typically taken the speech acts paradigm as its starting point despite their manifest attractions speechact models of communication have several serious disadvantages as a foundation for communication in artificial agent systems in particular it has proved to be extremely difficult to give a satisfactory semantics to speechact based agent communication languages in part the problem is that speechact semantics typically make reference to the mental states of agents their beliefs desires and intentions and there is in general no way to attribute such attitudes to arbitrary computational agents in addition agent programming languages have only had their semantics formalised for abstract standalone versions neglecting aspects such as communication primitives with respect to communication implemented agent programming languages have tended to be rather ad hoc this paper addresses both of these problems by giving semantics to speechact based messages received by an agentspeak agent agentspeak is a logicbased agent programming language which incorporates the main features of the prs model of reactive planning systems the paper builds upon a structural operational semantics to agentspeak that we developed in previous work the main contributions of this paper are as follows an extension of our earlier work on the theoretical foundations of agentspeak interpreters a computationally grounded semantics for the core performatives used in speechact based agent communication languages and a welldefined extension of agentspeak that supports agent communication




t  di noia e  di sciascio and f  m donini 2007 semantic matchmaking as nonmonotonic reasoning a description logic approach volume 29 pages 269307

matchmaking arises when supply and demand meet in an electronic marketplace or when agents search for a web service to perform some task or even when recruiting agencies match curricula and job profiles  in such open environments the objective of a matchmaking process is to discover best available offers to a given request
finally we report on the implementation of the proposed matchmaking framework which has been used both as a mediator in emarketplaces and for semantic web services discovery



h  m pasula l  s zettlemoyer and l  p kaelbling 2007 learning symbolic models of stochastic domains volume 29 pages 309352

in this article we work towards the goal of developing agents that can learn to act in complex worlds  we develop a probabilistic relational planning rule representation that compactly models noisy nondeterministic action effects and show how such rules can be effectively learned  through experiments in simple planning domains and a 3d simulated blocks world with realistic physics we demonstrate that this learning algorithm allows agents to effectively model world dynamics



t  c son e  pontelli and p  h tu 2007 answer sets for logic programs with arbitrary abstract constraint atoms volume 29 pages 353389

in this paper we present two alternative approaches to defining answer sets for logic programs with arbitrary types of abstract constraint atoms catoms these approaches generalize the fixpointbased and the level mapping based answer set semantics of normal logic programs to the case of logic programs with arbitrary types of catoms the results are four different answer set definitions which are equivalent when applied to normal logic programs  
we show that the newly defined semantics coincide with previously introduced semantics for logic programs with monotone catoms and they extend the original answer set semantics of normal logic programs we also study some properties of answer sets of programs with catoms and relate our definitions to several semantics for logic programs with aggregates presented in the literature  



r  jurca and b  faltings 2007 obtaining reliable feedback for sanctioning reputation mechanisms volume 29 pages 391419

reputation mechanisms offer an effective alternative to verification authorities for building trust in electronic markets with moral hazard future clients guide their business decisions by considering the feedback from past transactions if truthfully exposed cheating behavior is sanctioned and thus becomes irrational
it therefore becomes important to ensure that rational clients have the right incentives to report honestly as an alternative to sidepayment schemes that explicitly reward truthful reports we show that honesty can emerge as a rational behavior when clients have a repeated presence in the market to this end we describe a mechanism that supports an equilibrium where truthful feedback is obtained then we characterize the set of paretooptimal equilibria of the mechanism and derive an upper bound on the percentage of false reports that can be recorded by the mechanism an important role in the existence of this bound is played by the fact that rational clients can establish a reputation for reporting honestly



c  pralet g  verfaillie and t  schiex 2007 an algebraic graphical model for decision with uncertainties feasibilities and utilities volume 29 pages 421489

numerous formalisms and dedicated algorithms have been designed in the last decades to model and solve decision making problems some formalisms such as constraint networks can express simple decision problems while others are designed to take into account uncertainties unfeasible decisions and utilities even in a single formalism several variants are often proposed to model different types of uncertainty probability possibility or utility additive or not  in this article we introduce an algebraic graphical model that encompasses a large number of such formalisms 1 we first adapt previous structures from friedman chu and halpern for representing uncertainty utility and expected utility in order to deal with generic forms of sequential decision making 2 on these structures we then introduce composite graphical models that express information via variables linked by local functions thanks to conditional independence 3 on these graphical models we finally define a simple class of queries which can represent various scenarios in terms of observabilities and controllabilities a natural decisiontree semantics for such queries is completed by an equivalent operational semantics which induces generic algorithms  the proposed framework called the plausibilityfeasibilityutility pfu framework  not only provides a better understanding of the links between existing formalisms but it also covers yet unpublished frameworks such as possibilistic influence diagrams and unifies formalisms such as quantified boolean formulas and influence diagrams our backtrack and variable elimination generic algorithms are a first step towards unified algorithms
