r  j mooney and  m  e califf 1995 induction of firstorder decision lists results on learning the past tense of english verbs volume 3 pages 124

this paper presents a method for inducing logic programs    from examples that learns a new class of concepts called firstorder    decision lists defined as ordered lists of clauses each ending in a    cut  the method called foidl is based on foil quinlan 1990 but    employs intensional background knowledge and avoids the need for    explicit negative examples  it is particularly useful for problems    that involve rules with specific exceptions such as learning the    pasttense of english verbs a task widely studied in the context of    the symbolicconnectionist debate  foidl is able to learn concise    accurate programs for this problem from significantly fewer examples    than previous methods both connectionist and symbolic



m  veloso and  p  stone 1995 flecs planning with a flexible commitment strategy volume 3 pages 2552

there has been evidence that leastcommitment planners can    efficiently handle planning problems that involve difficult goal    interactions  this evidence has led to the common belief that    delayedcommitment is the best possible planning strategy  however    we recently found evidence that eagercommitment planners can handle a    variety of planning problems more efficiently in particular those    with difficult operator choices  resigned to the futility of trying    to find a universally successful planning strategy we devised a    planner that can be used to study which domains and problems are best    for which planning strategies in this article we introduce this new    planning algorithm flecs which uses a flexible commitment strategy    with respect to planstep orderings  it is able to use any strategy    from delayedcommitment to eagercommitment  the combination of    delayed and eager operatorordering commitments allows flecs to take    advantage of the benefits of explicitly using a simulated execution    state and reasoning about planning constraints  flecs can vary its    commitment strategy across different problems and domains and also    during the course of a single planning problem  flecs represents a    novel contribution to planning in that it explicitly provides the    choice of which commitment strategy to use while planning  flecs    provides a framework to investigate the mapping from planning domains    and problems to efficient planning strategies



r  bergmann and  w  wilke 1995 building and refining abstract planning cases by change of representation language volume 3 pages 53118

abstraction is one of the most promising approaches to improve the    performance of problem solvers in several domains abstraction by    dropping sentences of a domain description  as used in most    hierarchical planners  has proven useful in this paper we present    examples which illustrate significant drawbacks of abstraction by    dropping sentences to overcome these drawbacks we propose a more    general view of abstraction involving the change of representation    language we have developed a new abstraction methodology and a    related sound and complete learning algorithm that allows the complete    change of representation language of planning cases from concrete to    abstract  however to achieve a powerful change of the representation    language the abstract language itself as well as rules which describe    admissible ways of abstracting states must be provided in the domain    model this new abstraction approach is the core of paris plan    abstraction and refinement in an integrated system a system in which    abstract planning cases are automatically learned from given concrete    cases an empirical study in the domain of process planning in    mechanical engineering shows significant advantages of the proposed    reasoning from abstract cases over classical hierarchical planning



q  zhao and  t  nishida 1995 using qualitative hypotheses to identify inaccurate data volume 3 pages 119145

identifying inaccurate data has long been regarded as a    significant and difficult problem in ai in this paper we present a    new method for identifying inaccurate data on the basis of qualitative    correlations among related data first we introduce the definitions    of related data and qualitative correlations among related data  then    we put forward a new concept called support coefficient function    scf scf can be used to extract represent and calculate    qualitative correlations among related data within a dataset we    propose an approach to determining dynamic shift intervals of    inaccurate data and an approach to calculating possibility of    identifying inaccurate data respectively both of the approaches are    based on scf finally we present an algorithm for identifying    inaccurate data by using qualitative correlations among related data    as confirmatory or disconfirmatory evidence we have developed a    practical system for interpreting infrared spectra by applying the    method and have fully tested the system against several hundred real    spectra the experimental results show that the method is    significantly better than the conventional methods used in many    similar systems



c  g giraudcarrier and  t  r martinez 1995 an integrated framework for learning and reasoning volume 3 pages 147185

learning and reasoning are both aspects of what is    considered to be intelligence their studies within ai have been    separated historically learning being the topic of machine learning    and neural networks and reasoning falling under classical or    symbolic ai  however learning and reasoning are in many ways    interdependent this paper discusses the nature of some of these    interdependencies and proposes a general framework called flare that    combines inductive learning using prior knowledge together with    reasoning in a propositional setting several examples that test the    framework are presented including classical induction many important    reasoning protocols and two simple expert systems



k  woods  d  cook  l  hall  k  bowyer and  l  stark 1995 learning membership functions in a functionbased object recognition system volume 3 pages 187222

functionalitybased recognition systems recognize objects at    the category level by reasoning about how well the objects support the    expected function such systems naturally associate a measure of    goodness or membership value with a recognized object  this    measure of goodness is the result of combining individual measures or    membership values from potentially many primitive evaluations of    different properties of the objects shape a membership function is    used to compute the membership value when evaluating a primitive of a    particular physical property of an object  in previous versions of a    recognition system known as gruff the membership function for each of    the primitive evaluations was handcrafted by the system designer  in    this paper we provide a learning component for the gruff system    called omlet that automatically learns membership functions given a    set of example objects labeled with their desired category measure    the learning algorithm is generally applicable to any problem in which    lowlevel membership values are combined through an andor tree    structure to give a final overall membership value



g  pinkas and  r  dechter 1995 improving connectionist energy minimization volume 3 pages 223248

symmetric networks designed for energy minimization such as    boltzman machines and hopfield nets are frequently investigated for    use in optimization constraint satisfaction and approximation of    nphard problems nevertheless finding a global solution ie a    global minimum for the energy function is not guaranteed and even a    local solution may take an exponential number of steps  we propose an    improvement to the standard local activation function used for such    networks  the improved algorithm guarantees that a global minimum is    found in linear time for treelike subnetworks the algorithm called    activate is uniform and does not assume that the network is    treelike  it can identify treelike subnetworks even in cyclic    topologies arbitrary networks and avoid local minima along these    trees  for acyclic networks the algorithm is guaranteed to converge    to a global minimum from any initial state of the system    selfstabilization and remains correct under various types of    schedulers  on the negative side we show that in the presence of    cycles no uniform algorithm exists that guarantees optimality even    under a sequential asynchronous scheduler  an asynchronous scheduler    can activate only one unit at a time while a synchronous scheduler can    activate any number of units in a single time step  in addition no    uniform algorithm exists to optimize even acyclic networks when the    scheduler is synchronous  finally we show how the algorithm can be    improved using the cyclecutset scheme  the general algorithm called    activatewithcutset improves over activate and has some performance    guarantees that are related to the size of the networks cyclecutset



y  bengio and  p  frasconi 1995 diffusion of context and credit information in markovian models volume 3 pages 249270

this paper studies the problem of ergodicity of transition    probability matrices in markovian models such as hidden markov models    hmms and how it makes very difficult the task of learning to    represent longterm context for sequential data  this phenomenon    hurts the forward propagation of longterm context information as    well as learning a hidden state representation to represent longterm    context which depends on propagating credit information backwards in    time  using results from markov chain theory we show that this    problem of diffusion of context and credit is reduced when the    transition probabilities approach 0 or 1 ie the transition    probability matrices are sparse and the model essentially    deterministic  the results found in this paper apply to learning    approaches based on continuous optimization such as gradient descent    and the baumwelch algorithm



s  b huffman and  j  e laird 1995 flexibly instructable agents volume 3 pages 271324

this paper presents an approach to learning from situated    interactive tutorial instruction within an ongoing agent  tutorial    instruction is a flexible and thus powerful paradigm for teaching    tasks because it allows an instructor to communicate whatever types of    knowledge an agent might need in whatever situations might arise  to    support this flexibility however the agent must be able to learn    multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of instructional    interactions  our approach called situated explanation achieves    such learning through a combination of analytic and inductive    techniques  it combines a form of explanationbased learning that is    situated for each instruction with a full suite of contextually guided    responses to incomplete explanations  the approach is implemented in    an agent called instructosoar that learns hierarchies of new tasks    and other domain knowledge from interactive natural language    instructions  instructosoar meets three key requirements of flexible    instructability that distinguish it from previous systems 1 it can    take known or unknown commands at any instruction point 2 it can    handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to a    hypothetical situation specified in language as in for instance    conditional instructions and 3 it can learn from instructions    each class of knowledge it uses to perform tasks

the main aim of this work is the development of a    visionbased road detection system fast enough to cope with the    difficult realtime constraints imposed by moving vehicle    applications  the hardware platform a specialpurpose massively    parallel system has been chosen to minimize system production and    operational costs           this paper presents a novel approach to expectationdriven lowlevel    image segmentation which can be mapped naturally onto meshconnected    massively parallel simd architectures capable of handling hierarchical    data structures  the input image is assumed to contain a distorted    version of a given template a multiresolution stretching process is    used to reshape the original template in accordance with the acquired    image content minimizing a potential function  the distorted    template is the process output



r  khardon 1995 translating between horn representations and their characteristic models volume 3 pages 349372

characteristic models are an alternative model based    representation for horn expressions it has been shown that these two    representations are incomparable and each has its advantages over the    other it is therefore natural to ask what is the cost of translating    back and forth between these representations interestingly the same    translation questions arise in database theory where it has    applications to the design of relational databases this paper studies    the computational complexity of these problems        our main result is that the two translation problems are equivalent under    polynomial reductions and that they are equivalent to the corresponding    decision problem namely translating is equivalent to deciding whether a    given set of models is the set of characteristic models for a given horn    expression            we also relate these problems to the hypergraph transversal problem a    well known problem which is related to other applications in ai and for    which no polynomial time algorithm is known it is shown that in general    our translation problems are at least as hard as the hypergraph    transversal problem and in a special case they are equivalent to it



m  buro 1995 statistical feature combination for the evaluation of game positions volume 3 pages 373382

this article describes an application of three wellknown    statistical methods in the field of gametree search using a large    number of classified othello positions feature weights for evaluation    functions with a gamephaseindependent meaning are estimated by means    of logistic regression fishers linear discriminant and the    quadratic discriminant function for normally distributed    features thereafter the playing strengths are compared by means of    tournaments between the resulting versions of a worldclass othello    program in this application logistic regression  which is used here    for the first time in the context of game playing  leads to better    results than the other approaches



s  m weiss and  n  indurkhya 1995 rulebased machine learning methods for functional prediction volume 3 pages 383403

we describe a machine learning method for predicting the    value of a realvalued function given the values of multiple input    variables the method induces solutions from samples in the form of    ordered disjunctive normal form dnf decision rules a central    objective of the method and representation is the induction of    compact easily interpretable solutions  this rulebased decision    model can be extended to search efficiently for similar cases prior to    approximating function values experimental results on realworld data    demonstrate that the new techniques are competitive with existing    machine learning and statistical methods and can sometimes yield    superior regression performance



d  heckerman and  r  shachter 1995 decisiontheoretic foundations for causal reasoning volume 3 pages 405430

we present a definition of cause and effect in terms of    decisiontheoretic primitives and thereby provide a principled    foundation for causal reasoning  our definition departs from the    traditional view of causation in that causal assertions may vary with    the set of decisions available  we argue that this approach provides    added clarity to the notion of cause  also in this paper we examine    the encoding of causal relationships in directed acyclic graphs  we    describe a special class of influence diagrams those in canonical    form and show its relationship to pearls representation of cause and    effect  finally we show how canonical form facilitates    counterfactual reasoning



g  i webb 1995 opus an efficient admissible algorithm for unordered search volume 3 pages 431465

opus is a branch and bound search algorithm that enables    efficient admissible search through spaces for which the order of    search operator application is not significant  the algorithms    search efficiency is demonstrated with respect to very large machine    learning search spaces  the use of admissible search is of potential    value to the machine learning community as it means that the exact    learning biases to be employed for complex learning tasks can be    precisely specified and manipulated  opus also has potential for    application in other areas of artificial intelligence notably truth    maintenance



p  idestamalmquist 1995 generalization of clauses under implication volume 3 pages 467489

in the area of inductive learning generalization is a main    operation and the usual definition of induction is based on logical    implication  recently there has been a rising interest in clausal    representation of knowledge in machine learning almost all inductive    learning systems that perform generalization of clauses use the    relation thetasubsumption instead of implication the main reason is    that there is a wellknown and simple technique to compute least    general generalizations under thetasubsumption but not under    implication  however generalization under thetasubsumption is    inappropriate for learning recursive clauses which is a crucial    problem since recursion is the basic program structure of logic    programs     we note that implication between clauses is undecidable and we    therefore introduce a stronger form of implication called    timplication which is decidable between clauses we show that for    every finite set of clauses there exists a least general    generalization under timplication  we describe a technique to reduce    generalizations under implication of a clause to generalizations under    thetasubsumption of what we call an expansion of the original    clause moreover we show that for every nontautological clause there    exists a tcomplete expansion which means that every generalization    under timplication of the clause is reduced to a generalization under    thetasubsumption of the expansion
