d  long and  m  fox 2003 the 3rd international planning competition results and analysis volume 20 pages 159

this paper reports the outcome of the third in the series of biennial international planning competitions held in association with the international conference on ai planning and scheduling aips in 2002 in addition to describing the domains the planners and the objectives of the competition the paper includes analysis of the results the results are analysed from several perspectives in order to address the questions of comparative performance between planners comparative difficulty of domains the degree of agreement between planners about the relative difficulty of individual problem instances and the question of how well planners scale relative to one another over increasingly difficult problems the paper addresses these questions through statistical analysis of the raw results of the competition in order to determine which results can be considered to be adequately supported by the data the paper concludes with a discussion of some challenges for the future of the competition series



m  fox and  d  long 2003 pddl21 an extension to pddl for expressing temporal planning domains volume 20 pages 61124

in recent years research in the planning community has moved increasingly toward s application of planners to realistic problems involving both time and many typ es of resources for example interest in planning demonstrated by the space res earch community has inspired work in observation scheduling planetary rover ex ploration and spacecraft control domains other temporal and resourceintensive domains including logistics planning plant control and manufacturing have also helped to focus the community on the modelling and reasoning issues that must be confronted to make planning technology meet the challenges of application   the international planning competitions have acted as an important motivating fo rce behind the progress that has been made in planning since 1998 the third com petition held in 2002 set the planning community the challenge of handling tim e and numeric resources this necessitated the development of a modelling langua ge capable of expressing temporal and numeric properties of planning domains in this paper we describe the language pddl21 that was used in the competition  we describe the syntax of the language its formal semantics and the validation of concurrent plans we observe that pddl21 has considerable modelling power  exceeding the capabilities of current planning technology  and presents a number of important challenges to the research community



f  bacchus 2003 the power of modelinga response to pddl21 volume 20 pages 125132

in this commentary i argue that although pddl is a very useful standard for the planning competition its design does not properly consider the issue of domain modeling hence i would not advocate its use in specifying planning domains outside of the context of the planning competition rather the field needs to explore different approaches and grapple more directly with the problem of effectively modeling and utilizing all of the diverse pieces of knowledge we typically have about planning domains



m  s boddy 2003 imperfect match  pddl 21 and real applications volume 20 pages 133137

pddl was originally conceived and constructed as a lingua franca for the international planning competition  pddl21 embodies a set of extensions intended to support the expression of something closer to real planning problems  this objective has only been partially achieved due in large part to a deliberate focus on not moving too far from classical planning models and solution methods



h  a geffner 2003 pddl 21 representation vs computation volume 20 pages 139144

i comment on the pddl 21 language and its use in the planning competition focusing on the choices made for accommodating time and concurrency  i also discuss some methodological issues that have to do with the move toward more expressive planning languages and the balance needed in planning research between semantics and computation



d  mcdermott 2003 pddl21  the art of the possible  commentary on fox and long volume 20 pages 145148

pddl21 was designed to push the envelope of what planning algorithms can do and it has succeeded it adds two important features durative actionswhich take time and may have continuous effects and objective functions for measuring the quality of plans the concept of durative actions is flawed and the treatment of their semantics reveals too strong an attachment to the way many contemporary planners work future pddl innovators should focus on producing a clean semantics for additions to the language and let planner implementers worry about coupling their algorithms to problems expressed in the latest version of the language



d  e smith 2003 the case for durative actions a commentary on pddl21 volume 20 pages 149154

the addition of durative actions to pddl21 sparked some controversy fox and long argued that actions should be considered as instantaneous but can start and stop processes  ultimately a limited notion of durative actions was incorporated into the language i argue that this notion is still impoverished and that the underlying philosophical position of regarding durative actions as being a shorthand for a start action process and stop action ignores the realities of modelling and execution for complex systems



m  do and  s  kambhampati 2003 sapa a multiobjective metric temporal planner volume 20 pages 155194

sapa is a domainindependent heuristic forward chaining planner  that can handle durative actions metric resource constraints  and deadline goals it is designed to be capable of handling the  multiobjective nature of metric temporal planning  our technical  contributions include i planninggraph based methods for deriving  heuristics that are sensitive to both cost and makespan ii  techniques for adjusting the heuristic estimates to take action  interactions and metric resource limitations into account and  iii a linear time greedy postprocessing technique to improve  execution flexibility of the solution plans an implementation of sapa using many of the techniques presented in this paper was one of the best domain independent planners for domains with metric and temporal constraints in the third international planning competition held at aips02 we describe the technical details of extracting the heuristics and present an empirical evaluation of the current implementation of sapa



s  edelkamp 2003 taming numbers and durations in the model checking integrated planning system volume 20 pages 195238

the model checking integrated planning system mips is a temporal least commitment heuristic search planner based on a flexible objectoriented workbench architecture its design clearly separates explicit and symbolic directed exploration algorithms from the set of online and offline computed estimates and associated data structures   mips has shown distinguished performance in the last two international planning competitions in the last event the description language was extended from pure propositional planning to include numerical state variables action durations and plan quality objective functions plans were no longer sequences of actions but timestamped schedules   as a participant of the fully automated track of the competition mips has proven to be a general system in each track and every benchmark domain it efficiently computed plans of remarkable quality this article introduces and analyzes the most important algorithmic novelties that were necessary to tackle the new layers of expressiveness in the benchmark problems and to achieve a high level of performance   the extensions include critical path analysis of sequentially generated plans to generate corresponding optimal parallel plans  the linear time algorithm to compute the parallel plan bypasses known np hardness results for partial ordering by scheduling plans with respect to the set of actions and the imposed precedence relations the efficiency of this algorithm also allows us to improve the exploration guidance for each encountered planning state the corresponding approximate sequential plan is scheduled   one major strength of mips is its static analysis phase that grounds and simplifies parameterized predicates functions and operators that infers knowledge to minimize the state description length and that detects domain object symmetries  the latter aspect is analyzed in detail   mips has been developed to serve as a complete and optimal state space planner with admissible estimates exploration engines and branching cuts in the competition version however certain performance compromises had to be made including floating point arithmetic weighted heuristic search exploration according to an inadmissible estimate and parameterized optimization



a  gerevini  a  saetti and  i  serina 2003 planning through stochastic local search and temporal action graphs in lpg volume 20 pages 239290

we present some techniques for planning in domains specified with the recent standard language pddl21 supporting durative actions and numerical quantities these techniques are implemented in lpg a domainindependent planner that took part in the 3rd international planning competition ipc lpg is an incremental any time system  producing multicriteria quality plans the core of the system is  based on a stochastic local search method and on a graphbased  representation called temporal action graphs tagraphs   this paper focuses on temporal planning introducing tagraphs and proposing some techniques to guide the search in lpg using this representation the experimental results of the 3rd ipc as well as further results presented in this paper show that our techniques  can be very effective often lpg outperforms all other fullyautomated  planners of the 3rd ipc in terms of speed to derive a solution or  quality of the solutions that can be produced



j  hoffmann 2003 the metricff planning system translating ignoring delete lists to numeric state variables volume 20 pages 291341

planning with numeric state variables has been a challenge for many years and was a part of the 3rd international planning competition ipc3 currently one of the most popular and successful algorithmic techniques in strips planning is to guide search by a heuristic function where the heuristic is based on relaxing the planning task by ignoring the delete lists of the available actions     we present a natural extension of ignoring delete lists to numeric state variables preserving the relevant theoretical properties of the strips relaxation under the condition that the numeric task at hand is monotonic we then identify a subset of the numeric ipc3 competition language linear tasks where monotonicity can be achieved by preprocessing based on that we extend the algorithms used in the heuristic planning system ff to linear tasks the resulting system metricff is according to the ipc3 results which we discuss one of the two currently most efficient numeric planners



j  kvarnstr246m and  m  magnusson 2003 talplanner in ipc2002  extensions and control rules volume 20 pages 343377

talplanner is a forwardchaining planner that relies on domain knowledge in the shape of temporal logic formulas in order to prune irrelevant parts of the search space talplanner recently participated in the third international planning competition which had a clear emphasis on increasing the complexity of the problem domains being used as benchmark tests and the expressivity required to represent these domains in a planning system  like many other planners talplanner had support for some but not all aspects of this increase in expressivity and a number of changes to the planner were required after a short introduction to talplanner this article describes some of the changes that were made before and during the competition  we also describe the process of introducing suitable domain knowledge for several of the competition domains

h  ls younes and  r  g simmons 2003 vhpop versatile heuristic partial order planner volume 20 pages 405430

vhpop is a partial order causal link pocl planner loosely based on ucpop  it draws from the experience gained in the early to mid 1990s on flaw selection strategies for pocl planning and combines this with more recent developments in the field of domain independent planning such as distance based heuristics and reachability analysis  we present an adaptation of the additive heuristic for plan space planning and modify it to account for possible reuse of existing actions in a plan  we also propose a large set of novel flaw selection strategies and show how these can help us solve more problems than previously possible by pocl planners  vhpop also supports planning with durative actions by incorporating standard techniques for temporal constraint reasoning  we demonstrate that the same heuristic techniques used to boost the performance of classical pocl planning can be effective in domains with durative actions as well  the result is a versatile heuristic pocl planner competitive with established cspbased and heuristic state space planners
