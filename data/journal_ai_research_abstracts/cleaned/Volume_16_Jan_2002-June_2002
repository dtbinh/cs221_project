f  baader  c  lutz  h  sturm and  f  wolter 2002 fusions of description logics and abstract description systems volume 16 pages 158

fusions are a simple way of combining logics for normal    modal logics fusions have been investigated in detail in particular    it is known that under certain conditions decidability transfers    from the component logics to their fusion  though description logics    are closely related to modal logics they are not necessarily    normal in addition abox reasoning in description logics is not    covered by the results from modal logics           in this paper we extend the decidability transfer results from normal    modal logics to a large class of description logics to cover    different description logics in a uniform way we introduce abstract    description systems which can be seen as a common generalization of    description and modal logics and show the transfer results in this    general setting



c  drummond 2002 accelerating reinforcement learning by composing solutions of automatically identified subtasks volume 16 pages 59104

this paper discusses a system that accelerates reinforcement    learning by using transfer from related tasks  without such    transfer even if two tasks are very similar at some abstract level    an extensive relearning effort is required  the system achieves    much of its power by transferring parts of previously learned    solutions rather than a single complete solution the system    exploits strong features in the multidimensional function produced    by reinforcement learning in solving a particular task these    features are stable and easy to recognize early in the learning    process they generate a partitioning of the state space and thus    the function  the partition is represented as a graph  this is    used to index and compose functions stored in a case base to form a    close approximation to the solution of the new task  experiments    demonstrate that function composition often produces more than an    order of magnitude increase in learning rate compared to a basic    reinforcement learning algorithm



s  singh  d  litman  m  kearns and  m  walker 2002 optimizing dialogue management with reinforcement learning experiments with the njfun system volume 16 pages 105133

designing the dialogue policy of a spoken dialogue system    involves many nontrivial choices  this paper presents a reinforcement    learning approach for automatically optimizing a dialogue policy    which addresses the technical challenges in applying reinforcement    learning to a working dialogue system with human users  we report on    the design construction and empirical evaluation of njfun an    experimental spoken dialogue system that provides users with access to    information about fun things to do in new jersey  our results show    that by optimizing its performance via reinforcement learning njfun    measurably improves system performance
inductive logic programming or relational learning is a    powerful paradigm for machine learning or data mining  however in    order for ilp to become practically useful the efficiency of ilp    systems must improve substantially to this end the notion of a query    pack is introduced it structures sets of similar    queries furthermore a mechanism is described for executing such    query packs  a complexity analysis shows that considerable efficiency    improvements can be achieved through the use of this query pack    execution mechanism this claim is supported by empirical results    obtained by incorporating support for query pack execution in two    existing learning systems



h  shatkay and  l  p kaelbling 2002 learning geometricallyconstrained hidden markov models for robot navigation bridging the topologicalgeometrical gap volume 16 pages 167207

hidden markov models hmms and partially observable markov    decision processes pomdps provide useful tools for modeling    dynamical systems  they are particularly useful for representing the    topology of environments such as road networks and office buildings    which are typical for robot navigation and planning  the work    presented here describes a formal framework for incorporating readily    available odometric information and geometrical constraints into both    the models and the algorithm that learns them  by taking advantage of    such information learning hmmspomdps can be made to generate better    solutions and require fewer iterations while being robust in the face    of data reduction  experimental results obtained from both simulated    and real robot data demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach



e  di sciascio  f  m donini and  m  mongiello 2002 structured knowledge representation for image retrieval volume 16 pages 209257

we propose a structured approach to the problem of retrieval    of images by content and present a description logic that has been    devised for the semantic indexing and retrieval of images containing    complex objects        as other approaches do we start from lowlevel features extracted    with image analysis to detect and characterize regions in an    image however in contrast with featurebased approaches we provide    a syntax to describe segmented regions as basic objects and complex    objects as compositions of basic ones then we introduce a companion    extensional semantics for defining reasoning services such as    retrieval classification and subsumption  these services can be    used for both exact and approximate matching using similarity    measures           using our logical approach as a formal specification we implemented a    complete clientserver image retrieval system which allows a user to    pose both queries by sketch and queries by example a set of    experiments has been carried out on a testbed of images to assess the    retrieval capabilities of the system in comparison with expert users    ranking results are presented adopting a wellestablished measure of    quality borrowed from textual information retrieval



x  xu  h  he and  d  hu 2002 efficient reinforcement learning using recursive leastsquares methods volume 16 pages 259292

the recursive leastsquares rls algorithm is one of the    most wellknown algorithms used in adaptive filtering system    identification and adaptive control its popularity is mainly due to    its fast convergence speed which is considered to be optimal in    practice in this paper rls methods are used to solve reinforcement    learning problems where two new reinforcement learning algorithms    using linear value function approximators are proposed and    analyzed the two algorithms are called rlstdlambda and fastahc    fast adaptive heuristic critic respectively rlstdlambda can be    viewed as the extension of rlstd0 from lambda0 to general lambda    within interval 01 so it is a multistep temporaldifference td    learning algorithm using rls methods the convergence with probability    one and the limit of convergence of rlstdlambda are proved for    ergodic markov chains compared to the existing lstdlambda    algorithm rlstdlambda has advantages in computation and is more    suitable for online learning the effectiveness of rlstdlambda is    analyzed and verified by learning prediction experiments of markov    chains with a wide range of parameter settings        the fastahc algorithm is derived by applying the proposed    rlstdlambda algorithm in the critic network of the adaptive    heuristic critic method unlike conventional ahc algorithm fastahc    makes use of rls methods to improve the learningprediction efficiency    in the critic learning control experiments of the cartpole balancing    and the acrobot swingup problems are conducted to compare the data    efficiency of fastahc with conventional ahc from the experimental    results it is shown that the data efficiency of learning control can    also be improved by using rls methods in the learningprediction    process of the critic the performance of fastahc is also compared    with that of the ahc method using lstdlambda furthermore it is    demonstrated in the experiments that different initial values of the    variance matrix in rlstdlambda are required to get better    performance not only in learning prediction but also in learning    control the experimental results are analyzed based on the existing    theoretical work on the transient phase of forgetting factor rls    methods

spoken dialogue systems promise efficient and natural access    to a large variety of information sources and services from any phone    however current spoken dialogue systems are deficient in their    strategies for preventing identifying and repairing problems that    arise in the conversation this paper reports results on automatically    training a problematic dialogue predictor to predict problematic    humancomputer dialogues using a corpus of 4692 dialogues collected    with the how may i help you sm spoken dialogue system  the    problematic dialogue predictor can be immediately applied to the    systems decision of whether to transfer the call to a human customer    care agent or be used as a cue to the systems dialogue manager to    modify its behavior to repair problems and even perhaps to prevent    them we show that a problematic dialogue predictor using    automaticallyobtainable features from the first two exchanges in the    dialogue can predict problematic dialogues 132 more accurately than    the baseline



n  v chawla  k  w bowyer  l  o hall and  w  p kegelmeyer 2002 smote synthetic minority oversampling technique volume 16 pages 321357

an approach to the construction of classifiers from    imbalanced datasets is described a dataset is imbalanced if the    classification categories are not approximately equally    represented often realworld data sets are predominately composed of    normal examples with only a small percentage of abnormal or    interesting examples it is also the case that the cost of    misclassifying an abnormal interesting example as a normal example    is often much higher than the cost of the reverse    error undersampling of the majority normal class has been proposed    as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the    minority class this paper shows that a combination of our method of    oversampling the minority abnormal class and undersampling the    majority normal class can achieve better classifier performance in    roc space than only undersampling the majority class  this paper    also shows that a combination of our method of oversampling the    minority class and undersampling the majority class can achieve    better classifier performance in roc space than varying the loss    ratios in ripper or class priors in naive bayes our method of    oversampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority    class examples  experiments are performed using c45 ripper and a    naive bayes classifier the method is evaluated using the area under    the receiver operating characteristic curve auc and the roc convex    hull strategy



d  h wolpert and  k  tumer 2002 collective intelligence data routing and braess paradox volume 16 pages 359387

we consider the problem of designing the the utility    functions of the utilitymaximizing agents in a multiagent system so    that they work synergistically to maximize a global utility the    particular problem domain we explore is the control of network routing    by placing agents on all the routers in the network  conventional    approaches to this task have the agents all use the ideal shortest    path routing algorithm ispa  we demonstrate that in many cases due    to the sideeffects of one agents actions on another agents    performance having agents use ispas is suboptimal as far as global    aggregate cost is concerned even when they are only used to route    infinitesimally small amounts of traffic  the utility functions of    the individual agents are not aligned with the global utility    intuitively speaking  as a particular example of this we present an    instance of braess paradox in which adding new links to a network    whose agents all use the ispa results in a decrease in overall    throughput we also demonstrate that loadbalancing in which the    agents decisions are collectively made to optimize the global cost    incurred by all traffic currently being routed is suboptimal as far    as global cost averaged across time is concerned this is also due to    sideeffects in this case of current routing decision on future    traffic the mathematics of collective intelligence coin is    concerned precisely with the issue of avoiding such deleterious    sideeffects in multiagent systems both over time and space we    present key concepts from that mathematics and use them to derive an    algorithm whose ideal version should have better performance than that    of having all agents use the ispa even in the infinitesimal limit we    present experiments verifying this and also showing that a    machinelearningbased version of this coin algorithm in which costs    are only imprecisely estimated via empirical means a version    potentially applicable in the real world also outperforms the ispa    despite having access to less information than does the ispa in    particular this coin algorithm almost always avoids braess paradox



d  v pynadath and  m  tambe 2002 the communicative multiagent team decision problem analyzing teamwork theories and models volume 16 pages 389423

despite the significant progress in multiagent teamwork    existing research does not address the optimality of its prescriptions    nor the complexity of the teamwork problem  without a    characterization of the optimalitycomplexity tradeoffs it is    impossible to determine whether the assumptions and approximations    made by a particular theory gain enough efficiency to justify the    losses in overall performance  to provide a tool for use by    multiagent researchers in evaluating this tradeoff we present a    unified framework the communicative multiagent team decision problem    commtdp  the commtdp model combines and extends existing    multiagent theories such as decentralized partially observable markov    decision processes and economic team theory  in addition to their    generality of representation commtdps also support the analysis of    both the optimality of team performance and the computational    complexity of the agents decision problem  in analyzing complexity    we present a breakdown of the computational complexity of constructing    optimal teams under various classes of problem domains along the    dimensions of observability and communication cost  in analyzing    optimality we exploit the commtdps ability to encode existing    teamwork theories and models to encode two instantiations of joint    intentions theory taken from the literature  furthermore the    commtdp model provides a basis for the development of novel team    coordination algorithms  we derive a domainindependent criterion for    optimal communication and provide a comparative analysis of the two    joint intentions instantiations with respect to this optimal policy    we have implemented a reusable domainindependent software package    based on commtdps to analyze teamwork coordination strategies and we    demonstrate its use by encoding and evaluating the two joint    intentions strategies within an example domain



j  f baget and  m  l mugnier 2002 extensions of simple conceptual graphs the complexity of rules and constraints volume 16 pages 425465

simple conceptual graphs are considered as the kernel of    most knowledge representation formalisms built upon sowas    model reasoning in this model can be expressed by a graph    homomorphism called projection whose semantics is usually given in    terms of positive conjunctive existential fol  we present here a    family of extensions of this model based on rules and constraints    keeping graph homomorphism as the basic operation we focus on the    formal definitions of the different models obtained including their    operational semantics and relationships with fol and we analyze the    decidability and complexity of the associated problems consistency    and deduction as soon as rules are involved in reasonings these    problems are not decidable but we exhibit a condition under which    they fall in the polynomial hierarchy  these results extend and    complete the ones already published by the authors  moreover we    systematically study the complexity of some particular cases obtained    by restricting the form of constraints andor rules
