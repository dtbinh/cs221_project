pannaga  shivaswamy and thorsten  joachims 2015 coactive learning volume 53 pages 140

we propose coactive learning as a model of interaction between a learning system and a human user where both have the common goal of providing results of maximum utility to the user interactions in the coactive learning model take the following form at each step the system eg search engine receives a context eg query and predicts an object eg ranking the user responds by correcting the system if necessary providing a slightly improved but not necessarily optimal object as feedback we argue that such preference feedback can be inferred in large quantity from observable user behavior eg clicks in web search unlike the optimal feedback required in the expert model or the cardinal valuations required for bandit learning despite the relaxed requirements for the feedback we show that it is possible to adapt many existing online learning algorithms to the coactive framework in particular we provide algorithms that achieve square root regret in terms of cardinal utility even though the learning algorithm never observes cardinal utility values directly we also provide an algorithm with logarithmic regret in the case of strongly convex loss functions an extensive empirical study demonstrates the applicability of our model and algorithms on a movie recommendation task as well as ranking for web search



krishna  s r dubba anthony  g cohn david  c hogg mehul   bhatt and frank  dylla 2015 learning relational event models from video volume 53 pages 4190

event models obtained automatically from video can be used in applications ranging from abnormal event detection to content based video retrieval when multiple agents are involved in the events characterizing events naturally suggests encoding interactions as relations learning event models from this kind of relational spatiotemporal data using relational learning techniques such as inductive logic programming ilp hold promise but have not been successfully applied to very large datasets which result from video data in this paper we present a novel framework remind relational event model induction for supervised relational learning of event models from large video datasets using ilp efficiency is achieved through the learning from interpretations setting and using a typing system that exploits the type hierarchy of objects in a domain the use of types also helps prevent over generalization furthermore we also present a typerefining operator and prove that it is optimal the learned models can be used for recognizing events from previously unseen videos we also present an extension to the framework by integrating an abduction step that improves the learning performance when there is noise in the input data the experimental results on several hours of video data from two challenging real world domains an airport domain and a physical action verbs domain suggest that the techniques are suitable to real world scenarios



davide  grossi emiliano  lorini and francois  schwarzentruber 2015 the ceteris paribus structure of logics of game forms volume 53 pages 91126

the article introduces a ceteris paribus modal logic called cp interpreted on the equivalence classes induced by finite sets of propositional atoms this logic is studied and then used to embed three logics of strategic interaction namely atemporal stit the coalition logic of propositional control cl8722pc and the starless fragment of the dynamic logic of propositional assignments dl8722pa the embeddings highlight a common ceteris paribus structure underpinning the key operators of all these apparently very different logics and show we argue remarkable similarities behind some of the most influential formalisms for reasoning about strategic interaction



marijn  heule matti  j228rvisalo florian  lonsing martina  seidl and armin  biere 2015 clause elimination for sat and qsat volume 53 pages 127168

the famous archetypical npcomplete problem of boolean satisfiability sat and its pspacecomplete generalization of quantified boolean satisfiability qsat have become central declarative programming paradigms through which realworld instances of various computationally hard problems can be efficiently solved this success has been achieved through several breakthroughs in practical implementations of decision procedures for sat and qsat that is in sat and qsat solvers here simplification techniques for conjunctive normal form cnf for sat and for prenex conjunctive normal form pcnf for qsatthe standard input formats of sat and qsat solvershave recently proven very effective in increasing solver efficiency when applied before ie in preprocessing or during ie in inprocessing satisfiability search
in this article we develop and analyze clause elimination procedures for pre and inprocessing clause elimination procedures form a family of pcnf formula simplification techniques which remove clauses that have specific in practice polynomialtime redundancy properties while maintaining the satisfiability status of the formulas extending known procedures such as tautology subsumption and blocked clause elimination we introduce novel elimination procedures based on asymmetric variants of these techniques and also develop a novel family of socalled covered clause elimination procedures as well as natural liftings of the cnflevel procedures to pcnf we analyze the considered clause elimination procedures from various perspectives furthermore for the variants not preserving logical equivalence under clause elimination we show how to reconstruct solutions to original cnfs from satisfying assignments to simplified cnfs which is important for practical applications for the procedures complementing the more theoretical analysis we present results on an empirical evaluation on the practical importance of the clause elimination procedures in terms of the effect on solver runtimes on standard realworld application benchmarks it turns out that the importance of applying the clause elimination procedures developed in this work is empirically emphasized in the context of stateoftheart qsat solving



miquel  espl224gomis felipe  s225nchezmart237nez and mikel  l forcada 2015 using machine translation to provide targetlanguage edit hints in computer aided translation based on translation memories volume 53 pages 169222

this paper explores the use of generalpurpose machine translation mt in assisting the users of computeraided translation cat systems based on translation memory tm to identify the target words in the translation proposals that need to be changed either replaced or removed or kept unedited a task we term as wordkeeping recommendation mt is used as a black box to align source and target subsegments on the fly in the translation units tus suggested to the user sourcelanguage sl and targetlanguage tl segments in the matching tus are segmented into overlapping subsegments of variable length and machinetranslated into the tl and the sl respectively the bilingual subsegments obtained and the matching between the sl segment in the tu and the segment to be translated are employed to build the features that are then used by a binary classifier to determine the target words to be changed and those to be kept unedited in this approach mt results are never presented to the translator two approaches are presented in this work one using a wordkeeping recommendation system which can be trained on the tm used with the cat system and a more basic approach which does not require any training
experiments are conducted by simulating the translation of texts in several language pairs with corpora belonging to different domains and using three different mt systems we compare the performance obtained to that of previous works that have used statistical word alignment for wordkeeping recommendation and show that the mtbased approaches presented in this paper are more accurate in most scenarios in particular our results confirm that the mtbased approaches are better than the alignmentbased approach when using models trained on outofdomain tms additional experiments were performed to check how dependent the mtbased recommender is on the language pair and mt system used for training these experiments confirm a high degree of reusability of the recommendation models across various mt systems but a low level of reusability across language pairs

decentralized pomdps provide an expressive framework for multiagent sequential decision making however the complexity of these modelsnexpcomplete even for two agentshas limited their scalability we present a promising new class of approximation algorithms by developing novel connections between multiagent planning and machine learning we show how the multiagent planning problem can be reformulated as inference in a mixture of dynamic bayesian networks dbns this planningasinference approach paves the way for the application of efficient inference techniques in dbns to multiagent decision making to further improve scalability we identify certain conditions that are sufficient to extend the approach to multiagent systems with dozens of agents specifically we show that the necessary inference within the expectationmaximization framework can be decomposed into processes that often involve a small subset of agents thereby facilitating scalability we further show that a number of existing multiagent planning models satisfy these conditions experiments on large planning benchmarks confirm the benefits of our approach in terms of runtime and scalability with respect to existing techniques

meghyn  bienvenu magdalena  ortiz and mantas  simkus 2015 regular path queries in lightweight description logics complexity and algorithms volume 53 pages 315374

conjunctive regular path queries are an expressive extension of the wellknown class of conjunctive queries such queries have been extensively studied in the graph database community since they support a controlled form of recursion and enable sophisticated path navigation somewhat surprisingly there has been little work aimed at using such queries in the context of description logic dl knowledge bases particularly for the lightweight dls that are considered best suited for dataintensive applications this paper aims to bridge this gap by providing algorithms and tight complexity bounds for answering twoway conjunctive regular path queries over dl knowledge bases formulated in lightweight dls of the dllite and el families our results demonstrate that in data complexity the cost of moving to this richer query language is as low as one could wish for the problem is nlcomplete for dllite and pcomplete for el the combined complexity of query answering increases from np to pspacecomplete but for twoway regular path queries without conjunction we show that query answering is tractable even with respect to combined complexity our results reveal twoway conjunctive regular path queries as a promising language for querying data enriched by ontologies formulated in dls of the dllite and el families or the corresponding owl 2 ql and el profiles



timothy  a mann shie  mannor and doina  precup 2015 approximate value iteration with temporally extended actions volume 53 pages 375438

temporally extended actions have proven useful for reinforcement learning but their duration also makes them valuable for efficient planning the options framework provides a concrete way to implement and reason about temporally extended actions existing literature has demonstrated the value of planning with options empirically but there is a lack of theoretical analysis formalizing when planning with options is more efficient than planning with primitive actions we provide a general analysis of the convergence rate of a popular approximate value iteration avi algorithm called fitted value iteration fvi with options our analysis reveals that longer duration options and a pessimistic estimate of the value function both lead to faster convergence furthermore options can improve convergence even when they are suboptimal and sparsely distributed throughout the statespace next we consider the problem of generating useful options for planning based on a subset of landmark states this suggests a new algorithm landmarkbased avi lavi that represents the value function only at the landmark states we analyze both fvi and lavi using the proposed landmarkbased options and compare the two algorithms our experimental results in three different domains demonstrate the key properties from the analysis our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that options can play an important role in avi by decreasing approximation error and inducing fast convergence

matthew  l ginsberg 2015 satsisfiability and systematicity volume 53 pages 497540

we introduce a new notion of systematicity for satisfiability algorithms with restarts saying that an algorithm is strongly systematic if it is systematic independent of restart policy but weakly systematic if it is systematic for some restart policies but not others  we show that existing satisfiability engines are generally only weakly systematic and describe flex a strongly systematic algorithm that uses an amount of memory polynomial in the size of the problem  on large number factoring problems flex appears to outperform weakly systematic approaches




masood  feyzbakhsh rankooh and gholamreza  ghassemsani 2015 itsat an efficient satbased temporal planner volume 53 pages 541632

planning as satisfiability is known as an efficient approach to deal with many types of planning problems however this approach has not been competitive with the statespace based methods in temporal planning this paper describes itsat as an efficient satbased satisfiability based temporal planner capable of temporally expressive planning the novelty of itsat lies in the way it handles temporal constraints of given problems without getting involved in the difficulties of introducing continuous variables into the corresponding satisfiability problems we also show how as in satbased classical planning carefully devised preprocessing and encoding schemata can considerably improve the efficiency of satbased temporal planning we present two preprocessing methods for mutex relation extraction and action compression we also show that the separation of causal and temporal reasoning enables us to employ compact encodings that are based on the concept of parallel execution semantics although such encodings have been shown to be quite effective in classical planning itsat is the first temporal planner utilizing this type of encoding our empirical results show that not only does itsat outperform the stateoftheart temporally expressive planners it is also competitive with the fast temporal planners that cannot handle required concurrency

compared to conventional cars electric vehicles evs still suffer from considerably shorter cruising ranges combined with the sparsity of battery loading stations the complete transition to emobility still seems a long way to go in this paper we consider the problem of placing as few loading stations as possible so that on any shortest path there are sufficiently many not to run out of energy we show how to model this problem and introduce heuristics which provide closetooptimal solutions even in large road networks



daan  bloembergen karl  tuyls daniel  hennes and michael  kaisers 2015 evolutionary dynamics of multiagent learning a survey volume 53 pages 659697

the interaction of multiple autonomous agents gives rise to highly dynamic and nondeterministic environments contributing to the complexity in applications such as automated financial markets smart grids or robotics due to the sheer number of situations that may arise it is not possible to foresee and program the optimal behaviour for all agents beforehand consequently it becomes essential for the success of the system that the agents can learn their optimal behaviour and adapt to new situations or circumstances the past two decades have seen the emergence of reinforcement learning both in single and multiagent settings as a strong robust and adaptive learning paradigm progress has been substantial and a wide range of algorithms are now available an important challenge in the domain of multiagent learning is to gain qualitative insights into the resulting system dynamics in the past decade tools and methods from evolutionary game theory have been successfully employed to study multiagent learning dynamics formally in strategic interactions this article surveys the dynamical models that have been derived for various multiagent reinforcement learning algorithms making it possible to study and compare them qualitatively furthermore new learning algorithms that have been introduced using these evolutionary game theoretic tools are reviewed the evolutionary models can be used to study complex strategic interactions examples of such analysis are given for the domains of automated trading in stock markets and collision avoidance in multirobot systems the paper provides a roadmap on the progress that has been achieved in analysing the evolutionary dynamics of multiagent learning by highlighting the main results and accomplishments



johan  kwisthout 2015 treewidth and the computational complexity of map approximations in bayesian networks volume 53 pages 699720

the problem of finding the most probable explanation to a designated set of variables given partial evidence the map problem is a notoriously intractable problem in bayesian networks both to compute exactly and to approximate it is known both from theoretical considerations and from practical experience that low treewidth is typically an essential prerequisite to efficient exact computations in bayesian networks in this paper we investigate whether the same holds for approximating map we define four notions of approximating map by value structure rank and expectation and argue that all of them are intractable in general we prove that efficient valueapproximations structureapproximations and rankapproximations of map instances with high treewidth will violate the exponential time hypothesis in contrast we show that map can sometimes be efficiently expectationapproximated even in instances with high treewidth if the most probable explanation has a high probability we introduce the complexity class fert analogous to the class ftp to capture this notion of fixedparameter expectationapproximability we suggest a roadmap to future research that yields fixedparameter tractable results for expectationapproximate map even in graphs with high treewidth



piotr  krysta orestis  telelis and carmine  ventre 2015 mechanisms for multiunit combinatorial auctions with a few distinct goods volume 53 pages 721744

we design and analyze deterministic truthful approximation mechanisms for multiunit combinatorial auctions involving only a constant number of distinct goods each in arbitrary limited supply prospective buyers bidders have preferences over multisets of items ie for more than one unit per distinct good our objective is to determine allocations of multisets that maximize the social welfare our main results are for multiminded and submodular bidders in the first setting each bidder has a positive value for being allocated one multiset from a prespecified demand set of alternatives in the second setting each bidder is associated to a submodular valuation function that defines his value for the multiset he is allocated for multiminded bidders we design a truthful fptas that fully optimizes the social welfare while violating the supply constraints on goods within factor 1e for any fixed e0 ie the approximation applies to the constraints and not to the social welfare this result is best possible in that full optimization is impossible without violating the supply constraints for submodular bidders we obtain a ptas that approximates the optimum social welfare within factor 1e for any fixed e0 without violating the supply constraints this result is best possible as well our allocation algorithms are maximalinrange and yield truthful mechanisms when paired with vickreyclarkegroves payments




marius  lindauer holger  h hoos frank  hutter and torsten  schaub 2015 autofolio an automatically configured algorithm selector volume 53 pages 745778

algorithm selection as techniques  which involve choosing from a set of algorithms the one expected to solve a given problem instance most efficiently  have substantially improved the state of the art in solving many prominent ai problems such as sat csp asp maxsat and qbf although several as procedures have been introduced not too surprisingly none of them dominates all others across all as scenarios furthermore these procedures have parameters whose optimal values vary across as scenarios this holds specifically for the machine learning techniques that form the core of current as procedures and for their hyperparameters therefore to successfully apply as to new problems algorithms and benchmark sets two questions need to be answered i how to select an as approach and ii how to set its parameters effectively we address both of these problems simultaneously by using automated algorithm configuration specifically we demonstrate that we can automatically configure claspfolio 2 which implements a large variety of different as approaches and their respective parameters in a single highlyparameterized algorithm framework our approach dubbed autofolio allows researchers and practitioners across a broad range of applications to exploit the combined power of many different as methods we demonstrate autofolio can significantly improve the performance of claspfolio 2 on 8 out of the 13 scenarios from the algorithm selection library leads to new stateoftheart algorithm selectors for 7 of these scenarios and matches stateoftheart performance statistically on all other scenarios compared to the best single algorithm for each as scenario autofolio achieves average speedup factors between 13 and 154



aaron  hunter and james  delgrande 2015 belief change with uncertain action histories volume 53 pages 779824

we consider the iterated belief change that occurs following an alternating sequence of actions and observations  at each instant an agent has beliefs about the actions that have occurred as well as beliefs about the resulting state of the world  we represent such problems by a sequence of ranking functions so an agent assigns a quantitative plausibility value to every action and every state at each point in time  the resulting formalism is able to represent fallible belief erroneous perception exogenous actions and failed actions  we illustrate that our framework is a generalization of several existing approaches to belief change and it appropriately captures the nonelementary interaction between belief update and belief revision
