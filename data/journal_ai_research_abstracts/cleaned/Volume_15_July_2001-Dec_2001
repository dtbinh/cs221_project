j  hong 2001 goal recognition through goal graph analysis volume 15 pages 130

we present a novel approach to goal recognition based on a    twostage paradigm of graph construction and analysis first a graph    structure called a goal graph is constructed to represent the observed    actions the state of the world and the achieved goals as well as    various connections between these nodes at consecutive time    steps then the goal graph is analysed at each time step to recognise    those partially or fully achieved goals that are consistent with the    actions observed so far the goal graph analysis also reveals valid    plans for the recognised goals or part of these goals        our approach to goal recognition does not need a plan library  it    does not suffer from the problems in the acquisition and handcoding    of large plan libraries neither does it have the problems in    searching the plan space of exponential size we describe two    algorithms for goal graph construction and analysis in this    paradigm these algorithms are both provably sound polynomialtime    and polynomialspace the number of goals recognised by our algorithms    is usually very small after a sequence of observed actions has been    processed thus the sequence of observed actions is well explained by    the recognised goals with little ambiguity we have evaluated these    algorithms in the unix domain in which excellent performance has been    achieved in terms of accuracy efficiency and scalability



j  m siskind 2001 grounding the lexical semantics of verbs in visual perception using force dynamics and event logic volume 15 pages 3190

this paper presents an implemented system for recognizing    the occurrence of events described by simple spatialmotion verbs in    short image sequences the semantics of these verbs is specified with    eventlogic expressions that describe changes in the state of    forcedynamic relations between the participants of the event  an    efficient finite representation is introduced for the infinite sets of    intervals that occur when describing liquid and semiliquid events    additionally an efficient procedure using this representation is    presented for inferring occurrences of compound events described with    eventlogic expressions from occurrences of primitive events  using    force dynamics and event logic to specify the lexical semantics of    events allows the system to be more robust than prior systems based on    motion profile



c  bhattacharyya and  s  s keerthi 2001 mean field methods for a special class of belief networks volume 15 pages 91114

the chief aim of this paper is to propose meanfield    approximations for a broad class of belief networks of which sigmoid    and noisyor networks can be seen as special cases  the     approximations are based on a powerful meanfield theory suggested by    plefka  we show that saul jaakkola and jordan s approach is the    first order approximation in plefkas approach via a variational    derivation  the application of plefkas theory to belief networks is    not computationally tractable  to tackle this problem we propose new    approximations based on taylor series  small scale experiments show    that the proposed schemes are attractive



i  refanidis and  i  vlahavas 2001 the grt planning system backward heuristic construction in forward statespace planning volume 15 pages 115161

this paper presents grt a domainindependent heuristic    planning system for strips worlds grt solves problems in two    phases in the preprocessing phase it estimates the distance between    each fact and the goals of the problem in a backward direction then    in the search phase these estimates are used in order to further    estimate the distance between each intermediate state and the goals    guiding so the search process in a forward direction and on a    bestfirst basis the paper presents the benefits from the adoption of    opposite directions between the preprocessing and the search phases    discusses some difficulties that arise in the preprocessing phase and    introduces techniques to cope with them moreover it presents several    methods of improving the efficiency of the heuristic by enriching the    representation and by reducing the size of the problem finally a    method of overcoming local optimal states based on domain axioms is    proposed according to it difficult problems are decomposed into    easier subproblems that have to be solved sequentially the    performance results from various domains including those of the    recent planning competitions show that grt is among the fastest    planners



t  elomaa and  m  kaariainen 2001 an analysis of reduced error pruning volume 15 pages 163187

topdown induction of decision trees has been observed to    suffer from the inadequate functioning of the pruning phase  in    particular it is known that the size of the resulting tree grows    linearly with the sample size even though the accuracy of the tree    does not improve  reduced error pruning is an algorithm that has been    used as a representative technique in attempts to explain the problems    of decision tree learning      in this paper we present analyses of reduced error pruning in three    different settings  first we study the basic algorithmic properties    of the method properties that hold independent of the input decision    tree and pruning examples  then we examine a situation that    intuitively should lead to the subtree under consideration to be    replaced by a leaf node one in which the class label and attribute    values of the pruning examples are independent of each other  this    analysis is conducted under two different assumptions  the general    analysis shows that the pruning probability of a node fitting pure    noise is bounded by a function that decreases exponentially as the    size of the tree grows  in a specific analysis we assume that the    examples are distributed uniformly to the tree  this assumption lets    us approximate the number of subtrees that are pruned because they do    not receive any pruning examples      this paper clarifies the different variants of the reduced error    pruning algorithm brings new insight to its algorithmic properties    analyses the algorithm with less imposed assumptions than before and    includes the previously overlooked empty subtrees to the analysis

j  l ambite and  c  a knoblock 2001 planning by rewriting volume 15 pages 207261

domainindependent planning is a hard combinatorial    problem taking into account plan quality makes the task even more    difficult this article introduces planning by rewriting pbr a new    paradigm for efficient highquality domainindependent planning pbr    exploits declarative planrewriting rules and efficient local search    techniques to transform an easytogenerate but possibly suboptimal    initial plan into a highquality plan in addition to addressing the    issues of planning efficiency and plan quality this framework offers    a new anytime planning algorithm we have implemented this planner and    applied it to several existing domains the experimental results show    that the pbr approach provides significant savings in planning effort    while generating highquality plans



m  palomar and  p  martinezbarco 2001 computational approach to anaphora resolution in spanish dialogues volume 15 pages 263287

this paper presents an algorithm for identifying nounphrase    antecedents of pronouns and adjectival anaphors in spanish    dialogues we believe that anaphora resolution requires numerous    sources of information in order to find the correct antecedent of the    anaphor these sources can be of different kinds eg linguistic    information discoursedialogue structure information or topic    information for this reason our algorithm uses various different    kinds of information hybrid information the algorithm is based on    linguistic constraints and preferences and uses an anaphoric    accessibility space within which the algorithm finds the noun    phrase we present some experiments related to this algorithm and this    space using a corpus of 204 dialogues the algorithm is implemented in    prolog according to this study 959 of antecedents were located in    the proposed space a precision of 813 was obtained for pronominal    anaphora resolution and 815 for adjectival anaphora



j  renz and  b  nebel 2001 efficient methods for qualitative spatial reasoning volume 15 pages 289318

the theoretical properties of qualitative spatial reasoning    in the rcc8 framework have been analyzed extensively however no    empirical investigation has been made yet our experiments show that    the adaption of the algorithms used for qualitative temporal reasoning    can solve large rcc8 instances even if they are in the phase    transition region  provided that one uses the maximal tractable    subsets of rcc8 that have been identified by us in particular we    demonstrate that the orthogonal combination of heuristic methods is    successful in solving almost all apparently hard instances in the    phase transition region up to a certain size in reasonable time



j  baxter and  p  l bartlett 2001 infinitehorizon policygradient estimation volume 15 pages 319350

gradientbased approaches to direct policy search in    reinforcement learning have received much recent attention as a means    to solve problems of partial observability and to avoid some of the    problems associated with policy degradation in valuefunction methods    in this paper we introduce gpomdp a simulationbased algorithm for    generating a biased estimate of the gradient of the average reward in    partially observable markov decision processes pomdps controlled by    parameterized stochastic policies a similar algorithm was proposed by    kimura et al 1995 the algorithms chief advantages are that it    requires storage of only twice the number of policy parameters uses    one free beta which has a natural interpretation in terms of    biasvariance tradeoff and requires no knowledge of the underlying    state we prove convergence of gpomdp and show how the correct choice    of the parameter beta is related to the mixing time of the    controlled pomdp we briefly describe extensions of gpomdp to    controlled markov chains continuous state observation and control    spaces multipleagents higherorder derivatives and a version for    training stochastic policies with internal states  in a companion    paper baxter et al this volume we show how the gradient estimates    generated by gpomdp can be used in both a traditional stochastic    gradient algorithm and a conjugategradient procedure to find local    optima of the average reward



j  baxter  p  l bartlett and  l  weaver 2001 experiments with infinitehorizon policygradient estimation volume 15 pages 351381

in this paper we present algorithms that perform gradient    ascent of the average reward in a partially observable markov decision    process pomdp  these algorithms are based on gpomdp an algorithm    introduced in a companion paper baxter  bartlett this volume    which computes biased estimates of the performance gradient in pomdps    the algorithms chief advantages are that it uses only one free    parameter beta which has a natural interpretation in terms of    biasvariance tradeoff it requires no knowledge of the underlying    state and it can be applied to infinite state control and    observation spaces  we show how the gradient estimates produced by    gpomdp can be used to perform gradient ascent both with a traditional    stochasticgradient algorithm and with an algorithm based on    conjugategradients that utilizes gradient information to bracket    maxima in line searches experimental results are presented    illustrating both the theoretical results of baxter  bartlett this    volume on a toy problem and practical aspects of the algorithms on a    number of more realistic problems

i consider the problem of learning an optimal path graphical    model from data and show the problem to be nphard for the maximum    likelihood and minimum description length approaches and a bayesian    approach this hardness result holds despite the fact that the problem    is a restriction of the polynomially solvable problem of finding the    optimal tree graphical model



t  sato and  y  kameya 2001 parameter learning of logic programs for symbolicstatistical modeling volume 15 pages 391454

we propose a logicalmathematical framework for statistical    parameter learning of parameterized logic programs ie  definite    clause programs containing probabilistic facts with a parameterized    distribution  it extends the traditional least herbrand model    semantics in logic programming to distribution semantics possible    world semantics with a probability distribution which is    unconditionally applicable to arbitrary logic programs including ones    for hmms pcfgs and bayesian networks        we also propose a new em algorithm the graphical em algorithm that    runs for a class of parameterized logic programs representing    sequential decision processes where each decision is exclusive and    independent  it runs on a new data structure called support graphs    describing the logical relationship between observations and their    explanations and learns parameters by computing inside and outside    probability generalized for logic programs           the complexity analysis shows that when combined with oldt search for    all explanations for observations the graphical em algorithm despite    its generality has the same time complexity as existing em    algorithms ie the baumwelch algorithm for hmms the insideoutside    algorithm for pcfgs and the one for singly connected bayesian    networks that have been developed independently in each research    field  learning experiments with pcfgs using two corpora of moderate    size indicate that the graphical em algorithm can significantly    outperform the insideoutside algorithm
