s  thiebaux c  gretton j  slaney d  price and f  kabanza 2006 decisiontheoretic planning with nonmarkovian rewards volume 25 pages 1774

a decision process in which rewards depend on history rather than merely on the current state is called a decision process with nonmarkovian rewards nmrdp in decisiontheoretic planning where many desirable behaviours are more naturally expressed as properties of execution sequences rather than as properties of states nmrdps form a more natural model than the commonly adopted fully markovian decision process mdp model while the more tractable solution methods developed for mdps do not directly apply in the presence of nonmarkovian rewards a number of solution methods for nmrdps have been proposed in the literature these all exploit a compact specification of the nonmarkovian reward function in temporal logic to automatically translate the nmrdp into an equivalent mdp which is solved using efficient mdp solution methods this paper presents nmrdpp nonmarkovian reward decision process planner a software platform for the development and experimentation of methods for decisiontheoretic planning with nonmarkovian rewards the current version of nmrdpp implements under a single interface a family of methods based on existing as well as new approaches which we describe in detail these include dynamic programming heuristic search and structured methods using nmrdpp we compare the methods and identify certain problem features that affect their performance nmrdpps treatment of nonmarkovian rewards is inspired by the treatment of domainspecific search control knowledge in the tlplan planner which it incorporates as a special case in the first international probabilistic planning competition nmrdpp was able to compete and perform well in both the domainindependent and handcoded tracks using search control knowledge in the latter 




a  fern s  yoon and r  givan 2006 approximate policy iteration with a policy language bias solving relational markov decision processes volume 25 pages 75118




honorable mention for the 2011 ijcaijair best paper prize

we study an approach to policy selection for large relational markov decision processes mdps we consider a variant of approximate policy iteration api that replaces the usual valuefunction learning step with a learning step in policy space this is advantageous in domains where good policies are easier to represent and learn than the corresponding value functions which is often the case for the relational mdps we are interested in in order to apply api to such problems we introduce a relational policy language and corresponding learner in addition we introduce a new bootstrapping routine for goalbased planning domains based on random walks such bootstrapping is necessary for many large relational mdps where reward is extremely sparse as api is ineffective in such domains when initialized with an uninformed policy our experiments show that the resulting system is able to find good policies for a number of classical planning domains and their stochastic variants by solving them as extremely large relational mdps the experiments also point to some limitations of our approach suggesting future work



v  bulitko and g  lee 2006 learning in realtime search a unifying framework volume 25 pages 119157

realtime search methods are suited for tasks in which the agent is interacting with an initially unknown environment in real time in such simultaneous planning and learning problems the agent has to select its actions in a limited amount of time while sensing only a local part of the environment centered at the agents current location realtime heuristic search agents select actions using a limited lookahead search and evaluating the frontier states with a heuristic function over repeated experiences they refine heuristic values of states to avoid infinite loops and to converge to better solutions the wide spread of such settings in autonomous software and hardware agents has led to an explosion of realtime search algorithms over the last two decades not only is a potential user confronted with a hodgepodge of algorithms but he also faces the choice of control parameters they use in this paper we address both problems the first contribution is an introduction of a simple threeparameter framework named lrts which extracts the core ideas behind many existing algorithms we then prove that lrta epsilonlrta sla and gammatrap algorithms are special cases of our framework thus they are unified and extended with additional features second we prove completeness and convergence of any algorithm covered by the lrts framework third we prove several upperbounds relating the control parameters and solution quality finally we analyze the influence of the three control parameters empirically in the realistic scalable domains of realtime navigation on initially unknown maps from a commercial roleplaying game as well as routing in ad hoc sensor networks 




w  pullan and h  h hoos 2006 dynamic local search for the maximum clique problem volume 25 pages 159185

in this paper we introduce dlsmc a new stochastic local search algorithm for the maximum clique problem dlsmc alternates between phases of iterative improvement during which suitable vertices are added to the current clique and plateau search during which vertices of the current clique are swapped with vertices not contained in the current clique the selection of vertices is solely based on vertex penalties that are dynamically adjusted during the search and a perturbation mechanism is used to overcome search stagnation the behaviour of dlsmc is controlled by a single parameter penalty delay which controls the frequency at which vertex penalties are reduced we show empirically that dlsmc achieves substantial performance improvements over stateoftheart algorithms for the maximum clique problem over a large range of the commonly used dimacs benchmark instances



a  gerevini a  saetti and i  serina 2006 an approach to temporal planning and scheduling in domains with predictable exogenous events volume 25 pages 187231

the treatment of exogenous events in planning is practically important in many realworld domains where the preconditions of certain plan actions are affected by such events in this paper we focus on planning in temporal domains with exogenous events that happen at known times imposing the constraint that certain actions in the plan must be executed during some predefined time windows when actions have durations handling such temporal constraints adds an extra difficulty to planning we propose an approach to planning in these domains which integrates constraintbased temporal reasoning into a graphbased planning framework using local search our techniques are implemented in a planner that took part in the 4th international planning competition ipc4 a statistical analysis of the results of ipc4 demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both cputime and plan quality additional experiments show the good performance of the temporal reasoning techniques integrated into our planner 



p  haslum 2006 improving heuristics through relaxed search  an analysis of tp4 and hspa in the 2004 planning competition volume 25 pages 233267

the ihsupmsupi admissible heuristics for sequential and temporal regression planning are defined by a parameterized relaxation of the optimal cost function in the regression search space where the parameter imi offers a tradeoff between the accuracy and computational cost of theheuristic existing methods for computing the ihsupmsupi heuristic require time exponential in imi limiting them to small values im  2i the ihsupmsupi heuristic can also be viewed as the optimal cost function in a relaxation of the search space this paper presents emrelaxed searchem a method for computing this function partially by searching in the relaxed space the relaxed search method because it computes ihsupmsupi only partially is computationally cheaper and therefore usable for higher values of imi the complete ihsupmsupi heuristic is combined with partial ihsupmsupi heuristics for im  3i computed by relaxed search resulting in a more accurate heuristic




p  adjiman p  chatalic f  goasdoue m  c rousset and l  simon 2006 distributed reasoning in a peertopeer setting application to the semantic web volume 25 pages 269314

in a peertopeer inference system each peer can reason locally but can also solicit some of its acquaintances which are peers sharing part of its vocabulary in this paper we consider peertopeer inference systems in which the local theory of each peer is a set of propositional clauses defined upon a local vocabulary an important characteristic of peertopeer inference systems is that the global theory the union of all peer theories is not known as opposed to partitionbased reasoning systems the main contribution of this paper is to provide the first consequence finding algorithm in a peertopeer setting deca it is anytime and computes consequences gradually from the solicited peer to peers that are more and more distant we exhibit a sufficient condition on the acquaintance graph of the peertopeer inference system for guaranteeing the completeness of this algorithm another important contribution is to apply this general distributed reasoning setting to the setting of the semantic web through the somewhere semantic peertopeer data management system the last contribution of this paper is to provide an experimental analysis of the scalability of the peertopeer infrastructure that we propose on large networks of 1000 peers 



u  endriss n  maudet f  sadri and f  toni 2006 negotiating socially optimal allocations of resources volume 25 pages 315348

a multiagent system may be thought of as an artificial society of autonomous software agents and we can apply concepts borrowed from welfare economics and social choice theory to assess the social welfare of such an agent society in this paper we study an abstract negotiation framework where agents can agree on multilateral deals to exchange bundles of indivisible resources we then analyse how these deals affect social welfare for different instances of the basic framework and different interpretations of the concept of social welfare itself in particular we show how certain classes of deals are both sufficient and necessary to guarantee that a socially optimal allocation of resources will be reached eventually 



g  gutnik and g  a kaminka 2006 representing conversations for scalable overhearing volume 25 pages 349387

open distributed multiagent systems are gaining interest in the academic community and in industry in such open settings agents are often coordinated using standardized agent conversation protocols the representation of such protocols for analysis validation monitoring etc is an important aspect of multiagent applications recently petri nets have been shown to be an interesting approach to such representation and radically different approaches using petri nets have been proposed however their relative strengths and weaknesses have not been examined moreover their scalability and suitability for different tasks have not been addressed this paper addresses both these challenges first we analyze existing petri net representations in terms of their scalability and appropriateness for overhearing an important task in monitoring open multiagent systems then building on the insights gained we introduce a novel representation using colored petri nets that explicitly represent legal joint conversation states and messages this representation approach offers significant improvements in scalability and is particularly suitable for overhearing furthermore we show that this new representation offers a comprehensive coverage of all conversation features of fipa conversation standards we also present a procedure for transforming auml conversation protocol diagrams a standard humanreadable representation to our colored petri net representation 




r  i brafman c  domshlak and s  e shimony 2006 on graphical modeling of preference and importance volume 25 pages 389424

in recent years cpnets have emerged as a useful tool for supporting preference elicitation reasoning and representation cpnets capture and support reasoning with qualitative conditional preference statements statements that are relatively natural for users to express in this paper we extend the cpnets formalism to handle another class of very natural qualitative statements one often uses in expressing preferences in daily life  statements of relative importance of attributes the resulting formalism tcpnets maintains the spirit of cpnets in that it remains focused on using only simple and natural preference statements uses the ceteris paribus semantics and utilizes a graphical representation of this information to reason about its consistency and to perform possibly constrained optimization using it the extra expressiveness it provides allows us to better model tradeoffs users would like to make more faithfully representing their preferences

b  blum c  r shelton and d  koller 2006 a continuation method for nash equilibria in structured games volume 25 pages 457502

structured game representations have recently attracted interest as models for multiagent artificial intelligence scenarios with rational behavior most commonly characterized by nash equilibria  this paper presents efficient exact algorithms for computing nash equilibria in structured game representations including both graphical games and multiagent influence diagrams maids  the algorithms are derived from a continuation method for normalform and extensiveform games due to govindan and wilson they follow a trajectory through a space of perturbed games and their equilibria exploiting game structure through fast computation of the jacobian of the payoff function  they are theoretically guaranteed to find at least one equilibrium of the game and may find more  our approach provides the first efficient algorithm for computing exact equilibria in graphical games with arbitrary topology and the first algorithm to exploit finegrained structural properties of maids experimental results are presented demonstrating the  effectiveness of the algorithms and comparing them to predecessors  the running time of the graphical game algorithm is similar to and often better than the running time of previous approximate algorithms the algorithm for maids can effectively solve games that are much larger than those solvable by previous methods



a  roy 2006 fault tolerant boolean satisfiability volume 25 pages 503527

a deltamodel is a satisfying assignment of a boolean formula for which any small alteration such as a single bit flip can be repaired by flips to some small number of other bits yielding a new satisfying assignment  these satisfying assignments represent robust solutions to optimization problems eg scheduling where it is possible to recover from unforeseen events eg a resource becoming unavailable  the concept of deltamodels was introduced by ginsberg parkes and roy aaai 1998  where it was proved that finding deltamodels for general boolean formulas is npcomplete  in this paper we extend that result by studying the complexity of finding deltamodels for classes of boolean formulas which are known to have polynomial time satisfiability solvers  in particular we examine 2sat hornsat affinesat dualhornsat 0valid and 1valid sat  we see a wide variation in the complexity of finding deltamodels eg while 2sat and affinesat have polynomial time tests for deltamodels testing whether a hornsat formula has one is npcomplete



r  mailler and v  r lesser 2006 asynchronous partial overlay  a new algorithm for solving distributed constraint satisfaction problems volume 25 pages 529576

distributed constraint satisfaction dcsp has long been considered an important problem in multiagent systems research  this is because many realworld problems can be represented as constraint satisfaction and these problems often present themselves in a distributed form  in this article we present a new complete distributed algorithm called asynchronous partial overlay apo for solving dcsps that is based on a cooperative mediation process  the primary ideas behind this algorithm are that agents when acting as a mediator centralize small relevant portions of the dcsp that these centralized subproblems overlap and that agents increase the size of their subproblems along critical paths within the dcsp as the problem solving unfolds  we present empirical evidence that shows that apo outperforms other known complete dcsp techniques
