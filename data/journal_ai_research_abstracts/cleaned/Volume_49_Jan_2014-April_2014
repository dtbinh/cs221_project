e  bruni n  k  tran and m  baroni 2014 multimodal distributional semantics volume 49 pages 147

distributional semantic models derive computational representations of word meaning from the patterns of cooccurrence of words in text such models have been a success story of computational linguistics being able to provide reliable estimates of semantic relatedness for the many semantic tasks requiring them however distributional models extract meaning information exclusively from text which is an extremely impoverished basis compared to the rich perceptual sources that ground human semantic knowledge we address the lack of perceptual grounding of distributional models by exploiting computer vision techniques that automatically identify discrete visual words in images so that the distributional representation of a word can be extended to also encompass its cooccurrence with the visual words of images it is associated with we propose a flexible architecture to integrate text and imagebased distributional information and we show in a set of empirical tests that our integrated model is superior to the purely textbased approach and it provides somewhat complementary semantic information with respect to the latter



l  climent r  j wallace m  a salido and f  barber 2014 robustness and stability in constraint programming under dynamism and uncertainty volume 49 pages 4978

many real life problems that can be solved by constraint programming come from uncertain and dynamic environments because of the dynamism the original problem may change over time and thus the solution found for the original problem may become invalid for this reason dealing with such problems has become an important issue in the fields of constraint programming in some cases there exist extant knowledge about the uncertain and dynamic environment in other cases this information is fragmentary or unknown in this paper we extend the concept of robustness and stability for constraint satisfaction problems csps with ordered domains where only limited assumptions need to be made as to possible changes we present a search algorithm that searches for both robust and stable solutions for csps of this nature it is wellknown that meeting both criteria simultaneously is a desirable objective for constraint solving in uncertain and dynamic environments we also present compelling evidence that our search algorithm outperforms other generalpurpose algorithms for dynamic csps using random instances and benchmarks derived from real life problems



p  m dung and p  m thang 2014 closure and consistency  in logicassociated  argumentation volume 49 pages 79109

properties like logical closure and consistency are  important properties in any logical reasoning system caminada and amgoud showed that not every logicbased argument system satisfies these relevant properties but under  conditions like closure under contraposition or transposition of the monotonic part of the underlying logic aspiclike systems satisfy these properties in contrast the logical closure and  consistency properties are not wellunderstood for other  wellknown and widely applied systems like logic programming or assumption based argumentation though conditions like closure under contraposition or transposition seem intuitive in aspiclike systems they  rule out many sensible aspiclike systems that satisfy both properties of closure and consistency  
we present a new condition referred to as the selfcontradiction axiom that guarantees the consistency property  in both aspiclike and assumptionbased systems and is implied by both properties of closure under  contraposition or transposition we develop a logicassociated abstract argumentation framework by associating abstract argumentation with abstract logics to represent  the conclusions of arguments we show that logicassociated abstract argumentation frameworks  capture  aspiclike systems without preferences and assumptionbased argumentation we present two simple and natural properties of  compactness and cohesion in  logicassociated abstract argumentation frameworks and show that they capture  the logical closure and consistency properties we demonstrate that  in both  assumptionbased argumentation and aspiclike systems  cohesion  follows naturally from the selfcontradiction axiom we further give a translation from aspiclike systems without preferences into equivalent assumptionbased systems that keeps the selfcontradiction axiom invariant  



j  w crandall 2014 towards minimizing disappointment in repeated games volume 49 pages 111142

we consider the problem of learning in repeated games against arbitrary associates  specifically we study the ability of expert algorithms to quickly learn effective strategies in repeated games towards the ultimate goal of learning nearoptimal behavior against any arbitrary associate within only a handful of interactions  our contribution is threefold  first we advocate a new metric called disappointment for evaluating expert algorithms in repeated games  unlike minimizing traditional notions of regret minimizing disappointment in repeated games is equivalent to maximizing payoffs  unfortunately eliminating disappointment is impossible to guarantee in general  however it is possible for an expert algorithm to quickly achieve low disappointment against many known classes of algorithms in many games  second we show that popular existing expert algorithms often fail to achieve low disappointment against a variety of associates particularly in early rounds of the game  finally we describe a new metaalgorithm that can be applied to existing expert algorithms to substantially reduce disappointment in many twoplayer repeated games when associates follow various static reinforcement learning and expert algorithms




j  y halpern and y  moses 2014 a procedural characterization of solution concepts in games volume 49 pages 143170

we show how gametheoretic solution concepts such as nash equilibrium correlated equilibrium rationalizability and sequential equilibrium can be given a uniform definition in terms of a knowledgebased program with counterfactual semantics in a precise sense this program can be viewed as providing a procedural characterization of rationality




s  schiffel and m  thielscher 2014 representing and reasoning about the rules of general games with imperfect information volume 49 pages 171206

a general game player is a system that can play previously unknown games just by being given their rules for this purpose the game description language gdl has been developed as a highlevel knowledge representation formalism to communicate game rules to players in this paper we address a fundamental limitation of stateoftheart methods and systems for general game playing namely their being confined to deterministic games with complete information about the game state we develop a simple yet expressive extension of standard gdl that allows for formalising the rules of arbitrary finite nplayer games with randomness and incomplete state knowledge in the second part of the paper we address the intricate reasoning challenge for general gameplaying systems that comes with the new description language we develop a full embedding of extended gdl into the situation calculus augmented by scherl and levesques knowledge fluent we formally prove that this provides a sound and complete reasoning method for players knowledge about game states as well as about the knowledge of the other players



k  r apt and g  schaefer 2014 selfishness level of strategic games volume 49 pages 207240

we introduce a new measure of the discrepancy in strategic games between the social welfare in a nash equilibrium and in a social optimum that we call selfishness level it is the smallest fraction of the social welfare that needs to be offered to each player to achieve that a social optimum is realized in a pure nash equilibrium the selfishness level is unrelated to the price of stability and the price of anarchy and is invariant under positive linear transformations of the payoff functions also it naturally applies to other solution concepts and other forms of games
in particular the selfishness level of finite ordinal potential games is finite while that of weakly acyclic games can be infinite  we derive explicit bounds on the selfishness level of fair cost sharing games and linear congestion games which depend on specific parameters of the underlying game but are independent of the number of players  further we show that the selfishness level of the nplayers prisoners dilemma is cbn1c where b and c are the benefit and cost for cooperation respectively  that of the nplayers public goods game is 1cnc1 where c is the public good multiplier and that of the travelers dilemma game is b12 where b is the bonus finally the selfishness level of cournot competition an example of an infinite ordinal potential game tragedy of the commons and bertrand competition is infinite



d  berrar 2014 an empirical evaluation of ranking measures with respect to robustness to noise volume 49 pages 241267

ranking measures play an important role in model evaluation and selection using both synthetic and realworld data sets we investigate how different types and levels of noise affect the area under the roc curve auc the area under the roc convex hull the scored auc the kolmogorovsmirnov statistic and the hmeasure in our experiments the auc was overall the most robust among these measures thereby reinvigorating it as a reliable metric despite its wellknown deficiencies this paper also introduces a novel ranking measure which is remarkably robust to noise yet conceptually simple



t  eiter m  fink t  krennwallner c  redl and p  sch252ller 2014 efficient hexprogram evaluation based on unfounded sets volume 49 pages 269321

hexprograms extend logic programs under the answer set semantics with external computations through external atoms as reasoning from ground horn programs with nonmonotonic external atoms of polynomial complexity is already on the second level of the polynomial hierarchy minimality checking of answer set candidates needs special attention to this end we present an approach based on unfounded sets as a generalization of related techniques for asp programs the unfounded set detection is expressed as a propositional sat problem for which we provide two different encodings and optimizations to them we then integrate our approach into a previously developed evaluation framework for hexprograms which is enriched by additional learning techniques that aim at avoiding the reconstruction of the same or related unfounded sets furthermore we provide a syntactic criterion that allows one to skip the minimality check in many cases an experimental evaluation shows that the new approach significantly decreases runtime



l  cigler and b  faltings 2014 symmetric subgameperfect equilibria in resource allocation volume 49 pages 323361

we analyze symmetric protocols to rationally coordinate on an asymmetric efficient allocation in an infinitely repeated nagent cresource allocation problems where the resources are all homogeneous bhaskar proposed one way to achieve this in 2agent 1resource games agents start by symmetrically randomizing their actions and as soon as they each choose different actions they start to follow a potentially asymmetric convention that prescribes their actions from then on we extend the concept of convention to the general case of infinitely repeated resource allocation games with n agents and c resources we show that for any convention there exists a symmetric subgameperfect equilibrium which implements it we present two conventions bourgeois where agents stick to the first allocation and market where agents pay for the use of resources and observe a global coordination signal which allows them to alternate between different allocations we define price of anonymity of a convention as a ratio between the maximum social payoff of any asymmetric strategy profile and the expected social payoff of the subgameperfect equilibrium which implements the convention we show that while the price of anonymity of the bourgeois convention is infinite the market convention decreases this price by reducing the conflict between the agents



v  belle and g  lakemeyer 2014 multiagent only knowing in dynamic systems volume 49 pages 363402

	the idea of only knowing a collection of sentences as proposed by levesque has been previously shown to be very useful in characterizing knowledgebased agents in terms of a specification a precise and perspicuous account of the beliefs and nonbeliefs is obtained in a monotonic setting levesques logic is based on a firstorder modal language with quantifyingin thus allowing for de re versus de dicto distinctions among other things however the logic and its recent dynamic extension  only deal with the case of a single agent in this work we propose a firstorder multiagent framework with knowledge actions sensing and only knowing that is shown to inherit all  the features of the single agent version most significantly we prove reduction theorems by means of which reasoning about knowledge and actions in the framework simplifies to nonepistemic nondynamic reasoning about the initial situation 



g  greco and f  scarcello 2014 mechanisms for fair allocation problems nopunishment payment rules in verifiable settings volume 49 pages 403449

mechanism design is considered in the context of fair allocations of indivisible goods with monetary compensation by focusing on problems where agents declarations on allocated goods can be verified before payments are performed a setting is considered where verification might be subject to errors so that payments have to be awarded under the presumption of innocence as incorrect declared values do not necessarily mean manipulation attempts by the agents within this setting a mechanism is designed that is shown to be truthful efficient and budgetbalanced moreover agents utilities are fairly determined by the shapley value of suitable coalitional games and enjoy highly desirable properties such as equal treatment of equals envyfreeness and a stronger one called individualoptimality in particular the latter property guarantees that for every agent herhis utility is the maximum possible one over any alternative optimal allocation 
the computational complexity of the proposed mechanism is also studied it turns out that it is pcomplete so that to deal with applications with many agents involved two polynomialtime randomized variants are also proposed one that is still truthful and efficient and which is approximately budgetbalanced with high probability and another one that is truthful in expectation while still budgetbalanced and efficient



b  han p  cook and t  baldwin 2014 textbased twitter user geolocation prediction volume 49 pages 451500

geographical location is vital to geospatial applications like local search and event detection in this paper we investigate and improve on the task of textbased geolocation prediction of twitter users previous studies on this topic have typically assumed that geographical references eg gazetteer terms dialectal words in a text are indicative of its authors location however these references are often buried in informal ungrammatical and multilingual data and are therefore nontrivial to identify and exploit we present an integrated geolocation prediction framework and investigate what factors impact on prediction accuracy first we evaluate a range of feature selection methods to obtain location indicative words we then evaluate the impact of nongeotagged tweets language and userdeclared metadata on geolocation prediction in addition we evaluate the impact of temporal variance on model generalisation and discuss how users differ in terms of their geolocatability
we achieve stateoftheart results for the textbased twitter user geolocation task and also provide the most extensive exploration of the task to date our findings provide valuable insights into the design of robust practical textbased geolocation prediction systems



p  yang and w  gao 2014 informationtheoretic multiview domain adaptation a theoretical and empirical study volume 49 pages 501525

multiview learning aims to improve classification performance by leveraging the consistency among different views of data the incorporation of multiple views was paid little attention in the studies of domain adaptation where the view consistency based on source data is largely violated in the target domain due to the distribution gap between different domain data in this paper we leverage multiple views for crossdomain document classification the central idea is to strengthen the views consistency on target data by identifying the associations of domainspecific features from different domains we present an informationtheoretic multiview adaptation model imam using a multiway clustering scheme where word and link clusters can draw together seemingly unrelated features across domains which boosts the consistency between document clusterings that are based on the respective word and link views moreover we demonstrate that imam can always find the document clustering with the minimal disagreement rate to the overlap of viewbased clusterings we provide both theoretical and empirical justifications of the proposed method our experiments show that imam significantly outperforms traditional multiview algorithm cotraining the cotrainingbased adaptation algorithm coda the singleview transfer model cocc and the largemarginbased multiview transfer model mvtllm

this paper presents a new method minimax tree optimization mmto to learn a heuristic evaluation function of a practical alphabeta search program the evaluation function may be a linear or nonlinear combination of weighted features and the weights are the parameters to be optimized to control the search results so that the move decisions agree with the game records of human experts a wellmodeled objective function to be minimized is designed moreover a numerical iterative method is used to nd local minima of the objective function and more than forty million parameters are adjusted by using a small number of hyper parameters this method was applied to shogi a major variant of chess in which the evaluation function must handle a larger state space than in chess experimental results show that the largescale optimization of the evaluation function improves the playing strength of shogi programs and the new method performs signicantly better than other methods implementation of the new method in our shogi program bonanza made substantial contributions to the programs rstplace nish in the 2013 world computer shogi championship additionally we present preliminary evidence of broader applicability of our method to other twoplayer games such as chess



y  wu p  austrin t  pitassi and d  liu 2014 inapproximability of treewidth and related problems volume 49 pages 569600

graphical models such as bayesian networks and markov networks play an important role in artificial intelligence and machine learning inference is a central problem to be solved on these networks this and other problems on these graph models are often known to be hard to solve in general but tractable on graphs with bounded treewidth therefore finding or approximating the treewidth of a graph is a fundamental problem related to inference in graphical models in this paper we study the approximability of a number of graph problems   treewidth and pathwidth of graphs minimum fillin oneshot black and blackwhite pebbling costs of directed acyclic graphs and a variety of different graph layout problems such as minimum cut linear arrangement and interval graph completion  we show that assuming  the recently introduced small set expansion conjecture all of these  problems are nphard to approximate to within any constant factor in polynomial time



s  j chen a  choi and a  darwiche 2014 algorithms and applications for the samedecision probability volume 49 pages 601633

when making decisions under uncertainty the optimal choices are often difficult to discern especially if not enough information has been gathered two key questions in this regard relate to whether one should stop the information gathering process and commit to a decision stopping criterion and if not what information to gather next selection criterion in this paper we show that the recently introduced notion samedecision probability sdp can be useful as both a stopping and a selection criterion as it can provide additional insight and allow for robust decision making in a variety of scenarios this query has been shown to be highly intractable being ppppcomplete and is exemplary of a class of queries which correspond to the computation of certain expectations we propose the first exact algorithm for computing the sdp and demonstrate its effectiveness on several real and synthetic networks finally we present new complexity results such as the complexity of computing the sdp on models with a naive bayes structure  additionally we prove that computing  the nonmyopic value of information is complete for the  same complexity class as computing the sdp

m  l bonet s  buss and j  johannsen 2014 improved separations of regular resolution from clause learning proof systems volume 49 pages 669703

this paper studies the relationship between resolution and conflict driven clause learning cdcl without restarts and refutes some conjectured possible separations  we prove that the guarded xorified pebbling tautology clauses which urquhart proved are hard for regular resolution as well as the guarded graph tautology clauses of alekhnovich johannsen pitassi and urquhart have polynomial size pool resolution refutations that use only input lemmas as learned clauses  for the latter set of clauses we extend this to prove that a cdcl search without restarts can refute these clauses in polynomial time provided it makes the right choices for decision literals and clause learning  this holds even if the cdcl search is required to greedily process conflicts arising from unit propagation this refutes the conjecture that the guarded graph tautology clauses or the guarded xorified pebbling tautology clauses can be used to separate cdcl without restarts from general resolution  together with subsequent results by buss and kolodziejczyk this means we lack any good conjectures about how to establish the exact logical strength of conflictdriven clause learning without restarts



s  w carden 2014 convergence of a qlearning variant for continuous states and actions volume 49 pages 705731

this paper presents a reinforcement learning algorithm for solving infinite horizon markov decision processes under the expected total discounted reward criterion when both the state and action spaces are continuous  this algorithm is based on watkins qlearning but uses nadarayawatson kernel smoothing to generalize knowledge to unvisited states  as expected continuity conditions must be imposed on the mean rewards and transition probabilities  using results from kernel regression theory this algorithm is proven capable of producing a qvalue function estimate that is uniformly within an arbitrary tolerance of the true qvalue function with probability one  the algorithm is then applied to an example problem to empirically show convergence as well 



n  fernandez garcia j  arias fisteus and l  sanchez fernandez 2014 comparative evaluation of linkbased approaches for candidate ranking in linktowikipedia systems volume 49 pages 733773

in recent years the task of automatically linking pieces of text anchors  mentioned in a document to wikipedia articles that represent the meaning of these anchors has received extensive research attention typically linktowikipedia systems try to find a set of wikipedia articles that are candidates to represent the meaning of the anchor and later rank these candidates to select the most appropriate one in this ranking process the systems rely on context information obtained from the document where the anchor is mentioned andor from wikipedia in this paper we center our attention in the use of wikipedia links as context information in particular we offer a review of several candidate ranking approaches in the stateoftheart that rely on wikipedia link information in addition we provide a comparative empirical evaluation of the different approaches on five different corpora the tac 2010 corpus and four corpora built from actual  wikipedia articles and news items
