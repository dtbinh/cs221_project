in this paper we describe colin a forwardchaining heuristic search planner capable of reasoning with continuous linear numeric change in addition to the full temporal semantics of pddl  through this work we make two advances to the stateoftheart in terms of expressive reasoning capabilities of planners the handling of continuous linear change and the handling of durationdependent effects in combination with duration inequalities both of which require tightly coupled temporal and numeric reasoning during planning  colin combines ffstyle forward chaining search with the use of a linear program lp to check the consistency of the interacting temporal and numeric constraints at each state  the lp is used to compute bounds on the values of variables in each state reducing the range of actions that need to be considered for application  in addition we develop an extension of the temporal relaxed planning graph heuristic of crikey3 to support reasoning directly with continuous change  we extend the range of task variables considered to be suitable candidates for specifying the gradient of the continuous numeric change effected by an action  finally we explore the potential for employing mixed integer programming as a tool for optimising the timestamps of the actions in the plan once a solution has been found to support this we further contribute a selection of extended benchmark domains that include continuous numeric effects  we present results for colin that demonstrate its scalability on a range of benchmarks and compare to existing stateoftheart planners 




d  d maua c  p de campos and m  zaffalon 2012 solving limited memory influence diagrams volume 44 pages 97140

we present a new algorithm for exactly solving decision making problems represented as influence diagrams we do not require the usual assumptions of no forgetting and regularity this allows us to solve problems with simultaneous decisions and limited information the algorithm is empirically shown to outperform a stateoftheart algorithm on randomly generated problems of up to 150 variables and 1064 solutions we show that these problems are nphard even if the underlying graph structure of the problem has low treewidth and the variables take on a bounded number of  states and that they admit no provably good approximation if variables can take on an arbitrary number of states




c  b228ckstr246m and p  jonsson 2012 algorithms and limits for compact plan representations volume 44 pages 141177

compact representations of objects is a common concept in  computer science  automated planning can be viewed as a case of this concept a planning instance is a compact implicit representation of a graph and the problem is to find a path a plan in this graph  while the graphs themselves are represented compactly as planning instances the paths are usually represented explicitly as sequences of actions  some cases are known where the plans always have compact representations for example using macros  we show that these results do not extend to the general case by proving a number of bounds for compact representations of plans under various criteria like efficient sequential or random access of actions  in addition to this we show that our results have consequences for what can be gained from reformulating planning into some other problem  as a contrast to this we also prove a number of positive results demonstrating restricted cases where plans do have useful compact representations as well as proving that macro plans have favourable access properties  our results are finally discussed in relation to other relevant contexts



p  nakov and h t  ng 2012 improving statistical machine translation for a resourcepoor language using related resourcerich languages volume 44 pages 179222

we propose a novel languageindependent approach for improving machine translation for resourcepoor languages by exploiting their similarity to resourcerich ones more precisely we improve the translation from a resourcepoor source language x1 into a resourcerich language y given a bitext containing a limited number of parallel sentences for x1y and a larger bitext for x2y for some resourcerich language x2 that is closely related to x1 this is achieved by taking advantage of the opportunities that vocabulary overlap and similarities between the languages x1 and x2 in spelling word order and syntax offer 1 we improve the word alignments for the resourcepoor language 2 we further augment it with additional translation options and 3 we take care of potential spelling differences through appropriate transliteration the evaluation for indonesian english using malay and for spanish  english using portuguese and pretending spanish is resourcepoor shows an absolute gain of up to 135 and 337 bleu points respectively which is an improvement over the best rivaling approaches while using much less additional data overall our method cuts the amount of necessary real training data by a factor of 25



w  mao and j  gratch 2012 modeling social causality and responsibility judgment in multiagent interactions volume 44 pages 223273

social causality is the inference an entity makes about the social behavior of other entities and self besides physical cause and effect social causality involves reasoning about epistemic states of agents and coercive circumstances based on such inference responsibility judgment is the process whereby one singles out individuals to assign responsibility credit or blame for multiagent activities social causality and responsibility judgment are a key aspect of social intelligence and a model for them facilitates the design and development of a variety of multiagent interactive systems based on psychological attribution theory this paper presents a domainindependent computational model to automate social inference and judgment process according to an agents causal knowledge and observations of interaction we conduct experimental studies to empirically validate the computational model the experimental results show that our model predicts human judgments of social attributions and makes inferences consistent with what most people do in their judgments therefore the proposed model can be generically incorporated into an intelligent system to augment its social and cognitive functionality



p  ghosh a  sharma pp  chakrabarti and p  dasgupta 2012 algorithms for generating ordered solutions for explicit andor structures volume 44 pages 275333

we present algorithms for generating alternative solutions for explicit acyclic andor structures in nondecreasing order of cost the proposed algorithms use a best first search technique and report the solutions using an implicit representation ordered by cost in this paper we present two versions of the search algorithm  a an initial version of the best first search algorithm asg which may present one solution more than once while generating the ordered solutions and b another version lasg which avoids the construction of the duplicate solutions the actual solutions can be reconstructed quickly from the implicit compact representation used we have applied the methods on a few test domains some of them are synthetic while the others are based on well known problems including the search space of the 5peg tower of hanoi problem the matrixchain multiplication problem and the problem of finding secondary structure of rna experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithms over the existing approach our proposed algorithms have potential use in various domains ranging from knowledge based frameworks to service composition where the andor structure is widely used for representing problems



m  fox d  long and d  magazzeni 2012 planbased policies for efficient multiple battery load management volume 44 pages 335382




icaps 2011 best paper award

efficient use of multiple batteries is a practical problem with wide and growing application the problem can be cast as a planning problem under uncertainty we describe the approach we have adopted to modelling and solving this problem seen as a markov decision problem building effective policies for battery switching in the face of stochastic load profiles 
application of the approach leads to construction of policies that in simulation significantly outperform those that are currently in use and the best published solutions to the battery management problem we achieve solutions that achieve more than 99 efficiency in simulation compared with the theoretical limit and do so with far fewer battery switches than existing policies behaviour of physical batteries does not exactly match the simulated models for many reasons so to confirm that our theoretical results can lead to real measured improvements in performance we also conduct and report experiments using a physical test system these results demonstrate that we can obtain 515 improvement in lifetimes in the case of a two battery system

e  albacete j  calle e  castro and d  cuadra 2012 semantic similarity measures applied to an ontology for humanlike interaction volume 44 pages 397421

the focus of this paper is the calculation of similarity between two concepts from an ontology for a humanlike interaction system in order to facilitate this calculation a similarity function is proposed based on five dimensions sort compositional essential restrictive and descriptive constituting the structure of ontological knowledge the paper includes a proposal for computing a similarity function for each dimension of knowledge later on the similarity values obtained are weighted and aggregated to obtain a global similarity measure in order to calculate those weights associated to each dimension four training methods have been proposed the training methods differ in the element to fit the user concepts or pairs of concepts and a hybrid approach for evaluating the proposal the knowledge base was fed from wordnet and extended by using a knowledge editing toolkit cognos the evaluation of the proposal is carried out through the comparison of system responses with those given by human test subjects both providing a measure of the soundness of the procedure and revealing ways in which the proposal may be improved



j  velez g  hemann a  s huang i  posner and n  roy 2012 modelling observation correlations for active exploration and robust object detection  volume 44 pages 423453




icaps 2011 best student paper

today mobile robots are expected to carry out increasingly complex tasks in multifarious realworld environments often the tasks require a certain semantic understanding of the workspace consider for example spoken instructions from a human collaborator referring to objects of interest the robot must be able to accurately detect these objects to correctly understand the instructions however existing object detection while competent is not perfect in particular the performance of detection algorithms is commonly sensitive to the position of the sensor relative to the objects in the scene
this paper presents an online planning algorithm which learns an explicit model of the spatial dependence of object detection and generates plans which maximize the expected performance of the detection and by extension the overall plan performance crucially the learned sensor model incorporates spatial correlations between measurements capturing the fact that successive measurements taken at the same or nearby locations are not independent we show how this sensor model can be incorporated into an efficient forward search algorithm in the information space of detected objects allowing the robot to generate motion plans efficiently  we investigate the performance of our approach by addressing the tasks of door and text detection in indoor environments and demonstrate significant improvement in detection performance during task execution over alternative methods in simulated and real robot experiments



m  c cooper and s  zivny 2012 tractable triangles and crossfree convexity in discrete optimisation volume 44 pages 455490

the minimisation problem of a sum of unary and pairwise functions of discrete variables is a general nphard problem with wide applications such as computing map configurations in markov random fields mrf minimising gibbs energy or solving binary valued constraint satisfaction problems vcsps
furthermore we introduce a class of problems with convex cardinality functions on crossfree sets of assignments we prove that while imposing only one of the two conditions renders the problem nphard the conjunction of the two gives rise to a novel tractable class satisfying the crossfree convexity property which generalises the jointwinner property to problems of unbounded arity



j  huang a  kapoor and c  guestrin 2012 riffled independence for efficient inference with partial rankings volume 44 pages 491532

distributions over rankings are used to model data in a multitude of real world settings such as preference analysis and political elections modeling such distributions presents several computational challenges however due to the factorial size of the set of rankings over an item set some of these challenges are quite familiar to the artificial intelligence community such as how to compactly represent a distribution over a combinatorially large space and how to efficiently perform probabilistic inference with these representations with respect to ranking however there is the additional challenge of what we refer to as human task complexity  users are rarely willing to provide a full ranking over a long list of candidates instead often preferring to provide partial ranking information
simultaneously addressing all of these challenges  ie designing a compactly representable model which is amenable to efficient inference and can be learned using partial ranking data  is a difficult task but is necessary if we would like to scale to problems with nontrivial size in this paper we show that the recently proposed riffled independence assumptions cleanly and efficiently address each of the above challenges in particular we establish a tight mathematical connection between the concepts of riffled independence and of partial rankings this correspondence not only allows us to then develop efficient and exact algorithms for performing inference tasks using riffled independence based represen tations with partial rankings but somewhat surprisingly also shows that efficient inference is not possible for riffle independent models in a certain sense with observations which do not take the form of partial rankings finally using our inference algorithm we introduce the first method for learning riffled independence based models from partially ranked data



p  d turney 2012 domain and function a dualspace model of semantic relations and compositions volume 44 pages 533585

given appropriate representations of the semantic relations between carpenter and wood and between mason and stone for example vectors in a vector space model a suitable algorithm should be able to recognize that these relations are highly similar carpenter is to wood as mason is to stone the relations are analogous likewise with representations of dog house and kennel an algorithm should be able to recognize that the semantic composition of dog and house dog house is highly similar to kennel dog house and kennel are synonymous it seems that these two tasks recognizing relations and compositions are closely connected however up to now the best models for relations are significantly different from the best models for compositions in this paper we introduce a dualspace model that unifies these two tasks this model matches the performance of the best previous models for relations and compositions the dualspace model consists of a space for measuring domain similarity and a space for measuring function similarity carpenter and wood share the same domain the domain of carpentry mason and stone share the same domain the domain of masonry carpenter and mason share the same function the function of artisans wood and stone share the same function the function of materials in the composition dog house kennel has some domain overlap with both dog and house the domains of pets and buildings the function of kennel is similar to the function of house the function of shelters by combining domain and function similarities in various ways we can model relations compositions and other aspects of semantics



j  hoffmann i  weber and f  m kraft 2012 sap speaks pddl exploiting a softwareengineering model for planning in business process management volume 44 pages 587632

planning is concerned with the automated solution of action sequencing problems described in declarative languages giving the action preconditions and effects one important application area for such technology is the creation of new processes in business process management bpm which is essential in an ever more dynamic business environment a major obstacle for the application of planning in this area lies in the modeling obtaining a suitable model to plan with  ideally a description in pddl the most commonly used planning language  is often prohibitively complicated andor costly our core observation in this work is that this problem can be ameliorated by leveraging synergies with modelbased software development our application at sap one of the leading vendors of enterprise software demonstrates that even onetoone model reuse is possible
we compile sam into a variant of pddl and adapt an offtheshelf planner to solve this kind of problem thanks to the resulting technology business experts may create new processes simply by specifying the desired behavior in terms of status variable value changes effectively by describing the process in their own language

c  domshlak e  karpas and s  markovitch 2012 online speedup learning for optimal planning volume 44 pages 709755

domainindependent planning is one of the foundational areas in the field of artificial intelligence a description of a planning task consists of an initial world state a goal and a set of actions for modifying the world state the objective is to find a sequence of actions that is a plan that transforms the initial world state into a goal state in optimal planning we are interested in finding not just a plan but one of the cheapest plans a prominent approach to optimal planning these days is heuristic
statespace search guided by admissible heuristic functions numerous admissible heuristics have been developed each with its own strengths and weaknesses and it is well known that there is no single best heuristic for optimal planning in general  thus which heuristic to choose for a given planning task is a difficult question this difficulty can be avoided by combining several heuristics but that requires computing numerous heuristic estimates at each state and the tradeoff between the time spent doing so and the time saved by the combined advantages of the different heuristics might be high we present a novel method that reduces the cost of combining admissible heuristics for optimal planning while maintaining its benefits  using an idealized search space model we formulate a decision rule for choosing the best heuristic to compute at each state we then present an active online learning approach for learning a classifier with that decision rule as the target concept and employ the learned classifier to decide  which heuristic to compute at each state we evaluate this technique empirically and show that it substantially outperforms the standard method for combining several heuristics via their pointwise maximum
