g  wang q  song h  sun x  zhang b  xu and y  zhou 2013 a feature subset selection algorithm automatic recommendation method volume 47 pages 134

many feature subset selection fss algorithms have been proposed but not all of them are appropriate for a given feature selection problem at the same time so far there is rarely a good way to choose appropriate fss algorithms for the problem at hand thus fss algorithm automatic recommendation is very important and practically useful in this paper a meta learning based fss algorithm automatic recommendation method is presented the proposed method first identifies the data sets that are most similar to the one at hand by the knearest neighbor classification algorithm and the distances among these data sets are calculated based on the commonlyused data set characteristics then it ranks all the candidate fss algorithms according to their performance on these similar data sets and chooses the algorithms with best performance as the appropriate ones the performance of the candidate fss algorithms is evaluated by a multicriteria metric that takes into account not only the classification accuracy over the selected features but also the runtime of feature selection and the number of selected features the proposed recommendation method is extensively tested on 115 real world data sets with 22 wellknown and frequentlyused different fss algorithms for five representative classifiers the results show the effectiveness of our proposed fss algorithm recommendation method



m  aramon bajestani and j c  beck 2013 scheduling a dynamic aircraft repair shop with limited repair resources volume 47 pages 3570

we address a dynamic repair shop scheduling problem in the context of military aircraft fleet management where the goal is to maintain a full complement of aircraft over the longterm a number of flights each with a requirement for a specific number and type of aircraft are already scheduled over a long horizon we need to assign aircraft to flights and schedule repair activities while considering the flights requirements repair capacity and aircraft failures the number of aircraft awaiting repair dynamically changes over time due to failures and it is therefore necessary to rebuild the repair schedule online to solve the problem we view the dynamic repair shop as successive static repair scheduling subproblems over shorter time periods we propose a complete approach based on the logicbased benders decomposition to solve the static subproblems and design different rescheduling policies to schedule the dynamic repair shop computational experiments demonstrate that the benders model is able to find and prove optimal solutions on average four times faster than a mixed integer programming model the rescheduling approach having both aspects of scheduling over a longer horizon and quickly adjusting the schedule increases aircraft available in the long term by 10 compared to the approaches having either one of the aspects alone



s  vesic 2013 identifying the class of maxiconsistent operators in argumentation volume 47 pages 7193

dungs abstract argumentation theory can be seen as a general framework for nonmonotonic reasoning an important question is then what is the class of logics that can be subsumed as instantiations of this theory the goal of this paper is to identify and study the large class of logicbased instantiations of dungs theory which correspond to the maxiconsistent operator ie to the function which returns maximal consistent subsets of an inconsistent knowledge base in other words we study the class of instantiations where very extension of the argumentation system corresponds to exactly one maximal consistent subset of the knowledge base we show that an attack relation belonging to this class must be conflictdependent must not be valid must not be conflictcomplete must not be symmetric etc then we show that some attack relations serve as lower or upper bounds of the class eg if an attack relation contains canonical undercut then it is not a member of this class by using our results we show for all existing attack relations whether or not they belong to this class we also define new attack relations which are members of this class finally we interpret our results and discuss more general questions like what is the added value of argumentation in such a setting we believe that this work is a first step towards achieving our longterm goal which is to better understand the role of argumentation and particularly the expressivity of logicbased instantiations of dungstyle argumentation frameworks



j  c boerkoel jr and e  h durfee 2013 distributed reasoning for multiagent simple temporal problems volume 47 pages 95156

this research focuses on building foundational algorithms for scheduling agents that assist people in managing their activities in environments where tempo and complex activity interdependencies outstrip peoples cognitive capacity  we address the critical challenge of reasoning over individuals interacting schedules to efficiently answer queries about how to meet scheduling goals while respecting individual privacy and autonomy to the extent possible  we formally define the multiagent simple temporal problem for naturally capturing and reasoning over the distributed but interconnected scheduling problems of multiple individuals  our hypothesis is that combining bottomup and topdown approaches will lead to effective solution techniques  in our bottomup phase an agent externalizes constraints that compactly summarize how its local subproblem affects other agents subproblems whereas in our topdown phase an agent proactively constructs and internalizes new local constraints that decouple its subproblem from others  we confirm this hypothesis by devising distributed algorithms that calculate summaries of the joint solution space for multiagent scheduling problems without centralizing or otherwise redistributing the problems  the distributed algorithms permit concurrent execution to achieve significant speedup over the current art and also increase the level of privacy and independence in individual agent reasoning  these algorithms are most advantageous for problems where interactions between the agents are sparse compared to the complexity of agents individual problems

y  bachrach e  porat and j  s  rosenschein 2013 sharing rewards in cooperative connectivity games volume 47 pages 281311

we consider how selfish agents are likely to share revenues derived from maintaining connectivity between important network servers we model a network where a failure of one node may disrupt communication between other nodes as a cooperative game called the vertex connectivity game cg in this game each agent owns a vertex and controls all the edges going to and from that vertex a coalition of agents wins if it fully connects a certain subset of vertices in the graph called the primary vertices
we also investigate finding stable payoff divisions of the revenues in cgs captured by the game theoretic solution of the core and its relaxations the epsiloncore and least core we show a polynomial algorithm for computing the core of a cg but show that testing whether an imputation is in the epsiloncore is conpcomplete finally we show that for trees it is possible to test for epsiloncore imputations in polynomial time



p  r costa and l  m botelho 2013 learning by observation of agent software images volume 47 pages 313349

learning by observation can be of key importance whenever agents sharing similar features want to learn from each other this paper presents an agent architecture that enables software agents to learn by direct observation of the actions executed by expert agents while they are performing a task this is possible because the proposed architecture displays information that is essential for observation making it possible for software agents to observe each other 
results show that agents are able to learn in conditions where common supervised learning algorithms fail such as when agents do not know the results of their actions a priori or when not all the effects of the actions are visible the results also show that our approach provides better results than other learning methods since it requires shorter learning periods



w  faber m  truszczy324ski and s  woltran 2013 strong equivalence of qualitative optimization problems volume 47 pages 351391

we introduce the framework of qualitative optimization problems or simply optimization problems to represent preference theories the formalism uses separate modules to describe the space of outcomes to be compared the generator and the preferences on outcomes the selector we consider two types of optimization problems they differ in the way the generator which we model by a propositional theory is interpreted by the standard propositional logic semantics and by the equilibriummodel answerset semantics under the latter interpretation of generators optimization problems directly generalize answerset optimization programs proposed previously we study strong equivalence of optimization problems which guarantees their interchangeability within any larger context we characterize several versions of strong equivalence obtained by restricting the class of optimization problems that can be used as extensions and establish the complexity of associated reasoning tasks understanding strong equivalence is essential for modular representation of optimization problems and rewriting techniques to simplify them without changing their inherent properties



n  taghipour d  fierens j  davis and h  blockeel 2013 lifted variable elimination decoupling the operators from the constraint language volume 47 pages 393439

lifted probabilistic inference algorithms exploit regularities in the structure of graphical models to perform inference more efficiently more specifically they identify groups of interchangeable variables and perform inference once per group as opposed to once per variable the groups are defined by means of constraints so the flexibility of the grouping is determined by the expressivity of the constraint language existing approaches for exact lifted inference use specific languages for inequality constraints which often have limited expressivity in this article we decouple lifted inference from the constraint language we define operators for lifted inference in terms of relational algebra operators so that they operate on the semantic level the constraints extension rather than on the syntactic level making them languageindependent as a result lifted inference can be performed using more powerful constraint languages which provide more opportunities for lifting we empirically demonstrate that this can improve inference efficiency by orders of magnitude allowing exact inference where until now only approximate inference was feasible



l  cigler and b  faltings 2013 decentralized anticoordination through multiagent learning volume 47 pages 441473

to achieve an optimal outcome in many situations agents need to choose distinct actions from one another this is the case notably in many resource allocation problems where a single resource can only be used by one agent at a time how shall a designer of a multiagent system program its identical agents to behave each in a different way
we present a multiagent learning algorithm that converges in polynomial number of steps to a correlated equilibrium of a channel allocation game a variant of the resource allocation game we show that the agents learn to play for each coordination signal value a randomly chosen purestrategy nash equilibrium of the game therefore the outcome is an efficient correlated equilibrium this ce becomes more fair as the number of the available coordination signal values increases

we investigate two systems of fully proportional representation suggested by chamberlin courant and monroe both systems assign a representative to each voter so that the sum of misrepresentations is  minimized the winner determination problem for both systems is known to be nphard hence this work aims at investigating whether there are variants of the proposed rules andor specific electorates for which these problems can be solved efficiently as a variation of these rules instead of minimizing the sum of misrepresentations we considered minimizing the maximal misrepresentation introducing effectively two new rules in the general case  these minimax versions of classical rules appeared to be still nphard  




s  joty g  carenini and r  t ng 2013 topic segmentation and labeling in asynchronous conversations volume 47 pages 521573

topic segmentation and labeling is often considered a prerequisite for higherlevel conversation analysis and has been shown to be useful in many natural language processing nlp applications we present two new corpora of email and blog conversations annotated with topics and evaluate annotator reliability for the segmentation and labeling tasks in these asynchronous conversations we propose a complete computational framework for topic segmentation and labeling in asynchronous conversations our approach extends stateoftheart methods by considering a finegrained structure of an asynchronous conversation along with other conversational features by applying recent graphbased methods for nlp for topic segmentation we propose two novel unsupervised models that exploit the finegrained conversational structure and a novel graphtheoretic supervised model that combines lexical conversational and topic features for topic labeling we propose two novel unsupervised random walk models that respectively capture conversation specific clues from two different sources the leading sentences and the finegrained conversational structure empirical evaluation shows that the segmentation and the labeling performed by our best models beat the stateoftheart and are highly correlated with human annotations



c  b228ckstr246m and p  jonsson 2013 a refined view of causal graphs and component sizes spclosed graph classes and beyond volume 47 pages 575611

the causal graph of a planning instance is an important tool for planning both in practice and in theory the theoretical studies of causal graphs have largely analysed the computational complexity of planning for instances where the causal graph has a certain structure often in combination with other parameters like the domain size of the variables chen and gim233nez ignored even the structure and considered only the size of the weakly connected components they proved that planning is tractable if the components are bounded by a constant and otherwise intractable their intractability result was however conditioned by an assumption from parameterised complexity theory that has no known useful relationship with the standard complexity classes we approach the same problem from the perspective of standard complexity classes and prove that planning is nphard for classes with unbounded components under an additional restriction we refer to as spclosed we then argue that most nphardness theorems for causal graphs are difficult to apply and thus prove a more general result even if the component sizes grow slowly and the class is not densely populated with graphs planning still cannot be tractable unless the polynomial hierachy collapses both these results still hold when restricted to the class of acyclic causal graphs we finally give a partial characterization of the borderline between nphard and npintermediate classes giving further insight into the problem



t  grinshpoun a  grubshtein r  zivan a  netzer and a  meisels 2013 asymmetric distributed constraint optimization problems volume 47 pages 613647

distributed constraint optimization dcop is a powerful framework for representing and solving distributed combinatorial problems where the variables of the problem are owned by different agents many multiagent problems include constraints that produce different gains or costs for the participating agents asymmetric gains of constrained agents cannot be naturally represented by the standard dcop model
innovative algorithms that apply to the special properties of the proposed adcop model are presented in detail these include complete algorithms that have a substantial advantage in terms of runtime and network load over existing algorithms for standard dcops which use alternative representations  moreover standard incomplete algorithms ie local search algorithms are inapplicable to the existing dcop representations of asymmetric constraints and when they are applied to the new adcop framework they often fail to converge to a local optimum and yield poor results the local search algorithms proposed in the present paper converge to high quality solutions the experimental evidence that is presented reveals that the proposed local search algorithms for adcops achieve high quality solutions while preserving a high level of privacy



t  leaute and b  faltings 2013 protecting privacy through distributed computation in multiagent decision making volume 47 pages 649695

as largescale theft of data from corporate servers is becoming increasingly common it becomes interesting to examine alternatives to the paradigm of centralizing sensitive data into large databases instead one could use cryptography and distributed computation so that sensitive data can be supplied and processed in encrypted form and only the final result is made known in this paper we examine how such a paradigm can be used to implement constraint satisfaction a technique that can solve a broad class of ai problems such as resource allocation planning scheduling and diagnosis most previous work on privacy in constraint satisfaction only attempted to protect specific types of information in particular the feasibility of particular combinations of decisions we formalize and extend these restricted notions of privacy by introducing four types of private information including the feasibility of decisions and the final decisions made but also the identities of the participants and the topology of the problem we present distributed algorithms that allow computing solutions to constraint satisfaction problems while maintaining these four types of privacy we formally prove the privacy properties of these algorithms and show experiments that compare their respective performance on benchmark problems 




e  burns w  ruml and m  b do 2013 heuristic search when time matters volume 47 pages 697740

in many applications of shortestpath algorithms it is impractical to   find a provably optimal solution one can only hope to achieve an appropriate balance between search time and solution cost that respects the users preferences preferences come in many forms we consider utility functions that linearly tradeoff search time and solution cost many natural utility functions can be expressed in this form for example when solution cost represents the makespan of a plan equally weighting search time and plan makespan minimizes the time from the arrival of a goal until it is achieved current stateoftheart approaches to optimizing utility functions rely on anytime algorithms and the use of extensive training data to compute a termination policy we propose a more direct approach called bugsy that incorporates the utility function directly into the search obviating the need for a separate termination policy we describe a new method based on offline parameter tuning and a novel benchmark domain for planning under time pressure based on platformstyle video games we then present what we believe to be the first empirical study of applying anytime monitoring to heuristic search and we compare it with our proposals our results suggest that the parameter tuning technique can give the best performance if a representative set of training instances is available if not then bugsy is the algorithm of choice as it performs well and does not require any offline training this work extends the tradition of research on metareasoning for search by illustrating the benefits of embedding lightweight reasoning about time into the search algorithm itself

answering conjunctive queries cqs over a set of facts extended with existential rules is a prominent problem in knowledge representation and databases this problem can be solved using the chase algorithm which extends the given set of facts with fresh facts in order to satisfy the rules if the chase terminates then cqs can be evaluated directly in the resulting set of facts the chase however does not terminate necessarily and checking whether the chase terminates on a given set of rules and facts is undecidable numerous acyclicity notions were proposed as sufficient conditions for chase termination in this paper we present two new acyclicity notions called modelfaithful acyclicity mfa and modelsummarising acyclicity msa furthermore we investigate the landscape of the known acyclicity notions and establish a complete taxonomy of all notions known to us finally we show that mfa and msa generalise most of these notions

m  hodosh p  young and j  hockenmaier 2013 framing image description as a ranking task data models and evaluation metrics volume 47 pages 853899

the ability to associate images with natural language sentences that describe what is depicted in them is a hallmark of image understanding and a prerequisite for applications such as sentencebased image search in analogy to image search we propose to frame sentencebased image annotation as the task of ranking a given pool of captions we introduce a new benchmark collection for sentencebased image description and search consisting of 8000 images that are each paired with five different captions which provide clear descriptions of the salient entities and events we introduce a number of systems that perform quite well on this task even though they are only based on features that can be obtained with minimal supervision our results clearly indicate the importance of training on multiple captions per image and of capturing syntactic word orderbased and semantic features of these captions we also perform an indepth comparison of human and automatic evaluation metrics for this task and propose strategies for collecting human judgments cheaply and on a very large scale allowing us to augment our collection with additional relevance judgments of which captions describe which image our analysis shows that metrics that consider the ranked list of results for each query image or sentence are significantly more robust than metrics that are based on a single response per query moreover our study suggests that the evaluation of rankingbased image description systems may be fully automated
