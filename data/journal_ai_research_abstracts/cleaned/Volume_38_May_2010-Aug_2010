s  katrenko p  w adriaans and m  van someren 2010 using local alignments for relation recognition volume 38 pages 148

this paper discusses the problem of marrying structural similarity with semantic relatedness for information extraction from text aiming at accurate recognition of relations we introduce local alignment kernels and explore various possibilities of using them for this task we give a definition of a local alignment la kernel based on the smithwaterman score as a sequence similarity measure and proceed with a range of possibilities for computing similarity between elements of sequences we show how distributional similarity measures obtained from unlabeled data can be incorporated into the learning task as semantic knowledge our experiments suggest that the la kernel yields promising results on various biomedical corpora outperforming two baselines by a large margin additional series of experiments have been conducted on the data sets of seven general relation types where the performance of the la kernel is comparable to the current stateoftheart results



c  cayrol f  dupin de saintcyr and m  lagasquieschiex 2010 change in abstract argumentation frameworks adding an argument volume 38 pages 4984

in this paper we address the problem of change in an abstract argumentation system we focus on a particular change the addition of  a new argument which interacts with previous arguments we study the impact of such an addition on the outcome of the argumentation system more particularly on the set of its extensions several properties for this change operation are defined by comparing the new set of extensions to the initial one these properties are called structural when the comparisons are based on setcardinality or setinclusion relations several other properties are proposed where comparisons are based on the status of some particular arguments the accepted arguments these properties refer to the evolution of this status during the change eg monotony and priority to recency all these  properties may be more or less desirable according to specific applications they are studied under two particular semantics the grounded and preferred semantics



w  yeoh a  felner and s  koenig 2010 bnbadopt an asynchronous branchandbound dcop algorithm volume 38 pages 85133

distributed constraint optimization dcop problems are a popular way of formulating and solving agentcoordination problems a dcop problem is a problem where several agents coordinate their values such that the sum of the resulting constraint costs is minimal it is often desirable to solve dcop problems with memorybounded and asynchronous algorithms we introduce branchandbound adopt bnbadopt a memorybounded asynchronous dcop search algorithm that uses the messagepassing and communication framework of adopt modi shen tambe  yokoo 2005 a well known memorybounded asynchronous dcop search algorithm but changes the search strategy of adopt from bestfirst search to depthfirst branchandbound search our experimental results show that bnbadopt finds costminimal solutions up to one order of magnitude faster than adopt for a variety of large dcop problems and is as fast as ncbb a memorybounded synchronous dcop search algorithm for most of these dcop problems additionally it is often desirable to find boundederror solutions for dcop problems within a reasonable amount of time since finding costminimal solutions is nphard the existing boundederror approximation mechanism allows users only to specify an absolute error bound on the solution cost but a relative error bound is often more intuitive thus we present two new boundederror approximation mechanisms that allow for relative error bounds and implement them on top of bnbadopt



i  androutsopoulos and p  malakasiotis 2010 a survey of paraphrasing and textual entailment methods volume 38 pages 135187

paraphrasing methods recognize generate or extract phrases sentences or longer natural language expressions that convey almost the same information textual entailment methods on the other hand recognize generate or extract pairs of natural language expressions such that a human who reads and trusts the first element of a pair would most likely infer that the other element is also true paraphrasing can be seen as bidirectional textual entailment and methods from the two areas are often similar both kinds of methods are useful at least in principle in a wide range of natural language processing applications including question answering summarization text generation and machine translation we summarize key ideas from the two areas by considering in turn recognition generation and extraction methods also pointing to prominent articles and resources



m  michelson and c  a knoblock 2010 constructing reference sets from unstructured ungrammatical text volume 38 pages 189221

vast amounts of text on the web are unstructured and ungrammatical such as classified ads auction listings forum postings etc we call such text posts despite their inconsistent structure and lack of grammar posts are full of useful information this paper presents work on semiautomatically building tables of relational information called reference sets by analyzing such posts directly reference sets can be applied to a number of tasks such as ontology maintenance and information extraction our referenceset construction method starts with just a small amount of background knowledge and constructs tuples representing the entities in the posts to form a reference set we also describe an extension to this approach for the special case where even this small amount of background knowledge is impossible to discover and use to evaluate the utility of the machineconstructed reference sets we compare them to manually constructed reference sets in the context of referencesetbased information extraction our results show the reference sets constructed by our method outperform manually constructed reference sets we also compare the referencesetbased extraction approach using the machineconstructed reference set to supervised extraction approaches using generic features these results demonstrate that using machineconstructed reference sets outperforms the supervised methods even though the supervised methods require training data



j  wittocx m  mari235n and m  denecker 2010 grounding fo and foid with bounds volume 38 pages 223269

grounding is the task of reducing a firstorder theory and finite domain to an equivalent propositional theory it is used as preprocessing phase in many logicbased reasoning systems such systems provide a rich firstorder input language to a user and can rely on efficient propositional solvers to perform the actual reasoning 
we first present our method for classical firstorder logic fo theories then we extend it to foid the extension of fo with inductive definitions which allows for more concise and comprehensive input theories we discuss implementation issues and experimentally validate the practical applicability of our method



d  lesaint d  mehta b  osullivan l  quesada and n  wilson 2010 developing approaches  for solving a telecommunications feature subscription problem volume 38 pages 271305

call control features eg calldivert voicemail are primitive options to which users can subscribe offline to personalise their  service the configuration of a feature subscription involves choosing and sequencing features from a catalogue and is subject to  constraints that prevent undesirable feature interactions at runtime when the subscription requested by a user is inconsistent one  problem is to find an optimal relaxation  which is a generalisation of the feedback vertex  set problem on directed graphs and thus it is an nphard task we present several constraint programming formulations of the problem we also present formulations using partial  weighted maximum boolean satisfiability and mixed integer linear programming  we study all these formulations by experimentally comparing them  on a variety of randomly generated instances of the feature subscription problem

binary decision diagram bdd based set bounds propagation is a powerful approach to solving setconstraint satisfaction problems however prior bdd based techniques in cur the significant overhead of constructing and manipulating graphs during search we present a setconstraint solver which combines bddbased setbounds propagators with the learning abilities of a modern sat solver together with a number of improvements beyond the basic algorithm this solver is highly competitive with existing propagation based set constraint solvers



m  babaioff m  feldman and n  nisan 2010 mixed strategies in combinatorial agency volume 38 pages 339369

in many multiagent domains a set of agents exert effort towards a joint outcome yet the individual effort levels cannot be easily observed a typical example for such a scenario is routing in communication networks where the sender can only observe whether the packet reached its destination but often has no information about the actions of the intermediate routers which influences the final outcome  we study a setting where a principal needs to motivate a team of agents whose combination of hidden efforts stochastically determines an outcome  in a companion paper we devise and study a  basic combinatorial agency model for this setting where the principal is restricted to inducing a pure nash equilibrium  here we study various implications of this restriction first we show that in contrast to the case of observable efforts inducing a mixedstrategies equilibrium may be beneficial for the principal second we present a sufficient condition for technologies for which no gain can be generated third we bound the principals gain for various families of technologies finally we study the robustness of mixed equilibria to coalitional deviations and the computational hardness of the optimal mixed equilibria



a  feldman g  provan and a  van gemund 2010 approximate modelbased diagnosis using greedy stochastic search volume 38 pages 371413

we propose a stochastic fault diagnosis algorithm called safari which trades off guarantees of computing minimal diagnoses for computational efficiency we empirically demonstrate using the 74xxx and iscas85 suites of benchmark combinatorial circuits that safari achieves several ordersofmagnitude speedup over two wellknown deterministic algorithms cda and ha for multiplefault diagnoses further safari can compute a range of multiplefault diagnoses that cda and ha cannot we also prove that safari is optimal for a range of propositional fault models such as the widelyused weakfault models models with ignorance of abnormal behavior we discuss the optimality of safari in a class of strongfault circuit models with stuckat failure modes by modeling the algorithm itself as a markov chain we provide exact bounds on the minimality of the diagnosis computed safari also displays strong anytime behavior and will return a diagnosis after any nontrivial inference time



j  wu and e  h durfee 2010 resourcedriven missionphasing techniques for constrained agents in stochastic environments volume 38 pages 415473

because an agents resources dictate what actions it can possibly take it should plan which resources it holds over time carefully considering its inherent limitations such as power or payload restrictions the competing needs of other agents for the same resources and the stochastic nature of the environment such agents can in general achieve more of their objectives if they can use  and even create  opportunities to change which resources they hold at various times  driven by resource constraints the agents could break their overall missions into an optimal series of phases optimally reconfiguring their resources at each phase and optimally using their assigned resources in each phase given their knowledge of the stochastic environment
in this paper we formally define and analyze this constrained sequential optimization problem in both the singleagent and multiagent contexts we present a family of mixed integer linear programming milp formulations of this problem that can optimally create phases when phases are not predefined accounting for costs and limitations in phase creation  because our formulations multaneously also find the optimal allocations of resources at each phase and the optimal policies for using the allocated resources at each phase they exploit structure across these coupled problems this allows them to find solutions significantly fasterorders of magnitude faster in larger problems than alternative solution techniques as we demonstrate empirically



p  a ortega and d  a braun 2010 a minimum relative entropy principle for learning and acting volume 38 pages 475511

this paper proposes a method to construct an adaptive agent that is universal with respect to a given class of experts where each expert is designed specifically for a particular environment this adaptive control problem is formalized as the problem of minimizing the relative entropy of the adaptive agent from the expert that is most suitable for the unknown environment if the agent is a passive observer then the optimal solution is the wellknown bayesian predictor however if the agent is active then its past actions need to be treated as causal interventions on the io stream rather than normal probability conditions here it is shown that the solution to this new variational problem is given by a stochastic controller called the bayesian control rule which implements adaptive behavior as a mixture of experts furthermore it is shown that under mild assumptions the bayesian control rule converges to the control law of the most suitable expert



m  benisch g  b davis and t  sandholm 2010 algorithms for closed under rational behavior curb sets volume 38 pages 513534

we provide a series of algorithms demonstrating that solutions according to the fundamental gametheoretic solution concept of closed under rational behavior curb sets in twoplayer normalform games can be computed in polynomial time we also discuss extensions to nplayer games first we describe an algorithm that identifies all of a players best responses conditioned on the belief that the other player will play from within a given subset of its strategy space this algorithm serves as a subroutine in a series of polynomialtime algorithms for finding all minimal curb sets one minimal curb set and the smallest minimal curb set in a game we then show that the complexity of finding a nash equilibrium can be exponential only in the size of a games smallest curb set related to this we show that the smallest curb set can be an arbitrarily small portion of the game but it can also be arbitrarily larger than the supports of its only enclosed nash equilibrium we test our algorithms empirically and find that most commonly studied academic games tend to have either very large or very small minimal curb sets



j  de bruijn and s  heymans 2010 logical foundations of rdfs with datatypes  volume 38 pages 535568

the resource description framework rdf is a semantic web standard that provides a data language simply called rdf as well as a lightweight ontology language called rdf schema we investigate embeddings of rdf in logic and show how standard logic programming and description logic technology can be used for reasoning with rdf we subsequently consider extensions of rdf with datatype support considering d entailment defined in the rdf semantics specification and d entailment a semantic weakening of d entailment introduced by ter horst we use the embeddings and properties of the logics to establish novel upper bounds for the complexity of deciding entailment we subsequently establish two novel lower bounds establishing that rdfs entailment is ptimecomplete and that simpled entailment is conphard when considering arbitrary datatypes both in the size of the entailing graph the results indicate that rdfs may not be as lightweight as one may expect



m  a abedin v  ng and l  khan 2010 cause identification from aviation safety incident reports via weakly supervised semantic lexicon construction volume 38 pages 569631

the aviation safety reporting system collects voluntarily submitted reports on aviation safety incidents to facilitate research work aiming to reduce such incidents to effectively reduce these incidents it is vital to accurately identify why these incidents occurred more precisely given a set of possible causes or shaping factors this task of cause identification involves identifying all and only those shaping factors that are responsible for the incidents described in a report we investigate two approaches to cause identification both approaches exploit information provided by a semantic lexicon which is automatically constructed via thelen and riloffs basilisk framework augmented with our linguistic and algorithmic modifications the first approach labels a report using a simple heuristic which looks for the words and phrases acquired during the semantic lexicon learning process in the report the second approach recasts cause identification as a text classification problem employing supervised and transductive text classification algorithms to learn models from incident reports labeled with shaping factors and using the models to label unseen reports our experiments show that both the heuristicbased approach and the learningbased approach when given sufficient training data outperform the baseline system significantly




g  greco e  malizia l  palopoli and f  scarcello 2010 nontransferable utility coalitional games via mixedinteger linear constraints volume 38 pages 633685

coalitional games serve the purpose of modeling payoff distribution problems in scenarios where agents can collaborate by forming coalitions in order to obtain higher worths than by acting in isolation in the classical transferable utility tu setting coalition worths can be freely distributed amongst agents however in several application scenarios this is not the case and the nontransferable utility setting ntu must be considered where additional applicationoriented constraints are imposed on the possible worth distributions
in this paper an approach to define ntu games is proposed which is based on describing allowed distributions via a set of mixedinteger linear constraints applied to an underlying tu game it is shown that such games allow nontransferable conditions on worth distributions to be specified in a natural and succinct way the properties and the relationships among the most prominent solution concepts for ntu games that hold when they are applied on mixedinteger constrained games are investigated finally a thorough analysis is carried out to assess the impact of issuing constraints on the computational complexity of some of these solution concepts



j  wu and r  givan 2010 automatic induction of bellmanerror features for probabilistic planning volume 38 pages 687755

domainspecific features are important in representing problem structure throughout machine learning and decisiontheoretic planning in planning once state features are provided domainindependent algorithms such as approximate value iteration can learn weighted combinations of those features that often perform well as heuristic estimates of state value eg distance to the goal successful applications in realworld domains often require features crafted by human experts here we propose automatic processes for learning useful domainspecific feature sets with little or no human intervention our methods select and add features that describe statespace regions of high inconsistency in the bellman equation statewise bellman error during approximate value iteration our method can be applied using any realvaluedfeature hypothesis space and corresponding learning method for selecting features from training sets of statevalue pairs we evaluate the method with hypothesis spaces defined by both relational and propositional feature languages using nine probabilistic planning domains we show that approximate value iteration using a relational feature space performs at the stateoftheart in domainindependent stochastic relational planning our method provides the first domainindependent approach that plays tetris successfully without humanengineered features
