<p>Hierarchical latent class (HLC) models are tree-structured Bayesian networks where leaf nodes are observed while internal nodes are latent.  There are no theoretically well justified model selection criteria for HLC models in particular and Bayesian networks with latent nodes in general. Nonetheless, empirical studies suggest that the BIC score is a reasonable criterion to use in practice for learning HLC models.  Empirical studies also suggest that sometimes model selection can be improved if standard model dimension is replaced  with effective model dimension in the penalty term of the BIC score.</p> <p> Effective dimensions are difficult to compute. In this paper, we prove a theorem that relates the effective dimension of an HLC model to the effective dimensions of a number of latent class models.  The theorem makes it computationally feasible to compute the effective dimensions of large HLC models.  The theorem can also be used to compute the effective dimensions of general tree models.</p>

<p>The 2002 Trading Agent Competition (TAC) presented a challenging market game in the domain of travel shopping.  One of the pivotal issues in this domain is uncertainty about hotel prices, which have a significant influence on the relative cost of alternative trip schedules.  Thus, virtually all participants employ some method for predicting hotel prices.  We survey approaches employed in the tournament, finding that agents apply an interesting diversity of techniques, taking into account differing sources of evidence bearing on prices.  Based on data provided by entrants on their agents' actual predictions in the TAC-02 finals and semifinals, we analyze the relative efficacy of these approaches.  The results show that taking into account game-specific information about flight prices is a major distinguishing factor.  Machine learning methods effectively induce the relationship between flight and hotel prices from game data, and a purely analytical approach based on competitive equilibrium analysis achieves equal accuracy with no historical data.  Employing a new measure of prediction quality, we relate absolute accuracy to bottom-line performance in the game.</p>

<p>This paper discusses an interested party who wishes to influence the behavior of agents in a game (multi-agent interaction), which is not under his control. The interested party cannot design a new game, cannot enforce agents' behavior, cannot enforce payments by the agents, and cannot prohibit strategies available to the agents. However, he can influence the outcome of the game by committing to non-negative monetary transfers for the different strategy profiles that may be selected by the agents.  The interested party assumes that agents are rational in the commonly agreed sense that they do not use dominated strategies. Hence, a certain subset of outcomes is implemented in a given game if by adding non-negative payments, rational players will necessarily produce an outcome in this subset. Obviously, by making sufficiently big payments one can implement any desirable outcome. The question is what is the cost of implementation? In this paper we introduce the notion of k-implementation of a desired set of strategy profiles, where k stands for the amount of payment that need to be actually made in order to implement desirable outcomes. A major point in k-implementation is that monetary offers need not necessarily materialize when following desired behaviors.  We define and study k-implementation in the contexts of games with complete and incomplete information. In the latter case we mainly focus on the VCG games. Our setting is later extended to deal with mixed strategies using correlation devices. Together, the paper introduces and studies the implementation of desirable outcomes by a reliable party who cannot modify game rules (i.e. provide protocols), complementing previous work in mechanism design, while making it more applicable to many realistic CS settings.</p>

<p>Two major goals in machine learning are the discovery and improvement of solutions to complex problems.  In this paper, we argue that complexification, i.e. the incremental elaboration of solutions through adding new structure, achieves both these goals.  We demonstrate the power of complexification through the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) method, which evolves increasingly complex neural network architectures.  NEAT is applied to an open-ended coevolutionary robot duel domain where robot controllers compete head to head.  Because the robot duel domain supports a wide range of strategies, and because coevolution benefits from an escalating arms race, it serves as a suitable testbed for studying complexification.  When compared to the evolution of networks with fixed structure, complexifying evolution discovers significantly more sophisticated strategies.  The results suggest that in order to discover and improve complex solutions, evolution, and search in general, should be allowed to complexify as well as optimize.</p>

<p>MAP is the problem of finding a most probable instantiation of a set of variables given evidence. MAP has always been perceived to be significantly harder than the related problems of computing the probability of a variable instantiation Pr, or the problem of computing the most probable explanation (MPE). This paper investigates the complexity of MAP in Bayesian networks. Specifically, we show that MAP is complete for NP^PP and provide further negative complexity results for algorithms based on variable elimination. We also show that MAP remains hard even when MPE and Pr become easy. For example, we show that MAP is NP-complete when the networks are restricted to polytrees, and even then can not be effectively approximated.  Given the difficulty of computing MAP exactly, and the difficulty of approximating MAP while providing useful guarantees on the resulting approximation, we investigate best effort approximations. We introduce a generic MAP approximation framework. We provide two instantiations of the framework; one for networks which are amenable to exact inference Pr, and one for networks for which even exact inference is too hard. This allows MAP approximation on networks that are too complex to even exactly solve the easier problems, Pr and MPE. Experimental results indicate that using these approximation algorithms provides much better solutions than standard techniques, and provide accurate MAP estimates in many cases. </p>

<p>Information about user preferences plays a key role in automated decision making. In many domains it is desirable to assess such preferences in a qualitative rather than quantitative way. In this paper, we propose a qualitative graphical representation of preferences that reflects conditional dependence and independence of preference statements under a ceteris paribus (all else being equal) interpretation. Such a representation is often compact and arguably quite natural in many circumstances. We provide a formal semantics for this model, and describe how the structure of the network can be exploited in several inference tasks, such as determining whether one outcome dominates (is preferred to) another, ordering a set outcomes according to the preference relation, and constructing the best outcome subject to available evidence.</p>

<p>This is the first of three planned papers describing ZAP, a satisfiability engine that substantially generalizes existing tools while retaining the performance characteristics of modern high-performance solvers.  The fundamental idea underlying ZAP is that many problems passed to such engines contain rich internal structure that is obscured by the Boolean representation used; our goal is to define a representation in which this structure is apparent and can easily be exploited to improve computational performance.  This paper is a survey of the work underlying ZAP, and discusses previous attempts to improve the performance of the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland algorithm by exploiting the structure of the problem being solved.  We examine existing ideas including extensions of the Boolean language to allow cardinality constraints, pseudo-Boolean representations, symmetry, and a limited form of quantification.  While this paper is intended as a survey, our research results are contained in the two subsequent articles, with the theoretical structure of ZAP described in the second paper in this series, and ZAP's implementation described in the third.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce an abductive method for a coherent integration of independent data-sources. The idea is to compute a list of data-facts that should be inserted to the amalgamated database or retracted from it in order to restore its consistency. This method is implemented by an abductive solver, called Asystem, that applies SLDNFA-resolution on a meta-theory that relates different, possibly contradicting, input databases. We also give a pure model-theoretic analysis of the possible ways to `recover' consistent data from an inconsistent database in terms of those models of the database that exhibit as minimal inconsistent information as reasonably possible. This allows us to characterize the `recovered databases' in terms of the `preferred' (i.e., most consistent) models of the theory. The outcome is an abductive-based application that is sound and complete with respect to a corresponding model-based, preferential semantics, and -- to the best of our knowledge -- is more expressive (thus more general) than any other implementation of coherent integration of databases.</p>

<p>We  propose  a  formalism  for  representation  of  finite  languages, referred to  as the class of IDL-expressions,  which combines concepts that were  only considered in  isolation in existing  formalisms.  The suggested  applications  are  in  natural  language  processing,  more specifically  in surface  natural language  generation and  in machine translation, where a sentence is  obtained by first generating a large set of candidate sentences, represented  in a compact way, and then by filtering  such a  set  through  a parser.   We  study several  formal properties of IDL-expressions and compare this new formalism with more standard  ones.   We  also  present  a  novel  parsing  algorithm  for IDL-expressions  and  prove a  non-trivial  upper  bound  on its  time complexity.</p>

<p>Non-deductive reasoning systems are often representation dependent: representing the same situation in two different ways may cause such a system to return two different answers.  Some have viewed this as a significant problem.  For example, the principle of maximum entropyhas been subjected to much criticism due to its representation dependence. There has, however, been almost no work investigating representation dependence.  In this paper, we formalize this notion and show that it is not a problem specific to maximum entropy.  In fact, we show that any representation-independent probabilistic inference procedure that ignores irrelevant information is essentially entailment, in a precise sense.  Moreover, we show that representation independence is incompatible with even a weak default assumption of independence.  We then show that invariance under a restricted class of representation changes can form a reasonable compromise between representation independence and other desiderata, and provide a construction of a family of inference procedures that provides such restricted representation independence, using relative entropy.</p>

<p>When writing a constraint program, we have to choose which variables  should be the decision variables, and how to represent the constraints  on these variables. In many cases, there is considerable choice for  the decision variables.  Consider, for example, permutation problems in which we have as many values as variables, and each variable takes  an unique value. In such problems, we can choose between a primal and a dual viewpoint. In the dual viewpoint, each dual variable  represents one of the primal values, whilst each dual value represents one of the primal variables. Alternatively, by means of channelling  constraints to link the primal and dual variables, we can have a  combined model with both sets of variables. In this paper, we perform  an extensive theoretical and empirical study of such primal, dual and  combined models for two classes of problems: permutation problems and  injection problems. Our results show that it often be advantageous to  use multiple viewpoints, and to have constraints which channel between them to maintain consistency. They also illustrate a general  methodology for comparing different constraint models.</p>

<p>Searching for and making decisions about information is becoming increasingly difficult as the amount of information and number of choices increases.  Recommendation systems help users find items of interest of a particular type, such as movies or restaurants, but are still somewhat awkward to use.  Our solution is to take advantage of the complementary strengths of personalized recommendation systems and dialogue systems, creating personalized aides.  We present a  system -- the Adaptive Place Advisor -- that treats item selection as an interactive, conversational process, with the program inquiring about item attributes and the user responding.  Individual, long-term user preferences are unobtrusively obtained in the course of normal recommendation dialogues and used to direct future conversations with the same user.  We present a novel user model that influences both item search and the questions asked during a conversation.

<p>We present a visually-grounded language understanding model based on a study of how people verbally describe objects in scenes. The emphasis of the model is on the combination of individual word meanings to produce meanings for complex referring expressions. The model has been implemented, and it is able to understand a broad range of spatial referring expressions. We describe our implementation of word level visually-grounded semantics and their embedding in a compositional parsing framework. The implemented system selects the correct referents in response to natural language expressions for a large percentage of test cases. In an analysis of the system's successes and failures we reveal how visual context influences the semantics of utterances and propose future extensions to the model that take such context into account.</p>

<p>In recent years, there has been much interest in phase transitions of combinatorial problems.  Phase transitions have been successfully used to analyze combinatorial optimization problems, characterize their typical-case features and locate the hardest problem instances.  In this paper, we study phase transitions of the asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP), an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that has many real-world applications.  Using random instances of up to 1,500 cities in which intercity distances are uniformly distributed, we empirically show that many properties of the problem, including the optimal tour cost and backbone size, experience sharp transitions as the precision of intercity distances increases across a critical value.  Our experimental results on the costs of the ATSP tours and assignment problem agree with the theoretical result that the asymptotic cost of assignment problem is pi ^2 /6 the number of cities goes to infinity.  In addition, we show that the average computational cost of the well-known branch-and-bound subtour elimination algorithm for the problem also exhibits a thrashing behavior, transitioning from easy to difficult as the distance precision increases.  These results answer positively an open question regarding the existence of phase transitions in the ATSP, and provide guidance on how difficult ATSP problem instances should be generated.</p>

<p>The predominant knowledge-based approach to automated model construction, compositional modelling, employs a set of models of particular functional components.  Its inference mechanism takes a scenario describing the constituent interacting components of a system and translates it into a useful mathematical model.  This paper presents a novel compositional modelling approach aimed at building model repositories.  It furthers the field in two respects.  Firstly, it expands the application domain of compositional modelling to systems that can not be easily described in terms of interacting functional components, such as ecological systems.  Secondly, it enables the incorporation of user preferences into the model selection process.  These features are achieved by casting the compositional modelling problem as an activity-based dynamic preference constraint satisfaction problem, where the dynamic constraints describe the restrictions imposed over the composition of partial models and the preferences correspond to those of the user of the automated modeller. In addition, the preference levels are represented through the use of symbolic values that differ in orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>Policies of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) determine the next action to execute from the current state and, possibly, the history (the past states). When the number of states is large, succinct representations are often used to compactly represent both the MDPs and the policies in a reduced amount of space. In this paper, some problems related to the size of succinctly represented policies are analyzed. Namely, it is shown that some MDPs have policies that can only be represented in space super-polynomial in the size of the MDP, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. This fact motivates the study of the problem of deciding whether a given MDP has a policy of a given size and reward. Since some algorithms for MDPs work by finding a succinct representation of the value function, the problem of deciding the existence of a succinct representation of a value function of a given size and reward is also considered.</p>

<p>A novel algorithm for actively trading stocks is presented. While traditional expert advice and ``universal'' algorithms (as well as standard technical trading heuristics) attempt to predict winners or trends, our approach relies on predictable statistical relations between all pairs of stocks in the market. Our empirical results on historical markets provide strong evidence that this type of technical trading can ``beat the market'' and moreover, can beat the best stock in the market. In doing so we utilize a new idea for smoothing critical parameters in the context of expert learning.</p>

<p>With the recent technological feasibility of electronic commerce over the Internet, much attention has been given to the design of electronic markets for various types of electronically-tradable goods. Such markets, however, will normally need to function in some relationship with markets for other related goods, usually those downstream or upstream in the supply chain.  Thus, for example, an electronic market for rubber tires for trucks will likely need to be strongly influenced by the rubber market as well as by the truck market. </p> <p>  In this paper we design protocols for exchange of information between a sequence of markets along a single supply chain.  These protocols allow each of these markets to function separately, while the information exchanged ensures efficient global behavior across the supply chain.  Each market that forms a link in the supply chain operates as a double auction, where the bids on one side of the double auction come from bidders in the corresponding segment of the industry, and the bids on the other side are synthetically generated by the protocol to express the combined information from all other links in the chain.  The double auctions in each of the markets can be of several types, and we study several variants of incentive compatible double auctions, comparing them in terms of their efficiency and of the market revenue.</p>

<p>We address the problem of finding the shortest path between two points in an unknown real physical environment, where a traveling agent must move around in the environment to explore unknown territory.  We introduce the Physical-A* algorithm (PHA*) for solving this problem. PHA* expands all the mandatory nodes that A* would expand and returns the shortest path between the two points.  However, due to the physical nature of the problem, the complexity of the algorithm is measured by the traveling effort of the moving agent and not by the number of generated nodes, as in standard A*.  PHA* is presented as a two-level algorithm, such that its high level, A*, chooses the next node to be expanded and its low level directs the agent to that node in order to explore it.  We present a number of variations for both the high-level and low-level procedures and evaluate their performance theoretically and experimentally.  We show that the travel cost of our best variation is fairly close to the optimal travel cost, assuming that the mandatory nodes of A* are known in advance.  We then generalize our algorithm to the multi-agent case, where a number of cooperative agents are designed to solve the problem.  Specifically, we provide an experimental implementation for such a system.  It should be noted that the problem addressed here is not a navigation problem, but rather a problem of finding the shortest path between two points for future usage.</p>
