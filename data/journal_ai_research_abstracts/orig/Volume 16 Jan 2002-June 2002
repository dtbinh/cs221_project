<p>Fusions are a simple way of combining logics. For normal    modal logics, fusions have been investigated in detail. In particular,    it is known that, under certain conditions, decidability transfers    from the component logics to their fusion.  Though description logics    are closely related to modal logics, they are not necessarily    normal. In addition, ABox reasoning in description logics is not    covered by the results from modal logics. <p>          In this paper, we extend the decidability transfer results from normal    modal logics to a large class of description logics. To cover    different description logics in a uniform way, we introduce abstract    description systems, which can be seen as a common generalization of    description and modal logics, and show the transfer results in this    general setting.</p>

<p>This paper discusses a system that accelerates reinforcement    learning by using transfer from related tasks.  Without such    transfer, even if two tasks are very similar at some abstract level,    an extensive re-learning effort is required.  The system achieves    much of its power by transferring parts of previously learned    solutions rather than a single complete solution. The system    exploits strong features in the multi-dimensional function produced    by reinforcement learning in solving a particular task. These    features are stable and easy to recognize early in the learning    process. They generate a partitioning of the state space and thus    the function.  The partition is represented as a graph.  This is    used to index and compose functions stored in a case base to form a    close approximation to the solution of the new task.  Experiments    demonstrate that function composition often produces more than an    order of magnitude increase in learning rate compared to a basic    reinforcement learning algorithm.</p>

<p>Designing the dialogue policy of a spoken dialogue system    involves many nontrivial choices.  This paper presents a reinforcement    learning approach for automatically optimizing a dialogue policy,    which addresses the technical challenges in applying reinforcement    learning to a working dialogue system with human users.  We report on    the design, construction and empirical evaluation of NJFun, an    experimental spoken dialogue system that provides users with access to    information about fun things to do in New Jersey.  Our results show    that by optimizing its performance via reinforcement learning, NJFun    measurably improves system performance.</p>

<p>Inductive logic programming, or relational learning, is a    powerful paradigm for machine learning or data mining.  However, in    order for ILP to become practically useful, the efficiency of ILP    systems must improve substantially. To this end, the notion of a query    pack is introduced: it structures sets of similar    queries. Furthermore, a mechanism is described for executing such    query packs.  A complexity analysis shows that considerable efficiency    improvements can be achieved through the use of this query pack    execution mechanism. This claim is supported by empirical results    obtained by incorporating support for query pack execution in two    existing learning systems.</p>

<p>Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and partially observable Markov    decision processes (POMDPs) provide useful tools for modeling    dynamical systems.  They are particularly useful for representing the    topology of environments such as road networks and office buildings,    which are typical for robot navigation and planning.  The work    presented here describes a formal framework for incorporating readily    available odometric information and geometrical constraints into both    the models and the algorithm that learns them.  By taking advantage of    such information, learning HMMs/POMDPs can be made to generate better    solutions and require fewer iterations, while being robust in the face    of data reduction.  Experimental results, obtained from both simulated    and real robot data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.</p>

<p>We propose a structured approach to the problem of retrieval    of images by content and present a description logic that has been    devised for the semantic indexing and retrieval of images containing    complex objects.    <p>    As other approaches do, we start from low-level features extracted    with image analysis to detect and characterize regions in an    image. However, in contrast with feature-based approaches, we provide    a syntax to describe segmented regions as basic objects and complex    objects as compositions of basic ones. Then we introduce a companion    extensional semantics for defining reasoning services, such as    retrieval, classification, and subsumption.  These services can be    used for both exact and approximate matching, using similarity    measures.      <p>     Using our logical approach as a formal specification, we implemented a    complete client-server image retrieval system, which allows a user to    pose both queries by sketch and queries by example. A set of    experiments has been carried out on a testbed of images to assess the    retrieval capabilities of the system in comparison with expert users    ranking. Results are presented adopting a well-established measure of    quality borrowed from textual information retrieval.</p>

<p>The recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm is one of the    most well-known algorithms used in adaptive filtering, system    identification and adaptive control. Its popularity is mainly due to    its fast convergence speed, which is considered to be optimal in    practice. In this paper, RLS methods are used to solve reinforcement    learning problems, where two new reinforcement learning algorithms    using linear value function approximators are proposed and    analyzed. The two algorithms are called RLS-TD(lambda) and Fast-AHC    (Fast Adaptive Heuristic Critic), respectively. RLS-TD(lambda) can be    viewed as the extension of RLS-TD(0) from lambda=0 to general lambda    within interval [0,1], so it is a multi-step temporal-difference (TD)    learning algorithm using RLS methods. The convergence with probability    one and the limit of convergence of RLS-TD(lambda) are proved for    ergodic Markov chains. Compared to the existing LS-TD(lambda)    algorithm, RLS-TD(lambda) has advantages in computation and is more    suitable for online learning. The effectiveness of RLS-TD(lambda) is    analyzed and verified by learning prediction experiments of Markov    chains with a wide range of parameter settings.    <p>    The Fast-AHC algorithm is derived by applying the proposed    RLS-TD(lambda) algorithm in the critic network of the adaptive    heuristic critic method. Unlike conventional AHC algorithm, Fast-AHC    makes use of RLS methods to improve the learning-prediction efficiency    in the critic. Learning control experiments of the cart-pole balancing    and the acrobot swing-up problems are conducted to compare the data    efficiency of Fast-AHC with conventional AHC. From the experimental    results, it is shown that the data efficiency of learning control can    also be improved by using RLS methods in the learning-prediction    process of the critic. The performance of Fast-AHC is also compared    with that of the AHC method using LS-TD(lambda). Furthermore, it is    demonstrated in the experiments that different initial values of the    variance matrix in RLS-TD(lambda) are required to get better    performance not only in learning prediction but also in learning    control. The experimental results are analyzed based on the existing    theoretical work on the transient phase of forgetting factor RLS    methods.</p>

<p>Spoken dialogue systems promise efficient and natural access    to a large variety of information sources and services from any phone.    However, current spoken dialogue systems are deficient in their    strategies for preventing, identifying and repairing problems that    arise in the conversation. This paper reports results on automatically    training a Problematic Dialogue Predictor to predict problematic    human-computer dialogues using a corpus of 4692 dialogues collected    with the 'How May I Help You' (SM) spoken dialogue system.  The    Problematic Dialogue Predictor can be immediately applied to the    system's decision of whether to transfer the call to a human customer    care agent, or be used as a cue to the system's dialogue manager to    modify its behavior to repair problems, and even perhaps, to prevent    them. We show that a Problematic Dialogue Predictor using    automatically-obtainable features from the first two exchanges in the    dialogue can predict problematic dialogues 13.2% more accurately than    the baseline.</p>

<p>An approach to the construction of classifiers from    imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the    classification categories are not approximately equally    represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of    ``normal'' examples with only a small percentage of ``abnormal'' or    ``interesting'' examples. It is also the case that the cost of    misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example    is often much higher than the cost of the reverse    error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed    as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the    minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of    over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the    majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in    ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class.  This paper    also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the    minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve    better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss    ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of    over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority    class examples.  Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a    Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under    the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex    hull strategy.</p>

<p>We consider the problem of designing the the utility    functions of the utility-maximizing agents in a multi-agent system so    that they work synergistically to maximize a global utility. The    particular problem domain we explore is the control of network routing    by placing agents on all the routers in the network.  Conventional    approaches to this task have the agents all use the Ideal Shortest    Path routing Algorithm (ISPA).  We demonstrate that in many cases, due    to the side-effects of one agent's actions on another agent's    performance, having agents use ISPA's is suboptimal as far as global    aggregate cost is concerned, even when they are only used to route    infinitesimally small amounts of traffic.  The utility functions of    the individual agents are not ``aligned'' with the global utility,    intuitively speaking.  As a particular example of this we present an    instance of Braess' paradox in which adding new links to a network    whose agents all use the ISPA results in a decrease in overall    throughput. We also demonstrate that load-balancing, in which the    agents' decisions are collectively made to optimize the global cost    incurred by all traffic currently being routed, is suboptimal as far    as global cost averaged across time is concerned. This is also due to    `side-effects', in this case of current routing decision on future    traffic. The mathematics of Collective Intelligence (COIN) is    concerned precisely with the issue of avoiding such deleterious    side-effects in multi-agent systems, both over time and space. We    present key concepts from that mathematics and use them to derive an    algorithm whose ideal version should have better performance than that    of having all agents use the ISPA, even in the infinitesimal limit. We    present experiments verifying this, and also showing that a    machine-learning-based version of this COIN algorithm in which costs    are only imprecisely estimated via empirical means (a version    potentially applicable in the real world) also outperforms the ISPA,    despite having access to less information than does the ISPA. In    particular, this COIN algorithm almost always avoids Braess' paradox.</p>

<p>Despite the significant progress in multiagent teamwork,    existing research does not address the optimality of its prescriptions    nor the complexity of the teamwork problem.  Without a    characterization of the optimality-complexity tradeoffs, it is    impossible to determine whether the assumptions and approximations    made by a particular theory gain enough efficiency to justify the    losses in overall performance.  To provide a tool for use by    multiagent researchers in evaluating this tradeoff, we present a    unified framework, the COMmunicative Multiagent Team Decision Problem    (COM-MTDP).  The COM-MTDP model combines and extends existing    multiagent theories, such as decentralized partially observable Markov    decision processes and economic team theory.  In addition to their    generality of representation, COM-MTDPs also support the analysis of    both the optimality of team performance and the computational    complexity of the agents' decision problem.  In analyzing complexity,    we present a breakdown of the computational complexity of constructing    optimal teams under various classes of problem domains, along the    dimensions of observability and communication cost.  In analyzing    optimality, we exploit the COM-MTDP's ability to encode existing    teamwork theories and models to encode two instantiations of joint    intentions theory taken from the literature.  Furthermore, the    COM-MTDP model provides a basis for the development of novel team    coordination algorithms.  We derive a domain-independent criterion for    optimal communication and provide a comparative analysis of the two    joint intentions instantiations with respect to this optimal policy.    We have implemented a reusable, domain-independent software package    based on COM-MTDPs to analyze teamwork coordination strategies, and we    demonstrate its use by encoding and evaluating the two joint    intentions strategies within an example domain.</p>

<p class="media"><a href="/media/918/live-918-2019-jair.pdf">PDF</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/media/918/live-918-2017-jair.ps">PostScript</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1613/jair.918'>doi:10.1613/jair.918</a></p>
<p>Simple conceptual graphs are considered as the kernel of    most knowledge representation formalisms built upon Sowa's    model. Reasoning in this model can be expressed by a graph    homomorphism called projection, whose semantics is usually given in    terms of positive, conjunctive, existential FOL.  We present here a    family of extensions of this model, based on rules and constraints,    keeping graph homomorphism as the basic operation. We focus on the    formal definitions of the different models obtained, including their    operational semantics and relationships with FOL, and we analyze the    decidability and complexity of the associated problems (consistency    and deduction). As soon as rules are involved in reasonings, these    problems are not decidable, but we exhibit a condition under which    they fall in the polynomial hierarchy.  These results extend and    complete the ones already published by the authors.  Moreover we    systematically study the complexity of some particular cases obtained    by restricting the form of constraints and/or rules.</p>
