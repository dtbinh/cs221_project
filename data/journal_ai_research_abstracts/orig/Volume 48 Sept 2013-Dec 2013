<p>Many natural language processing (NLP) applications require the computation of similarities between pairs of syntactic or semantic trees. Many researchers have used tree edit distance for this task, but this technique suffers from the drawback that it deals with single node operations only. We have extended the standard tree edit distance algorithm to deal with subtree transformation operations as well as single nodes. The extended algorithm with subtree operations, TED+ST, is more effective and flexible than the standard algorithm, especially for applications that pay attention to relations among nodes (e.g. in linguistic trees, deleting a modifier subtree should be cheaper than the sum of deleting its components individually). We describe the use of TED+ST for checking entailment between two Arabic text snippets. The preliminary results of using TED+ST were encouraging when compared with two string-based approaches and with the standard algorithm.</p>

<p>In this paper, learning a Bayesian network structure that optimizes a scoring function for a given dataset is viewed as a shortest path problem in an implicit state-space search graph. This perspective highlights the importance of two research issues: the development of search strategies for solving the shortest path problem, and the design of heuristic functions for guiding the search. This paper introduces several techniques for addressing the issues. One is an A* search algorithm that learns an optimal Bayesian network structure by only searching the most promising part of the solution space. The others are mainly two heuristic functions. The first heuristic function represents a simple relaxation of the acyclicity constraint of a Bayesian network. Although admissible and consistent, the heuristic may introduce too much relaxation and result in a loose bound. The second heuristic function reduces the amount of relaxation by avoiding directed cycles within some groups of variables. Empirical results show that these methods constitute a promising approach to learning optimal Bayesian network structures.</p>

<p>Sequential decision-making problems with multiple objectives arise naturally in practice and pose unique challenges for research in decision-theoretic planning and learning, which has largely focused on single-objective settings. This article surveys algorithms designed for sequential decision-making problems with multiple objectives. Though there is a growing body of literature on this subject, little of it makes explicit under what circumstances special methods are needed to solve multi-objective problems. Therefore, we identify three distinct scenarios in which converting such a problem to a single-objective one is impossible, infeasible, or undesirable. Furthermore, we propose a taxonomy that classifies multi-objective methods according to the applicable scenario, the nature of the scalarization function (which projects multi-objective values to scalar ones), and the type of policies considered. We show how these factors determine the nature of an optimal solution, which can be a single policy, a convex hull, or a Pareto front. Using this taxonomy, we survey the literature on multi-objective methods for planning and learning. Finally, we discuss key applications of such methods and outline opportunities for future work.</p>

<p>The chase algorithm is a fundamental tool for query evaluation and for testing query containment under tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs) and equality-generating dependencies (EGDs).  So far, most of the research on this topic has focused on cases where the chase procedure terminates.  This paper introduces expressive classes of TGDs defined via syntactic restrictions: guarded TGDs (GTGDs) and weakly guarded sets of TGDs (WGTGDs).  For these classes, the chase procedure is not guaranteed to terminate and thus may have an infinite outcome. Nevertheless, we prove that the problems of conjunctive-query answering and query containment under such TGDs are decidable.  We provide decision procedures and tight complexity bounds for these problems.  Then we show how EGDs can be incorporated into our results by providing conditions under which EGDs do not harmfully interact with TGDs and do not affect the decidability and complexity of query answering.  We show applications of the aforesaid classes of constraints to the problem of answering conjunctive queries in F-Logic Lite, an object-oriented ontology language, and in some tractable Description Logics.<br />

<p>We develop an online mechanism for the allocation of an expiring resource to a dynamic agent population. Each agent has a non-increasing marginal valuation function for the resource, and an upper limit on the number of units that can be allocated in any period. We propose two versions on a truthful allocation mechanism. Each modifies the decisions of a greedy online assignment algorithm by sometimes cancelling an allocation of resources. One version makes this modification immediately upon an allocation decision while a second waits until the point at which an agent departs the market. Adopting a prior-free framework, we show that the second approach has better worst-case allocative efficiency and is more scalable. On the other hand, the first approach (with immediate cancellation) may be easier in practice because it does not need to reclaim units previously allocated. We consider an application to recharging plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Using data from a real-world trial of PHEVs in the UK, we demonstrate higher system performance than a fixed price system, performance comparable with a standard, but non-truthful scheduling heuristic, and the ability to support 50% more vehicles at the same fuel cost than a simple randomized policy.</p>

<p>I prove that an implementation technique for scanning lists in backtracking search algorithms is optimal.  The result applies to a simple general framework, which I present: applications include watched literal unit propagation in SAT and a number of examples in constraint satisfaction.  Techniques like watched literals are known to be highly space efficient and effective in practice.  When implemented in the `circular' approach described here,  these techniques also have optimal run time per branch in big-O terms when amortized across a search tree.  This also applies when multiple list elements must be found.  The constant factor overhead of the worst case is only 2.  Replacing the existing non-optimal implementation of unit propagation in MiniSat speeds up propagation by 29%, though this is not enough to improve overall run time significantly.</p>

<cite>I.  Kollia and B.  Glimm (2013) "Optimizing SPARQL Query Answering over OWL Ontologies", Volume 48, pages 253-303</cite>
<p class="media"><a href="/media/3872/live-3872-7402-jair.pdf">PDF</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/media/3872/live-3872-7403-jair.ps">PostScript</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1613/jair.3872'>doi:10.1613/jair.3872</a></p>
<p>The SPARQL query language is currently being extended by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) with so-called entailment regimes. An entailment regime defines how queries are evaluated under more expressive semantics than SPARQL's standard simple entailment, which is based on subgraph matching. The queries are very expressive since variables can occur within complex concepts and can also bind to concept or role names.<br />
<br />
In this paper, we describe a sound and complete algorithm for the OWL Direct Semantics entailment regime. We further propose several novel optimizations such as strategies for determining a good query execution order, query rewriting techniques, and show how specialized OWL reasoning tasks and the concept and role hierarchy can be used to reduce the query execution time. For determining a good execution order, we propose a cost-based model, where the costs are based on information about the instances of concepts and roles that are extracted from a model abstraction built by an OWL reasoner. We present two ordering strategies: a static and a dynamic one. For the dynamic case, we improve the performance by exploiting an individual clustering approach that allows for computing the cost functions based on one individual sample from a cluster.<br />
<br />
We provide a prototypical implementation and evaluate the efficiency of the proposed optimizations. Our experimental study shows that the static ordering usually outperforms the dynamic one when accurate statistics are available. This changes, however, when the statistics are less accurate, e.g., due to nondeterministic reasoning decisions. For queries that go beyond conjunctive instance queries we observe an improvement of up to three orders of magnitude due to the proposed optimizations.</p>

<p>  Concept-to-text generation refers to the task of automatically producing textual output from non-linguistic input. We present a joint model that captures content selection ("what to say") and surface realization ("how to say") in an unsupervised domain-independent fashion.  Rather than breaking up the generation process into a sequence of local decisions, we define a probabilistic context-free grammar that globally describes the inherent structure of the input (a corpus of database records and text describing some of them).  We recast generation as the task of finding the best derivation tree for a set of database records and describe an algorithm for decoding in this framework that allows to intersect the grammar with additional information capturing fluency and syntactic well-formedness constraints. Experimental evaluation on several domains achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art systems that use domain specific constraints, explicit feature engineering or labeled data.</p>

<p>The Beth definability property, a well-known property from classical logic, is investigated in the context of description logics: if a general L-TBox implicitly defines an L-concept in terms of a given signature, where L is a description logic, then does there always exist over this signature an explicit definition in L for the concept? This property has been studied before and used to optimize reasoning in description logics. In this paper a complete classification of Beth definability is provided for extensions of the basic description logic ALC with transitive roles, inverse roles, role hierarchies, and/or functionality restrictions, both on arbitrary and on finite structures. Moreover, we present a tableau-based algorithm which computes explicit definitions of at most double exponential size. This algorithm is optimal because it is also shown that the smallest explicit definition of an implicitly defined concept may be double exponentially long in the size of the input TBox. Finally, if explicit definitions are allowed to be expressed in first-order logic, then we show how to compute them in single exponential time.</p>

<p>Defeasible inheritance networks are a non-monotonic framework that deals with hierarchical knowledge. On the other hand, rational closure is acknowledged as a landmark of the preferential approach to non-monotonic reasoning. We will combine these two approaches and define a new non-monotonic closure operation for propositional knowledge bases that combines the advantages of both. Then we redefine such a procedure for Description Logics (DLs), a family of logics well-suited to model structured information. In both cases we will provide a simple reasoning method that is built on top of the classical entailment relation and, thus, is amenable of an implementation based on existing reasoners. Eventually, we evaluate our approach on well-known landmark test examples.</p>

<p>In classical, AGM-style belief change, it is assumed that the underlying logic contains classical propositional logic. This is clearly a limiting assumption, particularly in Artificial Intelligence. Consequently there has been recent interest in studying belief change in approaches where the full expressivity of classical propositional logic is not obtained. In this paper we investigate belief contraction in Horn knowledge bases. We point out that the obvious extension to the Horn case, involving Horn remainder sets as a starting point, is problematic. Not only do Horn remainder sets have undesirable properties, but also some desirable Horn contraction functions are not captured by this approach. For Horn belief set contraction, we develop an account in terms of a model-theoretic characterisation involving weak remainder sets. Maxichoice and partial meet Horn contraction is specified, and we show that the problems arising with earlier work are resolved by these approaches. As well, constructions of the specific operators and sets of postulates are provided, and representation results are obtained. We also examine Horn package contraction, or contraction by a set of formulas. Again, we give a construction and postulate set, linking them via a representation result. Last, we investigate the closely-related notion of forgetting in Horn clauses. This work is arguably interesting since Horn clauses have found widespread use in AI; as well, the results given here may potentially be extended to other areas which make use of Horn-like reasoning, such as logic programming, rule-based systems, and description logics. Finally, since Horn reasoning is weaker than classical reasoning, this work sheds light on the foundations of belief change</p>

<p>In recent years, Stackelberg Security Games have been successfully applied to solve resource allocation and scheduling problems in several security domains. However, previous work has mostly assumed that the targets are stationary relative to the defender and the attacker, leading to discrete game models with finite numbers of pure strategies. This paper in contrast focuses on protecting mobile targets that leads to a continuous set of strategies for the players. The problem is motivated by several real-world domains including protecting ferries with escort boats and protecting refugee supply lines. Our contributions include: (i) A new game model for multiple mobile defender resources and moving targets with a discretized strategy space for the defender and a continuous strategy space for the attacker. (ii) An efficient linear-programming-based solution that uses a compact representation for the defender's mixed strategy, while accurately modeling the attacker's continuous strategy using a novel sub-interval analysis method. (iii) Discussion and analysis of multiple heuristic methods for equilibrium refinement to improve robustness of defender's mixed strategy. (iv) Discussion of approaches to sample actual defender schedules from the defender's mixed strategy. (iv) Detailed experimental analysis of our algorithms in the ferry protection domain.</p>

<p>In order to meet usability requirements, most logic-based applications provide explanation facilities for reasoning services. This holds also for Description Logics, where research has focused on the explanation of both TBox reasoning and, more recently, query answering. Besides explaining the  presence of a tuple in a query answer, it is important to explain also why a   given tuple is missing. We address the latter problem for instance and  conjunctive query answering over DL-Lite ontologies by adopting abductive  reasoning; that is, we look for additions to the ABox that force a given  tuple to be in the result. As reasoning tasks we consider existence and recognition of an explanation, and relevance and necessity of a given  assertion for an explanation. We characterize the computational complexity of  these problems for arbitrary, subset minimal, and cardinality minimal<br />

<p>We present NaturalOWL, a natural language generation system that produces texts describing individuals or classes of OWL ontologies. Unlike simpler OWL verbalizers, which typically express a single axiom at a time in controlled, often not entirely fluent natural language primarily for the benefit of domain experts, we aim to generate fluent and coherent multi-sentence texts for end-users. With a system like NaturalOWL, one can publish information in OWL on the Web, along with automatically produced corresponding texts in multiple languages, making the information accessible not only to computer programs and domain experts, but also end-users. We discuss the processing stages of NaturalOWL, the optional domain-dependent linguistic resources that the system can use at each stage, and why they are useful. We also present trials showing that when the domain-dependent llinguistic resources are available, NaturalOWL produces significantly better texts compared to a simpler verbalizer, and that the resources can be created with relatively light effort.</p>

<p>This article considers the performance of the MOA* multiobjective search algorithm with heuristic information. It is shown that in certain cases blind search can be more efficient than perfectly informed search, in terms of both node and label expansions.<br />
<br />
A class of simple graph search problems is defined for which the number of nodes grows linearly with problem size and the number of nondominated labels grows quadratically. It is proved that for these problems the number of node expansions performed by blind MOA* grows linearly with problem size, while the number of such expansions performed with a perfectly informed heuristic grows quadratically. It is also proved that the number of label expansions grows quadratically in the blind case and cubically in the informed case.</p>

<p>This article presents a probabilistic sub-tree alignment model and its application to tree-to-tree machine translation. Unlike previous work, we do not resort to surface heuristics or expensive annotated data, but instead derive an unsupervised model to infer the syntactic correspondence between two languages. More importantly, the developed model is syntactically-motivated and does not rely on word alignments. As a by-product, our model outputs a sub-tree alignment matrix encoding a large number of diverse alignments between syntactic structures, from which machine translation systems can efficiently extract translation rules that are often filtered out due to the errors in 1-best alignment. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms three state-of-the-art baseline approaches in both alignment accuracy and grammar quality. When applied to machine translation, our approach yields a +1.0 BLEU improvement and a -0.9 TER reduction on the NIST machine translation evaluation corpora. With tree binarization and fuzzy decoding, it even outperforms a state-of-the-art hierarchical phrase-based system.<br />

<p>For almost two decades, monotonic, or ``delete free,'' relaxation has been one of the key auxiliary tools in the practice of domain-independent deterministic planning. In the particular contexts of both satisficing and optimal planning, it  underlies most state-of-the-art heuristic functions. While satisficing planning for monotonic tasks is polynomial-time, optimal planning for monotonic tasks is NP-equivalent. Here we establish both negative and positive results on the complexity of some wide fragments of optimal monotonic planning, with the fragments being defined around the causal graph topology. Our results shed some light on the link between the complexity of general  optimal planning and the complexity of optimal planning for the respective  monotonic relaxations.</p>

<p>Relational classification on a single connected network has been of particular interest in the machine learning and data mining communities in the last decade or so. This is mainly due to the explosion in popularity of social networking sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Google+ amongst others. In statistical relational learning, many techniques have been developed to address this problem, where we have a connected unweighted homogeneous/heterogeneous graph that is partially labeled and the goal is to propagate the labels to the unlabeled nodes. In this paper, we provide a different perspective by enabling the effective use of graph transduction techniques for this problem. We thus exploit the strengths of this class of methods for relational learning problems. We accomplish this by providing a simple procedure for constructing a weight matrix that serves as input to a rich class of graph transduction techniques. Our procedure has multiple desirable properties. For example, the weights it assigns to edges between unlabeled nodes naturally relate to a measure of association commonly used in statistics, namely the Gamma test statistic. We further portray the efficacy of our approach on synthetic as well as real data, by comparing it with state-of-the-art relational learning algorithms, and graph transduction techniques with an adjacency matrix or a real valued weight matrix computed using available attributes as input. In these experiments we see that our approach consistently outperforms other approaches when the graph is sparsely labeled, and remains competitive with the best when the proportion of known labels increases.</p>

<p>Bayesian planning is a formally elegant approach to learning optimal behaviour under model uncertainty, trading off exploration and exploitation in an ideal way. Unfortunately, planning optimally in the face of uncertainty is notoriously taxing, since the search space is enormous. In this paper we introduce a tractable, sample-based method for approximate Bayes-optimal planning which exploits Monte-Carlo tree search. Our approach avoids expensive applications of Bayes rule within the search tree by sampling models from current beliefs, and furthermore performs this sampling in a lazy manner. This enables it to outperform previous Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning algorithms by a significant margin on several well-known benchmark problems.  As we show, our approach can even work in problems with an infinite state space that lie qualitatively out of reach of almost all previous work in Bayesian exploration.</p>

<p>We study a general framework for query rewriting in the presence of an arbitrary first-order logic ontology over a database signature. The framework supports deciding the existence of a safe-range first-order equivalent reformulation of a query in terms of the database signature, and if so, it provides an effective approach to construct the reformulation based on interpolation using standard theorem proving techniques (e.g., tableau). Since the reformulation is a safe-range formula, it is effectively executable as an SQL query. At the end, we present a non-trivial application of the framework with ontologies in the very expressive ALCHOIQ description logic, by providing effective means to compute safe-range first-order exact reformulations of queries.</p>

<p>We study the phase transition of the coalitional manipulation problem for generalized scoring rules. Previously it has been shown that, under some conditions on the distribution of votes, if the number of manipulators is o(sqrt{n}), where n is the number of voters, then the probability that a random profile is manipulable by the coalition goes to zero as the number of voters goes to infinity, whereas if the number of manipulators is omega(sqrt{n}), then the probability that a random profile is manipulable goes to one. Here we consider the critical window, where a coalition has size c*sqrt{n}, and we show that as c goes from zero to infinity, the limiting probability that a random profile is manipulable goes from zero to one in a smooth fashion, i.e., there is a smooth phase transition between the two regimes. This result analytically validates recent empirical results, and suggests that deciding the coalitional manipulation problem may be of limited computational hardness in practice.</p>

<p>This paper proposes the formalization and implementation of a novel class of constraints aimed at modeling problems related to placement of multi-body systems in the 3-dimensional space. Each multi-body is a system composed of body elements, connected by joint relationships and constrained by geometric properties. The emphasis of this investigation is the use of multi-body systems to model native conformations of protein structures---where each body represents an entity of the protein (e.g., an amino acid, a small peptide) and the geometric constraints are related to the spatial properties of the composing atoms. The paper explores the use of the proposed class of constraints to support a variety of different structural analysis of proteins, such as loop modeling and structure prediction.<br />
<br />
The declarative nature of a constraint-based encoding provides elaboration tolerance and the ability to make use of any additional knowledge in the analysis studies. The filtering capabilities of the proposed constraints also allow to control the number of representative solutions that are withdrawn from the conformational space of the protein, by means of criteria driven by uniform distribution sampling principles. In this scenario it is possible to select the desired degree of precision and/or number of solutions. The filtering component automatically excludes configurations that violate the spatial and geometric properties of the composing multi-body system. The paper illustrates the implementation of a constraint solver based on the multi-body perspective and its empirical evaluation on protein  structure analysis problems.</p>
