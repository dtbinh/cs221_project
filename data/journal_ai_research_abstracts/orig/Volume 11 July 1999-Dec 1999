<p>Planning under uncertainty is a central problem in the study of    automated sequential decision making, and has been addressed by    researchers in many different fields, including AI planning, decision    analysis, operations research, control theory and economics.  While    the assumptions and perspectives adopted in these areas often differ    in substantial ways, many planning problems of interest to researchers    in these fields can be modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs)    and analyzed using the techniques of decision theory. <p>      This paper presents an overview and synthesis of MDP-related methods,    showing how they provide a unifying framework for modeling many    classes of planning problems studied in AI. It also describes    structural properties of MDPs that, when exhibited by particular    classes of problems, can be exploited in the construction of optimal    or approximately optimal policies or plans.  Planning problems    commonly possess structure in the reward and value functions used to    describe performance criteria, in the functions used to describe state    transitions and observations, and in the relationships among features    used to describe states, actions, rewards, and observations. <p>      Specialized representations, and algorithms employing these    representations, can achieve computational leverage by exploiting    these various forms of structure.  Certain AI techniques -- in    particular those based on the use of structured, intensional    representations -- can be viewed in this way.  This paper surveys    several types of representations for both classical and    decision-theoretic planning problems, and planning algorithms that    exploit these representations in a number of different ways to ease    the computational burden of constructing policies or plans.  It focuses    primarily on abstraction, aggregation and decomposition techniques    based on AI-style representations.</p>

<p>This article presents a measure of semantic similarity in an    IS-A taxonomy based on the notion of shared information content.    Experimental evaluation against a benchmark set of human similarity    judgments demonstrates that the measure performs better than the    traditional edge-counting approach.  The article presents algorithms    that take advantage of taxonomic similarity in resolving syntactic and    semantic ambiguity, along with experimental results demonstrating    their effectiveness.</p>

<p>This paper presents a new approach to identifying and    eliminating mislabeled training instances for supervised learning. The    goal of this approach is to improve classification accuracies produced    by learning algorithms by improving the quality of the training data.    Our approach uses a set of learning algorithms to create classifiers    that serve as noise filters for the training data.  We evaluate single    algorithm, majority vote and consensus filters on five datasets that    are prone to labeling errors.  Our experiments illustrate that    filtering significantly improves classification accuracy for noise    levels up to 30 percent.  An analytical and empirical evaluation of    the precision of our approach shows that consensus filters are    conservative at throwing away good data at the expense of retaining    bad data and that majority filters are better at detecting bad data at    the expense of throwing away good data.  This suggests that for    situations in which there is a paucity of data, consensus filters are    preferable, whereas majority vote filters are preferable for    situations with an abundance of data.</p>

<p>An ensemble consists of a set of individually trained    classifiers (such as neural networks or decision trees) whose    predictions are combined when classifying novel instances.  Previous    research has shown that an ensemble is often more accurate than any of    the single classifiers in the ensemble.  Bagging (Breiman, 1996c) and    Boosting (Freund & Shapire, 1996; Shapire, 1990) are two relatively    new but popular methods for producing ensembles.  In this paper we    evaluate these methods on 23 data sets using both neural networks and    decision trees as our classification algorithm.  Our results clearly    indicate a number of conclusions.  First, while Bagging is almost    always more accurate than a single classifier, it is sometimes much    less accurate than Boosting.  On the other hand, Boosting can create    ensembles that are less accurate than a single classifier --    especially when using neural networks.  Analysis indicates that the    performance of the Boosting methods is dependent on the    characteristics of the data set being examined.  In fact, further    results show that Boosting ensembles may overfit noisy data sets, thus    decreasing its performance.  Finally, consistent with previous    studies, our work suggests that most of the gain in an ensemble's    performance comes in the first few classifiers combined; however,    relatively large gains can be seen up to 25 classifiers when Boosting    decision trees.</p>

<p>The notion of class is ubiquitous in computer science and is    central in many formalisms for the representation of structured    knowledge used both in knowledge representation and in databases.  In    this paper we study the basic issues underlying such representation    formalisms and single out both their common characteristics and their    distinguishing features.  Such investigation leads us to propose a    unifying framework in which we are able to capture the fundamental    aspects of several representation languages used in different    contexts.  The proposed formalism is expressed in the style of    description logics, which have been introduced in knowledge    representation as a means to provide a semantically well-founded basis    for the structural aspects of knowledge representation systems. The    description logic considered in this paper is a subset of first order    logic with nice computational characteristics.  It is quite expressive    and features a novel combination of constructs that has not been    studied before.  The distinguishing constructs are number    restrictions, which generalize existence and functional dependencies,    inverse roles, which allow one to refer to the inverse of a    relationship, and possibly cyclic assertions, which are necessary for    capturing real world domains.  We are able to show that it is    precisely such combination of constructs that makes our logic powerful    enough to model the essential set of features for defining class    structures that are common to frame systems, object-oriented database    languages, and semantic data models.  As a consequence of the    established correspondences, several significant extensions of each of    the above formalisms become available. The high expressiveness of the    logic we propose and the need for capturing the reasoning in different    contexts forces us to distinguish between unrestricted and finite    model reasoning.  A notable feature of our proposal is that reasoning    in both cases is decidable.  We argue that, by virtue of the high    expressive power and of the associated reasoning capabilities on both    unrestricted and finite models, our logic provides a common core for    class-based representation formalisms.</p>

<p>There are two distinct approaches to solving reinforcement    learning problems, namely, searching in value function space and    searching in policy space.  Temporal difference methods and    evolutionary algorithms are well-known examples of these approaches.    Kaelbling, Littman and Moore recently provided an informative survey    of temporal difference methods.  This article focuses on the    application of evolutionary algorithms to the reinforcement learning    problem, emphasizing alternative policy representations, credit    assignment methods, and problem-specific genetic operators.  Strengths    and weaknesses of the evolutionary approach to reinforcement learning    are presented, along with a survey of representative applications.</p>

<p>We investigate the problem of reasoning in the propositional    fragment of MBNF, the logic of minimal belief and negation as failure    introduced by Lifschitz, which can be considered as a unifying    framework for several nonmonotonic formalisms, including default    logic, autoepistemic logic, circumscription, epistemic queries, and    logic programming.  We characterize the complexity and provide    algorithms for reasoning in propositional MBNF.  In particular, we    show that entailment in propositional MBNF lies at the third level of    the polynomial hierarchy, hence it is harder than reasoning in all the    above mentioned propositional formalisms for nonmonotonic reasoning.    We also prove the exact correspondence between negation as failure in    MBNF and negative introspection in Moore's autoepistemic logic.</p>

<p>Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) promise to offer solutions to    problems where established, older paradigms fall short. In order to    validate such claims that are repeatedly made in software agent    publications, empirical in-depth studies of advantages and weaknesses    of multi-agent solutions versus conventional ones in practical    applications are needed. Climate control in large buildings is one    application area where multi-agent systems, and market-oriented    programming in particular, have been reported to be very successful,    although central control solutions are still the standard practice.    We have therefore constructed and implemented a variety of market    designs for this problem, as well as different standard control    engineering solutions. This article gives a detailed analysis and    comparison, so as to learn about differences between standard versus    agent approaches, and yielding new insights about benefits and    limitations of computational markets. An important outcome is that    ``local information plus market communication produces global    control''.</p>

<p>In many real-world learning tasks, it is expensive to    acquire a sufficient number of labeled examples for training.  This    paper investigates methods for reducing annotation cost by `sample    selection'. In this approach, during training the learning program    examines many unlabeled examples and selects for labeling only those    that are most informative at each stage. This avoids redundantly    labeling examples that contribute little new information. <p>      Our work follows on previous research on Query By Committee, extending    the committee-based paradigm to the context of probabilistic    classification.  We describe a family of empirical methods for    committee-based sample selection in probabilistic classification    models, which evaluate the informativeness of an example by measuring    the degree of disagreement between several model variants.  These    variants (the committee) are drawn randomly from a probability    distribution conditioned by the training set labeled so far. <p>      The method was applied to the real-world natural language processing    task of stochastic part-of-speech tagging.  We find that all variants    of the method achieve a significant reduction in annotation cost,    although their computational efficiency differs.  In particular, the    simplest variant, a two member committee with no parameters to tune,    gives excellent results.  We also show that sample selection yields a    significant reduction in the size of the model used by the tagger.</p>

<p>In the recent literature of Artificial Intelligence, an    intensive research effort has been spent, for various algebras of    qualitative relations used in the representation of temporal and    spatial knowledge, on the problem of classifying the computational    complexity of reasoning problems for subsets of algebras.  The main    purpose of these researches is to describe a restricted set of maximal    tractable subalgebras, ideally in an exhaustive fashion with respect    to the hosting algebras.    <p>  In this paper we introduce a novel algebra for reasoning about Spatial    Congruence, show that the satisfiability problem in the spatial    algebra MC-4 is NP-complete, and present a complete classification of    tractability in the algebra, based on the individuation of three    maximal tractable subclasses, one containing the basic relations.  The    three algebras are formed by 14, 10 and 9 relations out of 16 which    form the full algebra.</p>

<p>Localization, that is the estimation of a robot's location    from sensor data, is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics.  This    papers presents a version of Markov localization which provides    accurate position estimates and which is tailored towards dynamic    environments. The key idea of Markov localization is to maintain a    probability density over the space of all locations of a robot in its    environment. Our approach represents this space metrically, using a    fine-grained grid to approximate densities.  It is able to globally    localize the robot from scratch and to recover from localization    failures.  It is robust to approximate models of the environment (such    as occupancy grid maps) and noisy sensors (such as ultrasound    sensors).  Our approach also includes a filtering technique which    allows a mobile robot to reliably estimate its position even in    densely populated environments in which crowds of people block the    robot's sensors for extended periods of time.  The method described    here has been implemented and tested in several real-world    applications of mobile robots, including the deployments of two mobile    robots as interactive museum tour-guides.</p>
