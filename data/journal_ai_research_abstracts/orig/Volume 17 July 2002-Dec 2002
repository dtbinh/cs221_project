<p>Recent trends in planning research have led to empirical     comparison becoming commonplace. The field has started to settle into    a methodology for such comparisons, which for obvious practical    reasons requires running a subset of planners on a subset of    problems.  In this paper, we characterize the methodology and    examine eight implicit assumptions about the problems, planners and    metrics used in many of these comparisons. The problem assumptions    are: PR1) the performance of a general purpose planner should not be    penalized/biased if executed on a sampling of problems and domains,    PR2) minor syntactic differences in representation do not affect    performance, and PR3) problems should be solvable by STRIPS capable    planners unless they require ADL. The planner assumptions are: PL1)    the latest version of a planner is the best one to use, PL2) default    parameter settings approximate good performance, and PL3) time    cut-offs do not unduly bias outcome. The metrics assumptions are:    M1) performance degrades similarly for each planner when run on    degraded runtime environments (e.g., machine platform) and M2) the    number of plan steps distinguishes performance. We find that most of    these assumptions are not supported empirically; in particular, that    planners are affected differently by these assumptions. We conclude    with a call to the community to devote research resources to    improving the state of the practice and especially to enhancing the    available benchmark problems.</p>

<p>The problem of organizing information for multidocument    summarization so that the generated summary is coherent has received    relatively little attention.  While sentence ordering for single    document summarization can be determined from the ordering of    sentences in the input article, this is not the case for multidocument    summarization where summary sentences may be drawn from different    input articles. In this paper, we propose a methodology for studying    the properties of ordering information in the news genre and describe    experiments done on a corpus of multiple acceptable orderings we    developed for the task. Based on these experiments, we implemented a    strategy for ordering information that combines constraints from    chronological order of events and topical relatedness.  Evaluation of    our augmented algorithm shows a significant improvement of the    ordering over two baseline strategies.</p>

<p>We present a propositional logic to reason about the uncertainty of events, where the uncertainty is modeled by a set of probability measures assigning an interval of probability to each event. We give a sound and complete axiomatization for the logic, and show that the satisfiability problem is NP-complete, no harder than satisfiability for propositional logic.</p>

<p>Recent years are seeing an increasing need for on-line    monitoring of teams of cooperating agents, e.g., for visualization, or    performance tracking. However, in monitoring deployed teams, we often    cannot rely on the agents to always communicate their state to the    monitoring system. This paper presents a non-intrusive approach to    monitoring by 'overhearing', where the monitored team's state is    inferred (via plan-recognition) from team-members' *routine*    communications, exchanged as part of their coordinated task execution,    and observed (overheard) by the monitoring system. Key challenges in    this approach include the demanding run-time requirements of    monitoring, the scarceness of observations (increasing monitoring    uncertainty), and the need to scale-up monitoring to address    potentially large teams. To address these, we present a set of    complementary novel techniques, exploiting knowledge of the social    structures and procedures in the monitored team: (i) an efficient    probabilistic plan-recognition algorithm, well-suited for processing    communications as observations; (ii) an approach to exploiting    knowledge of the team's social behavior to predict future observations    during execution (reducing monitoring uncertainty); and (iii)    monitoring algorithms that trade expressivity for scalability,    representing only certain useful monitoring hypotheses, but allowing    for any number of agents and their different activities to be    represented in a single coherent entity. We present an empirical    evaluation of these techniques, in combination and apart, in    monitoring a deployed team of agents, running on machines physically    distributed across the country, and engaged in complex, dynamic task    execution. We also compare the performance of these techniques to    human expert and novice monitors, and show that the techniques    presented are capable of monitoring at human-expert levels, despite    the difficulty of the task.</p>

<p>Recent advances in the study of voting classification    algorithms have brought empirical and theoretical results clearly    showing the discrimination power of ensemble classifiers. It has been    previously argued that the search of this classification power in the    design of the algorithms has marginalized the need to obtain    interpretable classifiers. Therefore, the question of whether one    might have to dispense with interpretability in order to keep    classification strength is being raised in a growing number of machine    learning or data mining papers. The purpose of this paper is to study    both theoretically and empirically the problem. First, we provide    numerous results giving insight into the hardness of the    simplicity-accuracy tradeoff for voting classifiers. Then we provide    an efficient ``top-down and prune'' induction heuristic, WIDC, mainly    derived from recent results on the weak learning and boosting    frameworks.  It is to our knowledge the first attempt to build a    voting classifier as a base formula using the weak learning framework    (the one which was previously highly successful for decision tree    induction), and not the strong learning framework (as usual for such    classifiers with boosting-like approaches). While it uses a well-known    induction scheme previously successful in other classes of concept    representations, thus making it easy to implement and compare, WIDC    also relies on recent or new results we give about particular cases of    boosting known as partition boosting and ranking loss    boosting. Experimental results on thirty-one domains, most of which    readily available, tend to display the ability of WIDC to produce    small, accurate, and interpretable decision committees.</p>

<p>Adjustable autonomy refers to entities dynamically varying    their own autonomy, transferring decision-making control to other    entities (typically agents transferring control to human users) in key    situations.  Determining whether and when such transfers-of-control    should occur is arguably the fundamental research problem in    adjustable autonomy. Previous work has investigated various approaches    to addressing this problem but has often focused on individual    agent-human interactions.  Unfortunately, domains requiring    collaboration between teams of agents and humans reveal two key    shortcomings of these previous approaches. First, these approaches use    rigid one-shot transfers of control that can result in unacceptable    coordination failures in multiagent settings.  Second, they ignore    costs (e.g., in terms of time delays or effects on actions) to an    agent's team due to such transfers-of-control.     <p>To remedy these problems, this article presents a novel approach to    adjustable autonomy, based on the notion of a transfer-of-control    strategy.  A transfer-of-control strategy consists of a conditional    sequence of two types of actions: (i) actions to transfer    decision-making control (e.g., from an agent to a user or vice versa)    and (ii) actions to change an agent's pre-specified coordination    constraints with team members, aimed at minimizing miscoordination    costs. The goal is for high-quality individual decisions to be made    with minimal disruption to the coordination of the team.  We present a    mathematical model of transfer-of-control strategies. The model guides    and informs the operationalization of the strategies using Markov    Decision Processes, which select an optimal strategy, given an    uncertain environment and costs to the individuals and teams. The    approach has been carefully evaluated, including via its use in a    real-world, deployed multi-agent system that assists a research group    in its daily activities.</p>

<p>We propose a perspective on knowledge compilation which    calls for analyzing different compilation approaches according to two    key dimensions: the succinctness of the target compilation language,    and the class of queries and transformations that the language    supports in polytime. We then provide a knowledge compilation map,    which analyzes a large number of existing target compilation languages    according to their succinctness and their polytime transformations and    queries. We argue that such analysis is necessary for placing new    compilation approaches within the context of existing ones. We also go    beyond classical, flat target compilation languages based on CNF and    DNF, and consider a richer, nested class based on directed acyclic    graphs (such as OBDDs), which we show to include a relatively large    number of target compilation languages.</p>

<p>Common wisdom has it that small distinctions in the    probabilities (parameters) quantifying a belief network do not matter    much for the results of probabilistic queries. Yet, one can develop    realistic scenarios under which small variations in network parameters    can lead to significant changes in computed queries. A pending    theoretical question is then to analytically characterize parameter    changes that do or do not matter. In this paper, we study the    sensitivity of probabilistic queries to changes in network parameters    and prove some tight bounds on the impact that such parameters can    have on queries. Our analytic results pinpoint some interesting    situations under which parameter changes do or do not matter. These    results are important for knowledge engineers as they help them    identify influential network parameters. They also help explain some    of the previous experimental results and observations with regards to    network robustness against parameter changes.</p>

<p>Is there a general model that can predict the perceived    phrase structure in language and music? While it is usually assumed    that humans have separate faculties for language and music, this work    focuses on the commonalities rather than on the differences between    these modalities, aiming at finding a deeper 'faculty'. Our key idea    is that the perceptual system strives for the simplest structure (the    'simplicity principle'), but in doing so it is biased by the    likelihood of previous structures (the 'likelihood principle'). We    present a series of data-oriented parsing (DOP) models that combine    these two principles and that are tested on the Penn Treebank and the    Essen Folksong Collection. Our experiments show that (1) a combination    of the two principles outperforms the use of either of them, and (2)    exactly the same model with the same parameter setting achieves    maximum accuracy for both language and music. We argue that our    results suggest an interesting parallel between linguistic and musical    structuring.</p>

<p>In this paper, we analyze the decision version of the NK    landscape model from the perspective of threshold phenomena and phase    transitions under two random distributions, the uniform probability    model and the fixed ratio model. For the uniform probability model, we    prove that the phase transition is easy in the sense that there is a    polynomial algorithm that can solve a random instance of the problem    with the probability asymptotic to 1 as the problem size tends to    infinity. For the fixed ratio model, we establish several upper bounds    for the solubility threshold, and prove that random instances with    parameters above these upper bounds can be solved polynomially. This,    together with our empirical study for random instances generated below    and in the phase transition region, suggests that the phase transition    of the fixed ratio model is also easy.</p>

<p>This paper presents a new classifier combination    technique based on the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. The    Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is a powerful method for    combining measures of evidence from different classifiers. However,    since each of the available methods that estimates the evidence of    classifiers has its own limitations, we propose here a new    implementation which adapts to training data so that the overall    mean square error is minimized. The proposed technique is shown to    outperform most available classifier combination methods when    tested on three different classification problems.</p>

<p>Much work in AI deals with the selection of proper actions    in a given (known or unknown) environment. However, the way to select    a proper action when facing other agents is quite unclear. Most work    in AI adopts classical game-theoretic equilibrium analysis to predict    agent behavior in such settings. This approach however does not    provide us with any guarantee for the agent. In this paper we    introduce competitive safety analysis. This approach bridges the gap    between the desired normative AI approach, where a strategy should be    selected in order to guarantee a desired payoff, and equilibrium    analysis.  We show that a safety level strategy is able to guarantee    the value obtained in a Nash equilibrium, in several classical    computer science settings.  Then, we discuss the concept of    competitive safety strategies, and illustrate its use in a    decentralized load balancing setting, typical to network problems. In    particular, we show that when we have many agents, it is possible to    guarantee an expected payoff which is a factor of 8/9 of the payoff    obtained in a Nash equilibrium.  Our discussion of competitive safety    analysis for decentralized load balancing is further developed to deal    with many communication links and arbitrary speeds.  Finally, we    discuss the extension of the above concepts to Bayesian games, and    illustrate their use in a basic auctions setup.</p>

<p>We develop, analyze, and evaluate a novel, supervised,    specific-to-general learner for a simple temporal logic and use the    resulting algorithm to learn visual event definitions from video    sequences.  First, we introduce a simple, propositional, temporal,    event-description language called AMA that is sufficiently expressive    to represent many events yet sufficiently restrictive to support    learning.  We then give algorithms, along with lower and upper    complexity bounds, for the subsumption and generalization problems for    AMA formulas. We present a positive-examples--only specific-to-general    learning method based on these algorithms. We also present a    polynomial-time--computable ``syntactic'' subsumption test that    implies semantic subsumption without being equivalent to it. A    generalization algorithm based on syntactic subsumption can be used in    place of semantic generalization to improve the asymptotic complexity    of the resulting learning algorithm. Finally, we apply this algorithm    to the task of learning relational event definitions from video and    show that it yields definitions that are competitive with hand-coded    ones.</p>

<p>In this paper, we present a method for recognising an    agent's behaviour in dynamic, noisy, uncertain domains, and across    multiple levels of abstraction.  We term this problem on-line plan    recognition under uncertainty and view it generally as probabilistic    inference on the stochastic process representing the execution of the    agent's plan. Our contributions in this paper are twofold.  In terms    of probabilistic inference, we introduce the Abstract Hidden Markov    Model (AHMM), a novel type of stochastic processes, provide its    dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) structure and analyse the properties of    this network.  We then describe an application of the    Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filter to the AHMM which allows us to    construct an efficient, hybrid inference method for this model.  In    terms of plan recognition, we propose a novel plan recognition    framework based on the AHMM as the plan execution model.  The    Rao-Blackwellised hybrid inference for AHMM can take advantage of the    independence properties inherent in a model of plan execution, leading    to an algorithm for online probabilistic plan recognition that scales    well with the number of levels in the plan hierarchy.  This    illustrates that while stochastic models for plan execution can be    complex, they exhibit special structures which, if exploited, can lead    to efficient plan recognition algorithms.  We demonstrate the    usefulness of the AHMM framework via a behaviour recognition system in    a complex spatial environment using distributed video surveillance    data.</p>

<p>This paper presents an approach to expert-guided subgroup    discovery.  The main step of the subgroup discovery process, the    induction of subgroup descriptions, is performed by a heuristic beam    search algorithm, using a novel parametrized definition of rule    quality which is analyzed in detail.  The other important steps of the    proposed subgroup discovery process are the detection of statistically    significant properties of selected subgroups and subgroup    visualization: statistically significant properties are used to enrich    the descriptions of induced subgroups, while the visualization shows    subgroup properties in the form of distributions of the numbers of    examples in the subgroups. The approach is illustrated by the results    obtained for a medical problem of early detection of patient risk    groups.</p>
