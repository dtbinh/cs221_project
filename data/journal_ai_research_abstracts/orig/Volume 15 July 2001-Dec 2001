<p>We present a novel approach to goal recognition based on a    two-stage paradigm of graph construction and analysis. First, a graph    structure called a Goal Graph is constructed to represent the observed    actions, the state of the world, and the achieved goals as well as    various connections between these nodes at consecutive time    steps. Then, the Goal Graph is analysed at each time step to recognise    those partially or fully achieved goals that are consistent with the    actions observed so far. The Goal Graph analysis also reveals valid    plans for the recognised goals or part of these goals.</p>        <p>Our approach to goal recognition does not need a plan library.  It    does not suffer from the problems in the acquisition and hand-coding    of large plan libraries, neither does it have the problems in    searching the plan space of exponential size. We describe two    algorithms for Goal Graph construction and analysis in this    paradigm. These algorithms are both provably sound, polynomial-time,    and polynomial-space. The number of goals recognised by our algorithms    is usually very small after a sequence of observed actions has been    processed. Thus the sequence of observed actions is well explained by    the recognised goals with little ambiguity. We have evaluated these    algorithms in the UNIX domain, in which excellent performance has been    achieved in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.</p>

<p>This paper presents an implemented system for recognizing    the occurrence of events described by simple spatial-motion verbs in    short image sequences. The semantics of these verbs is specified with    event-logic expressions that describe changes in the state of    force-dynamic relations between the participants of the event.  An    efficient finite representation is introduced for the infinite sets of    intervals that occur when describing liquid and semi-liquid events.    Additionally, an efficient procedure using this representation is    presented for inferring occurrences of compound events, described with    event-logic expressions, from occurrences of primitive events.  Using    force dynamics and event logic to specify the lexical semantics of    events allows the system to be more robust than prior systems based on    motion profile.</p>

<p>The chief aim of this paper is to propose mean-field    approximations for a broad class of Belief networks, of which sigmoid    and noisy-or networks can be seen as special cases.  The     approximations are based on a powerful mean-field theory suggested by    Plefka.  We show that Saul, Jaakkola and Jordan' s approach is the    first order approximation in Plefka's approach, via a variational    derivation.  The application of Plefka's theory to belief networks is    not computationally tractable.  To tackle this problem we propose new    approximations based on Taylor series.  Small scale experiments show    that the proposed schemes are attractive.</p>

<p>This paper presents GRT, a domain-independent heuristic    planning system for STRIPS worlds. GRT solves problems in two    phases. In the pre-processing phase, it estimates the distance between    each fact and the goals of the problem, in a backward direction. Then,    in the search phase, these estimates are used in order to further    estimate the distance between each intermediate state and the goals,    guiding so the search process in a forward direction and on a    best-first basis. The paper presents the benefits from the adoption of    opposite directions between the preprocessing and the search phases,    discusses some difficulties that arise in the pre-processing phase and    introduces techniques to cope with them. Moreover, it presents several    methods of improving the efficiency of the heuristic, by enriching the    representation and by reducing the size of the problem. Finally, a    method of overcoming local optimal states, based on domain axioms, is    proposed. According to it, difficult problems are decomposed into    easier sub-problems that have to be solved sequentially. The    performance results from various domains, including those of the    recent planning competitions, show that GRT is among the fastest    planners.</p>

<p>Top-down induction of decision trees has been observed to    suffer from the inadequate functioning of the pruning phase.  In    particular, it is known that the size of the resulting tree grows    linearly with the sample size, even though the accuracy of the tree    does not improve.  Reduced Error Pruning is an algorithm that has been    used as a representative technique in attempts to explain the problems    of decision tree learning.      <p>In this paper we present analyses of Reduced Error Pruning in three    different settings.  First we study the basic algorithmic properties    of the method, properties that hold independent of the input decision    tree and pruning examples.  Then we examine a situation that    intuitively should lead to the subtree under consideration to be    replaced by a leaf node, one in which the class label and attribute    values of the pruning examples are independent of each other.  This    analysis is conducted under two different assumptions.  The general    analysis shows that the pruning probability of a node fitting pure    noise is bounded by a function that decreases exponentially as the    size of the tree grows.  In a specific analysis we assume that the    examples are distributed uniformly to the tree.  This assumption lets    us approximate the number of subtrees that are pruned because they do    not receive any pruning examples.      <p>This paper clarifies the different variants of the Reduced Error    Pruning algorithm, brings new insight to its algorithmic properties,    analyses the algorithm with less imposed assumptions than before, and    includes the previously overlooked empty subtrees to the analysis.</p>

<p>The First Trading Agent Competition (TAC) was held from June    22nd to July 8th, 2000.  TAC was designed to create a benchmark    problem in the complex domain of e-marketplaces and to motivate    researchers to apply unique approaches to a common task.  This article    describes ATTac-2000, the first-place finisher in TAC.  ATTac-2000    uses a principled bidding strategy that includes several elements of    adaptivity.  In addition to the success at the competition, isolated    empirical results are presented indicating the robustness and    effectiveness of ATTac-2000's adaptive strategy.</p>

<p>Domain-independent planning is a hard combinatorial    problem. Taking into account plan quality makes the task even more    difficult. This article introduces Planning by Rewriting (PbR), a new    paradigm for efficient high-quality domain-independent planning. PbR    exploits declarative plan-rewriting rules and efficient local search    techniques to transform an easy-to-generate, but possibly suboptimal,    initial plan into a high-quality plan. In addition to addressing the    issues of planning efficiency and plan quality, this framework offers    a new anytime planning algorithm. We have implemented this planner and    applied it to several existing domains. The experimental results show    that the PbR approach provides significant savings in planning effort    while generating high-quality plans.</p>

<p>This paper presents an algorithm for identifying noun-phrase    antecedents of pronouns and adjectival anaphors in Spanish    dialogues. We believe that anaphora resolution requires numerous    sources of information in order to find the correct antecedent of the    anaphor. These sources can be of different kinds, e.g., linguistic    information, discourse/dialogue structure information, or topic    information. For this reason, our algorithm uses various different    kinds of information (hybrid information). The algorithm is based on    linguistic constraints and preferences and uses an anaphoric    accessibility space within which the algorithm finds the noun    phrase. We present some experiments related to this algorithm and this    space using a corpus of 204 dialogues. The algorithm is implemented in    Prolog. According to this study, 95.9% of antecedents were located in    the proposed space, a precision of 81.3% was obtained for pronominal    anaphora resolution, and 81.5% for adjectival anaphora.</p>

<p>The theoretical properties of qualitative spatial reasoning    in the RCC8 framework have been analyzed extensively. However, no    empirical investigation has been made yet. Our experiments show that    the adaption of the algorithms used for qualitative temporal reasoning    can solve large RCC8 instances, even if they are in the phase    transition region -- provided that one uses the maximal tractable    subsets of RCC8 that have been identified by us. In particular, we    demonstrate that the orthogonal combination of heuristic methods is    successful in solving almost all apparently hard instances in the    phase transition region up to a certain size in reasonable time.</p>

<p>Gradient-based approaches to direct policy search in    reinforcement learning have received much recent attention as a means    to solve problems of partial observability and to avoid some of the    problems associated with policy degradation in value-function methods.    In this paper we introduce GPOMDP, a simulation-based algorithm for    generating a biased estimate of the gradient of the average reward in    Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes POMDPs controlled by    parameterized stochastic policies. A similar algorithm was proposed by    (Kimura et al. 1995). The algorithm's chief advantages are that it    requires storage of only twice the number of policy parameters, uses    one free beta (which has a natural interpretation in terms of    bias-variance trade-off), and requires no knowledge of the underlying    state. We prove convergence of GPOMDP, and show how the correct choice    of the parameter beta is related to the mixing time of the    controlled POMDP. We briefly describe extensions of GPOMDP to    controlled Markov chains, continuous state, observation and control    spaces, multiple-agents, higher-order derivatives, and a version for    training stochastic policies with internal states.  In a companion    paper (Baxter et al., this volume) we show how the gradient estimates    generated by GPOMDP can be used in both a traditional stochastic    gradient algorithm and a conjugate-gradient procedure to find local    optima of the average reward.</p>

<p>In this paper, we present algorithms that perform gradient    ascent of the average reward in a partially observable Markov decision    process (POMDP).  These algorithms are based on GPOMDP, an algorithm    introduced in a companion paper (Baxter & Bartlett, this volume),    which computes biased estimates of the performance gradient in POMDPs.    The algorithm's chief advantages are that it uses only one free    parameter beta, which has a natural interpretation in terms of    bias-variance trade-off, it requires no knowledge of the underlying    state, and it can be applied to infinite state, control and    observation spaces.  We show how the gradient estimates produced by    GPOMDP can be used to perform gradient ascent, both with a traditional    stochastic-gradient algorithm, and with an algorithm based on    conjugate-gradients that utilizes gradient information to bracket    maxima in line searches. Experimental results are presented    illustrating both the theoretical results of (Baxter & Bartlett, this    volume) on a toy problem, and practical aspects of the algorithms on a    number of more realistic problems.</p>

<p>I consider the problem of learning an optimal path graphical    model from data and show the problem to be NP-hard for the maximum    likelihood and minimum description length approaches and a Bayesian    approach. This hardness result holds despite the fact that the problem    is a restriction of the polynomially solvable problem of finding the    optimal tree graphical model.</p>

<p>We propose a logical/mathematical framework for statistical    parameter learning of parameterized logic programs, i.e.  definite    clause programs containing probabilistic facts with a parameterized    distribution.  It extends the traditional least Herbrand model    semantics in logic programming to distribution semantics, possible    world semantics with a probability distribution which is    unconditionally applicable to arbitrary logic programs including ones    for HMMs, PCFGs and Bayesian networks. <p>       We also propose a new EM algorithm, the graphical EM algorithm, that    runs for a class of parameterized logic programs representing    sequential decision processes where each decision is exclusive and    independent.  It runs on a new data structure called support graphs    describing the logical relationship between observations and their    explanations, and learns parameters by computing inside and outside    probability generalized for logic programs. <p>          The complexity analysis shows that when combined with OLDT search for    all explanations for observations, the graphical EM algorithm, despite    its generality, has the same time complexity as existing EM    algorithms, i.e. the Baum-Welch algorithm for HMMs, the Inside-Outside    algorithm for PCFGs, and the one for singly connected Bayesian    networks that have been developed independently in each research    field.  Learning experiments with PCFGs using two corpora of moderate    size indicate that the graphical EM algorithm can significantly    outperform the Inside-Outside algorithm.</p>
