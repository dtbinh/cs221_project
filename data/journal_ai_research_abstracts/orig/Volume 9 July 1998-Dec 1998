<p>We examine the computational complexity of testing and    finding small plans in probabilistic planning domains with both flat    and propositional representations.  The complexity of plan evaluation    and existence varies with the plan type sought; we examine totally    ordered plans, acyclic plans, and looping plans, and partially ordered    plans under three natural definitions of plan value.  We show that    problems of interest are complete for a variety of complexity classes:    PL, P, NP, co-NP, PP, NP^PP, co-NP^PP, and PSPACE.  In the process of    proving that certain planning problems are complete for NP^PP, we    introduce a new basic NP^PP-complete problem, E-MAJSAT, which    generalizes the standard Boolean satisfiability problem to    computations involving probabilistic quantities; our results suggest    that the development of good heuristics for E-MAJSAT could be    important for the creation of efficient algorithms for a wide variety    of problems.</p>

<p>It is common to view programs as a combination of logic and    control: the logic part defines what the program must do, the control    part -- how to do it.  The Logic Programming paradigm was developed    with the intention of separating the logic from the control.    Recently, extensive research has been conducted on automatic    generation of control for logic programs.  Only a few of these works    considered the issue of automatic generation of control for improving    the efficiency of logic programs.  In this paper we present a novel    algorithm for automatic finding of lowest-cost subgoal orderings.  The    algorithm works using the divide-and-conquer strategy.  The given set    of subgoals is partitioned into smaller sets, based on co-occurrence    of free variables. The subsets are ordered recursively and merged,    yielding a provably optimal order.  We experimentally demonstrate the    utility of the algorithm by testing it in several domains, and discuss    the possibilities of its cooperation with other existing methods.</p>

<p>This article studies the problem of modifying the action    ordering of a plan in order to optimise the plan according to various    criteria.  One of these criteria is to make a plan less constrained    and the other is to minimize its parallel execution time.  Three    candidate definitions are proposed for the first of these criteria,    constituting a sequence of increasing optimality guarantees.  Two of    these are based on deordering plans, which means that ordering    relations may only be removed, not added, while the third one uses    reordering, where arbitrary modifications to the ordering are allowed.    It is shown that only the weakest one of the three criteria is    tractable to achieve, the other two being NP-hard and even difficult    to approximate.  Similarly, optimising the parallel execution time of    a plan is studied both for deordering and reordering of plans.  In the    general case, both of these computations are NP-hard.  However, it is    shown that optimal deorderings can be computed in polynomial time for    a class of planning languages based on the notions of producers,    consumers and threats, which includes most of the commonly used    planning languages.  Computing optimal reorderings can potentially    lead to even faster parallel executions, but this problem remains    NP-hard and difficult to approximate even under quite severe restrictions.</p>

<p>Many of the artificial intelligence techniques developed to    date rely on heuristic search through large spaces.  Unfortunately,    the size of these spaces and the corresponding computational effort    reduce the applicability of otherwise novel and effective algorithms.    A number of parallel and distributed approaches to search have    considerably improved the performance of the search process. <p>       Our goal is to develop an architecture that automatically selects    parallel search strategies for optimal performance on a variety of    search problems.  In this paper we describe one such architecture    realized in the Eureka system, which combines the benefits of    many different approaches to parallel heuristic search.  Through    empirical and theoretical analyses we observe that features of the    problem space directly affect the choice of optimal parallel search    strategy.  We then employ machine learning techniques to select the    optimal parallel search strategy for a given problem space.  When a    new search task is input to the system, Eureka uses features    describing the search space and the chosen architecture to    automatically select the appropriate search strategy.  Eureka    has been tested on a MIMD parallel processor, a distributed network of    workstations, and a single workstation using multithreading.  Results    generated from fifteen puzzle problems, robot arm motion problems,    artificial search spaces, and planning problems indicate that     Eureka outperforms any of the tested strategies used exclusively for    all problem instances and is able to greatly reduce the search time    for these applications.</p>

<p>This paper presents a general and efficient framework for    probabilistic inference and learning from arbitrary uncertain    information. It exploits the calculation properties of finite mixture    models, conjugate families and factorization. Both the joint    probability density of the variables and the likelihood function of    the (objective or subjective) observation are approximated by a    special mixture model, in such a way that any desired conditional    distribution can be directly obtained without numerical    integration. We have developed an extended version of the expectation    maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of mixture    models from uncertain training examples (indirect observations). As a    consequence, any piece of exact or uncertain information about both    input and output values is consistently handled in the inference and    learning stages. This ability, extremely useful in certain situations,    is not found in most alternative methods. The proposed framework is    formally justified from standard probabilistic principles and    illustrative examples are provided in the fields of nonparametric    pattern classification, nonlinear regression and pattern    completion. Finally, experiments on a real application and comparative    results over standard databases provide empirical evidence of the    utility of the method in a wide range of applications.</p>

<p>Using an improved backtrack algorithm with sophisticated    pruning techniques, we revise previous observations correlating a high    frequency of hard to solve Hamiltonian Cycle instances with the Gn,m    phase transition between Hamiltonicity and non-Hamiltonicity. Instead    all tested graphs of 100 to 1500 vertices are easily solved.    <p>   When we artificially restrict the degree sequence with a bounded    maximum degree, although there is some increase in difficulty, the    frequency of hard graphs is still low.  When we consider more regular    graphs based on a generalization of knight's tours, we observe    frequent instances of really hard graphs, but on these the average    degree is bounded by a constant.  We design a set of graphs with a    feature our algorithm is unable to detect and so are very hard for our    algorithm, but in these we can vary the average degree from O(1) to    O(n).  We have so far found no class of graphs correlated with the    Gn,m phase transition which asymptotically produces a high frequency    of hard instances.</p>

<p>Scheduling dialogs, during which people negotiate the    times of appointments, are common in everyday life.  This paper    reports the results of an in-depth empirical investigation of    resolving explicit temporal references in scheduling dialogs.  There    are four phases of this work: data annotation and evaluation, model    development, system implementation and evaluation, and model    evaluation and analysis.  The system and model were developed    primarily on one set of data, and then applied later to a much more    complex data set, to assess the generalizability of the model for the    task being performed.  Many different types of empirical methods are    applied to pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of the approach.    Detailed annotation instructions were developed and an intercoder    reliability study was performed, showing that naive annotators can    reliably perform the targeted annotations.  A fully automatic system    has been developed and evaluated on unseen test data, with good    results on both data sets.  We adopt a pure realization of a    recency-based focus model to identify precisely when it is and is not    adequate for the task being addressed.  In addition to system results,    an in-depth evaluation of the model itself is presented, based on    detailed manual annotations.  The results are that few errors occur    specifically due to the model of focus being used, and the set of    anaphoric relations defined in the model are low in ambiguity for both    data sets.</p>

<p>We present a new approach to path planning, called the    ``Ariadne's clew algorithm''. It is designed to find paths in    high-dimensional continuous spaces and applies to robots with many    degrees of freedom in static, as well as dynamic environments --- ones    where obstacles may move. The Ariadne's clew algorithm comprises two    sub-algorithms, called SEARCH and EXPLORE, applied in an interleaved    manner. EXPLORE builds a representation of the accessible space while    SEARCH looks for the target. Both are posed as optimization problems.    We describe a real implementation of the algorithm to plan paths for a    six degrees of freedom arm in a dynamic environment where another six    degrees of freedom arm is used as a moving obstacle. Experimental    results show that a path is found in about one second without any    pre-processing.</p>

<p>This paper introduces AntNet, a novel approach to the    adaptive learning of routing tables in communications networks.    AntNet is a distributed, mobile agents based Monte Carlo system that    was inspired by recent work on the ant colony metaphor for solving    optimization problems. AntNet's agents concurrently explore the    network and exchange collected information.  The communication among    the agents is indirect and asynchronous, mediated by the network    itself. This form of communication is typical of social insects and is    called stigmergy.  We compare our algorithm with six state-of-the-art    routing algorithms coming from the telecommunications and machine    learning fields.  The algorithms' performance is evaluated over a set    of realistic testbeds.  We run many experiments over real and    artificial IP datagram networks with increasing number of nodes and    under several paradigmatic spatial and temporal traffic distributions.    Results are very encouraging.  AntNet showed superior performance    under all the experimental conditions with respect to its competitors.    We analyze the main characteristics of the algorithm and try to    explain the reasons for its superiority.</p>

<p>As planning is applied to larger and richer domains the    effort involved in constructing domain descriptions increases and    becomes a significant burden on the human application designer. If    general planners are to be applied successfully to large and complex    domains it is necessary to provide the domain designer with some    assistance in building correctly encoded domains.  One way of doing    this is to provide domain-independent techniques for extracting, from    a domain description, knowledge that is implicit in that description    and that can assist domain designers in debugging domain    descriptions. This knowledge can also be exploited to improve the    performance of planners: several researchers have explored the    potential of state invariants in speeding up the performance of    domain-independent planners. In this paper we describe a process by    which state invariants can be extracted from the automatically    inferred type structure of a domain. These techniques are being    developed for exploitation by STAN, a Graphplan based planner that    employs state analysis techniques to enhance its performance.</p>

<p>In default reasoning, usually not all possible ways of    resolving conflicts between default rules are acceptable.  Criteria    expressing acceptable ways of resolving the conflicts may be hardwired    in the inference mechanism, for example specificity in inheritance    reasoning can be handled this way, or they may be given abstractly as    an ordering on the default rules.  In this article we investigate    formalizations of the latter approach in Reiter's default logic.  Our    goal is to analyze and compare the computational properties of three    such formalizations in terms of their computational complexity: the    prioritized default logics of Baader and Hollunder, and Brewka, and a    prioritized default logic that is based on lexicographic comparison.    The analysis locates the propositional variants of these logics on the    second and third levels of the polynomial hierarchy, and identifies    the boundary between tractable and intractable inference for    restricted classes of prioritized default theories.</p>

<p>A class of interval-based temporal languages for uniformly    representing and reasoning about actions and plans is presented.    Actions are represented by describing what is true while the action    itself is occurring, and plans are constructed by temporally relating    actions and world states.  The temporal languages are members of the    family of Description Logics, which are characterized by high    expressivity combined with good computational properties.  The    subsumption problem for a class of temporal Description Logics is    investigated and sound and complete decision procedures are given. The    basic language TL-F is considered first: it is the composition of a    temporal logic TL -- able to express interval temporal networks --    together with the non-temporal logic F -- a Feature Description Logic.    It is proven that subsumption in this language is an NP-complete    problem. Then it is shown how to reason with the more expressive    languages TLU-FU and TL-ALCF. The former adds disjunction both at the    temporal and non-temporal sides of the language, the latter extends    the non-temporal side with set-valued features (i.e., roles) and a    propositionally complete language.</p>
