<p>Distributional semantic models derive computational representations of word meaning from the patterns of co-occurrence of words in text. Such models have been a success story of computational linguistics, being able to provide reliable estimates of semantic relatedness for the many semantic tasks requiring them. However, distributional models extract meaning information exclusively from text, which is an extremely impoverished basis compared to the rich perceptual sources that ground human semantic knowledge. We address the lack of perceptual grounding of distributional models by exploiting computer vision techniques that automatically identify discrete “visual words” in images, so that the distributional representation of a word can be extended to also encompass its co-occurrence with the visual words of images it is associated with. We propose a flexible architecture to integrate text- and image-based distributional information, and we show in a set of empirical tests that our integrated model is superior to the purely text-based approach, and it provides somewhat complementary semantic information with respect to the latter.</p>

<p>Many real life problems that can be solved by constraint programming, come from uncertain and dynamic environments. Because of the dynamism, the original problem may change over time, and thus the solution found for the original problem may become invalid. For this reason, dealing with such problems has become an important issue in the fields of constraint programming. In some cases, there exist extant knowledge about the uncertain and dynamic environment. In other cases, this information is fragmentary or unknown. In this paper, we extend the concept of robustness and stability for Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) with ordered domains, where only limited assumptions need to be made as to possible changes. We present a search algorithm that searches for both robust and stable solutions for CSPs of this nature. It is well-known that meeting both criteria simultaneously is a desirable objective for constraint solving in uncertain and dynamic environments. We also present compelling evidence that our search algorithm outperforms other general-purpose algorithms for dynamic CSPs using random instances and benchmarks derived from real life problems.</p>

<p>Properties like logical closure and consistency are  important properties in any logical reasoning system. Caminada and Amgoud showed that not every logic-based argument system satisfies these relevant properties. But under  conditions like closure under contraposition or transposition of the monotonic part of the underlying logic, ASPIC-like systems satisfy these properties. In contrast, the logical closure and  consistency properties are not well-understood for other  well-known and widely applied systems like logic programming or assumption based argumentation. Though conditions like closure under contraposition or transposition seem intuitive in ASPIC-like systems, they  rule out many sensible ASPIC-like systems that satisfy both properties of closure and consistency.  <br />
<br />
We present a new condition referred to as the self-contradiction axiom that guarantees the consistency property  in both ASPIC-like and assumption-based systems and is implied by both properties of closure under  contraposition or transposition. We develop a logic-associated abstract argumentation framework, by associating abstract argumentation with abstract logics to represent  the conclusions of arguments. We show that logic-associated abstract argumentation frameworks  capture  ASPIC-like systems (without preferences) and assumption-based argumentation. We present two simple and natural properties of  compactness and cohesion in  logic-associated abstract argumentation frameworks and show that they capture  the logical closure and consistency properties. We demonstrate that  in both  assumption-based argumentation and ASPIC-like systems,  cohesion  follows naturally from the self-contradiction axiom. We further give a translation from ASPIC-like systems (without preferences) into equivalent assumption-based systems that keeps the self-contradiction axiom invariant.  </p>

<p>We consider the problem of learning in repeated games against arbitrary associates.  Specifically, we study the ability of expert algorithms to quickly learn effective strategies in repeated games, towards the ultimate goal of learning near-optimal behavior against any arbitrary associate within only a handful of interactions.  Our contribution is three-fold.  First, we advocate a new metric, called disappointment, for evaluating expert algorithms in repeated games.  Unlike minimizing traditional notions of regret, minimizing disappointment in repeated games is equivalent to maximizing payoffs.  Unfortunately, eliminating disappointment is impossible to guarantee in general.  However, it is possible for an expert algorithm to quickly achieve low disappointment against many known classes of algorithms in many games.  Second, we show that popular existing expert algorithms often fail to achieve low disappointment against a variety of associates, particularly in early rounds of the game.  Finally, we describe a new meta-algorithm that can be applied to existing expert algorithms to substantially reduce disappointment in many two-player repeated games when associates follow various static, reinforcement learning, and expert algorithms.<br />

<p>We show how game-theoretic solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium, correlated equilibrium, rationalizability, and sequential equilibrium can be given a uniform definition in terms of a knowledge-based program with counterfactual semantics. In a precise sense, this program can be viewed as providing a procedural characterization of rationality.<br />

<p>A general game player is a system that can play previously unknown games just by being given their rules. For this purpose, the Game Description Language (GDL) has been developed as a high-level knowledge representation formalism to communicate game rules to players. In this paper, we address a fundamental limitation of state-of-the-art methods and systems for General Game Playing, namely, their being confined to deterministic games with complete information about the game state. We develop a simple yet expressive extension of standard GDL that allows for formalising the rules of arbitrary finite, n-player games with randomness and incomplete state knowledge. In the second part of the paper, we address the intricate reasoning challenge for general game-playing systems that comes with the new description language. We develop a full embedding of extended GDL into the Situation Calculus augmented by Scherl and Levesque's knowledge fluent. We formally prove that this provides a sound and complete reasoning method for players' knowledge about game states as well as about the knowledge of the other players.</p>

<p>We introduce a new measure of the discrepancy in strategic games between the social welfare in a Nash equilibrium and in a social optimum, that we call selfishness level. It is the smallest fraction of the social welfare that needs to be offered to each player to achieve that a social optimum is realized in a pure Nash equilibrium. The selfishness level is unrelated to the price of stability and the price of anarchy and is invariant under positive linear transformations of the payoff functions. Also, it naturally applies to other solution concepts and other forms of games.<br />
<br />
We study the selfishness level of several well-known strategic games. This allows us to quantify the implicit tension within a game between players' individual interests and the impact of their decisions on the society as a whole. Our analyses reveal that the selfishness level often provides a deeper understanding of the characteristics of the underlying game that influence the players' willingness to cooperate.<br />
<br />
In particular, the selfishness level of finite ordinal potential games is finite, while that of weakly acyclic games can be infinite.  We derive explicit bounds on the selfishness level of fair cost sharing games and linear congestion games, which depend on specific parameters of the underlying game but are independent of the number of players.  Further, we show that the selfishness level of the $n$-players Prisoner's Dilemma is c/(b(n-1)-c), where b and c are the benefit and cost for cooperation, respectively,  that of the n-players public goods game is (1-c/n)/(c-1), where c is the public good multiplier, and that of the Traveler's Dilemma game is (b-1)/2, where b is the bonus. Finally, the selfishness level of Cournot competition (an example of an infinite ordinal potential game), Tragedy of the Commons, and Bertrand competition is infinite.</p>

<p>Ranking measures play an important role in model evaluation and selection. Using both synthetic and real-world data sets, we investigate how different types and levels of noise affect the area under the ROC curve (AUC), the area under the ROC convex hull, the scored AUC, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, and the H-measure. In our experiments, the AUC was, overall, the most robust among these measures, thereby reinvigorating it as a reliable metric despite its well-known deficiencies. This paper also introduces a novel ranking measure, which is remarkably robust to noise yet conceptually simple.</p>

<p>HEX-programs extend logic programs under the answer set semantics with external computations through external atoms. As reasoning from ground Horn programs with nonmonotonic external atoms of polynomial complexity is already on the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, minimality checking of answer set candidates needs special attention. To this end, we present an approach based on unfounded sets as a generalization of related techniques for ASP programs. The unfounded set detection is expressed as a propositional SAT problem, for which we provide two different encodings and optimizations to them. We then integrate our approach into a previously developed evaluation framework for HEX-programs, which is enriched by additional learning techniques that aim at avoiding the reconstruction of the same or related unfounded sets. Furthermore, we provide a syntactic criterion that allows one to skip the minimality check in many cases. An experimental evaluation shows that the new approach significantly decreases runtime.</p>

<p>We analyze symmetric protocols to rationally coordinate on an asymmetric, efficient allocation in an infinitely repeated N-agent, C-resource allocation problems, where the resources are all homogeneous. Bhaskar proposed one way to achieve this in 2-agent, 1-resource games: Agents start by symmetrically randomizing their actions, and as soon as they each choose different actions, they start to follow a potentially asymmetric "convention" that prescribes their actions from then on. We extend the concept of convention to the general case of infinitely repeated resource allocation games with N agents and C resources. We show that for any convention, there exists a symmetric subgame-perfect equilibrium which implements it. We present two conventions: bourgeois, where agents stick to the first allocation; and market, where agents pay for the use of resources, and observe a global coordination signal which allows them to alternate between different allocations. We define price of anonymity of a convention as a ratio between the maximum social payoff of any (asymmetric) strategy profile and the expected social payoff of the subgame-perfect equilibrium which implements the convention. We show that while the price of anonymity of the bourgeois convention is infinite, the market convention decreases this price by reducing the conflict between the agents.</p>

<p>	The idea of "only knowing" a collection of sentences, as proposed by Levesque, has been previously shown to be very useful in characterizing knowledge-based agents: in terms of a specification, a precise and perspicuous account of the beliefs and non-beliefs is obtained in a monotonic setting. Levesque's logic is based on a first-order modal language with quantifying-in, thus allowing for de re versus de dicto distinctions, among other things. However, the logic and its recent dynamic extension  only deal with the case of a single agent. In this work, we propose a first-order multiagent framework with knowledge, actions, sensing and only knowing, that is shown to inherit all  the features of the single agent version. Most significantly, we prove reduction theorems by means of which reasoning about knowledge and actions in the framework simplifies to non-epistemic, non-dynamic reasoning about the initial situation. </p>

<p>Mechanism design is considered in the context of fair allocations of indivisible goods with monetary compensation, by focusing on problems where agents' declarations on allocated goods can be verified before payments are performed. A setting is considered where verification might be subject to errors, so that payments have to be awarded under the presumption of innocence, as incorrect declared values do not necessarily mean manipulation attempts by the agents. Within this setting, a mechanism is designed that is shown to be truthful, efficient, and budget-balanced. Moreover, agents' utilities are fairly determined by the Shapley value of suitable coalitional games, and enjoy highly desirable properties such as equal treatment of equals, envy-freeness, and a stronger one called individual-optimality. In particular, the latter property guarantees that, for every agent, her/his utility is the maximum possible one over any alternative optimal allocation. <br />
<br />
The computational complexity of the proposed mechanism is also studied. It turns out that it is #P-complete so that, to deal with applications with many agents involved, two polynomial-time randomized variants are also proposed: one that is still truthful and efficient, and which is approximately budget-balanced with high probability, and another one that is truthful in expectation, while still budget-balanced and efficient.</p>

<p>Geographical location is vital to geospatial applications like local search and event detection. In this paper, we investigate and improve on the task of text-based geolocation prediction of Twitter users. Previous studies on this topic have typically assumed that geographical references (e.g., gazetteer terms, dialectal words) in a text are indicative of its author’s location. However, these references are often buried in informal, ungrammatical, and multilingual data, and are therefore non-trivial to identify and exploit. We present an integrated geolocation prediction framework and investigate what factors impact on prediction accuracy. First, we evaluate a range of feature selection methods to obtain “location indicative words”. We then evaluate the impact of non-geotagged tweets, language, and user-declared metadata on geolocation prediction. In addition, we evaluate the impact of temporal variance on model generalisation, and discuss how users differ in terms of their geolocatability.<br />
<br />
We achieve state-of-the-art results for the text-based Twitter user geolocation task, and also provide the most extensive exploration of the task to date. Our findings provide valuable insights into the design of robust, practical text-based geolocation prediction systems.</p>

<p>Multi-view learning aims to improve classification performance by leveraging the consistency among different views of data. The incorporation of multiple views was paid little attention in the studies of domain adaptation, where the view consistency based on source data is largely violated in the target domain due to the distribution gap between different domain data. In this paper, we leverage multiple views for cross-domain document classification. The central idea is to strengthen the views' consistency on target data by identifying the associations of domain-specific features from different domains. We present an Information-theoretic Multi-view Adaptation Model (IMAM) using a multi-way clustering scheme, where word and link clusters can draw together seemingly unrelated features across domains, which boosts the consistency between document clusterings that are based on the respective word and link views. Moreover, we demonstrate that IMAM can always find the document clustering with the minimal disagreement rate to the overlap of view-based clusterings. We provide both theoretical and empirical justifications of the proposed method. Our experiments show that IMAM significantly outperforms traditional multi-view algorithm co-training, the co-training-based adaptation algorithm CODA, the single-view transfer model CoCC and the large-margin-based multi-view transfer model MVTL-LM.</p>

<p>This paper presents a new method, Minimax Tree Optimization (MMTO), to learn a heuristic evaluation function of a practical alpha-beta search program. The evaluation function may be a linear or non-linear combination of weighted features, and the weights are the parameters to be optimized. To control the search results so that the move decisions agree with the game records of human experts, a well-modeled objective function to be minimized is designed. Moreover, a numerical iterative method is used to nd local minima of the objective function, and more than forty million parameters are adjusted by using a small number of hyper parameters. This method was applied to shogi, a major variant of chess in which the evaluation function must handle a larger state space than in chess. Experimental results show that the large-scale optimization of the evaluation function improves the playing strength of shogi programs, and the new method performs signicantly better than other methods. Implementation of the new method in our shogi program Bonanza made substantial contributions to the program's rst-place nish in the 2013 World Computer Shogi Championship. Additionally, we present preliminary evidence of broader applicability of our method to other two-player games such as chess.</p>

<p>Graphical models, such as Bayesian Networks and Markov networks play an important role in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Inference is a central problem to be solved on these networks. This, and other problems on these graph models are often known to be hard to solve in general, but tractable on graphs with bounded Treewidth. Therefore, finding or approximating the Treewidth of a graph is a fundamental problem related to inference in graphical models. In this paper, we study the approximability of a number of graph problems:   Treewidth and Pathwidth of graphs, Minimum Fill-In, One-Shot Black (and Black-White) pebbling costs of directed acyclic graphs, and a variety of different graph layout problems such as Minimum Cut Linear Arrangement and Interval Graph Completion.  We show that, assuming  the recently introduced Small Set Expansion Conjecture, all of these  problems are NP-hard to approximate to within any constant factor in polynomial time.</p>

<p>When making decisions under uncertainty, the optimal choices are often difficult to discern, especially if not enough information has been gathered. Two key questions in this regard relate to whether one should stop the information gathering process and commit to a decision (stopping criterion), and if not, what information to gather next (selection criterion). In this paper, we show that the recently introduced notion, Same-Decision Probability (SDP), can be useful as both a stopping and a selection criterion, as it can provide additional insight and allow for robust decision making in a variety of scenarios. This query has been shown to be highly intractable, being PP^PP-complete, and is exemplary of a class of queries which correspond to the computation of certain expectations. We propose the first exact algorithm for computing the SDP, and demonstrate its effectiveness on several real and synthetic networks. Finally, we present new complexity results, such as the complexity of computing the SDP on models with a Naive Bayes structure.  Additionally, we prove that computing  the non-myopic value of information is complete for the  same complexity class as computing the SDP.</p>

<p>A Dung argumentation framework (AF) is a pair (A,R): A is a set of abstract arguments and R &#8838; A&#215;A is a binary relation, so-called the attack relation, for capturing the conflicting arguments. Labeling based algorithms for enumerating extensions (i.e. sets of acceptable arguments) have been set out such that arguments (i.e. elements of A) are the only subject for labeling. In this paper we present implemented algorithms for listing extensions by labeling attacks (i.e. elements of R) along with arguments. Specifically, these algorithms are concerned with enumerating all extensions of an AF under a number of argumentation semantics: preferred, stable, complete, semi stable, stage, ideal and grounded. Our algorithms have impact, in particular, on enumerating extensions of AF-extended models that allow attacks on attacks. To demonstrate this impact, we instantiate our algorithms for an example of such models: namely argumentation frameworks with recursive attacks (AFRA), thereby we end up with unified algorithms that enumerate extensions of any AF/AFRA.</p>

<p>This paper studies the relationship between resolution and conflict driven clause learning (CDCL) without restarts, and refutes some conjectured possible separations.  We prove that the guarded, xor-ified pebbling tautology clauses, which Urquhart proved are hard for regular resolution, as well as the guarded graph tautology clauses of Alekhnovich, Johannsen, Pitassi, and Urquhart have polynomial size pool resolution refutations that use only input lemmas as learned clauses.  For the latter set of clauses, we extend this to prove that a CDCL search without restarts can refute these clauses in polynomial time, provided it makes the right choices for decision literals and clause learning.  This holds even if the CDCL search is required to greedily process conflicts arising from unit propagation. This refutes the conjecture that the guarded graph tautology clauses or the guarded xor-ified pebbling tautology clauses can be used to separate CDCL without restarts from general resolution.  Together with subsequent results by Buss and Kolodziejczyk, this means we lack any good conjectures about how to establish the exact logical strength of conflict-driven clause learning without restarts.</p>

<p>This paper presents a reinforcement learning algorithm for solving infinite horizon Markov Decision Processes under the expected total discounted reward criterion when both the state and action spaces are continuous.  This algorithm is based on Watkins' Q-learning, but uses Nadaraya-Watson kernel smoothing to generalize knowledge to unvisited states.  As expected, continuity conditions must be imposed on the mean rewards and transition probabilities.  Using results from kernel regression theory, this algorithm is proven capable of producing a Q-value function estimate that is uniformly within an arbitrary tolerance of the true Q-value function with probability one.  The algorithm is then applied to an example problem to empirically show convergence as well. </p>

<p>In recent years, the task of automatically linking pieces of text (anchors)  mentioned in a document to Wikipedia articles that represent the meaning of these anchors has received extensive research attention. Typically, link-to-Wikipedia systems try to find a set of Wikipedia articles that are candidates to represent the meaning of the anchor and, later, rank these candidates to select the most appropriate one. In this ranking process the systems rely on context information obtained from the document where the anchor is mentioned and/or from Wikipedia. In this paper we center our attention in the use of Wikipedia links as context information. In particular, we offer a review of several candidate ranking approaches in the state-of-the-art that rely on Wikipedia link information. In addition, we provide a comparative empirical evaluation of the different approaches on five different corpora: the TAC 2010 corpus and four corpora built from actual  Wikipedia articles and news items.</p>
