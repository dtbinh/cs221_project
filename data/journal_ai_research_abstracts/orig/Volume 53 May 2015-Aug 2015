<p>We propose Coactive Learning as a model of interaction between a learning system and a human user, where both have the common goal of providing results of maximum utility to the user. Interactions in the Coactive Learning model take the following form: at each step, the system (e.g. search engine) receives a context (e.g. query) and predicts an object (e.g. ranking); the user responds by correcting the system if necessary, providing a slightly improved but not necessarily optimal object as feedback. We argue that such preference feedback can be inferred in large quantity from observable user behavior (e.g., clicks in web search), unlike the optimal feedback required in the expert model or the cardinal valuations required for bandit learning. Despite the relaxed requirements for the feedback, we show that it is possible to adapt many existing online learning algorithms to the coactive framework. In particular, we provide algorithms that achieve square root regret in terms of cardinal utility, even though the learning algorithm never observes cardinal utility values directly. We also provide an algorithm with logarithmic regret in the case of strongly convex loss functions. An extensive empirical study demonstrates the applicability of our model and algorithms on a movie recommendation task, as well as ranking for web search.</p>

<p>Event models obtained automatically from video can be used in applications ranging from abnormal event detection to content based video retrieval. When multiple agents are involved in the events, characterizing events naturally suggests encoding interactions as relations. Learning event models from this kind of relational spatio-temporal data using relational learning techniques such as Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) hold promise, but have not been successfully applied to very large datasets which result from video data. In this paper, we present a novel framework REMIND (Relational Event Model INDuction) for supervised relational learning of event models from large video datasets using ILP. Efficiency is achieved through the learning from interpretations setting and using a typing system that exploits the type hierarchy of objects in a domain. The use of types also helps prevent over generalization. Furthermore, we also present a type-refining operator and prove that it is optimal. The learned models can be used for recognizing events from previously unseen videos. We also present an extension to the framework by integrating an abduction step that improves the learning performance when there is noise in the input data. The experimental results on several hours of video data from two challenging real world domains (an airport domain and a physical action verbs domain) suggest that the techniques are suitable to real world scenarios.</p>

<p>The article introduces a ceteris paribus modal logic, called CP, interpreted on the equivalence classes induced by finite sets of propositional atoms. This logic is studied and then used to embed three logics of strategic interaction, namely atemporal STIT, the coalition logic of propositional control (CL&#8722;PC) and the starless fragment of the dynamic logic of propositional assignments (DL&#8722;PA). The embeddings highlight a common ceteris paribus structure underpinning the key operators of all these apparently very different logics and show, we argue, remarkable similarities behind some of the most influential formalisms for reasoning about strategic interaction</p>

<p>The famous archetypical NP-complete problem of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and its PSPACE-complete generalization of quantified Boolean satisfiability (QSAT) have become central declarative programming paradigms through which real-world instances of various computationally hard problems can be efficiently solved. This success has been achieved through several breakthroughs in practical implementations of decision procedures for SAT and QSAT, that is, in SAT and QSAT solvers. Here, simplification techniques for conjunctive normal form (CNF) for SAT and for prenex conjunctive normal form (PCNF) for QSAT---the standard input formats of SAT and QSAT solvers---have recently proven very effective in increasing solver efficiency when applied before (i.e., in preprocessing) or during (i.e., in inprocessing) satisfiability search.<br />
<br />
In this article, we develop and analyze clause elimination procedures for pre- and inprocessing. Clause elimination procedures form a family of (P)CNF formula simplification techniques which remove clauses that have specific (in practice polynomial-time) redundancy properties while maintaining the satisfiability status of the formulas. Extending known procedures such as tautology, subsumption, and blocked clause elimination, we introduce novel elimination procedures based on asymmetric variants of these techniques, and also develop a novel family of so-called covered clause elimination procedures, as well as natural liftings of the CNF-level procedures to PCNF. We analyze the considered clause elimination procedures from various perspectives. Furthermore, for the variants not preserving logical equivalence under clause elimination, we show how to reconstruct solutions to original CNFs from satisfying assignments to simplified CNFs, which is important for practical applications for the procedures. Complementing the more theoretical analysis, we present results on an empirical evaluation on the practical importance of the clause elimination procedures in terms of the effect on solver runtimes on standard real-world application benchmarks. It turns out that the importance of applying the clause elimination procedures developed in this work is empirically emphasized in the context of state-of-the-art QSAT solving.</p>

<p>This paper explores the use of general-purpose machine translation (MT) in assisting the users of computer-aided translation (CAT) systems based on translation memory (TM) to identify the target words in the translation proposals that need to be changed (either replaced or removed) or kept unedited, a task we term as "word-keeping recommendation". MT is used as a black box to align source and target sub-segments on the fly in the translation units (TUs) suggested to the user. Source-language (SL) and target-language (TL) segments in the matching TUs are segmented into overlapping sub-segments of variable length and machine-translated into the TL and the SL, respectively. The bilingual sub-segments obtained and the matching between the SL segment in the TU and the segment to be translated are employed to build the features that are then used by a binary classifier to determine the target words to be changed and those to be kept unedited. In this approach, MT results are never presented to the translator. Two approaches are presented in this work: one using a word-keeping recommendation system which can be trained on the TM used with the CAT system, and a more basic approach which does not require any training.<br />
<br />
Experiments are conducted by simulating the translation of texts in several language pairs with corpora belonging to different domains and using three different MT systems. We compare the performance obtained to that of previous works that have used statistical word alignment for word-keeping recommendation, and show that the MT-based approaches presented in this paper are more accurate in most scenarios. In particular, our results confirm that the MT-based approaches are better than the alignment-based approach when using models trained on out-of-domain TMs. Additional experiments were performed to check how dependent the MT-based recommender is on the language pair and MT system used for training. These experiments confirm a high degree of reusability of the recommendation models across various MT systems, but a low level of reusability across language pairs.</p>

<p>Decentralized POMDPs provide an expressive framework for multiagent sequential decision making. However, the complexity of these models---NEXP-Complete even for two agents---has limited their scalability. We present a promising new class of approximation algorithms by developing novel connections between multiagent planning and machine learning. We show how the multiagent planning problem can be reformulated as inference in a mixture of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). This planning-as-inference approach paves the way for the application of efficient inference techniques in DBNs to multiagent decision making. To further improve scalability, we identify certain conditions that are sufficient to extend the approach to multiagent systems with dozens of agents. Specifically, we show that the necessary inference within the expectation-maximization framework can be decomposed into processes that often involve a small subset of agents, thereby facilitating scalability. We further show that a number of existing multiagent planning models satisfy these conditions. Experiments on large planning benchmarks confirm the benefits of our approach in terms of runtime and scalability with respect to existing techniques.</p>

<p>We investigate model theoretic properties of XPath with data (in)equality tests over the class of data trees, i.e., the class of trees where each node contains a label from a finite alphabet and a data value from an infinite domain.<br />
<br />
We provide notions of (bi)simulations for XPpath logics containing the child, parent, ancestor and descendant axes to navigate the tree.  We show that these notions precisely characterize the equivalence relation associated with each logic. We study formula complexity measures consisting of the number of nested axes and nested subformulas in a formula; these notions are akin to the notion of quantifier rank in first-order logic. We show characterization results for fine grained notions of equivalence and (bi)simulation that take into account these complexity measures. We also prove that positive fragments of these logics correspond to the formulas preserved under (non-symmetric) simulations. We show that the logic including the child axis is equivalent to the fragment of first-order logic invariant under the corresponding notion of bisimulation. If upward navigation is allowed the characterization fails but a weaker result can still be established. These results hold both over the class of possibly infinite data trees and over the class of finite data trees.<br />
<br />
Besides their intrinsic theoretical value, we argue that bi-simulations are useful tools to prove (non)expressivity results for the logics studied here, and we substantiate this claim with examples.<br />

<p>Conjunctive regular path queries are an expressive extension of the well-known class of conjunctive queries. Such queries have been extensively studied in the (graph) database community, since they support a controlled form of recursion and enable sophisticated path navigation. Somewhat surprisingly, there has been little work aimed at using such queries in the context of description logic (DL) knowledge bases, particularly for the lightweight DLs that are considered best suited for data-intensive applications. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing algorithms and tight complexity bounds for answering two-way conjunctive regular path queries over DL knowledge bases formulated in lightweight DLs of the DL-Lite and EL families. Our results demonstrate that in data complexity, the cost of moving to this richer query language is as low as one could wish for: the problem is NL-complete for DL-Lite and P-complete for EL. The combined complexity of query answering increases from NP- to PSpace-complete, but for two-way regular path queries (without conjunction), we show that query answering is tractable even with respect to combined complexity. Our results reveal two-way conjunctive regular path queries as a promising language for querying data enriched by ontologies formulated in DLs of the DL-Lite and EL families or the corresponding OWL 2 QL and EL profiles.</p>

<p>Temporally extended actions have proven useful for reinforcement learning, but their duration also makes them valuable for efficient planning. The options framework provides a concrete way to implement and reason about temporally extended actions. Existing literature has demonstrated the value of planning with options empirically, but there is a lack of theoretical analysis formalizing when planning with options is more efficient than planning with primitive actions. We provide a general analysis of the convergence rate of a popular Approximate Value Iteration (AVI) algorithm called Fitted Value Iteration (FVI) with options. Our analysis reveals that longer duration options and a pessimistic estimate of the value function both lead to faster convergence. Furthermore, options can improve convergence even when they are suboptimal and sparsely distributed throughout the state-space. Next we consider the problem of generating useful options for planning based on a subset of landmark states. This suggests a new algorithm, Landmark-based AVI (LAVI), that represents the value function only at the landmark states. We analyze both FVI and LAVI using the proposed landmark-based options and compare the two algorithms. Our experimental results in three different domains demonstrate the key properties from the analysis. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that options can play an important role in AVI by decreasing approximation error and inducing fast convergence.</p>

<p>For many election systems, bribery (and related) attacks have been shown NP-hard using constructions on combinatorially rich structures such as partitions and covers.  This paper shows that for voters who follow the most central political-science model of electorates---single-peaked preferences---those hardness protections vanish.  By using single-peaked preferences to simplify combinatorial covering challenges, we for the first time show that NP-hard bribery problems---including those for Kemeny and Llull elections---fall to polynomial time for single-peaked electorates.  By using single-peaked preferences to simplify combinatorial partition challenges, we for the first time show that NP-hard partition-of-voters problems fall to polynomial time for single-peaked electorates.  We show that for single-peaked electorates, the winner problems for Dodgson and Kemeny elections, though Theta-two-complete in the general case, fall to polynomial time.  And we completely classify the complexity of weighted coalition manipulation for scoring protocols in single-peaked electorates.</p>

<p>We introduce a new notion of systematicity for satisfiability algorithms with restarts, saying that an algorithm is strongly systematic if it is systematic independent of restart policy but weakly systematic if it is systematic for some restart policies but not others.  We show that existing satisfiability engines are generally only weakly systematic, and describe FLEX, a strongly systematic algorithm that uses an amount of memory polynomial in the size of the problem.  On large number factoring problems, FLEX appears to outperform weakly systematic approaches.<br />

<p>Planning as satisfiability is known as an efficient approach to deal with many types of planning problems. However, this approach has not been competitive with the state-space based methods in temporal planning. This paper describes ITSAT as an efficient SAT-based (satisfiability based) temporal planner capable of temporally expressive planning. The novelty of ITSAT lies in the way it handles temporal constraints of given problems without getting involved in the difficulties of introducing continuous variables into the corresponding satisfiability problems. We also show how, as in SAT-based classical planning, carefully devised preprocessing and encoding schemata can considerably improve the efficiency of SAT-based temporal planning. We present two preprocessing methods for mutex relation extraction and action compression. We also show that the separation of causal and temporal reasoning enables us to employ compact encodings that are based on the concept of parallel execution semantics. Although such encodings have been shown to be quite effective in classical planning, ITSAT is the first temporal planner utilizing this type of encoding. Our empirical results show that not only does ITSAT outperform the state-of-the-art temporally expressive planners, it is also competitive with the fast temporal planners that cannot handle required concurrency.</p>

<p>Compared to conventional cars, electric vehicles (EVs) still suffer from considerably shorter cruising ranges. Combined with the sparsity of battery loading stations, the complete transition to E-mobility still seems a long way to go. In this paper, we consider the problem of placing as few loading stations as possible so that on any shortest path there are sufficiently many not to run out of energy. We show how to model this problem and introduce heuristics which provide close-to-optimal solutions even in large road networks.</p>

<p>The interaction of multiple autonomous agents gives rise to highly dynamic and nondeterministic environments, contributing to the complexity in applications such as automated financial markets, smart grids, or robotics. Due to the sheer number of situations that may arise, it is not possible to foresee and program the optimal behaviour for all agents beforehand. Consequently, it becomes essential for the success of the system that the agents can learn their optimal behaviour and adapt to new situations or circumstances. The past two decades have seen the emergence of reinforcement learning, both in single and multi-agent settings, as a strong, robust and adaptive learning paradigm. Progress has been substantial, and a wide range of algorithms are now available. An important challenge in the domain of multi-agent learning is to gain qualitative insights into the resulting system dynamics. In the past decade, tools and methods from evolutionary game theory have been successfully employed to study multi-agent learning dynamics formally in strategic interactions. This article surveys the dynamical models that have been derived for various multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, making it possible to study and compare them qualitatively. Furthermore, new learning algorithms that have been introduced using these evolutionary game theoretic tools are reviewed. The evolutionary models can be used to study complex strategic interactions. Examples of such analysis are given for the domains of automated trading in stock markets and collision avoidance in multi-robot systems. The paper provides a roadmap on the progress that has been achieved in analysing the evolutionary dynamics of multi-agent learning by highlighting the main results and accomplishments.</p>

<p>The problem of finding the most probable explanation to a designated set of variables given partial evidence (the MAP problem) is a notoriously intractable problem in Bayesian networks, both to compute exactly and to approximate. It is known, both from theoretical considerations and from practical experience, that low tree-width is typically an essential prerequisite to efficient exact computations in Bayesian networks. In this paper we investigate whether the same holds for approximating MAP. We define four notions of approximating MAP (by value, structure, rank, and expectation) and argue that all of them are intractable in general. We prove that efficient value-approximations, structure-approximations, and rank-approximations of MAP instances with high tree-width will violate the Exponential Time Hypothesis. In contrast, we show that MAP can sometimes be efficiently expectation-approximated, even in instances with high tree-width, if the most probable explanation has a high probability. We introduce the complexity class FERT, analogous to the class FTP, to capture this notion of fixed-parameter expectation-approximability. We suggest a road-map to future research that yields fixed-parameter tractable results for expectation-approximate MAP, even in graphs with high tree-width.</p>

<p>We design and analyze deterministic truthful approximation mechanisms for multi-unit Combinatorial Auctions involving only a constant number of distinct goods, each in arbitrary limited supply. Prospective buyers (bidders) have preferences over multisets of items, i.e., for more than one unit per distinct good. Our objective is to determine allocations of multisets that maximize the Social Welfare. Our main results are for multi-minded and submodular bidders. In the first setting each bidder has a positive value for being allocated one multiset from a prespecified demand set of alternatives. In the second setting each bidder is associated to a submodular valuation function that defines his value for the multiset he is allocated. For multi-minded bidders, we design a truthful FPTAS that fully optimizes the Social Welfare, while violating the supply constraints on goods within factor (1+e), for any fixed e>0 (i.e., the approximation applies to the constraints and not to the Social Welfare). This result is best possible, in that full optimization is impossible without violating the supply constraints. For submodular bidders, we obtain a PTAS that approximates the optimum Social Welfare within factor (1+e), for any fixed e>0, without violating the supply constraints. This result is best possible as well. Our allocation algorithms are Maximal-in-Range and yield truthful mechanisms, when paired with Vickrey-Clarke-Groves payments.<br />

<p>Algorithm selection (AS) techniques -- which involve choosing from a set of algorithms the one expected to solve a given problem instance most efficiently -- have substantially improved the state of the art in solving many prominent AI problems, such as SAT, CSP, ASP, MAXSAT and QBF. Although several AS procedures have been introduced, not too surprisingly, none of them dominates all others across all AS scenarios. Furthermore, these procedures have parameters whose optimal values vary across AS scenarios. This holds specifically for the machine learning techniques that form the core of current AS procedures, and for their hyperparameters. Therefore, to successfully apply AS to new problems, algorithms and benchmark sets, two questions need to be answered: (i) how to select an AS approach and (ii) how to set its parameters effectively. We address both of these problems simultaneously by using automated algorithm configuration. Specifically, we demonstrate that we can automatically configure claspfolio 2, which implements a large variety of different AS approaches and their respective parameters in a single, highly-parameterized algorithm framework. Our approach, dubbed AutoFolio, allows researchers and practitioners across a broad range of applications to exploit the combined power of many different AS methods. We demonstrate AutoFolio can significantly improve the performance of claspfolio 2 on 8 out of the 13 scenarios from the Algorithm Selection Library, leads to new state-of-the-art algorithm selectors for 7 of these scenarios, and matches state-of-the-art performance (statistically) on all other scenarios. Compared to the best single algorithm for each AS scenario, AutoFolio achieves average speedup factors between 1.3 and 15.4.</p>

<p>We consider the iterated belief change that occurs following an alternating sequence of actions and observations.  At each instant, an agent has beliefs about the actions that have occurred as well as beliefs about the resulting state of the world.  We represent such problems by a sequence of ranking functions, so an agent assigns a quantitative plausibility value to every action and every state at each point in time.  The resulting formalism is able to represent fallible belief, erroneous perception, exogenous actions, and failed actions.  We illustrate that our framework is a generalization of several existing approaches to belief change, and it appropriately captures the non-elementary interaction between belief update and belief revision.</p>
