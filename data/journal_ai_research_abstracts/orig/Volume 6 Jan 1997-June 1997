<p>Instance-based learning techniques typically handle    continuous and linear input values well, but often do not handle    nominal input attributes appropriately.  The Value Difference Metric    (VDM) was designed to find reasonable distance values between nominal    attribute values, but it largely ignores continuous attributes,    requiring discretization to map continuous values into nominal values.    This paper proposes three new heterogeneous distance functions, called    the Heterogeneous Value Difference Metric (HVDM), the Interpolated    Value Difference Metric (IVDM), and the Windowed Value Difference    Metric (WVDM).  These new distance functions are designed to handle    applications with nominal attributes, continuous attributes, or both.    In experiments on 48 applications the new distance metrics achieve    higher classification accuracy on average than three previous distance    functions on those datasets that have both nominal and continuous    attributes.</p>

<p>Previous approaches of analyzing spontaneously spoken    language often have been based on encoding syntactic and semantic    knowledge manually and symbolically. While there has been some    progress using statistical or connectionist language models, many    current spoken- language systems still use a relatively brittle,    hand-coded symbolic grammar or symbolic semantic component.<p>        In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning    robust processing of spontaneously spoken language.  A screening    approach is a flat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category    representations for analyzing an utterance at various syntactic,    semantic and dialog levels.  Rather than using a deeply structured    symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist analysis.  This    screening approach aims at supporting speech and language processing    by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of connectionist    networks.  In order to test this approach, we have developed the    SCREEN system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat    analysis.<p>        In this paper, we focus on a detailed description of SCREEN's    architecture, the flat syntactic and semantic analysis, the    interaction with a speech recognizer, and a detailed evaluation    analysis of the robustness under the influence of noisy or incomplete    input.  The main result of this paper is that flat representations    allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken language than    deeply structured representations.  In particular, we show how the    fault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can    support a flat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language    processing within an overall hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework.</p>

<p>Most modern formalisms used in Databases and Artificial    Intelligence for describing an application domain are based on the    notions of class (or concept) and relationship among classes.  One    interesting feature of such formalisms is the possibility of defining    a class, i.e., providing a set of properties that precisely    characterize the instances of the class.  Many recent articles point    out that there are several ways of assigning a meaning to a class    definition containing some sort of recursion.  In this paper, we argue    that, instead of choosing a single style of semantics, we achieve    better results by adopting a formalism that allows for different    semantics to coexist. We demonstrate the feasibility of our argument,    by presenting a knowledge representation formalism, the description    logic muALCQ, with the above characteristics.  In addition to the    constructs for conjunction, disjunction, negation, quantifiers, and    qualified number restrictions, muALCQ includes special fixpoint    constructs to express (suitably interpreted) recursive definitions.    These constructs enable the usual frame-based descriptions to be    combined with definitions of recursive data structures such as    directed acyclic graphs, lists, streams, etc.  We establish several    properties of muALCQ, including the decidability and the computational    complexity of reasoning, by formulating a correspondence with a    particular modal logic of programs called the modal mu-calculus.</p>

<p>We argue that the analysis of agent/environment interactions should be extended to include the conventions and invariants maintained by agents throughout their activity.  We refer to this thicker notion of environment as a lifeworld and present a partial set of formal tools for describing structures of lifeworlds and the ways in which they computationally simplify activity.  As one specific example, we apply the tools to the analysis of the Toast system and show how versions of the system with very different control structures in fact implement a common control structure together with different conventions for encoding task state in the positions or states of objects in the environment.</p>

<p class="media"><a href="/media/330/live-330-1595-jair.pdf">PDF</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/media/330/live-330-1594-jair.ps">PostScript</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume6/darwiche97a-html/jair-f.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">HTML</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1613/jair.330'>doi:10.1613/jair.330</a></p>
<p>We describe a new paradigm for implementing inference in    belief networks, which consists of two steps: (1) compiling a belief    network into an arithmetic expression called a Query DAG (Q-DAG); and    (2) answering queries using a simple evaluation algorithm. Each node    of a Q-DAG represents a numeric operation, a number, or a symbol for    evidence.  Each leaf node of a Q-DAG represents the answer to a    network query, that is, the probability of some event of interest. It    appears that Q-DAGs can be generated using any of the standard    algorithms for exact inference in belief networks (we show how they    can be generated using clustering and conditioning algorithms). The    time and space complexity of a Q-DAG generation algorithm is no worse    than the time complexity of the inference algorithm on which it is    based. The complexity of a Q-DAG evaluation algorithm is linear in the    size of the Q-DAG, and such inference amounts to a standard evaluation    of the arithmetic expression it represents. The intended value of    Q-DAGs is in reducing the software and hardware resources required to    utilize belief networks in on-line, real-world applications. The    proposed framework also facilitates the development of on-line    inference on different software and hardware platforms due to the    simplicity of the Q-DAG evaluation algorithm. Interestingly enough,    Q-DAGs were found to serve other purposes: simple techniques for    reducing Q-DAGs tend to subsume relatively complex optimization    techniques for belief-network inference, such as network-pruning and    computation-caching.</p>

<p>An algorithm that learns from a set of examples should    ideally be able to exploit the available resources of (a) abundant    computing power and (b) domain-specific knowledge to improve its    ability to generalize.  Connectionist theory-refinement systems, which    use background knowledge to select a neural network's topology and    initial weights, have proven to be effective at exploiting    domain-specific knowledge; however, most do not exploit available    computing power. This weakness occurs because they lack the ability to    refine the topology of the neural networks they produce, thereby    limiting generalization, especially when given impoverished domain    theories. We present the REGENT algorithm which uses (a) domain-specific     knowledge to help create an initial population of knowledge-based    neural networks and (b) genetic operators of crossover and mutation    (specifically designed for knowledge-based networks) to continually    search for better network topologies. Experiments on three real-world    domains indicate that our new algorithm is able to significantly    increase generalization compared to a standard connectionist    theory-refinement system, as well as our previous algorithm for    growing knowledge-based networks.</p>

<p>We investigate the computational properties of the spatial    algebra RCC-5 which is a restricted version of the RCC framework for    spatial reasoning.  The satisfiability problem for RCC-5 is known to    be NP-complete but not much is known about its approximately four    billion subclasses. We provide a complete classification of    satisfiability for all these subclasses into polynomial and    NP-complete respectively. In the process, we identify all maximal    tractable subalgebras which are four in total.</p>

<p>Several recent studies have compared the relative efficiency    of alternative flaw selection strategies for partial-order causal link    (POCL) planning.  We review this literature, and present new    experimental results that generalize the earlier work and explain some    of the discrepancies in it.  In particular, we describe the Least-Cost    Flaw Repair (LCFR) strategy developed and analyzed by Joslin and    Pollack (1994), and compare it with other strategies, including    Gerevini and Schubert's (1996) ZLIFO strategy.  LCFR and ZLIFO make    very different, and apparently conflicting claims about the most    effective way to reduce search-space size in POCL planning.  We    resolve this conflict, arguing that much of the benefit that Gerevini    and Schubert ascribe to the LIFO component of their ZLIFO strategy is    better attributed to other causes.  We show that for many problems, a    strategy that combines least-cost flaw selection with the delay of    separable threats will be effective in reducing search-space size, and    will do so without excessive computational overhead.  Although such a    strategy thus provides a good default, we also show that certain    domain characteristics may reduce its effectiveness.</p>
