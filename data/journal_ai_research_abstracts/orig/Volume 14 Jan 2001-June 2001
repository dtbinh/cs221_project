<p>In recent years, there is a growing awareness of the    importance of reachability and relevance-based pruning techniques for    planning, but little work specifically targets these techniques. In    this paper, we compare the ability of two classes of algorithms to    propagate and discover reachability and relevance constraints in    classical planning problems. The first class of algorithms operates on    SAT encoded planning problems obtained using the linear and Graphplan    encoding schemes.  It applies unit-propagation and more general    resolution steps (involving larger clauses) to these plan encodings.    The second class operates at the plan level and contains two families    of pruning algorithms: Reachable-k and Relevant-k.  Reachable-k    provides a coherent description of a number of existing forward    pruning techniques used in numerous algorithms, while Relevant-k    captures different grades of backward pruning.  Our results shed light    on the ability of different plan-encoding schemes to propagate    information forward and backward and on the relative merit of    plan-level and SAT-level pruning methods.</p>

<p>Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) have    recently become popular among many AI researchers because they serve    as a natural model for planning under uncertainty.  Value iteration is    a well-known algorithm for finding optimal policies for POMDPs.  It    typically takes a large number of iterations to converge.  This paper    proposes a method for accelerating the convergence of value iteration.    The method has been evaluated on an array of benchmark problems and    was found to be very effective: It enabled value iteration to converge    after only a few iterations on all the test problems.</p>

<p>In recent years, many improvements to backtracking algorithms for    solving constraint satisfaction problems have been proposed.    The techniques for improving backtracking algorithms can    be conveniently classified as look-ahead schemes and    look-back schemes.  Unfortunately, look-ahead and look-back    schemes are not entirely orthogonal as it has been observed    empirically that the enhancement of look-ahead techniques    is sometimes counterproductive to the effects of look-back    techniques. In this paper, we focus on the relationship between    the two most important look-ahead techniques---using a variable    ordering heuristic and maintaining a level of local consistency    during the backtracking search---and the look-back technique of    conflict-directed backjumping (CBJ). We show that there exists    a ``perfect'' dynamic variable ordering such that CBJ becomes    redundant. We also show theoretically that as the level of local    consistency that is maintained in the backtracking search is    increased, the less that backjumping will be an improvement.    Our theoretical results partially explain why a backtracking    algorithm doing more in the look-ahead phase cannot benefit    more from the backjumping look-back scheme. Finally, we show    empirically that adding CBJ to a backtracking algorithm that    maintains generalized arc consistency (GAC), an algorithm that    we refer to as GAC-CBJ, can still provide orders of magnitude    speedups. Our empirical results contrast with Bessiere and    Regin's conclusion (1996) that CBJ is useless to an algorithm    that maintains arc consistency.</p>

<p>We show that for several variations of partially observable    Markov decision processes, polynomial-time algorithms for finding    control policies are unlikely to or simply don't have guarantees of    finding policies within a constant factor or a constant summand of    optimal.  Here ``unlikely'' means ``unless some complexity classes    collapse,'' where the collapses considered are P=NP, P=PSPACE, or    P=EXP.  Until or unless these collapses are shown to hold, any    control-policy designer must choose between such performance    guarantees and efficient computation.</p>

<p>In order to generate plans for agents with multiple    actuators, agent teams, or distributed controllers, we must be able to    represent and plan using concurrent actions with interacting    effects. This has historically been considered a challenging task    requiring a temporal planner with the ability to reason explicitly    about time. We show that with simple modifications, the STRIPS action    representation language can be used to represent interacting actions.    Moreover, algorithms for partial-order planning require only small    modifications in order to be applied in such multiagent domains.  We    demonstrate this fact by developing a sound and complete partial-order    planner for planning with concurrent interacting actions, POMP, that    extends existing partial-order planners in a straightforward    way. These results open the way to the use of partial-order planners    for the centralized control of cooperative multiagent systems.</p>

<p>Description Logics (DLs) are suitable, well-known, logics    for managing structured knowledge.  They allow reasoning about    individuals and well defined concepts, i.e., set of individuals with    common properties.  The experience in using DLs in applications has    shown that in many cases we would like to extend their capabilities.    In particular, their use in the context of Multimedia Information    Retrieval (MIR) leads to the convincement that such DLs should allow    the treatment of the inherent imprecision in multimedia object content    representation and retrieval.     <p>      In this paper we will present a fuzzy extension of ALC, combining    Zadeh's fuzzy logic with a classical DL. In particular, concepts    becomes fuzzy and, thus, reasoning about imprecise concepts is    supported.  We will define its syntax, its semantics, describe its    properties and present a constraint propagation calculus for reasoning    in it.</p>

<p>Functional relationships between objects, called    `attributes', are of considerable importance in knowledge    representation languages, including Description Logics (DLs). A study    of the literature indicates that papers have made, often implicitly,    different assumptions about the nature of attributes: whether they are    always required to have a value, or whether they can be partial    functions. The work presented here is the first explicit study of this    difference for subclasses of the CLASSIC DL, involving the same-as    concept constructor.  It is shown that although determining    subsumption between concept descriptions has the same complexity    (though requiring different algorithms), the story is different in the    case of determining the least common subsumer (lcs). For attributes    interpreted as partial functions, the lcs exists and can be computed    relatively easily; even in this case our results correct and extend    three previous papers about the lcs of DLs.  In the case where    attributes must have a value, the lcs may not exist, and even if it    exists it may be of exponential size.  Interestingly, it is possible    to decide in polynomial time if the lcs exists.</p>

<p>Enforcing local consistencies is one of the main features    of constraint reasoning. Which level of local consistency should be    used when searching for solutions in a constraint network is a basic    question. Arc consistency and partial forms of arc consistency have    been widely studied, and have been known for sometime through the    forward checking or the MAC search algorithms. Until recently,    stronger forms of local consistency remained limited to those that    change the structure of the constraint graph, and thus, could not be    used in practice, especially on large networks. This paper focuses on    the local consistencies that are stronger than arc consistency,    without changing the structure of the network, i.e., only removing    inconsistent values from the domains. In the last five years, several    such local consistencies have been proposed by us or by others. We    make an overview of all of them, and highlight some relations between    them. We compare them both theoretically and experimentally,    considering their pruning efficiency and the time required to enforce    them.</p>

<p>The growing need to manage and exploit the proliferation of    online data sources is opening up new opportunities for bringing    people closer to the resources they need.  For instance, consider a    recommendation service through which researchers can receive daily    pointers to journal papers in their fields of interest. We survey some    of the known approaches to the problem of technical paper    recommendation and ask how they can be extended to deal with multiple    information sources. More specifically, we focus on a variant of this    problem -- recommending conference paper submissions to reviewing    committee members -- which offers us a testbed to try different    approaches.  Using WHIRL -- an information integration system -- we    are able to implement different recommendation algorithms derived from    information retrieval principles. We also use a novel autonomous    procedure for gathering reviewer interest information from the Web. We    evaluate our approach and compare it to other methods using preference    data provided by members of the AAAI-98 conference reviewing committee    along with data about the actual submissions.</p>

<p>We describe and evaluate the algorithmic techniques that are    used in the FF planning system. Like the HSP system, FF relies on    forward state space search, using a heuristic that estimates goal    distances by ignoring delete lists. Unlike HSP's heuristic, our method    does not assume facts to be independent. We introduce a novel search    strategy that combines hill-climbing with systematic search, and we    show how other powerful heuristic information can be extracted and    used to prune the search space. FF was the most successful automatic    planner at the recent AIPS-2000 planning competition. We review the    results of the competition, give data for other benchmark domains, and    investigate the reasons for the runtime performance of FF compared to    HSP.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the problems arising in the    construction of a program to play the game of contract bridge.  These    problems include both the difficulty of solving the game's perfect    information variant, and techniques needed to address the fact that    bridge is not, in fact, a perfect information game.  GIB, the program    being described, involves five separate technical advances: partition    search, the practical application of Monte Carlo techniques to    realistic problems, a focus on achievable sets to solve problems    inherent in the Monte Carlo approach, an extension of alpha-beta    pruning from total orders to arbitrary distributive lattices, and the    use of squeaky wheel optimization to find approximately optimal    solutions to cardplay problems. <p>    GIB is currently believed to be of approximately expert caliber, and    is currently the strongest computer bridge program in the world.</p>
