f  heras j  larrosa and a  oliveras 2008 minimaxsat an efficient weighted maxsat solver volume 31 pages 132

in this paper we introduce minimaxsat a new maxsat solver that is built on top of minisat it incorporates the best current sat and maxsat techniques it can handle hard clausesclauses of mandatory satisfaction as in sat soft clauses clauses whose falsification is penalized by a cost as in maxsat as well as pseudoboolean objective functions and constraints  its main features are learning and  backjumping on hard clauses resolutionbased and substractionbased  lower bounding and lazy propagation with the twowatched literal scheme  our empirical evaluation comparing a wide set of solving alternatives on a broad set of optimization benchmarks indicates that the performance of minimaxsat is usually close to the best specialized alternative and in some cases even better



mausam and d  s  weld 2008 planning with durative actions in stochastic domains volume 31 pages 3382

probabilistic planning problems are typically modeled as a markov decision process mdp mdps while an otherwise expressive model allow only for sequential nondurative actions this poses severe restrictions in modeling and solving a real world planning problem we extend the mdp model to incorporate  1 simultaneous action execution 2 durative actions and 3 stochastic durations we develop several algorithms to combat the computational explosion introduced by these features the key theoretical ideas used in building these algorithms are  modeling a complex problem as an mdp in extended stateaction space pruning of irrelevant actions sampling of relevant actions using informed heuristics to guide the search hybridizing different planners to achieve benefits of both approximating the problem and replanning our empirical evaluation illuminates the different merits in using various algorithms viz optimality empirical closeness to optimality theoretical error bounds and speed



y  engel and m  p wellman 2008 cui networks a graphical representation for conditional utility independence volume 31 pages 83112

we introduce cui networks a compact graphical representation of utility functions over multiple attributes cui networks model multiattribute utility functions using the wellstudied and widely applicable utility independence concept we show how conditional utility independence leads to an effective functional decomposition that can be exhibited graphically and how local compact data at the graph nodes can be used to calculate joint utility we discuss aspects of elicitation network construction and optimization and contrast our new representation with previous graphical preference modeling




y  zhang and y  ding 2008 ctl model update for system modifications volume 31 pages 113155

model checking is a promising technology which has been applied for verification of many hardware and software systems in this paper we introduce the concept of model update towards the development of an automatic system modification tool that extends model checking functions we define primitive update operations on the models of computation tree logic ctl and formalize the principle of minimal change for ctl model update these primitive update operations together with the underlying minimal change principle serve as the foundation for ctl model update essential semantic and computational characterizations are provided for our ctl model update approach we then describe a formal algorithm that implements this approach we also illustrate two case studies of ctl model updates for the wellknown microwave oven example and the andrew file system 1 from which we further propose a method to optimize the update results in complex system modifications



b  glimm c  lutz i  horrocks and u  sattler 2008 conjunctive query answering for the description logic shiq volume 31 pages 157204

conjunctive queries play an important role as an expressive query language for description logics dls although modern dls usually provide for transitive roles conjunctive query answering over dl knowledge bases is only poorly understood if transitive roles are admitted in the query in this paper we consider unions of conjunctive queries over knowledge bases formulated in the prominent dl shiq and allow transitive roles in both the query and the knowledge base we show decidability of query answering in this setting and establish two tight complexity bounds regarding combined complexity we prove that there is a deterministic algorithm for query answering that needs time single exponential in the size of the kb and double exponential in the size of the query which is optimal regarding data complexity we prove containment in conp



k  wong 2008 sound and complete inference rules for seconsequence volume 31 pages 205216

the notion of strong equivalence on logic programs with answer set semantics gives rise to a consequence relation on logic program rules called seconsequence we present a sound and complete set of inference rules for seconsequence on disjunctive logic programs




m  hl van den briel t  vossen and s  kambhampati 2008 loosely coupled formulations for automated planning an integer programming perspective volume 31 pages 217257

we represent planning as a set of loosely coupled network flow problems where each network corresponds to one of the state variables in the planning domain the network nodes correspond to the state variable values and the network arcs correspond to the value transitions the planning problem is to find a path a sequence of actions in each network such that when merged they constitute a feasible plan in this paper we present a number of integer programming formulations that model these loosely coupled networks with varying degrees of flexibility since merging may introduce exponentially many ordering constraints we implement a socalled branchandcut algorithm in which these constraints are dynamically generated and added to the formulation when needed our results are very promising they improve upon previous planning as integer programming approaches and lay the foundation for integer programming approaches for cost optimal planning



y  liu and g  lakemeyer 2008 on the expressiveness of levesques normal form volume 31 pages 259272

levesque proposed a generalization of a database called a proper knowledge base kb which is equivalent to a possibly infinite consistent set of ground literals in contrast to databases proper kbs do not make the closedworld assumption and hence the entailment  problem becomes undecidable levesque then proposed a limited but efficient inference method v for proper kbs which is sound and when the query is in a certain normal form also logically complete  he conjectured that for every firstorder query there is an equivalent one in normal form in this note we show that this conjecture is false in fact we show that any class of formulas for which v is complete must be strictly less expressive than full firstorder logic moreover in the propositional case it is very unlikely that a formula always has a polynomialsize normal form



b  cuenca grau i  horrocks y  kazakov and u  sattler 2008 modular reuse of ontologies theory and practice volume 31 pages 273318

in this paper we propose a set of tasks that are relevant for the modular reuse of ontologies in order to formalize these tasks as reasoning problems we introduce the notions of conservative extension safety and module for a very general class of logicbased ontology languages we investigate the general properties of and relationships between these notions  and study the relationships between the relevant reasoning problems we have previously identified to study the computability of these problems we   consider in particular description logics dls which provide the formal underpinning of the w3c web ontology language owl and show that all the  problems we consider are undecidable or algorithmically unsolvable for the description logic underlying owl dl  in order to achieve a practical solution we identify conditions sufficient for an ontology to reuse a set of symbols safelythat is without changing their meaning we provide the notion of a safety class which characterizes any sufficient condition for safety and identify a family of safety classescalled localitywhich enjoys a collection of desirable properties  we use the notion of a safety class to extract modules from ontologies and we provide various modularization algorithms that are appropriate to the properties of the particular safety class in use  finally we show practical benefits of our safety checking and module extraction algorithms



o  gimenez and a  jonsson 2008 the complexity of planning problems with simple causal graphs volume 31 pages 319351

we present three new complexity results for classes of planning problems with simple causal graphs first we describe a polynomialtime algorithm that uses macros to generate plans for the class 3s of planning problems with binary state variables and acyclic causal graphs this implies that plan generation may be tractable even when a planning problem has an exponentially long minimal solution we also prove that the problem of plan existence for planning problems with multivalued variables and chain causal graphs is nphard finally we show that plan existence for planning problems with binary state variables and polytree causal graphs is npcomplete



j  eisenstein r  barzilay and r  davis 2008 gesture salience as a hidden variable for coreference resolution and keyframe extraction volume 31 pages 353398

gesture is a nonverbal modality that can contribute crucial information to the understanding of natural language but not all gestures are informative and noncommunicative hand motions may confuse natural language processing nlp and impede learning people have little diffculty ignoring irrelevant hand movements and focusing on meaningful gestures suggesting that an automatic system could also be trained to perform this task  however the informativeness of a gesture is contextdependent and labeling enough data to cover all cases would be expensive we present conditional modality fusion a conditional hiddenvariable model that learns to predict which gestures are salient for coreference resolution the task of determining whether two noun phrases refer to the same semantic entity moreover our approach uses only coreference annotations and not annotations of gesture salience itself we show that gesture features improve performance on coreference resolution and that by attending only to gestures that are salient our method achieves further significant gains in addition we show that the model of gesture salience learned in the context of coreference accords with human intuition by demonstrating that gestures judged to be salient by our model can be used successfully to create multimedia keyframe summaries of video these summaries are similar to those created by human raters and significantly outperform summaries produced by baselines from the literature



j  clarke and m  lapata 2008 global inference for sentence compression an integer linear programming approach volume 31 pages 399429

sentence compression holds promise for many applications ranging from summarization to subtitle generation  our work views sentence compression as an optimization problem and uses integer linear programming ilp to infer globally optimal compressions in the presence of linguistically motivated constraints we show how previous formulations of sentence compression can be recast as ilps and extend these models with novel global constraints experimental results on written and spoken texts demonstrate improvements over stateoftheart models



c  wang s  joshi and r  khardon 2008 first order decision diagrams for relational mdps volume 31 pages 431472

markov decision processes capture sequential decision making under uncertainty where an agent must choose actions so as to optimize long term reward  the paper studies efficient reasoning mechanisms for relational markov decision processes rmdp where world states have an internal relational structure that can be naturally described in terms of objects and relations among them  two contributions are presented  first the paper develops first order decision diagrams fodd a new compact representation for functions over relational structures together with a set of operators to combine fodds and novel reduction techniques to keep the representation small  second the paper shows how fodds can be used to develop solutions for rmdps where reasoning is performed at the abstract level and the resulting optimal policy is independent of domain size number of objects or instantiation  in particular a variant of the value iteration algorithm is developed by using special operations over fodds and the algorithm is shown to converge to the optimal policy




a  altman and m  tennenholtz 2008 axiomatic foundations for ranking systems volume 31 pages 473495

reasoning about agent preferences on a set of alternatives and the aggregation of such preferences into some social ranking is a fundamental issue in reasoning about multiagent systems when the set of agents and the set of alternatives coincide we get the ranking systems setting a famous type of ranking systems are page ranking systems in the context of search engines in this paper we present an extensive axiomatic study of ranking systems in particular we consider two fundamental axioms transitivity and ranked independence of irrelevant alternatives surprisingly we find that there is no general social ranking rule that satisfies both requirements furthermore we show that our impossibility result holds under various restrictions on the class of ranking problems considered however when transitivity is weakened an interesting possibility result is obtained in addition we show a complete axiomatization of approval voting using ranked iia 



m  rk ryan 2008 exploiting subgraph structure in multirobot path planning volume 31 pages 497542

multirobot path planning is difficult due to the combinatorial explosion of the search space with every new robot added complete search of the combined statespace soon becomes intractable in this paper we present a novel form of abstraction that allows us to plan much more efficiently the key to this abstraction is the partitioning of the map into subgraphs of known structure with entry and exit restrictions which we can represent compactly planning then becomes a search in the much smaller space of subgraph configurations once an abstract plan is found it can be quickly resolved into a correct but possibly suboptimal concrete plan without the need for further search we prove that this technique is sound and complete and demonstrate its practical effectiveness on a real map




m  michelson and c  a knoblock 2008 creating relational data from unstructured and ungrammatical data sources volume 31 pages 543590

in order for agents to act on behalf of users they will have to retrieve and integrate vast amounts of textual data on the world wide web however much of the useful data on the web is neither grammatical nor formally structured making querying difficult examples of these types of data sources are online classifieds like craigslist and auction item listings like ebay we call this unstructured ungrammatical data posts the unstructured nature of posts makes query and integration difficult because the attributes are embedded within the text also these attributes do not conform to standardized values which prevents queries based on a common attribute value the schema is unknown and the values may vary dramatically making accurate search difficult creating relational data for easy querying requires that we define a schema for the embedded attributes and extract values from the posts while standardizing these values  traditional information extraction ie is inadequate to perform this task because it relies on clues from the data such as structure or natural language neither of which are found in posts furthermore traditional information extraction does not incorporate data cleaning which is necessary to accurately query and integrate the source the twostep approach described in this paper creates relational data sets from unstructured and ungrammatical text by addressing both issues to do this we require a set of known entities called a reference set the first step aligns each post to each member of each reference set this allows our algorithm to define a schema over the post and include standard values for the attributes defined by this schema the second step performs information extraction for the attributes including attributes not easily represented by reference sets such as a price in this manner we create a relational structure over previously unstructured data supporting deep and accurate queries over the data as well as standard values for integration our experimental results show that our technique matches the posts to the reference set accurately and efficiently and outperforms stateoftheart extraction systems on the extraction task from posts



k  dresner and p  stone 2008 a multiagent approach to autonomous intersection management volume 31 pages 591656

artificial intelligence research is ushering in a new era of sophisticated massmarket transportation technology while computers can already fly a passenger jet better than a trained human pilot people are still faced with the dangerous yet tedious task of driving automobiles intelligent transportation systems its is the field that focuses on integrating information technology with vehicles and transportation infrastructure to make transportation safer cheaper and more efficient recent advances in its point to a future in which vehicles themselves handle the vast majority of the driving task once autonomous vehicles become popular autonomous interactions amongst multiple vehicles will be possible current methods of vehicle coordination which are all designed to work with human drivers will be outdated the bottleneck for roadway efficiency will no longer be the drivers but rather the mechanism by which those drivers actions are coordinated while openroad driving is a wellstudied and moreorlesssolved problem urban traffic scenarios especially intersections are much more challenging
we believe current methods for controlling traffic specifically at intersections will not be able to take advantage of the increased sensitivity and precision of autonomous vehicles as compared to human drivers in this article we suggest an alternative mechanism for coordinating the movement of autonomous vehicles through intersections drivers and intersections in this mechanism are treated as autonomous agents in a multiagent system in this multiagent system intersections use a new reservationbased approach built around a detailed communication protocol which we also present we demonstrate in simulation that our new mechanism has the potential to significantly outperform current intersection control technology  traffic lights and stop signs because our mechanism can emulate a traffic light or stop sign it subsumes the most popular current methods of intersection control this article also presents two extensions to the mechanism the first extension allows the system to control humandriven vehicles in addition to autonomous vehicles the second gives priority to emergency vehicles without significant cost to civilian vehicles the mechanism including both extensions is implemented and tested in simulation and we present experimental results that strongly attest to the efficacy of this approach
