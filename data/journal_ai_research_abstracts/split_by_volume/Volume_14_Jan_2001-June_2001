r  i brafman 2001 on reachability relevance and resolution in the planning as satisfiability approach volume 14 pages 128

in recent years there is a growing awareness of the    importance of reachability and relevancebased pruning techniques for    planning but little work specifically targets these techniques in    this paper we compare the ability of two classes of algorithms to    propagate and discover reachability and relevance constraints in    classical planning problems the first class of algorithms operates on    sat encoded planning problems obtained using the linear and graphplan    encoding schemes  it applies unitpropagation and more general    resolution steps involving larger clauses to these plan encodings    the second class operates at the plan level and contains two families    of pruning algorithms reachablek and relevantk  reachablek    provides a coherent description of a number of existing forward    pruning techniques used in numerous algorithms while relevantk    captures different grades of backward pruning  our results shed light    on the ability of different planencoding schemes to propagate    information forward and backward and on the relative merit of    planlevel and satlevel pruning methods



n  l zhang and  w  zhang 2001 speeding up the convergence of value iteration in partially observable markov decision processes volume 14 pages 2951

partially observable markov decision processes pomdps have    recently become popular among many ai researchers because they serve    as a natural model for planning under uncertainty  value iteration is    a wellknown algorithm for finding optimal policies for pomdps  it    typically takes a large number of iterations to converge  this paper    proposes a method for accelerating the convergence of value iteration    the method has been evaluated on an array of benchmark problems and    was found to be very effective it enabled value iteration to converge    after only a few iterations on all the test problems



x  chen and p  van beek 2001 conflictdirected backjumping revisited volume 14 pages 5381

in recent years many improvements to backtracking algorithms for    solving constraint satisfaction problems have been proposed    the techniques for improving backtracking algorithms can    be conveniently classified as lookahead schemes and    lookback schemes  unfortunately lookahead and lookback    schemes are not entirely orthogonal as it has been observed    empirically that the enhancement of lookahead techniques    is sometimes counterproductive to the effects of lookback    techniques in this paper we focus on the relationship between    the two most important lookahead techniquesusing a variable    ordering heuristic and maintaining a level of local consistency    during the backtracking searchand the lookback technique of    conflictdirected backjumping cbj we show that there exists    a perfect dynamic variable ordering such that cbj becomes    redundant we also show theoretically that as the level of local    consistency that is maintained in the backtracking search is    increased the less that backjumping will be an improvement    our theoretical results partially explain why a backtracking    algorithm doing more in the lookahead phase cannot benefit    more from the backjumping lookback scheme finally we show    empirically that adding cbj to a backtracking algorithm that    maintains generalized arc consistency gac an algorithm that    we refer to as gaccbj can still provide orders of magnitude    speedups our empirical results contrast with bessiere and    regins conclusion 1996 that cbj is useless to an algorithm    that maintains arc consistency



c  lusena  j  goldsmith and  m  mundhenk 2001 nonapproximability results for partially observable markov decision processes volume 14 pages 83103

we show that for several variations of partially observable    markov decision processes polynomialtime algorithms for finding    control policies are unlikely to or simply dont have guarantees of    finding policies within a constant factor or a constant summand of    optimal  here unlikely means unless some complexity classes    collapse where the collapses considered are pnp ppspace or    pexp  until or unless these collapses are shown to hold any    controlpolicy designer must choose between such performance    guarantees and efficient computation



c  boutilier and  r  i brafman 2001 partialorder planning with concurrent interacting actions volume 14 pages 105136

in order to generate plans for agents with multiple    actuators agent teams or distributed controllers we must be able to    represent and plan using concurrent actions with interacting    effects this has historically been considered a challenging task    requiring a temporal planner with the ability to reason explicitly    about time we show that with simple modifications the strips action    representation language can be used to represent interacting actions    moreover algorithms for partialorder planning require only small    modifications in order to be applied in such multiagent domains  we    demonstrate this fact by developing a sound and complete partialorder    planner for planning with concurrent interacting actions pomp that    extends existing partialorder planners in a straightforward    way these results open the way to the use of partialorder planners    for the centralized control of cooperative multiagent systems



u  straccia 2001 reasoning within fuzzy description logics volume 14 pages 137166

description logics dls are suitable wellknown logics    for managing structured knowledge  they allow reasoning about    individuals and well defined concepts ie set of individuals with    common properties  the experience in using dls in applications has    shown that in many cases we would like to extend their capabilities    in particular their use in the context of multimedia information    retrieval mir leads to the convincement that such dls should allow    the treatment of the inherent imprecision in multimedia object content    representation and retrieval           in this paper we will present a fuzzy extension of alc combining    zadehs fuzzy logic with a classical dl in particular concepts    becomes fuzzy and thus reasoning about imprecise concepts is    supported  we will define its syntax its semantics describe its    properties and present a constraint propagation calculus for reasoning    in it



r  kusters and  a  borgida 2001 whats in an attribute consequences for the least common subsumer volume 14 pages 167203

functional relationships between objects called    attributes are of considerable importance in knowledge    representation languages including description logics dls a study    of the literature indicates that papers have made often implicitly    different assumptions about the nature of attributes whether they are    always required to have a value or whether they can be partial    functions the work presented here is the first explicit study of this    difference for subclasses of the classic dl involving the sameas    concept constructor  it is shown that although determining    subsumption between concept descriptions has the same complexity    though requiring different algorithms the story is different in the    case of determining the least common subsumer lcs for attributes    interpreted as partial functions the lcs exists and can be computed    relatively easily even in this case our results correct and extend    three previous papers about the lcs of dls  in the case where    attributes must have a value the lcs may not exist and even if it    exists it may be of exponential size  interestingly it is possible    to decide in polynomial time if the lcs exists



r  debruyne and  c  bessiere 2001 domain filtering consistencies volume 14 pages 205230

enforcing local consistencies is one of the main features    of constraint reasoning which level of local consistency should be    used when searching for solutions in a constraint network is a basic    question arc consistency and partial forms of arc consistency have    been widely studied and have been known for sometime through the    forward checking or the mac search algorithms until recently    stronger forms of local consistency remained limited to those that    change the structure of the constraint graph and thus could not be    used in practice especially on large networks this paper focuses on    the local consistencies that are stronger than arc consistency    without changing the structure of the network ie only removing    inconsistent values from the domains in the last five years several    such local consistencies have been proposed by us or by others we    make an overview of all of them and highlight some relations between    them we compare them both theoretically and experimentally    considering their pruning efficiency and the time required to enforce    them

the growing need to manage and exploit the proliferation of    online data sources is opening up new opportunities for bringing    people closer to the resources they need  for instance consider a    recommendation service through which researchers can receive daily    pointers to journal papers in their fields of interest we survey some    of the known approaches to the problem of technical paper    recommendation and ask how they can be extended to deal with multiple    information sources more specifically we focus on a variant of this    problem  recommending conference paper submissions to reviewing    committee members  which offers us a testbed to try different    approaches  using whirl  an information integration system  we    are able to implement different recommendation algorithms derived from    information retrieval principles we also use a novel autonomous    procedure for gathering reviewer interest information from the web we    evaluate our approach and compare it to other methods using preference    data provided by members of the aaai98 conference reviewing committee    along with data about the actual submissions

2005 ijcaijair best paper prize

we describe and evaluate the algorithmic techniques that are    used in the ff planning system like the hsp system ff relies on    forward state space search using a heuristic that estimates goal    distances by ignoring delete lists unlike hsps heuristic our method    does not assume facts to be independent we introduce a novel search    strategy that combines hillclimbing with systematic search and we    show how other powerful heuristic information can be extracted and    used to prune the search space ff was the most successful automatic    planner at the recent aips2000 planning competition we review the    results of the competition give data for other benchmark domains and    investigate the reasons for the runtime performance of ff compared to    hsp
