simone  villa and fabio  stella 2016 learning continuous time bayesian networks in nonstationary domains volume 57 pages 137

nonstationary continuous time bayesian networks are introduced they allow the parents set of each node to change over continuous time three settings are developed for learning nonstationary continuous time bayesian networks from data known transition times known number of epochs and unknown number of epochs a score function for each setting is derived and the corresponding learning algorithm is developed a set of numerical experiments on synthetic data is used to compare the effectiveness of nonstationary continuous time bayesian networks to that of nonstationary dynamic bayesian networks furthermore the performance achieved by nonstationary continuous time bayesian networks is compared to that achieved by stateoftheart algorithms on four realworld datasets namely drosophila saccharomyces cerevisiae songbird and macroeconomics 



karsten  martiny and ralf  m246ller 2016 pdt logic a probabilistic doxastic temporal logic for reasoning about beliefs in multiagent systems volume 57 pages 39112

we present probabilistic doxastic temporal pdt logic a formalism to represent and reason about probabilistic beliefs and their temporal evolution in multiagent systems this formalism enables the quantification of agents beliefs through probability intervals and incorporates an explicit notion of time we discuss how over time agents dynamically change their beliefs in facts temporal rules and other agents beliefs with respect to any new information they receive we introduce an appropriate formal semantics for pdt logic and show that it is decidable alternative options of specifying problems in pdt logic are possible for these problem specifications we develop different satisfiability checking algorithms and provide complexity results for the respective decision problems the use of probability intervals enables a formal representation of probabilistic knowledge without enforcing possibly incorrect exact probability values by incorporating an explicit notion of time pdt logic provides enriched possibilities to represent and reason about temporal relations



christian  muise j  christopher beck and sheila  a mcilraith 2016 optimal partialorder plan relaxation via maxsat volume 57 pages 113149

partialorder plans pops are attractive because of their leastcommitment nature which provides enhanced plan flexibility at execution time relative to sequential plans current research on automated plan generation focuses on producing sequential plans despite the appeal of pops in this paper we examine pop generation by relaxing or modifying the action orderings of a sequential plan to optimize for plan criteria that promote flexibility our approach relies on a novel partial weighted maxsat encoding of a sequential plan that supports the minimization of deordering or reordering of actions using a similar technique we further demonstrate how to remove redundant actions from the plan and how to combine this criterion with the objective of maximizing a pops flexibility our partial weighted maxsat encoding allows us to compute a pop from a sequential plan effectively we compare the efficiency of our approach to previous methods for pop generation via sequentialplan relaxation our results show that while an existing heuristic approach consistently produces the optimal deordering of a sequential plan our approach has greater flexibility when we consider reordering the actions in the plan while also providing a guarantee of optimality we also investigate and confirm the accuracy of the standard flex metric typically used to predict the true flexibility of a pop as measured by the number of linearizations it represents



alejandro  moreo fern225ndez andrea  esuli and fabrizio  sebastiani 2016 lightweight random indexing for polylingual text classification volume 57 pages 151185

multilingual text classification mltc is a text classification task in which documents are written each in one among a set l of natural languages and in which all documents must be classified under the same classification scheme irrespective of language there are two main variants of mltc namely crosslingual text classification cltc and polylingual text classification pltc in pltc which is the focus of this paper we assume differently from cltc that for each language in l there is a representative set of training documents pltc consists of improving the accuracy of each of the l monolingual classifiers by also leveraging the training documents written in the other l 8722 1 languages the obvious solution consisting of generating a single polylingual classifier from the juxtaposed monolingual vector spaces is usually infeasible since the dimensionality of the resulting vector space is roughly l times that of a monolingual one and is thus often unmanageable as a response the use of machine translation tools or multilingual dictionaries has been proposed however these resources are not always available or are not always free to use
one machinetranslationfree and dictionaryfree method that to the best of our knowledge has never been applied to pltc before is random indexing ri we analyse ri in terms of space and time efficiency and propose a particular configuration of it that we dub lightweight random indexing  lri by running experiments on two well known public benchmarks reuters rcv1rcv2 a comparable corpus and jrcacquis a parallel one we show lri to outperform both in terms of effectiveness and efficiency a number of previously proposed machinetranslationfree and dictionaryfree pltc methods that we use as baselines



simone  parisi matteo  pirotta and marcello  restelli 2016 multiobjective reinforcement learning through continuous pareto manifold approximation volume 57 pages 187227

many realworld control applications from economics to robotics are characterized by the presence of multiple conflicting objectives in these problems the standard concept of optimality is replaced by paretooptimality and the goal is to find the pareto frontier a set of solutions representing different compromises among the objectives despite recent advances in multiobjective optimization achieving an accurate representation of the pareto frontier is still an important challenge  in this paper we propose a reinforcement learning policy gradient approach to learn a continuous approximation of the pareto   frontier in multiobjective markov decision problems momdps differently from previous policy gradient algorithms where n optimization routines are executed to have n solutions our approach performs a single gradient ascent run generating at each step an improved continuous approximation of the pareto frontier the idea is   to optimize the parameters of a function defining a manifold in the policy parameters space so that the corresponding image in the objectives space gets as close as possible to the true pareto frontier besides deriving how to compute and estimate such gradient we will also discuss the nontrivial issue of defining a metric to assess the quality of the candidate pareto frontiers finally the properties of the proposed approach are empirically evaluated on two problems a linearquadratic gaussian regulator and a water reservoir control task
