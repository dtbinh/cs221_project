d  a cohen m  c cooper p  creed d  marx and a  z salamon 2012 the tractability of csp classes defined by forbidden patterns volume 45 pages 4778

the constraint satisfaction problem csp is a general problem central to computer science and artificial intelligence  although the csp is nphard in general considerable effort has been spent on identifying tractable subclasses  the main two approaches consider structural properties restrictions on the hypergraph of constraint scopes and relational properties restrictions on the language of constraint relations  recently some authors have considered hybrid properties that restrict the constraint hypergraph and the relations simultaneously




h  vlaeminck j  vennekens m  denecker and m  bruynooghe 2012 an approximative inference method for solving 87078704so satisfiability problems volume 45 pages 79124

this paper considers the fragment 87078704so of secondorder logic many interesting problems such as conformant planning can be naturally expressed as finite domain satisfiability problems of this logic such satisfiability problems are computationally hard 931p2 and many of these problems are often solved approximately in this paper we develop a general approximative method ie a sound but incomplete method for solving 87078704so satisfiability problems we use a syntactic representation of a constraint propagation method for firstorder logic to transform such an 87078704so satisfiability problem to an 8707soid satisfiability problem secondorder logic extended with inductive definitions the finite domain satisfiability problem for the latter language is in np and can be handled by several existing solvers inductive definitions are a powerful knowledge representation tool and this moti vates us to also approximate 87078704soid problems in order to do this we first show how to perform propagation on such inductive definitions next we use this to approximate 87078704soid satisfiability problems all this provides a general theoretical framework for a number of approximative methods in the literature moreover we also show how we can use this framework for solving practical useful problems such as conformant planning in an effective way



sa  mirroshandel and g  ghassemsani 2012 towards unsupervised learning of temporal relations between events volume 45 pages 125163

automatic extraction of temporal relations between event pairs is an important task for several natural language processing applications such as question answering information extraction and summarization since most existing methods are supervised and require large corpora which for many languages do not exist we have concentrated our efforts to reduce the need for annotated data as much as possible this paper presents two different algorithms towards this goal the first algorithm is a weakly supervised machine learning approach for classification of temporal relations between events in the first stage the algorithm learns a general classifier from an annotated corpus then inspired by the hypothesis of one type of temporal relation per discourse it extracts useful information from a cluster of topically related documents we show that by combining the global information of such a cluster with local decisions of a general classifier a bootstrapping crossdocument classifier can be built to extract temporal relations between events our experiments show that without any additional annotated data the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher than that of several previous successful systems the second proposed method for temporal relation extraction is based on the expectation maximization em algorithm within em we used different techniques such as a greedy bestfirst search and integer linear programming for temporal inconsistency removal we think that the experimental results of our em based algorithm as a first step toward a fully unsupervised temporal relation extraction method is encouraging



t  voice m  polukarov and n  r jennings 2012 coalition structure generation over graphs volume 45 pages 165196

we give the analysis of the computational complexity of coalition structure generation over graphs given an undirected graph g  ne and a valuation function v  pn 8594 r over the subsets of nodes the problem is to find a partition of n into connected subsets that maximises the sum of the components values this problem is generally npcomplete in particular it is hard for a defined class of valuation functions which are independent of disconnected membersthat is two nodes have no effect on each others marginal con tribution to their vertex separator nonetheless for all such functions we provide bounds on the complexity of coalition structure generation over general and minorfree graphs our proof is constructive and yields algorithms for solving corresponding instances of the problem furthermore we derive linear time bounds for graphs of bounded treewidth however as we show the problem remains npcomplete for planar graphs and hence for any kk minorfree graphs where k 8805 5 moreover a 3sat problem with m clauses can be represented by a coalition structure generation problem over a planar graph with om2 nodes importantly our hardness result holds for a particular subclass of valuation functions termed edge sum where the value of each subset of nodes is simply determined by the sum of given weights of the edges in the induced subgraph



b  cuenca grau and b  motik 2012 reasoning over ontologies with hidden content the importbyquery approach volume 45 pages 197255

there is currently a growing interest in techniques for hiding parts of the signature of an ontology kh that is being reused by another ontology kv towards this goal in this paper we propose the importbyquery framework which makes the content of kh accessible through a limited query interface if kv reuses the symbols from kh in a certain restricted way one can reason over kv u kh by accessing only kv and the query interface we map out the landscape of the importbyquery problem in particular we outline the limitations of our framework and prove that certain restrictions on the expressivity of kh and the way in which kv reuses symbols from kh are strictly necessary to enable reasoning in our setting we also identify cases in which reasoning is possible and we present suitable importbyquery reasoning algorithms




r  hoshino and k  kawarabayashi 2012 generating approximate solutions to the ttp using a linear distance relaxation volume 45 pages 257286

in some domestic professional sports leagues the home stadiums are located in cities connected by a common train line running in one direction for these instances we can incorporate this geographical information to determine optimal or nearlyoptimal solutions to the nteam traveling tournament problem ttp an nphard sports scheduling problem whose solution is a double roundrobin tournament schedule that minimizes the sum total of distances traveled by all n teams
we conclude the paper by applying this linear distance relaxation to general nonlinear nteam ttp instances where we develop fast approximate solutions by simply assuming the n teams lie on a straight line and solving the modified problem we show that this technique surprisingly generates the distanceoptimal tournament on all benchmark sets on 6 teams as well as closetooptimal schedules for larger n even when the teams are located around a circle or positioned in threedimensional space



p  gutierrez and p  meseguer 2012 removing redundant messages in nary bnbadopt volume 45 pages 287304

this note considers how to modify  bnbadopt a wellknown algorithm for optimally solving distributed constraint optimization problems with a double aim i   to avoid sending most of the redundant messages and ii to handle cost functions of any arity some of the messages exchanged by bnbadopt  turned out to be redundant removing most of the redundant messages increases substantially communication efficiency the number of exchanged messages is  in most cases  at least three times fewer keeping the other measures almost unchanged and termination and optimality are maintained on the other hand handling nary cost functions was addressed in the original work but the presence of thresholds makes their practical usage more complex both issues  removing most of the redundant messages and efficiently handling nary cost functions  can be combined producing the new version bnbadopt experimentally we show the benefits of this  version over the original one 



a  m rush and m  j  collins 2012 a tutorial on dual decomposition and lagrangian relaxation for inference in natural language processing volume 45 pages 305362

dual decomposition and more generally lagrangian relaxation is a classical method for combinatorial optimization it has recently been applied to several inference problems in natural language processing nlp this tutorial gives an overview of the technique we describe example algorithms describe formal guarantees for the method and describe practical issues in implementing the algorithms while our examples are predominantly drawn from the nlp literature the material should be of general relevance to inference problems in machine learning a central theme of this tutorial is that lagrangian relaxation is naturally applied in conjunction with a broad class of combinatorial algorithms allowing inference in models that go significantly beyond previous work on lagrangian relaxation for inference in graphical models




r  a rossi l  k mcdowell d  w aha and j  neville 2012 transforming graph data for statistical relational learning volume 45 pages 363441

relational data representations have become an increasingly important topic due to the recent proliferation of network datasets eg social biological information networks and a corresponding increase in the application of statistical relational learning srl algorithms to these domains in this article we examine and categorize techniques for transforming graphbased relational data to improve srl algorithms in particular appropriate transformations of the nodes links andor features of the data can dramatically affect the capabilities and results of srl algorithms we introduce an intuitive taxonomy for data representation transformations in relational domains that incorporates link transformation and node transformation as symmetric representation tasks more specifically the transformation tasks for both nodes and links include i predicting their existence ii predicting their label or type iii estimating their weight or importance and iv system atically constructing their relevant features we motivate our taxonomy through detailed examples and use it to survey competing approaches for each of these tasks we also dis cuss general conditions for transforming links nodes and features finally we highlight challenges that remain to be addressed

pseudoboolean constraints are omnipresent in practical applications and thus a significant effort has been devoted to the development of good sat encoding techniques for them some of these encodings first construct a binary decision diagram bdd for the constraint and then encode the bdd into a propositional formula  these bddbased approaches have some important advantages such as not being dependent on the size of the coefficients or being able to share the same bdd for representing many constraints




u  endriss u  grandi and d  porello 2012 complexity of judgment aggregation volume 45 pages 481514

we analyse the computational complexity of three problems in judgment aggregation 1 computing a collective judgment from a profile of individual judgments the winner determination problem 2 deciding whether a given agent can influence the outcome of a judgment aggregation procedure in her favour by reporting insincere judgments the strategic manipulation problem and 3 deciding whether a given judgment aggregation scenario is guaranteed to result in a logically consistent outcome independently from what the judgments supplied by the individuals are the problem of the safety of the agenda we provide results both for specific aggregation procedures the quota rules the premisebased procedure and a distancebased procedure and for classes of aggregation procedures characterised in terms of fundamental axioms




j  garcia and f  fernandez 2012 safe exploration of state and action spaces in reinforcement learning volume 45 pages 515564

in this paper we consider the important problem of safe exploration in reinforcement learning while reinforcement learning is wellsuited to domains with complex transition dynamics and highdimensional stateaction spaces an additional challenge is posed by the need for safe and efficient exploration traditional exploration techniques are not particularly useful for solving dangerous tasks where the trial and error process may lead to the selection of actions whose execution in some states may result in damage to the learning system or any other system consequently when an agent begins an interaction with a dangerous and highdimensional stateaction space an important question arises namely that of how to avoid or at least minimize damage caused by the exploration of the stateaction space we introduce the pisrl algorithm which safely improves suboptimal albeit robust behaviors for continuous state and action control tasks and which efficiently learns from the experience gained from the environment we evaluate the proposed method in four complex tasks automatic car parking polebalancing helicopter hovering and business management




r  i brafman and g  shani 2012 replanning in domains with partial information and sensing actions volume 45 pages 565600

replanning via determinization is a recent popular approach for online planning in mdps in this paper we adapt this idea to classical nonstochastic domains with partial information and sensing actions presenting a new planner sdr sample determinize replan at each step we generate a  solution plan to a classical planning problem induced by the original problem we execute this plan as long as it is safe to do so when this is no longer the case we replan the classical planning problem we generate is based on the translationbased approach for conformant planning introduced by palacios and geffner the state of the classical planning problem generated in this approach captures the belief state of the agent in the original problem unfortunately when this method is applied to planning problems with sensing it yields a nondeterministic planning problem that is typically very large our main contribution is the introduction of state sampling techniques for overcoming these two problems in addition we introduce a novel lazy regressionbased method for querying the agents belief state during runtime  we provide a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the planner showing that it scales better than the stateoftheart clg planner on existing benchmark problems but also highlighting its weaknesses with new domains  we also discuss its theoretical guarantees



g  de cooman and e  miranda 2012 irrelevant and independent natural extension for sets of desirable gambles volume 45 pages 601640

the results in this paper add useful tools to the theory of sets of desirable gambles a growing toolbox for reasoning with partial probability assessments we investigate how to combine a number of marginal coherent sets of desirable gambles into a joint set using the properties of epistemic irrelevance and independence we provide formulas for the smallest such joint called their independent natural extension and study its main properties the independent natural extension of maximal coherent sets of desirable gambles allows us to define the strong product of sets of desirable gambles finally we explore an easy way to generalise these results to also apply for the conditional versions of epistemic irrelevance and independence   having such a set of tools that are easily implemented in computer programs is clearly beneficial to fields like ai with a clear interest in coherent reasoning under uncertainty using general and robust uncertainty models that require no full specification

given a current news event we tackle the problem of generating plausible predictions of future events it might cause  we present a new methodology for modeling and predicting such future news events using machine learning and data mining techniques our pundit algorithm generalizes examples of causality pairs to infer a causality predictor  to obtain precisely labeled causality examples we mine 150 years of news articles and apply semantic natural language modeling techniques to headlines containing certain predefined causality patterns  for generalization the model uses a vast number of world knowledge ontologies  empirical evaluation on real news articles shows that our pundit algorithm performs as well as nonexpert humans



h  t dinh h  t dinh l  michel and a  russell 2012 the time complexity of a with approximate heuristics on multiplesolution search spaces volume 45 pages 685729

we study the behavior of the a search algorithm when coupled with a heuristic h satisfying 1epsilon1h  h 1epsilon2h where 0  epsilon1 epsilon2  1 are small constants and h denotes the optimal cost to a solution we prove a rigorous general upper bound on the time complexity of a search on trees that depends on both the accuracy of the heuristic and the distribution of solutions our upper bound is essentially tight in the worst case in fact we show nearly matching lower bounds that are attained even by nonadversarially chosen solution sets induced by a simple stochastic model a consequence of our rigorous results is that the effective branching factor of the search will be reduced as long as epsilon1epsilon2  1 and the number of nearoptimal solutions in the search tree is not too large we go on to provide an upper bound for a search on graphs and in this context establish a bound on running time determined by the spectrum of the graph




m  bodirsky and m  hils 2012 tractable set constraints volume 45 pages 731759

many fundamental problems in artificial intelligence knowledge representation and verification involve reasoning about sets and relations between sets and can be modeled as set constraint satisfaction problems set csps such problems are frequently intractable but there are several important set csps that are known to be polynomialtime tractable  we introduce a large class of set csps that can be solved in quadratic time  our class which we call ei contains all previously known tractable set csps but also some new ones that are of crucial importance for example in description logics  the class of ei set constraints has an elegant universalalgebraic characterization which we use to show that every set constraint language that properly contains all ei set constraints already has a finite sublanguage with an nphard constraint satisfaction problem
