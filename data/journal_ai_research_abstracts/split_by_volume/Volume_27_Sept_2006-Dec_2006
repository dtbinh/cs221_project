a  epshteyn and g  dejong 2006 generative prior knowledge for discriminative classification volume 27 pages 2553

we present a novel framework for integrating prior knowledge into discriminative classifiers  our framework allows discriminative classifiers such as support vector machines svms to utilize prior knowledge specified in the generative setting the dual objective of fitting the data and respecting prior knowledge is formulated as a bilevel program which is solved approximately via iterative application of secondorder cone programming  to test our approach we consider the problem of using wordnet a semantic database of english language to improve lowsample classification accuracy of newsgroup categorization  wordnet is viewed as an approximate but readily available source of background knowledge and our framework is capable of utilizing it in a flexible way




j  y chai z  prasov and s  qu 2006 cognitive principles in robust multimodal interpretation volume 27 pages 5583

multimodal conversational interfaces provide a natural means for users to communicate with computer systems through multiple modalities such as speech and gesture to build effective multimodal interfaces automated interpretation of user multimodal inputs is important inspired by the previous investigation on cognitive status in multimodal human machine interaction we have developed a greedy algorithm for interpreting user referring expressions ie multimodal reference resolution this algorithm incorporates the cognitive principles of conversational implicature and givenness hierarchy and applies constraints from various sources eg temporal semantic and contextual to resolve references our empirical results have shown the advantage of this algorithm in efficiently resolving a variety of user references because of its simplicity and generality this approach has the potential to improve the robustness of multimodal input interpretation



m  lapata and a  lascarides 2006 learning sentenceinternal temporal relations volume 27 pages 85117

in this paper we propose a data intensive approach for inferring sentenceinternal temporal relations temporal inference is relevant for practical nlp applications which either extract or synthesize temporal information eg summarisation question answering  our method bypasses the need for manual coding by exploiting the presence of markers like after which overtly signal a temporal relation we first show that models trained on main and subordinate clauses connected with a temporal marker achieve good performance on a pseudodisambiguation task simulating temporal inference during testing the temporal marker is treated as unseen and the models must select the right marker from a set of possible candidates  secondly we assess whether the proposed approach holds promise for the semiautomatic creation of temporal annotations  specifically we use a model trained on noisy and approximate data ie main and subordinate clauses to predict intrasentential relations present in timebank a corpus annotated rich temporal information  our experiments compare and contrast several probabilistic models differing in their feature space linguistic assumptions and data requirements  we evaluate performance against gold standard corpora and also against human subjects 



j  oh k  choi and h  isahara 2006 a comparison of different machine transliteration models volume 27 pages 119151

machine transliteration is a method for automatically converting words in one language into phonetically equivalent ones in another language machine transliteration plays an important role in natural language applications such as information retrieval and machine translation especially for handling proper nouns and technical terms four machine transliteration models  graphemebased transliteration model phonemebased transliteration model hybrid transliteration model and correspondencebased transliteration model  have been proposed by several researchers to date however there has been little research on a framework in which multiple transliteration models can operate simultaneously furthermore there has been no comparison of the four models within the same framework and using the same data we addressed these problems by 1 modeling the four models within the same framework 2 comparing them under the same conditions and 3 developing a way to improve machine transliteration through this comparison our comparison showed that the hybrid and correspondencebased models were the most effective and that the four models can be used in a complementary manner to improve machine transliteration performance



b  kveton m  hauskrecht and c  guestrin 2006 solving factored mdps with hybrid state and action variables volume 27 pages 153201

efficient representations and solutions for large decision problems with continuous and discrete variables are among the most important challenges faced by the designers of automated decision support systems in this paper we describe a novel hybrid factored markov decision process mdp model that allows for a compact representation of these problems and a new hybrid approximate linear programming halp framework that permits their efficient solutions the central idea of halp is to approximate the optimal value function by a linear combination of basis functions and optimize its weights by linear programming we analyze both theoretical and computational aspects of this approach and demonstrate its scaleup potential on several hybrid optimization problems




i  muslea s  minton and c  a knoblock 2006 active learning with multiple views volume 27 pages 203233

active learners alleviate the burden of labeling large amounts of data by detecting and asking the user to label only the most informative examples in the domain  we focus here on active learning for multiview domains in which there are several disjoint subsets of features views each of which is sufficient to learn the target concept  in this paper we make several contributions first we introduce cotesting which is the first approach to multiview active learning  second we extend the multiview learning framework by also exploiting weak views which are adequate only for learning a concept that is more generalspecific than the target concept  finally we empirically show that cotesting outperforms existing active learners on a variety of real world domains such as wrapper induction web page classification advertisement removal and discourse tree parsing




m  fox and d  long 2006 modelling mixed discretecontinuous domains for planning volume 27 pages 235297

in this paper we present pddl a planning domain description language for modelling mixed discretecontinuous planning domains we describe the syntax and modelling style of pddl showing that the language makes convenient the modelling of complex timedependent effects we provide a formal semantics for pddl by mapping planning instances into constructs of hybrid automata using the syntax of has as our semantic model we construct a semantic mapping to labelled transition systems to complete the formal interpretation of pddl planning instances an advantage of building a mapping from pddl to ha theory is that it forms a bridge between the planning and real time systems research communities one consequence is that we can expect to make use of some of the theoretical properties of has for example for a restricted class of has the reachability problem which is equivalent to plan existence is decidable pddl provides an alternative to the continuous durative action model of pddl21 adding a more flexible and robust model of timedependent behaviour



l  liu and m  truszczynski 2006 properties and applications of programs with monotone and convex constraints volume 27 pages 299334

we study properties of programs with monotone and convex constraints we extend to these formalisms concepts and results from normal logic programming they include the notions of strong and uniform equivalence with their characterizations tight programs and fages lemma program completion and loop formulas our results provide an abstract account of properties of some recent extensions of logic programming with aggregates especially the formalism of lparse programs they imply a method to compute stable models of lparse programs by means of offtheshelf solvers of pseudoboolean constraints which is often much faster than the smodels system



j  pineau g  gordon and s  thrun 2006 anytime pointbased approximations for large pomdps volume 27 pages 335380

the partially observable markov decision process has long been recognized as a rich framework for realworld planning and control problems especially in robotics however exact solutions in this framework are typically computationally intractable for all but the smallest problems  a wellknown technique for speeding up pomdp solving involves performing value backups at specific belief points rather than over the entire belief simplex the efficiency of this approach however depends greatly on the selection of points  this paper presents a set of novel techniques for selecting informative belief points which work well in practice the point selection procedure is combined with pointbased value backups to form an effective anytime pomdp algorithm called pointbased value iteration pbvi the first aim of this paper is to introduce this algorithm and present a theoretical analysis justifying the choice of belief selection technique the second aim of this paper is to provide a thorough empirical comparison between pbvi and other stateoftheart pomdp methods in particular the perseus algorithm in an effort to highlight their similarities and differences evaluation is performed using both standard pomdp domains and realistic robotic tasks



s  s fatima m  j wooldridge and n  r jennings 2006 multiissue negotiation with deadlines volume 27 pages 381417

this paper studies bilateral multiissue negotiation between selfinterested autonomous agents now there are a number of different procedures that can be used for this process the three main ones being the package deal procedure in which all the issues are bundled and discussed together the simultaneous procedure in which the issues are discussed simultaneously but independently of each other and the sequential procedure in which the issues are discussed one after another since each of them yields a different outcome a key problem is to decide which one to use in which circumstances specifically we consider this question for a model in which the agents have time constraints in the form of both deadlines and discount factors and information uncertainty in that the agents do not know the opponents utility function for this model we consider issues that are both independent and those that are interdependent and determine equilibria for each case for each procedure in so doing we show that the package deal is in fact the optimal procedure for each party we then go on to show that although the package deal may be computationally more complex than the other two procedures it generates pareto optimal outcomes unlike the other two it has similar earliest and latest possible times of agreement to the simultaneous procedure which is better than the sequential procedure and that it like the other two procedures generates a unique outcome only under certain conditions which we define 




s  hoelldobler e  karabaev and o  skvortsova 2006 flucap a heuristic search planner for firstorder mdps volume 27 pages 419439

we present a heuristic search algorithm for solving firstorder markov decision processes fomdps our approach combines firstorder state abstraction that avoids evaluating states individually and heuristic search that avoids evaluating all states firstly in contrast to existing systems which start with propositionalizing the fomdp and then perform state abstraction on its propositionalized version we apply state abstraction directly on the fomdp avoiding propositionalization this kind of abstraction is referred to as firstorder state abstraction secondly guided by an admissible heuristic the search is restricted to those states that are reachable from the initial state we demonstrate the usefulness of the above techniques for solving fomdps with a system referred to as flucap formerly fcplanner that entered the probabilistic track of the 2004 international planning competition ipc2004 and demonstrated an advantage over other planners on the problems represented in firstorder terms




y  zhang and r  h c yap 2006 set intersection and consistency in constraint networks volume 27 pages 441464

in this paper we show that there is a close relation between consistency in a constraint network and set intersection a proof schema is provided as a generic way to obtain consistency properties from properties on set intersection this approach not only simplifies the understanding of and unifies many existing consistency results but also directs the study of consistency to that of set intersection properties in many situations as demonstrated by the results on the convexity and tightness of constraints in this paper specifically we identify a new class of tree convex constraints where local consistency ensures global consistency this generalizes row convex constraints various consistency results are also obtained on constraint networks where only some in contrast to all in the existing workconstraints are tight 




p  viappiani b  faltings and p  pu 2006 preferencebased search using examplecritiquing with suggestions volume 27 pages 465503

we consider interactive tools that help users search for their most preferred item in a large collection of options in particular we examine examplecritiquing a technique for enabling users to incrementally construct preference models by critiquing example options that are presented to them we present novel techniques for improving the examplecritiquing technology by adding suggestions to its displayed options such suggestions are calculated based on an analysis of users current preference model and their potential hidden preferences we evaluate the performance of our modelbased suggestion techniques with both synthetic and real users  results show that such suggestions are highly attractive to users and can stimulate them to express more preferences to improve the chance of identifying their most preferred item by up to 78



d  a dolgov and e  h durfee 2006 resource allocation among agents with mdpinduced preferences volume 27 pages 505549

allocating scarce resources among agents to maximize global utility is in general computationally challenging  we focus on problems where resources enable agents to execute actions in stochastic environments modeled as markov decision processes mdps such that the value of a resource bundle is defined as the expected value of the optimal mdp policy realizable given these resources  we present an algorithm that simultaneously solves the resourceallocation and the policyoptimization problems  this allows us to avoid explicitly representing utilities over exponentially many resource bundles leading to drastic often exponential reductions in computational complexity  we then use this algorithm in the context of selfinterested agents to design a combinatorial auction for allocating resources we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by showing that it can in minutes optimally solve problems for which a straightforward combinatorial resourceallocation technique would require the agents to enumerate up to 2100 resource bundles and the auctioneer to solve an npcomplete problem with an input of that size



o  yilmaz and a c cem  say 2006 causes of ineradicable spurious predictions in qualitative simulation volume 27 pages 551575

it was recently proved that a sound and complete qualitative simulator does not exist that is as long as the inputoutput vocabulary of the stateoftheart qsim algorithm is used there will always be input models which cause any simulator with a coverage guarantee to make spurious predictions in its output in this paper we examine whether a meaningfully expressive restriction of this vocabulary is possible so that one can build a simulator with both the soundness and completeness properties we prove several negative results all sound qualitative simulators employing subsets of the qsim representation which retain the operating region transition feature and support at least the addition and constancy constraints are shown to be inherently incomplete even when the simulations are restricted to run in a single operating region a constraint vocabulary containing just the addition constancy derivative and multiplication relations makes the construction of sound and complete qualitative simulators impossible

f  rossi k  b venable and n  yorkesmith 2006 uncertainty in soft temporal constraint problemsa general framework and controllability algorithms forthe fuzzy case volume 27 pages 617674

in reallife temporal scenarios uncertainty and preferences are often  essential and coexisting aspects  we present a formalism where quantitative temporal constraints with both preferences and uncertainty can be defined  we show how three classical notions of controllability that is strong weak and dynamic which have been developed for uncertain temporal problems can be generalized to handle preferences as well after defining this general framework we focus on problems where preferences follow the fuzzy approach and with properties that assure tractability for such problems we propose algorithms to check the presence of the controllability properties in particular we show that in such a setting dealing simultaneously with preferences and uncertainty does not increase the complexity of controllability testing  we also develop a dynamic execution algorithm of polynomial complexity that produces temporal plans under uncertainty that are optimal with respect to fuzzy preferences
