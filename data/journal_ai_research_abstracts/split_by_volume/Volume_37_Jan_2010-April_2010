g  tsatsaronis i  varlamis and m  vazirgiannis 2010 text relatedness based on a word thesaurus volume 37 pages 139

the computation of relatedness between two fragments of text in an automated manner requires taking into account a wide range of factors pertaining to the meaning the two fragments convey and the pairwise relations between their words without doubt a measure of relatedness between text segments must take into account both the lexical and the semantic relatedness between words such a measure that captures well both aspects of text relatedness may help in many tasks such as text retrieval classification and clustering in this paper we present a new approach for measuring the semantic relatedness between words based on their implicit semantic links the approach exploits only a word thesaurus in order to devise implicit semantic links between words based on this approach we introduce omiotis a new measure of semantic relatedness between texts which capitalizes on the wordtoword semantic relatedness measure sr and extends it to measure the relatedness between texts we gradually validate our method we first evaluate the performance of the semantic relatedness measure between individual words covering wordtoword similarity and relatedness synonym identification and word analogy then we proceed with evaluating the performance of our method in measuring texttotext semantic relatedness in two tasks namely sentencetosentence similarity and paraphrase recognition experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms every lexiconbased method of semantic relatedness in the selected tasks and the used data sets and competes well against corpusbased and hybrid approaches 



u  zahavi a  felner n  burch and r  c holte 2010 predicting the performance of ida using conditional distributions volume 37 pages 4183

korf reid and edelkamp introduced a formula to predict the number of nodes ida will expand on a single iteration for a given consistent heuristic and experimentally demonstrated that it could make very accurate predictions in this paper we show that in addition to requiring the heuristic to be consistent their formulas predictions are accurate only at levels of the bruteforce search tree where the heuristic values obey the unconditional distribution that they defined and then used in their formula we then propose a new formula that works well without these requirements ie it can  make accurate predictions of idas performance for inconsistent heuristics and if the heuristic values in any
level do not obey the unconditional distribution in order to achieve this we introduce the conditional distribution of heuristic values which is a generalization of their unconditional heuristic distribution we also provide extensions of our formula that handle individual start states and the augmentation of ida with bidirectional pathmax bpmx a technique for propagating heuristic values when inconsistent heuristics are used experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of our new method and all its variations



s  dobzinski and n  nisan 2010 mechanisms for multiunit auctions volume 37 pages 8598

we present an incentivecompatible polynomialtime approximation scheme for multiunit auctions with general kminded player valuations the mechanism fully optimizes over an appropriately chosen subrange of possible allocations and then uses vcg payments over this subrange we show that obtaining a fully polynomialtime incentivecompatible approximation scheme at least using vcg payments is nphard for the case of valuations given by black boxes we give a polynomialtime incentivecompatible 2approximation mechanism and show that no better is possible at least using vcg payments



h  r andersen t  hadzic and d  pisinger 2010 interactive cost configuration over decision diagrams volume 37 pages 99139

in many ai domains such as product configuration a user should interactively specify a solution that must satisfy  a set of constraints in such scenarios offline compilation of feasible solutions into a tractable representation is an important approach to delivering efficient backtrackfree  user interaction online in particularbinary decision diagrams bdds have been successfully used as a compilation target for product and service configuration in this paper we discuss how to extend bddbased configuration to scenarios involving cost functions which express user preferences
we first show that an efficient robust and easy to implement extension is possible if the cost function is additive and feasible solutions are represented using multivalued decision diagrams mdds we also discuss the effect on mdd size if the cost function is nonadditive or if it is encoded explicitly into mdd we then discuss interactive configuration in the presence of multiple cost functions we prove that even in its simplest form multiplecost configuration is nphard in the input mdd however for solving twocost configuration we develop a pseudopolynomial scheme and a fully polynomial approximation scheme the applicability of our approach is demonstrated through experiments over realworld configuration models and productcatalogue datasets response times are generally within a fraction of a second even for very large instances 



p  d turney and p  pantel 2010 from frequency to meaning vector space models of semantics volume 37 pages 141188

computers understand very little of the meaning of human language this profoundly limits our ability to give instructions to computers the ability of computers to explain their actions to us and the ability of computers to analyse and process text vector space models vsms of semantics are beginning to address these limits this paper surveys the use of vsms for semantic processing of text we organize the literature on vsms according to the structure of the matrix in a vsm there are currently three broad classes of vsms based on termdocument wordcontext and pairpattern matrices yielding three classes of applications we survey a broad range of applications in these three categories and we take a detailed look at a specific open source project in each category our goal in this survey is to show the breadth of applications of vsms for semantics to provide a new perspective on vsms for those who are already familiar with the area and to provide pointers into the literature for those who are less familiar with the field



i  j varzinczak 2010 on action theory change volume 37 pages 189246

as historically acknowledged in the reasoning about actions and change community intuitiveness of a logical domain description cannot be fully automated moreover like any other logical theory action theories may also evolve and thus knowledge engineers need revision methods to help in accommodating new incoming information about the behavior of actions in an adequate manner the present work is about changing action domain descriptions in multimodal logic its contribution is threefold first we revisit the semantics of action theory contraction proposed in previous work giving more robust operators that express minimal change based on a notion of distance between kripkemodels second we give algorithms for syntactical action theory contraction and establish their correctness with respect to our semantics for those action theories that satisfy a principle of modularity investigated in previous work since modularity can be ensured for every action theory and as we show here needs to be computed at most once during the evolution of a domain description it does not represent a limitation at all to the method here studied finally we state agmlike postulates for action theory contraction and assess the behavior of our operators with respect to them moreover we also address the revision counterpart of action theory change showing that it benefits from our semantics for contraction



s  qu and j  y chai 2010 contextbased word acquisition for situated dialogue in a virtual world volume 37 pages 247277

to tackle the vocabulary problem in conversational systems previous work has applied unsupervised learning approaches on cooccurring  speech and eye gaze during interaction to automatically acquire new words although these approaches have shown promise several issues related to human language behavior and humanmachine conversation have not been addressed first psycholinguistic studies have shown certain temporal regularities between human eye movement and language production while these regularities can potentially guide the acquisition process they have not been incorporated in the previous unsupervised approaches second conversational systems generally have an existing knowledge base about the domain and vocabulary while the existing knowledge can potentially help bootstrap and constrain the acquired new words it has not been incorporated in the previous models third eye gaze could serve different functions in humanmachine conversation some gaze streams may not be closely coupled with speech stream and thus are potentially detrimental to word acquisition automated recognition of closelycoupled speechgaze streams based on conversation context is important to address these issues we developed new approaches that incorporate user language behavior domain knowledge and conversation context in word acquisition we evaluated these approaches in the context of situated dialogue in a virtual world our experimental results have shown that incorporating the above three types of contextual information significantly improves word acquisition performance



r  mateescu k  kask v  gogate and r  dechter 2010 joingraph propagation algorithms volume 37 pages 279328

the paper investigates parameterized approximate messagepassing schemes that are based on bounded inference and are inspired by pearls belief propagation algorithm bp we start with the bounded inference miniclustering algorithm and then move to the iterative scheme called iterative joingraph propagation ijgp that combines both iteration and bounded inference algorithm ijgp belongs to the class of generalized belief propagation algorithms a framework that allowed connections with approximate algorithms from statistical physics and is shown empirically to surpass the performance of miniclustering and belief propagation as well as a number of other stateoftheart algorithms on several classes of networks we also provide insight into the accuracy of iterative bp and ijgp by relating these algorithms to well known classes of constraint propagation schemes



r  aras and a  dutech 2010 an investigation into mathematical programming for finite horizon decentralized pomdps volume 37 pages 329396

decentralized planning in uncertain environments is a complex task generally dealt with by using a decisiontheoretic approach mainly through the framework of decentralized partially observable markov decision processes decpomdps although decpomdps are a general and powerful modeling tool solving them is a task with an overwhelming complexity that can be doubly exponential in this paper we study an alternate formulation of decpomdps relying on a sequenceform representation of policies from this formulation we show how to derive mixed integer linear programming milp problems that once solved give exact optimal solutions to the decpomdps we show that these milps can be derived either by using some combinatorial characteristics of the optimal solutions of the decpomdps or by using concepts borrowed from game theory through an experimental validation on classical test problems from the decpomdp literature we compare our approach to existing algorithms results show that mathematical programming outperforms dynamic programming but is less efficient than forward search except for some particular problems
the main contributions of this work are the use of mathematical programming for decpomdps and a better understanding of decpomdps and of their solutions besides we argue that our alternate representation of decpomdps could be helpful for designing novel algorithms looking for approximate solutions to decpomdps



d  l chen j  kim and r  j mooney 2010 training a multilingual sportscaster using perceptual context to learn language volume 37 pages 397435

we present a novel framework for learning to interpret and generate language using only perceptual context as supervision  we demonstrate its capabilities by developing a system that learns to sportscast simulated robot soccer games in both english and korean without any languagespecific prior knowledge  training employs only ambiguous supervision consisting of a stream of descriptive textual comments and a sequence of events extracted from the simulation trace  the system simultaneously establishes correspondences between individual comments and the events that they describe while building a translation model that supports both parsing and generation we also present a novel algorithm for learning which events are worth describing  human evaluations of the generated commentaries indicate they are of reasonable quality and in some cases even on par with those produced by humans for our limited domain



w  van der hoek d  walther and m  wooldridge 2010 reasoning about the transfer of control volume 37 pages 437477

 we present dclpc a logic for reasoning about how the abilities of agents and coalitions of agents are altered by transferring control from one agent to another the logical foundation of dclpc is clpc a logic for reasoning about cooperation in which the abilities of agents and coalitions of agents stem from a distribution of atomic boolean variables to individual agents  the choices available to a coalition correspond to assignments to the variables the coalition controls the basic modal constructs of dclpc are of the form coalition c can cooperate to bring about phi dclpc extends clpc with dynamic logic modalities in which atomic programs are of the form agent i gives control of variable p to agent j as usual in dynamic logic these atomic programs may be combined using sequence iteration choice and test operators to form complex programs by combining such dynamic transfer programs with cooperation modalities it becomes possible to reason about how the power of agents and coalitions is affected by the transfer of control we give two alternative semantics for the logic a direct semantics in which we capture the distributions of boolean variables to agents and a more conventional kripke semantics we prove that these semantics are equivalent and then present an axiomatization for the logic we investigate the computational complexity of model checking and satisfiability for dclpc and show that both problems are pspacecomplete and hence no worse than the underlying logic clpc finally we investigate the characterisation of control in dclpc we distinguish between firstorder control  the ability of an agent or coalition to control some state of affairs through the assignment of values to the variables under the control of the agent or coalition  and secondorder control  the ability of an agent to exert control over the control that other agents have by transferring variables to other agents we give a logical characterisation of secondorder control



y  engel and m  p wellman 2010 multiattribute auctions based on generalized additive independence volume 37 pages 479525

we develop multiattribute auctions that accommodate generalized additive independent gai preferences we propose an iterative auction mechanism that maintains prices on potentially overlapping gai clusters of attributes thus decreases elicitation and computational burden and creates an open competition among suppliers over a multidimensional domain most significantly the auction is guaranteed to achieve surplus which approximates optimal welfare up to a small additive factor under reasonable equilibrium strategies of traders the main departure of gai auctions from previous literature is to accommodate nonadditive trader preferences hence allowing traders to condition their evaluation of specific attributes on the value of other attributes at the same time the gai structure supports a compact representation of prices enabling a tractable auction process we perform a simulation study demonstrating and quantifying the significant efficiency advantage of more expressive preference modeling we draw random gaistructured utility functions with various internal structures generate additive functions that approximate the gai utility and compare the performance of the auctions using the two representations we find that allowing traders to express existing dependencies among attributes improves the economic efficiency of multiattribute auctions
