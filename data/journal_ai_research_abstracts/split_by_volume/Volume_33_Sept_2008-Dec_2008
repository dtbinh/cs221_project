s  esmeir and s  markovitch 2008 anytime induction of lowcost lowerror classifiers a samplingbased approach volume 33 pages 131

machine learning techniques are gaining prevalence in the production of a wide range of classifiers for complex realworld applications with nonuniform testing and misclassification costs the increasing complexity of these applications poses a real challenge to resource management during learning and classification in this work we introduce act anytime costsensitive tree learner a novel framework for operating in such complex environments act is an anytime algorithm that allows learning time to be increased in return for lower classification costs it builds a tree topdown and exploits additional time resources to obtain better estimations for the utility of the different candidate splits using sampling techniques act approximates the cost of the subtree under each candidate split and favors the one with a minimal cost as a stochastic algorithm act is expected to be able to escape local minima into which greedy methods may be trapped experiments with a variety of datasets were conducted to compare act to the stateoftheart costsensitive tree learners the results show that for the majority of domains act produces significantly less costly trees act also exhibits good anytime behavior with diminishing returns



b  lubin a  i juda r  cavallo s  lahaie j  shneidman and d  c parkes 2008 ice an expressive iterative combinatorial exchange volume 33 pages 3377

we present the design and analysis of the first fully expressive iterative combinatorial exchange ice the exchange incorporates a treebased bidding language tbbl that is concise and expressive for ces bidders specify lower and upper bounds in tbbl on their value for different trades and refine these bounds across rounds these bounds allow price discovery and useful preference elicitation in early rounds and allow termination with an efficient trade despite partial information on bidder valuations all computation in the exchange is carefully optimized to exploit the structure of the bidtrees and to avoid enumerating trades a proxied interpretation of a revealedpreference activity rule coupled with simple linear prices ensures progress across rounds the exchange is fully implemented and we give results demonstrating several aspects of its scalability and economic properties with simulated bidding strategies



d  martinez o  lopez de lacalle and e  agirre 2008 on the use of automatically acquired examples   for allnouns word sense disambiguation  volume 33 pages 79107

this article focuses on word sense disambiguation wsd which is a natural language processing task that is thought to be important for many language technology applications such as information retrieval information extraction or machine translation one of the main issues preventing the deployment of wsd technology is the lack of training examples for machine learning systems also known as the knowledge acquisition bottleneck a method which has been shown to work for small samples of words is the automatic acquisition of examples we have previously shown that one of the most promising example acquisition methods scales up and produces a freely available database of 150 million examples from web snippets for all polysemous nouns in wordnet this paper focuses on the issues that arise when using those examples all alone or in addition to manually tagged examples to train a supervised wsd system for all nouns the extensive evaluation on both lexicalsample and allwords senseval benchmarks shows that we are able to improve over commonly used baselines and to achieve toprank performance the good use of the prior distributions from the senses proved to be a crucial factor



y  gal and a  pfeffer 2008 networks of influence diagrams a formalism for representing  agents  beliefs and  decisionmaking processes volume 33 pages 109147

this paper presents networks of influence diagrams nid a compact natural and highly expressive language for reasoning about agents beliefs and decisionmaking processes  nids are graphical structures in which agents mental models are represented as nodes in a network a mental model for an agent may itself use descriptions of the mental models of other agents nids are demonstrated by examples showing how they can be used to describe conflicting and cyclic belief structures and certain forms of bounded rationality  in an opponent modeling domain nids were able to outperform other computational agents whose strategies were not known in advance  nids are equivalent in representation to bayesian games  but they are more compact and structured than this formalism in particular the equilibrium definition for nids makes an explicit distinction between agents optimal strategies and how they actually behave in reality

although recent years have seen a surge of interest in the computational aspects of social choice no specific attention has previously been devoted to elections with multiple winners eg elections of an assembly or committee in this paper we characterize the worstcase complexity of manipulation and control in the context of four prominent multiwinner voting systems under different formulations of the strategic agent226s goal



t  de laet j  de schutter and h  bruyninckx 2008 a rigorously bayesian beam model and an adaptive full scan model for range finders in dynamic environments volume 33 pages 179222

this paper proposes and experimentally validates a bayesian network model of a range finder adapted to dynamic environments all modeling assumptions are rigorously explained and all model parameters have a physical interpretation this approach results in a transparent and intuitive model with respect to the state of the art beam model this paper i proposes a different functional form for the probability of range measurements caused by unmodeled objects ii intuitively explains the discontinuity encountered in te state of the art beam model and iii reduces the number of model parameters while maintaining the same representational power for experimental data the proposed beam model is called rbbm short for rigorously bayesian beam model a maximum likelihood and a variational bayesian estimator both based on expectationmaximization are proposed to learn the model parameters




t  grinshpoun and a  meisels 2008 completeness and performance of the apo algorithm volume 33 pages 223258

asynchronous partial overlay apo is a search algorithm that uses cooperative mediation to solve distributed constraint satisfaction problems discsps the algorithm partitions the search into different subproblems of the discsp the original proof of completeness of the apo algorithm is based on the growth of the size of the subproblems the present paper demonstrates that this expected growth of subproblems does not occur in some situations leading to a termination problem of the algorithm the problematic parts in the apo algorithm that interfere with its completeness are identified and necessary modifications to the algorithm that fix these problematic parts are given the resulting version of the algorithm complete asynchronous partial overlay compapo ensures its completeness formal proofs for the soundness and completeness of compapo are given a detailed performance evaluation of compapo comparing it to other discsp algorithms is presented along with an extensive experimental evaluation of the algorithms unique behavior additionally an optimization version of the algorithm compoptapo is presented discussed and evaluated

in this paper we elucidate the equivalence between inference in game theory and machine learning our aim in so doing is to establish an equivalent vocabulary between the two domains so as to facilitate developments at the intersection of both 64257elds and as proof of the usefulness of this approach we use recent developments in each 64257eld to make useful improvements to the other more speci64257cally we consider the analogies between smooth best responses in 64257ctitious play and bayesian inference methods initially we use these insights to develop and demonstrate an improved algorithm for learning in games based on probabilistic moderation that is by integrating over the distribution of opponent strategies a bayesian approach within machine learning rather than taking a simple empirical average the approach used in standard 64257ctitious play we derive a novel moderated 64257ctitious play algorithm and show that it is more likely than standard 64257ctitious play to converge to a payoffdominant but riskdominated nash equilibrium in a simple coordination game furthermore we consider the converse case and show how insights from game theory can be used to derive two improved mean 64257eld variational learning algorithms we 64257rst show that the standard update rule of mean 64257eld variational learning is analogous to a cournot adjustment within game theory by analogy with 64257ctitious play we then suggest an improved update rule and show that this results in 64257ctitious variational play an improved mean 64257eld variational learning algorithm that exhibits better convergence in highly or strongly connected graphical models second we use a recent advance in 64257ctitious play namely dynamic 64257ctitious play to derive a derivative action variational learning algorithm that exhibits superior convergence properties on a canonical machine learning problem clustering a mixture distribution



a  kakas p  mancarella f  sadri k  stathis and f  toni 2008 computational logic foundations of kgp agents volume 33 pages 285348

this paper presents the computational logic foundations of a model of agency called the kgp knowledge goals and plan model this model allows the specification of heterogeneous agents that can interact with each other and can exhibit both proactive and reactive behaviour allowing them to function in dynamic environments by adjusting their goals and plans when changes happen in such environments  kgp provides a highly modular agent architecture that integrates a collection of reasoning and physical capabilities synthesised within transitions that update the agents state in response to reasoning sensing and acting transitions are orchestrated by cycle theories that specify the order in which transitions are executed while taking into account the dynamic context and agent preferences as well as selection operators for providing inputs to transitions



e  amir and a  chang 2008 learning partially observable deterministic action models volume 33 pages 349402

we present exact algorithms for identifying deterministicactions effects and preconditions in dynamic partially observable domains  they apply when one does not know the action modelthe way actions affect the world of a domain and must learn it from partial observations over time such scenarios are common in real world applications they are challenging for ai tasks because traditional domain structures that underly tractability eg conditional independence fail there eg world features become correlated our work departs from traditional assumptions about partial observations and action models in particular it focuses on problems in which actions are deterministic of simple logical structure and observation models have all features observed with some frequency we yield tractable algorithms for the modified problem for such domains 




j  goldsmith j  lang m  truszczynski and n  wilson 2008 the computational complexity of dominance and consistency in cpnets volume 33 pages 403432

we investigate the computational complexity of testing dominance and consistency in cpnets previously the complexity of dominance has been determined for restricted classes in which the dependency graph of the  cpnet is acyclic however there are preferences of interest that define cyclic dependency graphs these are modeled with general cpnets in our main results we show here that both dominance and consistency for general cpnets are pspacecomplete we then consider the concept of strong dominance dominance equivalence and dominance incomparability and several notions of optimality and identify the complexity of the corresponding decision problems the reductions used in the proofs are from strips planning and thus reinforce the earlier established connections between both areas




d  zhang and y  zhang 2008 an ordinal bargaining solution with fixedpoint property volume 33 pages 433464

shapleys impossibility result indicates that the twoperson bargaining problem has no nontrivial ordinal solution with the traditional gametheoretic bargaining model although the result is no longer true for bargaining problems with more than two agents none of the well known bargaining solutions are ordinal searching for meaningful ordinal solutions especially for the bilateral bargaining problem has been a challenging issue in bargaining theory for more than three decades this paper proposes a logicbased ordinal solution to the bilateral bargaining problem we argue that if a bargaining problem is modeled in terms of the logical relation of players physical negotiation items a meaningful bargaining solution can be constructed based on the ordinal structure of bargainers preferences we represent bargainers demands in propositional logic and bargainers preferences over their demands in total preorder we show that the solution satisfies most desirable logical properties such as individual rationality logical version consistency collective rationality as well as a few typical gametheoretic properties such as weak pareto optimality and contraction invariance in addition if all players demand sets are logically closed the solution satisfies a fixedpoint condition which says that the outcome of a negotiation is the result of mutual belief revision finally we define various decision problems in relation to our bargaining model and study their computational complexity



r  mateescu r  dechter and r  marinescu 2008 andor multivalued decision diagrams aomdds for graphical models volume 33 pages 465519

inspired by the recently introduced framework of andor search spaces for graphical models we propose to augment multivalued decision diagrams mdd with and nodes in order to capture function decomposition structure and to extend these compiled data structures to general weighted graphical models eg probabilistic models we present the andor multivalued decision diagram aomdd which compiles a graphical model into a canonical form that supports polynomial eg solution counting belief updating or constant time eg equivalence of graphical models queries we provide two algorithms for compiling the aomdd of a graphical model the first is searchbased and works by applying reduction rules to the trace of the memory intensive andor search algorithm the second is inferencebased and uses a bucket elimination schedule to combine the aomdds of the input functions via the the apply operator for both algorithms the compilation time and the size of the aomdd are in the worst case exponential in the treewidth of the graphical model rather than pathwidth as is known for ordered binary decision diagrams obdds we introduce the concept of semantic treewidth which helps explain why the size of a decision diagram is often much smaller than the worst case bound we provide an experimental evaluation that demonstrates the potential of aomdds

several multiagent reinforcement learning marl algorithms have been proposed to optimize agents decisions due to the complexity of the problem the majority of the previously developed marl algorithms assumed agents either had some knowledge of the underlying game such as nash equilibria andor observed other agents actions and the rewards they received




s  de jong s  uyttendaele and k  tuyls 2008 learning to reach agreement in a continuous ultimatum game volume 33 pages 551574

it is wellknown that acting in an individually rational manner according to the principles of classical game theory may lead to suboptimal solutions in a class of problems named social dilemmas in contrast humans generally do not have much difficulty with social dilemmas as they are able to balance personal benefit and group benefit as agents in multiagent systems are regularly confronted with social dilemmas for instance in tasks such as resource allocation these agents may benefit from the inclusion of mechanisms thought to facilitate human fairness although many of such mechanisms have already been implemented in a multiagent systems context their application is usually limited to rather abstract social dilemmas with a discrete set of available strategies usually two given that many realworld examples of social dilemmas are actually continuous in nature we extend this previous work to more general dilemmas in which agents operate in a continuous strategy space the social dilemma under study here is the wellknown ultimatum game in which an optimal solution is achieved if agents agree on a common strategy we investigate whether a scalefree interaction network facilitates agents to reach agreement especially in the presence of fixedstrategy agents that represent a desired eg human outcome moreover we study the influence of rewiring in the interaction network the agents are equipped with continuousaction learning automata and play a large number of random pairwise games in order to establish a common strategy from our experiments we may conclude that results obtained in discretestrategy games can be generalized to continuousstrategy games to a certain extent a scalefree interaction network structure allows agents to achieve agreement on a common strategy and rewiring in the interaction network greatly enhances the agents ability to reach agreement however it also becomes clear that some alternative mechanisms such as reputation and volunteering have many subtleties involved and do not have convincing beneficial effects in the continuous case



i  ashlagi d  monderer and m  tennenholtz 2008 on the value of correlation volume 33 pages 575613

correlated equilibrium generalizes nash equilibrium to allow correlation devices correlated equilibrium captures the idea that in many systems there exists a trusted administrator who can recommend behavior to a set of agents but can not enforce such behavior this makes this solution concept most appropriate to the study of multiagent systems in ai  aumann showed an example of a game and of a correlated equilibrium in this game in which the agents welfare expected sum of players utilities is greater than their welfare in all mixedstrategy equilibria following the idea initiated by the price of anarchy literature this suggests the study of two major measures for the value of correlation in a game with nonnegative payoffs
in this work we initiate the study of the mediation and enforcement values providing several general results on the value of correlation as captured by these concepts we also present a set of results for the more specialized case of congestion games a class of games that received a lot of attention in the recent literature



p  d turney 2008 the latent relation mapping engine algorithm and experiments volume 33 pages 615655

many ai researchers and cognitive scientists have argued that analogy is the core of cognition the most influential work on computational modeling of analogymaking is structure mapping theory smt and its implementation in the structure mapping engine sme a limitation of sme is the requirement for complex handcoded representations we introduce the latent relation mapping engine lrme which combines ideas from sme and latent relational analysis lra in order to remove the requirement for handcoded representations lrme builds analogical mappings between lists of words using a large corpus of raw text to automatically discover the semantic relations among the words we evaluate lrme on a set of twenty analogical mapping problems ten based on scientific analogies and ten based on common metaphors lrme achieves humanlevel performance on the twenty problems we compare lrme with a variety of alternative approaches and find that they are not able to reach the same level of performance
