b  zanuttini 2003 new polynomial classes for logicbased abduction volume 19 pages 110

we address the problem of propositional logicbased    abduction ie the problem of searching for a best explanation for a    given propositional observation according to a given propositional    knowledge base we give a general algorithm based on the notion of    projection then we study restrictions over the representations of the    knowledge base and of the query and find new polynomial classes of    abduction problems



r  i brafman and  m  tennenholtz 2003 learning to coordinate efficiently a modelbased approach volume 19 pages 1123

in commoninterest stochastic games all players receive an identical payoff players participating in such games must learn to coordinate with each other in order to receive the highestpossible value a number of reinforcement learning algorithms have been proposed for this problem and some have been shown to converge to good solutions in the limit in this paper we show that using very simple modelbased algorithms much better ie polynomial convergence rates can be attained moreover our modelbased algorithms are guaranteed to converge to the optimal value unlike many of the existing algorithms



t  eiter  w  faber  n  leone  g  pfeifer and  a  polleres 2003 answer set planning under action costs volume 19 pages 2571

recently planning based on answer set programming has been proposed as an approach towards realizing declarative planning systems in this paper we present the language kc which extends the declarative planning language k by action costs kc provides the notion of admissible and optimal plans which are plans whose overall action costs are within a given limit resp minimum over all plans ie cheapest plans as we demonstrate this novel language allows for expressing some nontrivial planning tasks in a declarative way furthermore it can be utilized for representing planning problems under other optimality criteria such as computing shortest plans with the least number of steps and refinement combinations of cheapest and fastest plans we study complexity aspects of the language kc and provide a transformation to logic programs such that planning problems are solved via answer set programming furthermore we report experimental results on selected problems our experience is encouraging that answer set planning may be a valuable approach to expressive planning systems in which intricate planning problems can be naturally specified and solved



l  finkelstein  s  markovitch and  e  rivlin 2003 optimal schedules for parallelizing anytime algorithms the case of shared resources volume 19 pages 73138

the performance of anytime algorithms can be improved by simultaneously solving several instances of algorithmproblem pairs these pairs may include different instances of a problem such as starting from a different initial state different algorithms if several alternatives exist or several runs of the same algorithm for nondeterministic algorithms in this paper we present a methodology for designing an optimal scheduling policy based on the statistical characteristics of the algorithms involved we formally analyze the case where the processes share resources a singleprocessor model and provide an algorithm for optimal scheduling  we analyze theoretically and empirically the behavior of our scheduling algorithm for various distribution types  finally we present empirical results of applying our scheduling algorithm to the latin square problem



m  leisink and  b  kappen 2003 bound propagation volume 19 pages 139154

in this article we present an algorithm to compute bounds on the marginals of a graphical model  for several small clusters of nodes upper and lower bounds on the marginal values are computed independently of the rest of the network  the range of allowed probability distributions over the surrounding nodes is restricted using earlier computed bounds as we will show this can be considered as a set of constraints in a linear programming problem of which the objective function is the marginal probability of the center nodes  in this way knowledge about the maginals of neighbouring clusters is passed to other clusters thereby tightening the bounds on their marginals  we show that sharp bounds can be obtained for undirected and directed graphs that are used for practical applications but for which exact computations are infeasible



p  maynardzhang and  d  lehmann 2003 representing and aggregating conflicting beliefs volume 19 pages 155203

we consider the twofold problem of representing collective beliefs and aggregating these beliefs we propose a novel representation for collective beliefs that uses modular transitive relations over possible worlds they allow us to represent conflicting opinions and they have a clear semantics thus improving upon the quasitransitive relations often used in social choice we then describe a way to construct the belief state of an agent informed by a set of sources of varying degrees of reliability this construction circumvents arrows impossibility theorem in a satisfactory manner by accounting for the explicitly encoded conflicts we give a simple settheorybased operator for combining the information of multiple agents we show that this operator satisfies the desirable invariants of idempotence commutativity and associativity and thus is wellbehaved when iterated and we describe a computationally effective way of computing the resulting belief state finally we extend our framework to incorporate voting



e  wiewiora 2003 potentialbased shaping and qvalue initialization are equivalent volume 19 pages 205208

shaping has proven to be a powerful but precarious means of improving reinforcement learning performance ng harada and russell 1999 proposed the potentialbased shaping algorithm for adding shaping rewards in a way that guarantees the learner will learn optimal behavior   in this note we prove certain similarities between this shaping algorithm and the initialization step required for several reinforcement learning algorithms more specifically we prove that a reinforcement learner with initial qvalues based on the shaping algorithms potential function make the same updates throughout learning as a learner receiving potentialbased shaping rewards we further prove that under a broad category of policies the behavior of these two learners are indistinguishable the comparison provides intuition on the theoretical properties of the shaping algorithm as well as a suggestion for a simpler method for capturing the algorithms benefit in addition the equivalence raises previously unaddressed issues concerning the efficiency of learning with potentialbased shaping



p  stone  r  e schapire  m  l littman  j  a csirik and d  mcallester 2003 decisiontheoretic bidding based on learned density models in simultaneous interacting auctions volume 19 pages 209242

auctions are becoming an increasingly popular method for transacting business especially over the internet  this article presents a general approach to building autonomous bidding agents to bid in multiple simultaneous auctions for interacting goods  a core component of our approach learns a model of the empirical price dynamics based on past data and uses the model to analytically calculate to the greatest extent possible optimal bids  we introduce a new and general boostingbased algorithm for conditional density estimation problems of this kind ie supervised learning problems in which the goal is to estimate the entire conditional distribution of the realvalued label  this approach is fully implemented as attac2001 a topscoring agent in the second trading agent competition tac01 we present experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of our boostingbased price predictor relative to several reasonable alternatives



p  d grunwald and  j  y halpern 2003 updating probabilities volume 19 pages 243278

as examples such as the monty hall puzzle show applying conditioning to update a probability distribution on a naive space which does not take into account the protocol used can often lead to counterintuitive results  here we examine why  a criterion known as car coarsening at random in the statistical literature characterizes when naive conditioning in a naive space works  we show that the car condition holds rather infrequently and we provide a procedural characterization of it by giving a randomized algorithm that generates all and only distributions for which car holds this substantially extends previous characterizations of car  we also consider more generalized notions of update such as jeffrey conditioning and minimizing relative entropy mre  we give a generalization of the car condition that characterizes when jeffrey conditioning leads to appropriate answers and show that there exist some very simple settings in which mre essentially never gives the right results  this generalizes and interconnects previous results obtained in the literature on car and mre



f  lin 2003 compiling causal theories to successor state axioms and stripslike systems volume 19 pages 279314

we describe a system for specifying the effects of actions unlike those commonly used in ai planning our system uses an action description language that allows one to specify the effects of actions using domain rules which are state constraints that can entail new action effects from old ones declaratively an action domain in our language corresponds to a nonmonotonic causal theory in the situation calculus procedurally such an action domain is compiled into a set of    logical theories one for each action in the domain from which fully instantiated  successor statelike axioms and stripslike systems are then generated we expect the system to be a useful tool for knowledge engineers writing action specifications for classical ai planning systems golog systems and other systems where formal specifications of actions are needed



g  m weiss and  f  provost 2003 learning when training data are costly the effect of class distribution on tree induction volume 19 pages 315354

for large realworld inductive learning problems the number of training examples often must be limited due to the costs associated with procuring preparing and storing the training examples andor the computational costs associated with learning from them in such circumstances one question of practical importance is if only n training examples can be selected in what proportion should the classes be represented  in this article we help to answer this question by analyzing for a fixed trainingset size the relationship between the class distribution of the training data and the performance of classification trees induced from these data we study twentysix data sets and for each determine the best class distribution for learning  the naturally occurring class distribution is shown to generally perform well when classifier performance is evaluated using undifferentiated error rate 01 loss  however when the area under the roc curve is used to evaluate classifier performance a balanced distribution is shown to perform well  since neither of these choices for class distribution always generates the bestperforming classifier we introduce a budgetsensitive progressive sampling algorithm for selecting training examples based on the class associated with each example  an empirical analysis of this algorithm shows that the class distribution of the resulting training set yields classifiers with good nearlyoptimal classification performance



r  e wray and  j  e laird 2003 an architectural approach to ensuring consistency in hierarchical execution volume 19 pages 355398

hierarchical task decomposition is a method used in many agent systems to organize agent knowledge  this work shows how the combination of a hierarchy and persistent assertions of knowledge can lead to difficulty in maintaining logical consistency in asserted knowledge we explore the problematic consequences of persistent assumptions in the reasoning process and introduce novel potential solutions  having implemented one of the possible solutions dynamic hierarchical justification its effectiveness is demonstrated with an empirical analysis

2007 ijcaijair best paper prize

this paper addresses the problem of planning under uncertainty in large markov decision processes mdps factored mdps represent a complex state space using state variables and the transition model using a dynamic bayesian network this representation often allows an exponential reduction in the representation size of structured mdps but the complexity of exact solution algorithms for such mdps can grow exponentially in the representation size  in this paper we present two approximate solution algorithms that exploit structure in factored mdps  both use an approximate value function represented as a linear combination of basis functions where each basis function involves only a small subset of the domain variables  a key contribution of this paper is that it shows how the basic operations of both algorithms can be performed efficiently in closed form by exploiting both additive and contextspecific structure in a factored mdp  a central element of our algorithms is a novel linear program decomposition technique analogous to variable elimination in bayesian networks which reduces an exponentially large lp to a provably equivalent polynomialsized one  one algorithm uses approximate linear programming and the second approximate dynamic programming our dynamic programming algorithm is novel in that it uses an approximation based on maxnorm a technique that more directly minimizes the terms that appear in error bounds for approximate mdp algorithms  we provide experimental results on problems with over 1040 states demonstrating a promising indication of the scalability of our approach and compare our algorithm to an existing stateoftheart approach showing in some problems exponential gains in computation time

the automatic generation of decision trees based on offline reasoning on models of a domain is a reasonable compromise between the advantages of using a modelbased approach in technical domains and the constraints imposed by embedded applications  in this paper we extend the approach to deal with temporal information we introduce a notion of temporal decision tree which is designed to make use of relevant information as long as it is acquired and we present an algorithm for compiling such trees from a modelbased reasoning system



w  e walsh and  m  p wellman 2003 decentralized supply chain formation a market protocol and competitive equilibrium analysis volume 19 pages 513567

supply chain formation is the process of determining the structure and terms of exchange relationships to enable a multilevel multiagent production activity  we present a simple model of supply chains highlighting two characteristic features hierarchical subtask decomposition and resource contention  to decentralize the formation process we introduce a market price system over the resources produced along the chain  in a competitive equilibrium for this system agents choose locally optimal allocations with respect to prices and outcomes are optimal overall  to determine prices we define a market protocol based on distributed progressive auctions and myopic nonstrategic agent bidding policies  in the presence of resource contention this protocol produces better solutions than the greedy protocols common in the artificial intelligence and multiagent systems literature  the protocol often converges to highvalue supply chains and when competitive equilibria exist typically to approximate competitive equilibria  however complementarities in agent production technologies can cause the protocol to wastefully allocate inputs to agents that do not produce their outputs  a subsequent decommitment phase recovers a significant fraction of the lost surplus



b  price and  c  boutilier 2003 accelerating reinforcement learning through implicit imitation volume 19 pages 569629

imitation can be viewed as a means of enhancing learning in multiagent environments  it augments an agents ability to learn useful behaviors by making intelligent use of the knowledge implicit in behaviors demonstrated by cooperative teachers or other more experienced agents  we propose and study a formal model of implicit imitation that can accelerate reinforcement learning dramatically in certain cases  roughly by observing a mentor a reinforcementlearning agent can extract information about its own capabilities in and the relative value of unvisited parts of the state space  we study two specific instantiations of this model one in which the learning agent and the mentor have identical abilities and one designed to deal with agents and mentors with different action sets  we illustrate the benefits of implicit imitation by integrating it with prioritized sweeping and demonstrating improved performance and convergence through observation of single and multiple mentors though we make some stringent assumptions regarding observability and possible interactions we briefly comment on extensions of the model that relax these restricitions



r  sanchez and  s  kambhampati 2003 altaltp online parallelization of plans with heuristic state search volume 19 pages 631657

despite their near dominance heuristic state search planners still lag behind disjunctive planners in the generation of parallel plans in classical planning the reason is that directly searching for parallel solutions in state space planners would require the planners to branch on all possible subsets of parallel actions thus increasing the branching factor exponentially we present a variant of our heuristic state search planner altalt called altaltp which generates parallel plans by using greedy online parallelization of partial plans the greedy approach is significantly informed by the use of novel distance heuristics that altaltp derives from a graphplanstyle planning graph for the problem while this approach is not guaranteed to provide optimal parallel plans empirical results show that altaltp is capable of generating good quality parallel plans at a fraction of the cost incurred by the disjunctive planners
