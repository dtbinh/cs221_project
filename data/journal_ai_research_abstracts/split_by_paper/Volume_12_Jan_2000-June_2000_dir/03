r  m neal 2000 on deducing conditional independence from dseparation in causal graphs with feedback research note volume 12 pages 8791

pearl and dechter 1996 claimed that the dseparation    criterion for conditional independence in acyclic causal networks also    applies to networks of discrete variables that have feedback cycles    provided that the variables of the system are uniquely determined by    the random disturbances  i show by example that this is not true in    general  some condition stronger than uniqueness is needed such as    the existence of a causal dynamics guaranteed to lead to the unique    solution
