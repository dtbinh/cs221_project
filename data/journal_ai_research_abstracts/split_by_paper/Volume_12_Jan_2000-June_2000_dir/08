we show how to find a minimum weight loop cutset in a    bayesian network with high probability finding such a loop cutset is    the first step in the method of conditioning for inference  our    randomized algorithm for finding a loop cutset outputs a minimum loop    cutset after oc 6k kn steps with probability at least     1  1  16kc6k where c  1 is a constant specified by the    user k is the minimal size of a minimum weight loop cutset and n is    the number of vertices  we also show empirically that a variant of    this algorithm often finds a loop cutset that is closer to the minimum    weight loop cutset than the ones found by the best deterministic    algorithms known
