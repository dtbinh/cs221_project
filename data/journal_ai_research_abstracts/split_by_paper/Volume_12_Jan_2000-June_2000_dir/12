j  koehler and  j  hoffmann 2000 on reasonable and forced goal orderings and their use in an agendadriven planning algorithm volume 12 pages 338386

the paper addresses the problem of computing goal orderings    which is one of the longstanding issues in ai planning  it makes two    new contributions  first it formally defines and discusses two    different goal orderings which are called the reasonable and the    forced ordering both orderings are defined for simple strips    operators as well as for more complex adl operators supporting    negation and conditional effects the complexity of these orderings is    investigated and their practical relevance is discussed secondly two    different methods to compute reasonable goal orderings are developed    one of them is based on planning graphs while the other investigates    the set of actions directly finally it is shown how the ordering    relations which have been derived for a given set of goals g can be    used to compute a socalled goal agenda that divides g into an ordered    set of subgoals any planner can then in principle use the goal    agenda to plan for increasing sets of subgoals  this can lead to an    exponential complexity reduction as the solution to a complex    planning problem is found by solving easier subproblems since only a    polynomial overhead is caused by the goal agenda computation a    potential exists to dramatically speed up planning algorithms as we    demonstrate in the empirical evaluation where we use this method in    the	ipp planner
