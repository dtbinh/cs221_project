k  xu and  w  li 2000 exact phase transitions in random constraint satisfaction problems volume 12 pages 93103

in this paper we propose a new type of random csp model    called model rb which is a revision to the standard model b it is    proved that phase transitions from a region where almost all problems    are satisfiable to a region where almost all problems are    unsatisfiable do exist for model rb as the number of variables    approaches infinity  moreover the critical values at which the phase    transitions occur are also known exactly by relating the hardness of    model rb to model b it is shown that there exist a lot of hard    instances in model rb
