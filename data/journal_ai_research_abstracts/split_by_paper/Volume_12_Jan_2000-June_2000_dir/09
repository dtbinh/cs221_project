the local search algorithm wsat is one of the most    successful algorithms for solving the satisfiability sat problem it    is notably effective at solving hard random 3sat instances near the    socalled satisfiability threshold but still shows a peak in search    cost near the threshold and large variations in cost over different    instances we make a number of significant contributions to the    analysis of wsat on highcost random instances using the    recentlyintroduced concept of the backbone of a sat instance the    backbone is the set of literals which are entailed by an instance we    find that the number of solutions predicts the cost well for    smallbackbone instances but is much less relevant for the    largebackbone instances which appear near the threshold and dominate    in the overconstrained region we show a very strong correlation    between search cost and the hamming distance to the nearest solution    early in wsats search this pattern leads us to introduce a measure    of the backbone fragility of an instance which indicates how    persistent the backbone is as clauses are removed we propose that    highcost random instances for local search are those with very large    backbones which are also backbonefragile we suggest that the decay    in cost beyond the satisfiability threshold is due to increasing    backbone robustness the opposite of backbone fragility our    hypothesis makes three correct predictions first that the backbone    robustness of an instance is negatively correlated with the local    search cost when other factors are controlled for second that    backboneminimal instances which are 3sat instances altered so as to    be more backbonefragile are unusually hard for wsat third that the    clauses most often unsatisfied during search are those whose deletion    has the most effect on the backbone in understanding the pathologies    of local search methods we hope to contribute to the development of    new and better techniques
