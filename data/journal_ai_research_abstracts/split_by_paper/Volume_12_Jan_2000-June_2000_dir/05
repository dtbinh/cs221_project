g  a kaminka and  m  tambe 2000 robust agent teams via sociallyattentive monitoring volume 12 pages 105147

agents in dynamic multiagent environments must monitor    their peers to execute individual and group plans a key open question    is how much monitoring of other agents states is required to be    effective the monitoring selectivity problem  we investigate this    question in the context of detecting failures in teams of cooperating    agents via sociallyattentive monitoring which focuses on monitoring    for failures in the social relationships between the agents we    empirically and analytically explore a family of sociallyattentive    teamwork monitoring algorithms in two dynamic complex multiagent    domains under varying conditions of task distribution and    uncertainty we show that a centralized scheme using a complex    algorithm trades correctness for completeness and requires monitoring    all teammates in contrast a simple distributed teamwork monitoring    algorithm results in correct and complete detection of teamwork    failures despite relying on limited uncertain knowledge and    monitoring only key agents in a team  in addition we report on the    design of a sociallyattentive monitoring system and demonstrate its    generality in monitoring several coordination relationships    diagnosing detected failures and both online and offline applications
