f  barber 2000 reasoning on interval and pointbased disjunctive metric constraints in temporal contexts volume 12 pages 3586

we introduce a temporal model for reasoning on disjunctive    metric constraints on intervals and time points in temporal    contexts this temporal model is composed of a labeled temporal    algebra and its reasoning algorithms the labeled temporal algebra    defines labeled disjunctive metric pointbased constraints where each    disjunct in each input disjunctive constraint is univocally associated    to a label reasoning algorithms manage labeled constraints    associated label lists and sets of mutually inconsistent    disjuncts these algorithms guarantee consistency and obtain a minimal    network additionally constraints can be organized in a hierarchy of    alternative temporal contexts therefore we can reason on    contextdependent disjunctive metric constraints on intervals and    points moreover the model is able to represent nonbinary    constraints such that logical dependencies on disjuncts in    constraints can be handled  the computational cost of reasoning    algorithms is exponential in accordance with the underlying problem    complexity although some improvements are proposed
