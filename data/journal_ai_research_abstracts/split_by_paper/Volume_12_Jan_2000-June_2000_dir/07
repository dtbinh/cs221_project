s  tobies 2000 the complexity of reasoning with cardinality restrictions and nominals in expressive description logics volume 12 pages 199217

we study the complexity of the combination of the    description logics alcq and alcqi with a terminological formalism    based on cardinality restrictions on concepts these combinations can    naturally be embedded into c2 the two variable fragment of predicate    logic with counting quantifiers which yields decidability in    nexptime we show that this approach leads to an optimal solution for    alcqi as alcqi with cardinality restrictions has the same complexity    as c2 nexptimecomplete in contrast we show that for alcq the    problem can be solved in exptime this result is obtained by a    reduction of reasoning with cardinality restrictions to reasoning with    the in general weaker terminological formalism of general axioms for    alcq extended with nominals using the same reduction we show that    for the extension of alcqi with nominals reasoning with general    axioms is a nexptimecomplete problem finally we sharpen this result    and show that pure concept satisfiability for alcqi with nominals is    nexptimecomplete without nominals this problem is known to be    pspacecomplete
