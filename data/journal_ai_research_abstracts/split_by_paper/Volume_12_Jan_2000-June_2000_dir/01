s  kambhampati 2000 planning graph as a dynamic csp exploiting ebl ddb and other csp search techniques in graphplan volume 12 pages 134

this paper reviews the connections between graphplans    planninggraph and the dynamic constraint satisfaction problem and    motivates the need for adapting csp search techniques to the graphplan    algorithm  it then describes how explanation based learning    dependency directed backtracking dynamic variable ordering forward    checking sticky values and randomrestart search strategies can be    adapted to graphplan empirical results are provided to demonstrate    that these augmentations improve graphplans performance significantly    up to 1000x speedups on several benchmark problems  special    attention is paid to the explanationbased learning and dependency    directed backtracking techniques as they are empirically found to be    most useful in improving the performance of graphplan
