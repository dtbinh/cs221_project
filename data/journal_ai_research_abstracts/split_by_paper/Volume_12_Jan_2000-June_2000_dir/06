j  baxter 2000 a model of inductive bias learning volume 12 pages 149198

a major problem in machine learning is that of inductive    bias how to choose a learners hypothesis space so that it is large    enough to contain a solution to the problem being learnt yet small    enough to ensure reliable generalization from reasonablysized    training sets  typically such bias is supplied by hand through the    skill and insights of experts in this paper a model for automatically    learning bias is investigated the central assumption of the model is    that the learner is embedded within an environment of related learning    tasks within such an environment the learner can sample from multiple    tasks and hence it can search for a hypothesis space that contains    good solutions to many of the problems in the environment under    certain restrictions on the set of all hypothesis spaces available to    the learner we show that a hypothesis space that performs well on a    sufficiently large number of training tasks will also perform well    when learning novel tasks in the same environment  explicit bounds    are also derived demonstrating that learning multiple tasks within an    environment of related tasks can potentially give much better    generalization than learning a single task
