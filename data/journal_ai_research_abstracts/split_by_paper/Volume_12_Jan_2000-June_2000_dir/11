j  y halpern 2000 axiomatizing causal reasoning volume 12 pages 317337

causal models defined in terms of a collection of equations    as defined by pearl are axiomatized here axiomatizations are    provided for three successively more general classes of causal models    1 the class of recursive theories those without feedback 2 the    class of theories where the solutions to the equations are unique     3 arbitrary theories where the equations may not have solutions and if    they do they are not necessarily unique it is shown that to reason    about causality in the most general third class we must extend the    language used by galles and pearl in addition the complexity of the    decision procedures is characterized for all the languages and classes    of models considered
