kenji  kawaguchi yu  maruyama and xiaoyu  zheng 2016 global continuous optimization with error bound and fast convergence volume 56 pages 153195

this paper considers global optimization with a blackbox unknown objective function that can be nonconvex and nondifferentiable such a difficult optimization problem arises in many realworld applications such as parameter tuning in machine learning engineering design problem and planning with a complex physics simulator this paper proposes a new global optimization algorithm called locally oriented global optimization logo to aim for both fast convergence in practice and finitetime error bound in theory the advantage and usage of the new algorithm are illustrated via theoretical analysis and an experiment conducted with 11 benchmark test functions further we modify the logo algorithm to specifically solve a planning problem via policy search with continuous stateaction space and long time horizon while maintaining its finitetime error bound we apply the proposed planning method to accident management of a nuclear power plant the result of the application study demonstrates the practical utility of our method
