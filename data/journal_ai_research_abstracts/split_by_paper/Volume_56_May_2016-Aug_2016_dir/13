description logic dl ontologies and nonmonotonic rules are two prominent knowledge representation kr formalisms with complementary features that are essential for various applications nonmonotonic description logic dl programs combine these formalisms thus providing support for rulebased reasoning on top of dl ontologies using a welldefined query interface represented by socalled dlatoms unfortunately interaction of the rules and the ontology may incur inconsistencies such that a dlprogram lacks answer sets ie models and thus yields no information this issue is addressed by recently defined repair answer sets for computing which an effective practical algorithm was proposed for dllite a ontologies that reduces a repair computation to constraint matching based on socalled support sets however the algorithm exploits particular features of dllite a and can not be readily applied to repairing dlprograms over other prominent dls like el compared to dllite a  in el support sets may neither be small nor only few support sets might exist and completeness of the algorithm may need to be given up when the support information is bounded we thus provide an approach for computing repairs for dlprograms over el ontologies based on partial incomplete support families the latter are constructed using datalog query rewriting techniques as well as ontology approximation based on logical difference between elterminologies we show how the maximal size and number of support sets for a given dlatom can be estimated by analyzing the properties of a support hypergraph which characterizes a relevant set of tbox axioms needed for query derivation we present a declarative implementation of the repair approach and experimentally evaluate it on a set of benchmark problems the promising results witness practical feasibility of our repair approach
