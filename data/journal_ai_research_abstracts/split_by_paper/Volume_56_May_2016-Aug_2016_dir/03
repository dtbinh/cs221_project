anyangle pathfinding is a fundamental problem in robotics and computer games the goal is to find a shortest path between a pair of points on a grid map such that the path is not artificially constrained to the points of the grid prior research has focused on approximate online solutions a number of exact methods exist but they all require superlinear space and preprocessing time  in this study we describe anya a new and optimal anyangle pathfinding algorithm where other works find approximate anyangle paths by searching over individual points from the grid anya finds optimal paths by searching over sets of states represented as intervals each interval is identified onthefly from each interval anya selects a single representative point that it uses to compute an admissible cost estimate for the entire set  anya always returns an optimal path if one exists  moreover it does so without any offline preprocessing or the introduction of additional memory overheads  in a range of empirical comparisons we show that anya is competitive with several recent suboptimal online and preprocessing based techniques and is up to an order of magnitude faster than the most common benchmark algorithm a gridbased implementation of a
