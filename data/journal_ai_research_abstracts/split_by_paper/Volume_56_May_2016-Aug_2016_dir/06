diana  grooters and henry  prakken 2016 two aspects of relevance in structured argumentation minimality and paraconsistency volume 56 pages 197245

this paper studies two issues concerning relevance in structured argumentation in the context of the aspic framework arising from the combined use of strict and defeasible inference rules one issue arises if the strict inference rules correspond to classical logic  a longstanding problem is how the trivialising effect of the classical ex falso principle can be avoided while satisfying consistency and closure postulates in this paper this problem is solved by disallowing chaining of strict rules resulting in a variant of the aspic framework called aspic and then disallowing the application of strict rules to inconsistent sets of formulas thus in effect rescher  manors paraconsistent notion of weak consequence is embedded in aspic

finally the combined results of this paper are shown to be a proper extension of classicallogic argumentation with preferences and defeasible rules
