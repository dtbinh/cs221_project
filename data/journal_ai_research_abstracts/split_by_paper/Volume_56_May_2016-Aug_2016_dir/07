the analysis and diagnosis of alzheimers disease ad can be based on genetic variations eg single nucleotide polymorphisms snps and phenotypic traits eg magnetic resonance imaging mri features we consider two important and related tasks i to select genetic and phenotypical markers for ad diagnosis and ii to identify associations between genetic and phenotypical data while previous studies treat these two tasks separately they are tightly coupled because underlying associations between genetic variations and phenotypical features contain the biological basis for a disease here we present a new sparse bayesian approach for joint association study and disease diagnosis in this approach common latent features are extracted from different data sources based on sparse projection matrices and used to predict multiple disease severity levels in return the disease status can guide the discovery of relationships between data sources the sparse projection matrices not only reveal interactions between data sources but also select groups of biomarkers related to the disease moreover to take advantage of the linkage disequilibrium ld measuring the nonrandom association of alleles we incorporate a graph laplacian type of prior in the model to learn the model from data we develop an efficient variational inference algorithm analysis on an imaging genetics dataset for the study of alzheimers disease ad indicates that our model identifies biologically meaningful associations between genetic variations and mri features and achieves significantly higher accuracy for predicting ordinal ad stages than the competing methods
