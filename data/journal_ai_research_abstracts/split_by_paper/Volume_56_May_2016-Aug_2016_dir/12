this paper concerns the mechanism design for online scheduling in a strategic setting in this setting each job is owned by a selfinterested agent who may misreport the release time deadline length and value of her job while we need to determine not only the schedule of the jobs but also the payment of each agent we focus on the design of incentive compatible ic mechanisms and study the maximization of social welfare ie the aggregated value of completed jobs by competitive analysis we first derive two lower bounds on the competitive ratio of any deterministic ic mechanism to characterize the landscape of our research we then propose a deterministic ic mechanism and show that such a simple mechanism works very well for both the preemptionrestart model and the preemptionresume model we show the mechanism can achieve the optimal competitive ratio of 5 for equallength jobs and a near optimal competitive ratio within a constant factor for unequallength jobs
