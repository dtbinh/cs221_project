we survey existing rules of thumb propose novel methods  and comprehensively evaluate a number of solutions to the problem of calculating the cost to serve each location in a singlevehicle transport setting cost to serve analysis has applications both strategically and operationally in transportation settings the problem is formally modeled as the traveling salesperson game tsg a cooperative transferable utility game in which agents correspond to locations in a traveling salesperson problem tsp the total cost to serve all locations in the tsp is the length of an optimal tour an allocation divides the total cost among individual locations thus providing the cost to serve each of them as one of the most important normative division schemes in cooperative games the shapley value gives a principled and fair allocation for a broad variety of games including the tsg we consider a number of direct and samplingbased procedures for calculating the shapley value and  prove that approximating the shapley value of the tsg within a constant factor is nphard treating the shapley value as an ideal baseline allocation we survey six proxies for it that are each relatively easy to compute some of these proxies are rules of thumb and some are procedures international delivery companies used as cost allocation methods we perform an experimental evaluation using synthetic euclidean games as well as games derived from realworld tours calculated for scenarios involving fastmoving goods where deliveries are made on a road network every day we explore several computationally tractable allocation techniques that are good proxies for the shapley value in problem instances of a size and complexity that is commercially relevant
