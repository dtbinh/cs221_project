two essential tasks in managing description logic knowledge bases are eliminating problematic axioms and incorporating newly formed ones such elimination and incorporation are formalised as the operations of contraction and revision in belief change in this paper we deal with contraction and revision for the dllite family through a modeltheoretic approach standard description logic semantics yields an infinite number of models for dllite knowledge bases thus it is difficult to develop algorithms for contraction and revision that involve dl models  the key to our approach is the introduction of an alternative semantics called type semantics which can replace the standard semantics in characterising the standard inference tasks of dllite type semantics has several advantages over the standard one it is more succinct and importantly with a finite signature the semantics always yields a finite number of models we then define modelbased contraction and revision functions for dllite knowledge bases under type semantics and provide representation theorems for them finally the finiteness and succinctness of type semantics allow us to develop tractable algorithms for instantiating the functions
