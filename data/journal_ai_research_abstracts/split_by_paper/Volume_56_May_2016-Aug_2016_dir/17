knowledge bases in the form of ontologies are receiving increasing attention as they allow to clearly represent both the available knowledge which includes the knowledge in itself and the constraints imposed to it by the domain or the users in particular datalog177 ontologies are attractive because of their property of decidability and the possibility of dealing with the massive amounts of data in real world environments however as it is the case with many other ontological languages their application in collaborative environments often lead to inconsistency related issues in this paper we introduce the notion of incoherence regarding datalog177 ontologies in terms of satisfiability of sets of constraints and show how under specific conditions incoherence leads to inconsistent datalog177 ontologies the main contribution of this work is a novel approach to restore both consistency and coherence in datalog177 ontologies the proposed approach is based on kernel contraction and restoration is performed by the application of incision functions that select formulas to delete nevertheless instead of working  over minimal incoherentinconsistent sets encountered in the ontologies our operators produce incisions over nonminimal structures called clusters we present a construction for consolidation operators along with the properties expected to be satisfied by them finally we establish the relation between the construction and the properties by means of a representation theorem although this proposal is presented for datalog177 ontologies consolidation these operators can be applied to other types of ontological languages such as description logics making  them apt to be used in collaborative environments like the semantic web
