many aspects of the design of efficient crowdsourcing processes such as defining workers bonuses fair prices and time limits of the tasks involve knowledge of the likely duration of the task at hand in this work we introduce a new timesensitive bayesian aggregation method that simultaneously estimates a tasks duration and obtains reliable aggregations of crowdsourced judgments our method called bcctime uses latent variables to represent the uncertainty about the workers completion time the tasks duration and the workers accuracy to relate the quality of a judgment to the time a worker spends on a task our model assumes that each task is completed within a latent time window within which all workers with a propensity to genuinely attempt the labelling task ie no spammers are expected to submit their judgments in contrast workers with a lower propensity to valid labelling such as spammers bots or lazy labellers are assumed to perform tasks considerably faster or slower than the time required by normal workers specifically we use efficient messagepassing bayesian inference to learn approximate posterior probabilities of i the confusion matrix of each worker ii the propensity to valid labelling of each worker iii the unbiased duration of each task and iv the true label of each task using two real world public datasets for entity linking tasks we show that bcctime produces up to 11 more accurate classifications and up to 100 more informative estimates of a tasks duration compared to stateoftheart methods
