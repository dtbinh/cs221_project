recent work has shown how to improve delete relaxation heuristics by computing relaxed plans ie the hff heuristic in a compiled planning task pic which represents a given set c of fact conjunctions explicitly while this compilation view of such partial delete relaxation is simple and elegant its meaning with respect to the original planning task is opaque and the size of pic grows exponentially in c we herein provide a direct characterization without compilation making explicit how the approach arises from a combination of the deleterelaxation with criticalpath heuristics designing equations characterizing a novel view on h on the one hand and a generalized version hc of hm on the other hand we show that hpic can be characterized in terms of a combined hcplus equation this naturally generalizes the standard deleterelaxation framework understanding that framework as a relaxation over singleton facts as atomic subgoals one can refine the relaxation by using the conjunctions c as atomic subgoals instead thanks to this explicit view we identify the precise source of complexity in hffpic namely maximization of sets of supported atomic subgoals during relaxed plan extraction which is easy for singletonfact subgoals but is npcomplete in the general case approximating that problem greedily we obtain a polynomialtime hcff version of hffpic superseding the pic compilation and superseding the modified picce compilation which achieves the same complexity reduction but at an information loss experiments on ipc benchmarks show that these theoretical advantages can translate into empirical ones
