sequential planning portfolios are very powerful in exploiting the complementary strength of different automated planners the main challenge of a portfolio planner is to define which base planners to run to assign the running time for each planner and to decide in what order they should be carried out to optimize a planning metric portfolio configurations are usually derived empirically from training benchmarks and remain fixed for an evaluation phase in this work we create a perinstance configurable portfolio which is able to adapt itself to every planning task the proposed system preselects a group of candidate planners using a paretodominance filtering approach and then it decides which planners to include and the time assigned according to predictive models these models estimate whether a base planner will be able to solve the given problem and if so how long it will take we define different portfolio strategies to combine the knowledge generated by the models the experimental evaluation shows that the resulting portfolios provide an improvement when compared with noninformed strategies one of the proposed portfolios was the winner of the sequential satisficing track of the international planning competition held in 2014
