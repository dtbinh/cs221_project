timebounded a is a realtime singleagent deterministic search algorithm that expands states of a graph in the same order as a does but that unlike a interleaves search and action execution  known to outperform stateoftheart realtime search algorithms based on korfs learning realtime a lrta in some benchmarks it has not been studied in detail and is sometimes not considered as a true realtime search algorithm since it fails in nonreversible problems even it the goal is still reachable from the current state  in this paper we propose and study timebounded bestfirst search tbbfs a straightforward generalization of the timebounded approach to any bestfirst search algorithm furthermore we propose restarting timebounded weighted a tbrwa an algorithm that deals more adequately with nonreversible search graphs eliminating  backtracking moves and incorporating search restarts and heuristic learning in nonreversible problems we prove that tbbfs terminates and we deduce cost bounds for the solutions returned by timebounded weighted a tbwa an instance of tbbfs furthermore we prove tbrwa under reasonable conditions terminates  we evaluate tbwa in both grid pathfinding and the 15puzzle in addition we evaluate tbrwa on the racetrack problem we compare our algorithms to lsslrtwa a variant of lrta that can exploit lookahead search and a weighted heuristic a general observation is that the performance of both tbwa and tbrwa improves as the weight parameter is increased in addition our timebounded algorithms almost always outperform lsslrtwa by a significant margin
