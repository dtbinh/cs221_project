a matched formula is a cnf formula whose incidence graph admits a matching which matches a distinct variable to every clause such a formula is always satisfiable matched formulas are used for example in the area of parametrized complexity we prove that the problem of counting the number of the models satisfying assignments of a matched formula is pcomplete on the other hand we define a class of formulas generalizing the matched formulas and prove that for a formula in this class one can choose in polynomial time a variable suitable for splitting the tree for the search of the models of the formula as a consequence the models of a formula from this class in particular of any matched formula can be generated sequentially with a delay polynomial in the size of the input on the other hand we prove that this task cannot be performed efficiently for linearly satisfiable formulas which is a generalization of matched formulas containing the class considered above
