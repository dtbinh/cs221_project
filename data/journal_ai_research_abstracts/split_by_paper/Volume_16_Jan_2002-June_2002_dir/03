designing the dialogue policy of a spoken dialogue system    involves many nontrivial choices  this paper presents a reinforcement    learning approach for automatically optimizing a dialogue policy    which addresses the technical challenges in applying reinforcement    learning to a working dialogue system with human users  we report on    the design construction and empirical evaluation of njfun an    experimental spoken dialogue system that provides users with access to    information about fun things to do in new jersey  our results show    that by optimizing its performance via reinforcement learning njfun    measurably improves system performance

inductive logic programming or relational learning is a    powerful paradigm for machine learning or data mining  however in    order for ilp to become practically useful the efficiency of ilp    systems must improve substantially to this end the notion of a query    pack is introduced it structures sets of similar    queries furthermore a mechanism is described for executing such    query packs  a complexity analysis shows that considerable efficiency    improvements can be achieved through the use of this query pack    execution mechanism this claim is supported by empirical results    obtained by incorporating support for query pack execution in two    existing learning systems
