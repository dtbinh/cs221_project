j  f baget and  m  l mugnier 2002 extensions of simple conceptual graphs the complexity of rules and constraints volume 16 pages 425465

simple conceptual graphs are considered as the kernel of    most knowledge representation formalisms built upon sowas    model reasoning in this model can be expressed by a graph    homomorphism called projection whose semantics is usually given in    terms of positive conjunctive existential fol  we present here a    family of extensions of this model based on rules and constraints    keeping graph homomorphism as the basic operation we focus on the    formal definitions of the different models obtained including their    operational semantics and relationships with fol and we analyze the    decidability and complexity of the associated problems consistency    and deduction as soon as rules are involved in reasonings these    problems are not decidable but we exhibit a condition under which    they fall in the polynomial hierarchy  these results extend and    complete the ones already published by the authors  moreover we    systematically study the complexity of some particular cases obtained    by restricting the form of constraints andor rules
