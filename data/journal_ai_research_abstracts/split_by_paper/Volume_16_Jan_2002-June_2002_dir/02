c  drummond 2002 accelerating reinforcement learning by composing solutions of automatically identified subtasks volume 16 pages 59104

this paper discusses a system that accelerates reinforcement    learning by using transfer from related tasks  without such    transfer even if two tasks are very similar at some abstract level    an extensive relearning effort is required  the system achieves    much of its power by transferring parts of previously learned    solutions rather than a single complete solution the system    exploits strong features in the multidimensional function produced    by reinforcement learning in solving a particular task these    features are stable and easy to recognize early in the learning    process they generate a partitioning of the state space and thus    the function  the partition is represented as a graph  this is    used to index and compose functions stored in a case base to form a    close approximation to the solution of the new task  experiments    demonstrate that function composition often produces more than an    order of magnitude increase in learning rate compared to a basic    reinforcement learning algorithm
