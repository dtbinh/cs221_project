we propose a structured approach to the problem of retrieval    of images by content and present a description logic that has been    devised for the semantic indexing and retrieval of images containing    complex objects        as other approaches do we start from lowlevel features extracted    with image analysis to detect and characterize regions in an    image however in contrast with featurebased approaches we provide    a syntax to describe segmented regions as basic objects and complex    objects as compositions of basic ones then we introduce a companion    extensional semantics for defining reasoning services such as    retrieval classification and subsumption  these services can be    used for both exact and approximate matching using similarity    measures           using our logical approach as a formal specification we implemented a    complete clientserver image retrieval system which allows a user to    pose both queries by sketch and queries by example a set of    experiments has been carried out on a testbed of images to assess the    retrieval capabilities of the system in comparison with expert users    ranking results are presented adopting a wellestablished measure of    quality borrowed from textual information retrieval
