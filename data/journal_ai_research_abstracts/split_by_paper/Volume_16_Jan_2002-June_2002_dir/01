fusions are a simple way of combining logics for normal    modal logics fusions have been investigated in detail in particular    it is known that under certain conditions decidability transfers    from the component logics to their fusion  though description logics    are closely related to modal logics they are not necessarily    normal in addition abox reasoning in description logics is not    covered by the results from modal logics           in this paper we extend the decidability transfer results from normal    modal logics to a large class of description logics to cover    different description logics in a uniform way we introduce abstract    description systems which can be seen as a common generalization of    description and modal logics and show the transfer results in this    general setting
