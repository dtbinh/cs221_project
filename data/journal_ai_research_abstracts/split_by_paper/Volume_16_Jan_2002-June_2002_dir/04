hidden markov models hmms and partially observable markov    decision processes pomdps provide useful tools for modeling    dynamical systems  they are particularly useful for representing the    topology of environments such as road networks and office buildings    which are typical for robot navigation and planning  the work    presented here describes a formal framework for incorporating readily    available odometric information and geometrical constraints into both    the models and the algorithm that learns them  by taking advantage of    such information learning hmmspomdps can be made to generate better    solutions and require fewer iterations while being robust in the face    of data reduction  experimental results obtained from both simulated    and real robot data demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach
