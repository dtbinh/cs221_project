despite the significant progress in multiagent teamwork    existing research does not address the optimality of its prescriptions    nor the complexity of the teamwork problem  without a    characterization of the optimalitycomplexity tradeoffs it is    impossible to determine whether the assumptions and approximations    made by a particular theory gain enough efficiency to justify the    losses in overall performance  to provide a tool for use by    multiagent researchers in evaluating this tradeoff we present a    unified framework the communicative multiagent team decision problem    commtdp  the commtdp model combines and extends existing    multiagent theories such as decentralized partially observable markov    decision processes and economic team theory  in addition to their    generality of representation commtdps also support the analysis of    both the optimality of team performance and the computational    complexity of the agents decision problem  in analyzing complexity    we present a breakdown of the computational complexity of constructing    optimal teams under various classes of problem domains along the    dimensions of observability and communication cost  in analyzing    optimality we exploit the commtdps ability to encode existing    teamwork theories and models to encode two instantiations of joint    intentions theory taken from the literature  furthermore the    commtdp model provides a basis for the development of novel team    coordination algorithms  we derive a domainindependent criterion for    optimal communication and provide a comparative analysis of the two    joint intentions instantiations with respect to this optimal policy    we have implemented a reusable domainindependent software package    based on commtdps to analyze teamwork coordination strategies and we    demonstrate its use by encoding and evaluating the two joint    intentions strategies within an example domain
