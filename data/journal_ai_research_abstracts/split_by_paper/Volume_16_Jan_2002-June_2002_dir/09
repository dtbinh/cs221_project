we consider the problem of designing the the utility    functions of the utilitymaximizing agents in a multiagent system so    that they work synergistically to maximize a global utility the    particular problem domain we explore is the control of network routing    by placing agents on all the routers in the network  conventional    approaches to this task have the agents all use the ideal shortest    path routing algorithm ispa  we demonstrate that in many cases due    to the sideeffects of one agents actions on another agents    performance having agents use ispas is suboptimal as far as global    aggregate cost is concerned even when they are only used to route    infinitesimally small amounts of traffic  the utility functions of    the individual agents are not aligned with the global utility    intuitively speaking  as a particular example of this we present an    instance of braess paradox in which adding new links to a network    whose agents all use the ispa results in a decrease in overall    throughput we also demonstrate that loadbalancing in which the    agents decisions are collectively made to optimize the global cost    incurred by all traffic currently being routed is suboptimal as far    as global cost averaged across time is concerned this is also due to    sideeffects in this case of current routing decision on future    traffic the mathematics of collective intelligence coin is    concerned precisely with the issue of avoiding such deleterious    sideeffects in multiagent systems both over time and space we    present key concepts from that mathematics and use them to derive an    algorithm whose ideal version should have better performance than that    of having all agents use the ispa even in the infinitesimal limit we    present experiments verifying this and also showing that a    machinelearningbased version of this coin algorithm in which costs    are only imprecisely estimated via empirical means a version    potentially applicable in the real world also outperforms the ispa    despite having access to less information than does the ispa in    particular this coin algorithm almost always avoids braess paradox
