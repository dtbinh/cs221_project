s  schroedl 2005 an improved search algorithm for optimal multiplesequence alignment volume 23 pages 587623



multiple sequence alignment msa is a ubiquitous problem in computational biology although it is nphard to find an optimal solution for an arbitrary number of sequences due to the importance of this problem researchers are trying to push the limits of exact algorithms further since msa can be cast as a classical path finding problem it is attracting a growing number of ai researchers interested in heuristic search algorithms as a challenge with actual practical relevance  in this paper we first review two previous complementary lines of research based on hirschbergs algorithm dynamic programming needs oknk1 space to store both the search frontier and the nodes needed to reconstruct the solution path for k sequences of length n best first search on the other hand has the advantage of bounding the search space that has to be explored using a heuristic  however it is necessary to maintain all explored nodes up to the final solution in order to prevent the search from reexpanding them at higher cost  earlier approaches to reduce the closed list are either incompatible with pruning methods for the open list or must retain at least the boundary of the closed list  in this article we present an algorithm that attempts at combining the respective advantages like a it uses a heuristic for pruning the search space but reduces both the maximum open and closed size to oknk1 as in dynamic programming  the underlying idea is to conduct a series of searches with successively increasing upper bounds but using the dp ordering as the key for the open priority queue  with a suitable choice of thresholds in practice a running time below four times that of a can be expected  in our experiments we show that our algorithm outperforms one of the currently most successful algorithms for optimal multiple sequence alignments partial expansion a both in time and memory moreover we apply a refined heuristic based on optimal alignments not only of pairs of sequences but of larger subsets  this idea is not new however to make it practically relevant we show that it is equally important to bound the heuristic computation appropriately or the overhead can obliterate any possible gain  furthermore we discuss a number of improvements in time and space efficiency with regard to practical implementations  our algorithm used in conjunction with higherdimensional heuristics is able to calculate for the first time the optimal alignment for almost all of the problems in reference 1 of the benchmark database balibase





m  bowling and  m  veloso 2004 existence of multiagent equilibria with limited agents volume 22 pages 353384



multiagent learning is a necessary yet challenging problem as multiagent systems become more prevalent and environments become more dynamic  much of the groundbreaking work in this area draws on notable results from game theory in particular the concept of nash equilibria  learners that directly learn an equilibrium obviously rely on their existence  learners that instead seek to play optimally with respect to the other players also depend upon equilibria since equilibria are fixed points for learning  from another perspective agents with limitations are real and common  these may be undesired physical limitations as well as selfimposed rational limitations such as abstraction and approximation techniques used to make learning tractable  this article explores the interactions of these two important concepts equilibria and limitations in learning  we introduce the question of whether equilibria continue to exist when agents have limitations  we look at the general effects limitations can have on agent behavior and define a natural extension of equilibria that accounts for these limitations  using this formalization we make three major contributions i a counterexample for the general existence of equilibria with limitations ii sufficient conditions on limitations that preserve their existence iii three general classes of games and limitations that satisfy these conditions  we then present empirical results from a specific multiagent learning algorithm applied to a specific instance of limited agents  these results demonstrate that learning with limitations is feasible when the conditions outlined by our theoretical analysis hold





s  hoelldobler e  karabaev and o  skvortsova 2006 flucap a heuristic search planner for firstorder mdps volume 27 pages 419439



we present a heuristic search algorithm for solving firstorder markov decision processes fomdps our approach combines firstorder state abstraction that avoids evaluating states individually and heuristic search that avoids evaluating all states firstly in contrast to existing systems which start with propositionalizing the fomdp and then perform state abstraction on its propositionalized version we apply state abstraction directly on the fomdp avoiding propositionalization this kind of abstraction is referred to as firstorder state abstraction secondly guided by an admissible heuristic the search is restricted to those states that are reachable from the initial state we demonstrate the usefulness of the above techniques for solving fomdps with a system referred to as flucap formerly fcplanner that entered the probabilistic track of the 2004 international planning competition ipc2004 and demonstrated an advantage over other planners on the problems represented in firstorder terms





p  s dutta  n  r jennings and  l  moreau 2005 cooperative information sharing to improve distributed learning in multiagent systems volume 24 pages 407463



effective coordination of agents actions in partiallyobservable domains is a major challenge of multiagent systems research  to address this many researchers have developed techniques that allow the agents to make decisions based on estimates of the states and actions of other agents that are typically learnt using some form of machine learning algorithm  nevertheless many of these approaches fail to provide an actual means by which the necessary information is made available so that the estimates can be learnt  to this end we argue that cooperative communication of state information between agents is one such mechanism  however in a dynamically changing environment the accuracy and timeliness of this communicated information determine the fidelity of the learned estimates and the usefulness of the actions taken based on these  given this we propose a novel informationsharing protocol  posttaskcompletion sharing for the distribution of state information  we then show through a formal analysis the improvement in the quality of estimates produced using our strategy over the widely used protocol of sharing information between nearest neighbours  moreover communication heuristics designed around our informationsharing principle are subjected to empirical evaluation along with other benchmark strategies including littmans qrouting and stones tpotrl in a simulated callrouting application  these studies conducted across a range of environmental settings show that compared to the different benchmarks used our strategy generates an improvement of up to 60 in the call connection rate of more than 1000 in the ability to connect longdistance calls and incurs as low as 025 of the message overhead





s  chien  a  stechert and  d  mutz 1999 efficient heuristic hypothesis ranking volume 10 pages 375397



this paper considers the problem of learning the ranking of    a set of stochastic alternatives based upon incomplete information    ie a limited number of samples  we describe a system that at    each decision cycle outputs either a complete ordering on the    hypotheses or decides to gather additional information ie    observations at some cost  the ranking problem is a generalization    of the previously studied hypothesis selection problem  in selection    an algorithm must select the single best hypothesis while in ranking    an algorithm must order all the hypotheses      the central problem we address is achieving the desired ranking    quality while minimizing the cost of acquiring additional samples  we    describe two algorithms for hypothesis ranking and their application    for the probably approximately correct pac and expected loss el    learning criteria  empirical results are provided to demonstrate the    effectiveness of these ranking procedures on both synthetic and    realworld datasets













2013 ijcaijair best paper



many problems in artificial intelligence require adaptively making a sequence of decisions with uncertain outcomes under partial observability solving such stochastic optimization problems is a fundamental but notoriously difficult challenge  in this paper we introduce the concept of adaptive submodularity generalizing submodular set functions to adaptive policies  we prove that if a problem satisfies this property a simple adaptive greedy algorithm is guaranteed to be competitive with the optimal policy in addition to providing  performance guarantees for both stochastic maximization and coverage adaptive submodularity can be exploited to drastically speed up the greedy algorithm by using lazy evaluations we illustrate the usefulness of the concept by giving several examples of adaptive submodular objectives arising in diverse ai applications including management of sensing resources viral marketing and active learning proving adaptive submodularity for these problems allows us to recover existing results in these applications as special cases improve approximation guarantees and handle natural generalizations 



shapleys impossibility result indicates that the twoperson bargaining problem has no nontrivial ordinal solution with the traditional gametheoretic bargaining model although the result is no longer true for bargaining problems with more than two agents none of the well known bargaining solutions are ordinal searching for meaningful ordinal solutions especially for the bilateral bargaining problem has been a challenging issue in bargaining theory for more than three decades this paper proposes a logicbased ordinal solution to the bilateral bargaining problem we argue that if a bargaining problem is modeled in terms of the logical relation of players physical negotiation items a meaningful bargaining solution can be constructed based on the ordinal structure of bargainers preferences we represent bargainers demands in propositional logic and bargainers preferences over their demands in total preorder we show that the solution satisfies most desirable logical properties such as individual rationality logical version consistency collective rationality as well as a few typical gametheoretic properties such as weak pareto optimality and contraction invariance in addition if all players demand sets are logically closed the solution satisfies a fixedpoint condition which says that the outcome of a negotiation is the result of mutual belief revision finally we define various decision problems in relation to our bargaining model and study their computational complexity







a  artale and  e  franconi 1998 a temporal description logic for reasoning about actions and plans volume 9 pages 463506



a class of intervalbased temporal languages for uniformly    representing and reasoning about actions and plans is presented    actions are represented by describing what is true while the action    itself is occurring and plans are constructed by temporally relating    actions and world states  the temporal languages are members of the    family of description logics which are characterized by high    expressivity combined with good computational properties  the    subsumption problem for a class of temporal description logics is    investigated and sound and complete decision procedures are given the    basic language tlf is considered first it is the composition of a    temporal logic tl  able to express interval temporal networks     together with the nontemporal logic f  a feature description logic    it is proven that subsumption in this language is an npcomplete    problem then it is shown how to reason with the more expressive    languages tlufu and tlalcf the former adds disjunction both at the    temporal and nontemporal sides of the language the latter extends    the nontemporal side with setvalued features ie roles and a    propositionally complete language



t  sato and  y  kameya 2001 parameter learning of logic programs for symbolicstatistical modeling volume 15 pages 391454



we propose a logicalmathematical framework for statistical    parameter learning of parameterized logic programs ie  definite    clause programs containing probabilistic facts with a parameterized    distribution  it extends the traditional least herbrand model    semantics in logic programming to distribution semantics possible    world semantics with a probability distribution which is    unconditionally applicable to arbitrary logic programs including ones    for hmms pcfgs and bayesian networks        we also propose a new em algorithm the graphical em algorithm that    runs for a class of parameterized logic programs representing    sequential decision processes where each decision is exclusive and    independent  it runs on a new data structure called support graphs    describing the logical relationship between observations and their    explanations and learns parameters by computing inside and outside    probability generalized for logic programs           the complexity analysis shows that when combined with oldt search for    all explanations for observations the graphical em algorithm despite    its generality has the same time complexity as existing em    algorithms ie the baumwelch algorithm for hmms the insideoutside    algorithm for pcfgs and the one for singly connected bayesian    networks that have been developed independently in each research    field  learning experiments with pcfgs using two corpora of moderate    size indicate that the graphical em algorithm can significantly    outperform the insideoutside algorithm

this paper describes a novel method by which a spoken    dialogue system can learn to choose an optimal dialogue strategy from    its experience interacting with human users  the method is based on a    combination of reinforcement learning and performance modeling of    spoken dialogue systems  the reinforcement learning component applies    qlearning watkins 1989 while the performance modeling component    applies the paradise evaluation framework walker et al 1997 to    learn the performance function reward used in reinforcement    learning  we illustrate the method with a spoken dialogue system    named elvis email voice interactive system that supports access to    email over the phone  we conduct a set of experiments for training an    optimal dialogue strategy on a corpus of 219 dialogues in which human    users interact with elvis over the phone we then test that strategy    on a corpus of 18 dialogues  we show that elvis can learn to optimize    its strategy selection for agent initiative for reading messages and    for summarizing email folders

aaai 2015 outstanding paper honorable mention



understanding the demographics of users of online social networks has important applications for health marketing and public messaging whereas most prior approaches rely on a supervised learning approach in which individual users are labeled with demographics for training we instead create a distantly labeled dataset by collecting audience measurement data for 1500 websites eg 50 of visitors to gizmodocom are estimated to have a bachelors degree we then fit a regression model to predict these demographics from information about the followers of each website on twitter using patterns derived both from textual content and the social network of each user our final model produces an average heldout correlation of 77 across seven different variables age gender education ethnicity income parental status and political preference we then apply this model to classify individual twitter users by ethnicity gender and political preference finding performance that is surprisingly competitive with a fully supervised approach

b  j clement e  h durfee and a  c barrett 2007 abstract reasoning for planning and coordination volume 28 pages 453515



the judicious use of abstraction can help planning agents to identify key interactions between actions and resolve them without getting bogged down in details however ignoring the wrong details can lead agents into building plans that do not work or into costly backtracking and replanning once overlooked interdependencies come to light we claim that associating systematicallygenerated summary information with plans abstract operators can ensure plan correctness even for asynchronouslyexecuted plans that must be coordinated across multiple agents while still achieving valuable efficiency gains in this paper we formally characterize hierarchical plans whose actions have temporal extent and describe a principled method for deriving summarized state and metric resource information for such actions we provide sound and complete algorithms along with heuristics to exploit summary information during hierarchical refinement planning and plan coordination our analyses and experiments show that under clearcut and reasonable conditions using summary information can speed planning as much as doubly exponentially even for plans involving interacting subproblems

adequate representation of natural language semantics requires access to vast amounts of common sense and domainspecific world knowledge prior work in the field was based on purely statistical techniques that did not make use of background knowledge on limited lexicographic knowledge bases such as wordnet or on huge manual efforts such as the cyc project here we propose a novel method called explicit semantic analysis esa for finegrained semantic interpretation of unrestricted natural language texts our method represents meaning in a highdimensional space of concepts derived from wikipedia the largest encyclopedia in existence we explicitly represent the meaning of any text in terms of wikipediabased concepts we evaluate the effectiveness of our method on text categorization and on computing the degree of semantic relatedness between fragments of natural language text using esa results in significant improvements over the previous state of the art in both tasks importantly due to the use of natural concepts the esa model is easy to explain to human users

s  dasgupta and v  ng 2010 which clustering do you want inducing your ideal clustering with minimal feedback volume 39 pages 581632



while traditional research on text clustering has largely focused on grouping documents by topic it is conceivable that a user may want to cluster documents along other dimensions such as the authors mood gender age or sentiment without knowing the users intention a clustering algorithm will only group documents along the most prominent dimension which may not be the one the user desires to address the problem of clustering documents along the userdesired dimension previous work has focused on learning a similarity metric from data manually annotated with the users intention or having a human construct a feature space in an interactive manner during the clustering process with the goal of reducing reliance on human knowledge for finetuning the similarity function or selecting the relevant features required by these approaches we propose a novel active clustering algorithm which allows a user to easily select the dimension along which she wants to cluster the documents by inspecting only a small number of words we demonstrate the viability of our algorithm on a variety of commonlyused sentiment datasets

searching for and making decisions about information is becoming increasingly difficult as the amount of information and number of choices increases  recommendation systems help users find items of interest of a particular type such as movies or restaurants but are still somewhat awkward to use  our solution is to take advantage of the complementary strengths of personalized recommendation systems and dialogue systems creating personalized aides  we present a  system  the adaptive place advisor  that treats item selection as an interactive conversational process with the program inquiring about item attributes and the user responding  individual longterm user preferences are unobtrusively obtained in the course of normal recommendation dialogues and used to direct future conversations with the same user  we present a novel user model that influences both item search and the questions asked during a conversation  we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in significantly reducing the time and number of interactions required to find a satisfactory item as compared to a control group of users interacting with a nonadaptive version of the system

we provide a series of algorithms demonstrating that solutions according to the fundamental gametheoretic solution concept of closed under rational behavior curb sets in twoplayer normalform games can be computed in polynomial time we also discuss extensions to nplayer games first we describe an algorithm that identifies all of a players best responses conditioned on the belief that the other player will play from within a given subset of its strategy space this algorithm serves as a subroutine in a series of polynomialtime algorithms for finding all minimal curb sets one minimal curb set and the smallest minimal curb set in a game we then show that the complexity of finding a nash equilibrium can be exponential only in the size of a games smallest curb set related to this we show that the smallest curb set can be an arbitrarily small portion of the game but it can also be arbitrarily larger than the supports of its only enclosed nash equilibrium we test our algorithms empirically and find that most commonly studied academic games tend to have either very large or very small minimal curb sets





t  c son e  pontelli and p  h tu 2007 answer sets for logic programs with arbitrary abstract constraint atoms volume 29 pages 353389



in this paper we present two alternative approaches to defining answer sets for logic programs with arbitrary types of abstract constraint atoms catoms these approaches generalize the fixpointbased and the level mapping based answer set semantics of normal logic programs to the case of logic programs with arbitrary types of catoms the results are four different answer set definitions which are equivalent when applied to normal logic programs  

we show that the newly defined semantics coincide with previously introduced semantics for logic programs with monotone catoms and they extend the original answer set semantics of normal logic programs we also study some properties of answer sets of programs with catoms and relate our definitions to several semantics for logic programs with aggregates presented in the literature

a weighted constraint satisfaction problem wcsp is a constraint satisfaction problem in which preferences among solutions can be expressed bucket elimination is a complete technique commonly used to solve this kind of constraint satisfaction problem when the memory required to apply bucket elimination is too high a heuristic method based on it denominated minibuckets can be used to calculate bounds for the optimal solution nevertheless the curse of dimensionality makes these techniques impractical on large scale problems in response to this situation we present a memetic algorithm for wcsps in which bucket elimination is used as a mechanism for recombining solutions providing the best possible child from the parental set subsequently a multilevel model in which this exactmetaheuristic hybrid is further hybridized with branchandbound techniques and minibuckets is studied as a case study we have applied these algorithms to the resolution of the maximum density still life problem a hard constraint optimization problem based on conways game of life the resulting algorithm consistently finds optimal patterns for up to date solved instances in less time than current approaches moreover it is shown that this proposal provides new best known solutions for very large instances

localization that is the estimation of a robots location    from sensor data is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics  this    papers presents a version of markov localization which provides    accurate position estimates and which is tailored towards dynamic    environments the key idea of markov localization is to maintain a    probability density over the space of all locations of a robot in its    environment our approach represents this space metrically using a    finegrained grid to approximate densities  it is able to globally    localize the robot from scratch and to recover from localization    failures  it is robust to approximate models of the environment such    as occupancy grid maps and noisy sensors such as ultrasound    sensors  our approach also includes a filtering technique which    allows a mobile robot to reliably estimate its position even in    densely populated environments in which crowds of people block the    robots sensors for extended periods of time  the method described    here has been implemented and tested in several realworld    applications of mobile robots including the deployments of two mobile    robots as interactive museum tourguides
