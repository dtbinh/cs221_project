we derive optimal strategies for a bidding agent that participates in multiple simultaneous secondprice auctions with perfect substitutes we prove that if everyone else bids locally in a single auction the global bidder should always place nonzero bids in all available auctions provided there are no budget constraints with a budget however the optimal strategy is to bid locally if this budget is equal or less than the valuation furthermore for a wide range of valuation distributions we prove that the problem of finding the optimal bids reduces to two dimensions if all auctions are identical finally we address markets with both sequential and simultaneous auctions nonidentical auctions and the allocative efficiency of the market



b  bonet and h  geffner 2005 mgpt a probabilistic planner based on heuristic search volume 24 pages 933944



we describe the version of the gpt planner used in the probabilistic track of the 4th international planning competition ipc4 this version called mgpt solves markov decision processes specified in the ppddl language by extracting and using different classes of lower bounds along with various heuristicsearch algorithms the lower bounds are extracted from deterministic relaxations where the alternative probabilistic effects of an action are mapped into different independent deterministic actions the heuristicsearch algorithms use these lower bounds for focusing the updates and delivering a consistent value function over all states reachable from the initial state and the greedy policy 







n  agmon g  a kaminka and s  kraus 2011 multirobot adversarial patrolling facing a fullknowledge opponent volume 42 pages 887916



the problem of adversarial multirobot patrol has gained interest in recent years mainly due to its immediate relevance to various security applications in this problem robots are required to repeatedly visit a target area in a way that maximizes their chances of detecting an adversary trying to penetrate through the patrol path when facing a strong adversary that knows the patrol strategy of the robots if the robots use a deterministic patrol algorithm then in many cases it is easy for the adversary to penetrate undetected in fact in some of those cases the adversary can guarantee penetration therefore this paper presents a nondeterministic patrol framework for the robots assuming that the strong adversary will take advantage of its knowledge and try to penetrate through the patrols weakest spot hence an optimal algorithm is one that maximizes the chances of detection in that point we therefore present a polynomialtime algorithm for determining an optimal patrol under the markovian strategy assumption for the robots such that the probability of detecting the adversary in the patrols weakest spot is maximized we build upon this framework and describe an optimal patrol strategy for several robotic models based on their movement abilities directed or undirected and sensing abilities perfect or imperfect and in different environment models  either patrol around a perimeter closed polygon or an open fence open polyline



  the paper focuses on finding the m best solutions to combinatorial optimization problems using bestfirst or depthfirst branch and bound search  specifically we present a new algorithm ma extending the wellknown a to the mbest task and for the first time prove that all its desirable properties including soundness completeness and optimal efficiency are maintained since bestfirst algorithms require extensive memory we also extend the memoryefficient depthfirst branch and bound to the mbest task

we adapt both algorithms to optimization tasks over graphical models eg weighted csp and mpe in bayesian networks provide complexity analysis and an empirical evaluation our experiments confirm theory that the bestfirst approach is largely superior when memory is available but depthfirst branch and bound is more robust  we also show that our algorithms are competitive with related schemes recently developed for the mbest task









b  bosansky c  kiekintveld v  lisy and m  pechoucek 2014 an exact doubleoracle algorithm for zerosum extensiveform games with imperfect information volume 51 pages 829866



developing scalable solution algorithms is one of the central problems in computational game theory we present an iterative algorithm for computing an exact nash equilibrium for twoplayer zerosum extensiveform games with imperfect information our approach combines two key elements 1 the compact sequenceform representation of extensiveform games and 2 the algorithmic framework of doubleoracle methods the main idea of our algorithm is to restrict the game by allowing the players to play only selected sequences of available actions after solving the restricted game new sequences are added by finding best responses to the current solution using fast algorithms 

our main contributions include 1 a generic sequenceform doubleoracle algorithm for solving zerosum extensiveform games 2 fast methods for maintaining a valid restricted game model when adding new sequences 3 a search algorithm and pruning methods for computing bestresponse sequences 4 theoretical guarantees about the convergence of the algorithm to a nash equilibrium 5 experimental analysis of our algorithm on several games including an approximate version of the algorithm



in domains such as  biomedicine ontologies are prominently utilized for annotating data   consequently aligning ontologies facilitates integrating  data   several   algorithms  exist  for  automatically aligning  ontologies   with  diverse  levels   of  performance   as alignment   applications  evolve   and  exhibit   online   run  time constraints performing the alignment in a reasonable amount of time without  compromising the  quality  of the  alignment  is a  crucial challenge  a  large class of alignment algorithms  is iterative and often consumes more time than others in delivering solutions of high quality we present a novel and general approach for speeding up the multivariable  optimization process  utilized  by these  algorithms specifically  we  use  the  technique of  blockcoordinate  descent bcd  which exploits  the subdimensions  of the  alignment problem identified using a partitioning  scheme  we integrate this approach into  multiple wellknown  alignment  algorithms and  show that  the enhanced  algorithms  generate  similar  or improved  alignments  in significantly  less  time on  a  comprehensive  testbed of  ontology pairs  because  bcd does not  overly constrain how we  partition or order the  parts we vary  the partitioning and ordering  schemes in order  to empirically  determine the  best schemes  for each  of the selected  algorithms  as biomedicine  represents a  key application domain  for  ontologies  we  introduce a  comprehensive  biomedical ontology testbed  for the community  in order to  evaluate alignment algorithms  because biomedical ontologies tend to be large default iterative  techniques find it  difficult to  produce a  good quality alignment within a reasonable amount of time we align a significant number  of  ontology  pairs  from this  testbed  using  bcdenhanced algorithms   our contributions represent  an important  step toward making a  significant class of  alignment techniques computationally feasible
