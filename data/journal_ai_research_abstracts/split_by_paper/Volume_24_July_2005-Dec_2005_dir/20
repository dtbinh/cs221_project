stochastic processes that involve the creation of objects and relations over time are widespread but relatively poorly studied for example accurate fault diagnosis in factory assembly processes requires inferring the probabilities of erroneous assembly operations but doing this efficiently and accurately is difficult modeled as dynamic bayesian networks these processes have discrete variables with very large domains and extremely high dimensionality in this paper we introduce relational dynamic bayesian networks rdbns which are an extension of dynamic bayesian networks dbns to firstorder logic rdbns are a generalization of dynamic probabilistic relational models dprms which we had proposed in our previous work to model dynamic uncertain domains we first extend the raoblackwellised particle filtering described in our earlier work to rdbns next we lift the assumptions associated with raoblackwellization in rdbns and propose two new forms of particle filtering the first one uses abstraction hierarchies over the predicates to smooth the particle filters estimates the second employs kernel density estimation with a kernel function specifically designed for relational domains experiments show these two methods greatly outperform standard particle filtering on the task of assembly plan execution monitoring
