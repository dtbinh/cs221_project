effective coordination of agents actions in partiallyobservable domains is a major challenge of multiagent systems research  to address this many researchers have developed techniques that allow the agents to make decisions based on estimates of the states and actions of other agents that are typically learnt using some form of machine learning algorithm  nevertheless many of these approaches fail to provide an actual means by which the necessary information is made available so that the estimates can be learnt  to this end we argue that cooperative communication of state information between agents is one such mechanism  however in a dynamically changing environment the accuracy and timeliness of this communicated information determine the fidelity of the learned estimates and the usefulness of the actions taken based on these  given this we propose a novel informationsharing protocol  posttaskcompletion sharing for the distribution of state information  we then show through a formal analysis the improvement in the quality of estimates produced using our strategy over the widely used protocol of sharing information between nearest neighbours  moreover communication heuristics designed around our informationsharing principle are subjected to empirical evaluation along with other benchmark strategies including littmans qrouting and stones tpotrl in a simulated callrouting application  these studies conducted across a range of environmental settings show that compared to the different benchmarks used our strategy generates an improvement of up to 60 in the call connection rate of more than 1000 in the ability to connect longdistance calls and incurs as low as 025 of the message overhead
