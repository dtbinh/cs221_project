b  bonet and h  geffner 2005 mgpt a probabilistic planner based on heuristic search volume 24 pages 933944

we describe the version of the gpt planner used in the probabilistic track of the 4th international planning competition ipc4 this version called mgpt solves markov decision processes specified in the ppddl language by extracting and using different classes of lower bounds along with various heuristicsearch algorithms the lower bounds are extracted from deterministic relaxations where the alternative probabilistic effects of an action are mapped into different independent deterministic actions the heuristicsearch algorithms use these lower bounds for focusing the updates and delivering a consistent value function over all states reachable from the initial state and the greedy policy
