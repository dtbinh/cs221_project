m  tj spaan and  n  vlassis 2005 perseus randomized pointbased value iteration for pomdps volume 24 pages 195220

partially observable markov decision processes pomdps form an attractive and principled framework for agent planning under uncertainty  pointbased approximate techniques for pomdps compute a policy based on a finite set of points collected in advance from the agents belief space  we present a randomized pointbased value iteration algorithm called perseus  the algorithm performs approximate value backup stages ensuring that in each backup stage the value of each point in the belief set is improved the key observation is that a single backup may improve the value of many belief points  contrary to other pointbased methods perseus backs up only a randomly selected subset of points in the belief set sufficient for improving the value of each belief point in the set we show how the same idea can be extended to dealing with continuous action spaces  experimental results show the potential of perseus in large scale pomdp problems
