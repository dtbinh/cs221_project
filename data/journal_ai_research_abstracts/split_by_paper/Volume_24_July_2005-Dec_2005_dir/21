m  beetz and h  grosskreutz 2005 probabilistic hybrid action models for predicting concurrent perceptdriven robot behavior volume 24 pages 799849

this article develops probabilistic hybrid action models phams a realistic causal model for predicting the behavior generated by modern perceptdriven robot plans phams represent aspects of robot behavior that cannot be represented by most action models used in ai planning the temporal structure of continuous control processes their nondeterministic effects several modes of their interferences and the achievement of triggering conditions in closedloop robot plans
