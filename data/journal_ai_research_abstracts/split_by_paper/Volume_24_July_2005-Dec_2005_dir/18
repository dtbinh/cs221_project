a nonbinary constraint satisfaction problem csp can be solved directly using extended versions of binary techniques alternatively the nonbinary problem can be translated into an equivalent binary one in this case it is generally accepted that the translated problem can be solved by applying wellestablished techniques for binary csps in this paper we evaluate the applicability of the latter approach we demonstrate that the use of standard techniques for binary csps in the encodings of nonbinary problems is problematic and results in models that are very rarely competitive with the nonbinary representation to overcome this we propose specialized arc consistency and search algorithms for binary encodings and we evaluate them theoretically and empirically we consider three binary representations the hidden variable encoding the dual encoding and the double encoding theoretical and empirical results show that for certain classes of nonbinary constraints binary encodings are a competitive option and in many cases a better one than the nonbinary representation
