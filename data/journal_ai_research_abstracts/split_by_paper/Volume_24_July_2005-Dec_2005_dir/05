p  w jordan and  m  a walker 2005 learning content selection rules for generating object descriptions in dialogue volume 24 pages 157194

a fundamental requirement of any taskoriented dialogue system is the ability to generate object descriptions that refer to objects in the task domain the subproblem of content selection for object descriptions in taskoriented dialogue has been the focus of much previous work and a large number of models have been proposed in this paper we use the annotated coconut corpus of taskoriented design dialogues to develop feature sets based on dale and reiters 1995 incremental model brennan and clarks 1996 conceptual pact model and jordans 2000b intentional influences model and use these feature sets in a machine learning experiment to automatically learn a model of content selection for object descriptions  since dale and reiters model requires a representation of discourse structure the corpus annotations are used to derive a representation based on grosz and sidners 1986 theory of the intentional structure of discourse as well as two very simple representations of discourse structure based purely on recency we then apply the ruleinduction program ripper to train and test the content selection component of an object description generator on a set of 393 object descriptions from the corpus to our knowledge this is the first reported experiment of a trainable content selection component for object description generation in dialogue three separate content selection models that are based on the three theoretical models all independently achieve accuracies significantly above the majority class baseline 17 on unseen test data with the intentional influences model 424 performing significantly better than either the incremental model 304 or the conceptual pact model 289 but the best performing models combine all the feature sets achieving accuracies near 60 surprisingly a simple recencybased representation of discourse structure does as well as one based on intentional structure  to our knowledge this is also the first empirical comparison of a representation of grosz and sidners model of discourse structure with a simpler model for any generation task
