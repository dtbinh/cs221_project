despite recent progress in ai planning many benchmarks remain challenging for current planners in many domains the performance of a planner can greatly be improved by discovering and exploiting information about the domain structure that is not explicitly encoded in the initial pddl formulation in this paper we present and compare two automated methods that learn relevant information from previous experience in a domain and use it to solve new problem instances our methods share a common fourstep strategy first a domain is analyzed and structural information is extracted then macrooperators are generated based on the previously discovered structure a filtering and ranking procedure selects the most useful macrooperators finally the selected macros are used to speed up future searches  we have successfully used such an approach in the fourth international planning competition ipc4 our system macroff extends hoffmanns stateoftheart planner ff 23 with support for two kinds of macrooperators and with engineering enhancements we demonstrate the effectiveness of our ideas on benchmarks from international planning competitions our results indicate a large reduction in search effort in those complex domains where structural information can be inferred
