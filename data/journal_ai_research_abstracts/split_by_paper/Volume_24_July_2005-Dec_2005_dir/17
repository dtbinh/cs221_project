the evaluation of incomplete satisfiability solvers depends critically on the availability of hard satisfiable instances a plausible source of such instances consists of random ksat formulas whose clauses are chosen uniformly from among all clauses satisfying some randomly chosen truth assignment a unfortunately instances generated in this manner tend to be relatively easy and can be solved efficiently by practical heuristics roughly speaking for a number of different algorithms a acts as a stronger and stronger attractor as the formulas density increases motivated by recent results on the geometry of the space of satisfying truth assignments of random ksat and naeksat formulas we introduce a simple twist on this basic model which appears to dramatically increase its hardness namely in addition to forbidding the clauses violated by the hidden assignment a we also forbid the clauses violated by its complement so that both a and compliment of a are satisfying it appears that under this symmetrization the effects of the two attractors largely cancel out making it much harder for algorithms to find any truth assignment we give theoretical and experimental evidence supporting this assertion
