we present a novel approach to the automatic acquisition of taxonomies or concept hierarchies from a text corpus the approach is based on formal concept analysis fca a method mainly used for the analysis of data ie for investigating and processing explicitly given information  we follow harris distributional hypothesis and model the context of a certain term as a vector representing syntactic dependencies which are automatically acquired from the text corpus with a linguistic parser  on the basis of this context information fca produces a lattice that we convert into a special kind of partial order constituting a concept hierarchy  the approach is evaluated by comparing the resulting concept hierarchies with handcrafted taxonomies for two domains tourism and finance  we also directly compare our approach with hierarchical agglomerative clustering as well as with bisectionkmeans as an instance of a divisive clustering algorithm furthermore we investigate the impact of using different measures weighting the contribution of each attribute as well as of applying a particular smoothing technique to cope with data sparseness
