we investigate complexity issues related to pure nash equilibria of strategic games we show that even in very restrictive settings determining whether a game has a pure nash equilibrium is nphard while deciding whether a game has a strong nash equilibrium is sigmap2complete  we then study practically relevant restrictions that lower the complexity in particular we are interested in quantitative and qualitative restrictions of the way each players payoff depends on moves of other players  we say that a game has small neighborhood if the utility function for each player depends only on the actions of a logarithmically small number of other players the dependency structure of a game g can be expressed by a graph dgg or by a hypergraph hg by relating nash equilibrium problems to constraint satisfaction problems csps we show that if g has small neighborhood and if hg has bounded hypertree width or if dgg has bounded treewidth then finding pure nash and pareto equilibria is feasible in polynomial time if the game is graphical then these problems are logcflcomplete and thus in the class nc2 of highly parallelizable problems
