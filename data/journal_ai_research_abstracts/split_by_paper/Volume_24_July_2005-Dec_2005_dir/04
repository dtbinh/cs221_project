p  j hawkins  v  lagoon and  p  j stuckey 2005 solving set constraint satisfaction problems using robdds volume 24 pages 109156

in this paper we present a new approach to modeling finite set domain constraint problems using reduced ordered binary decision diagrams robdds we show that it is possible to construct an efficient set domain propagator which compactly represents many set domains and set constraints using robdds  we demonstrate that the robddbased approach provides unprecedented flexibility in modeling constraint satisfaction problems leading to performance improvements we also show that the robddbased modeling approach can be extended to the modeling of integer and multiset constraint problems in a straightforward manner since domain propagation is not always practical we also show how to incorporate less strict consistency notions into the robdd framework such as set bounds cardinality bounds and lexicographic bounds consistency finally we present experimental results that demonstrate the robddbased solver performs better than various more conventional constraint solvers on several standard set constraint problems
