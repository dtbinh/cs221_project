j  hoffmann 2005 where ignoring delete lists works local search topology in planning benchmarks volume 24 pages 685758

between 1998 and 2004 the planning community has seen vast progress in terms of the sizes of benchmark examples that domainindependent planners can tackle successfully the key technique behind this progress is the use of heuristic functions based on relaxing the planning task at hand where the relaxation is to assume that all delete lists are empty the unprecedented success of such methods in many commonly used benchmark examples calls for an understanding of what classes of domains these methods are well suited for   in the investigation at hand we derive a formal background to such an understanding we perform a case study covering a range of 30 commonly used strips and adl benchmark domains including all examples used in the first four international planning competitions we prove connections between domain structure and local search topology  heuristic cost surface properties  under an idealized version of the heuristic functions used in modern planners the idealized heuristic function is called h and differs from the practically used functions in that it returns the length of an optimal relaxed plan which is nphard to compute we identify several key characteristics of the topology under h concerning the existencenonexistence of unrecognized dead ends as well as the existencenonexistence of constant upper bounds on the difficulty of escaping local minima and benches these distinctions divide the set of all planning domains into a taxonomy of classes of varying h topology as it turns out many of the 30 investigated domains lie in classes with a relatively easy topology most particularly 12 of the domains lie in classes where ffs search algorithm provided with h is a polynomial solving mechanism   we also present results relating h to its approximation as implemented in ff the behavior regarding dead ends is provably the same we summarize the results of an empirical investigation showing that in many domains the topological qualities of h are largely inherited by the approximation the overall investigation gives a rare example of a successful analysis of the connections between typicalcase problem structure and search performance the theoretical investigation also gives hints on how the topological phenomena might be automatically recognizable by domain analysis techniques we outline some preliminary steps we made into that direction
