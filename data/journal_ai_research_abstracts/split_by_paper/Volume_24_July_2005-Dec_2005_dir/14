we present a uniform nonmonotonic solution to the problems of reasoning about action on the basis of an argumentationtheoretic approach our theory is provably correct relative to a sensible minimisation policy introduced on top of a temporal propositional logic sophisticated problem domains can be formalised in our framework  as much attention of researchers in the field has been paid to the traditional and basic problems in reasoning about actions such as the frame the qualification and the ramification problems approaches to these problems within our formalisation lie at heart of the expositions presented in this paper
