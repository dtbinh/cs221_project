hl  chieu and ws  lee 2009 relaxed survey propagation for the weighted maximum satisfiability problem volume 36 pages 229266

the survey propagation sp algorithm has been shown to work well on large instances of the random 3sat problem near its phase transition it was shown that sp estimates marginals over covers that represent clusters of solutions the spy algorithm generalizes sp to work on the maximum satisfiability maxsat problem but the cover interpretation of sp does not generalize to spy in this paper  we formulate the relaxed survey propagation rsp algorithm which extends the sp algorithm to apply to the  weighted maxsat problem we show that rsp has an interpretation of  estimating marginals over covers violating a set of clauses with  minimal weight this naturally generalizes the cover  interpretation of sp empirically we show that rsp outperforms  spy and other stateoftheart maxsat solvers on random maxsat instances rsp also outperforms stateoftheart weighted maxsat solvers on random weighted maxsat instances
