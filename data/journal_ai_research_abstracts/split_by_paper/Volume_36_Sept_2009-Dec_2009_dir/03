we present a novel bayesian topic model for learning discourselevel document structure our model leverages insights from discourse theory to constrain latent topic assignments in a way that reflects the underlying organization of document topics we propose a global model in which both topic selection and ordering are biased to be similar across a collection of related documents we show that this space of orderings can be effectively represented using a distribution over permutations called the generalized mallows model we apply our method to three complementary discourselevel tasks crossdocument alignment document segmentation and information ordering our experiments show that incorporating our permutationbased model in these applications yields substantial improvements in performance over previously proposed methods
