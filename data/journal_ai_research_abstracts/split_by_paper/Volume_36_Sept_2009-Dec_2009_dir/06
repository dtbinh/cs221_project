the identification of performanceoptimizing parameter settings is an important part of the development and application of algorithms we describe an automatic framework for this algorithm configuration problem more formally we provide methods for optimizing a target algorithms performance on a given class of problem instances by varying a set of ordinal andor categorical parameters we review a family of localsearchbased algorithm configuration procedures and present novel techniques for accelerating them by adaptively limiting the time spent for evaluating individual configurations we describe the results of a comprehensive experimental evaluation of our methods based on the configuration of prominent complete and incomplete algorithms for sat we also present what is to our knowledge the first published work on automatically configuring the cplex mixed integer programming solver all the algorithms we considered had default parameter settings that were manually identified with considerable effort nevertheless using our automated algorithm configuration procedures we achieved substantial and consistent performance improvements
