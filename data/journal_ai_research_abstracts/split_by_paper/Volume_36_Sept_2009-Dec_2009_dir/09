m  feldman and t  tamir 2009 approximate strong equilibrium in job scheduling games volume 36 pages 387414

a nash equilibrium ne is a strategy profile resilient to unilateral deviations and is predominantly used in the analysis of multiagent systems a downside of ne is that it is not necessarily stable against deviations by coalitions yet as we show in this paper in some cases ne does exhibit stability against coalitional deviations in that the benefits from a joint deviation are bounded in this sense ne approximates strong equilibrium

our results indicate that lpt performs better than a general ne  however lpt is not the best possible approximation in particular we present a polynomial time approximation scheme ptas for the makespan minimization problem which provides a schedule with irmin of 1epsilon for any given epsilon with respect to computational complexity we show that given an ne on m  3 identical machines or m  2 unrelated machines it is nphard to determine whether a given coalition can deviate such that every member decreases its cost
