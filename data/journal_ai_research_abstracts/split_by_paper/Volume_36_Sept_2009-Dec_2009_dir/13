e  keyder and h  geffner 2009 soft goals can be compiled away volume 36 pages 547556

soft goals extend the classical model of planning with a simple model of preferences the best plans are then not the ones with least cost but the ones with maximum utility where the utility of a plan is the sum of the utilities of the soft goals achieved minus the plan cost finding plans with high utility appears to involve two linked problems choosing a subset of soft goals to achieve and finding a lowcost plan to achieve them  new search algorithms and heuristics have been developed for planning with soft goals and a new track has been introduced in the international planning competition ipc to test their performance in this note we show however that these extensions are not needed soft goals do not increase the expressive power of the basic model of planning with action costs as they can easily be compiled away we apply this compilation to the problems of the netbenefit track of the most recent ipc and show that optimal and satisficing costbased planners do better on the compiled problems than optimal and satisficing netbenefit planners on the original problems with explicit soft goals furthermore we show that penalties or negative preferences expressing conditions to avoid can also be compiled away using a similar idea
