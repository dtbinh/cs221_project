s  pado and m  lapata 2009 crosslingual annotation projection for semantic roles volume 36 pages 307340

 this article considers the task of automatically inducing rolesemantic annotations in the framenet paradigm for new languages  we propose a general framework that is based on annotation projection phrased as a graph optimization problem it is relatively inexpensive and has the potential to reduce the human effort involved in creating rolesemantic resources within this framework we present projection models that exploit lexical and syntactic information we provide an experimental evaluation on an englishgerman parallel corpus which demonstrates the feasibility of inducing highprecision german semantic role annotation both for manually and automatically annotated english data
