b  motik r  shearer and i  horrocks 2009 hypertableau reasoning for description logics volume 36 pages 165228

we present a novel reasoning calculus for the description logic shoiqa knowledge representation formalism with applications in areas such as the semantic web unnecessary nondeterminism and the construction of large models are two primary sources of inefficiency in the tableaubased reasoning calculi used in stateoftheart reasoners in order to reduce nondeterminism we base our calculus on hypertableau and hyperresolution calculi which we extend with a blocking condition to ensure termination in order to reduce the size of the constructed models we introduce anywhere pairwise blocking we also present an improved nominal introduction rule that ensures termination in the presence of nominals inverse roles and number restrictionsa combination of dl constructs that has proven notoriously difficult to handle our implementation shows significant performance improvements over stateoftheart reasoners on several wellknown ontologies
