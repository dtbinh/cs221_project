the recently introduced series of description logics under the common moniker dllite has attracted attention of the description logic and semantic web communities due to the low computational complexity of inference on the one hand and the ability to represent  conceptual modeling formalisms on the other  the main aim of this article is to carry out a thorough and systematic investigation of inference in extensions of the original dllite logics along five axes by i adding the boolean connectives and ii number restrictions to concept constructs iii allowing role hierarchies iv allowing role disjointness symmetry asymmetry reflexivity irreflexivity and transitivity constraints and v adopting or dropping  the unique same assumption  we analyze the combined complexity of satisfiability for the resulting logics as well as the data complexity of instance checking and answering positive existential queries  our approach is based on embedding dllite logics in suitable fragments of the onevariable firstorder logic which provides useful insights into their properties and in particular computational behavior
