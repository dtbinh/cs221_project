a  jonsson 2009 the role of macros in tractable planning volume 36 pages 471511

this paper presents several new tractability results for planning based on macros we describe an algorithm that optimally solves planning problems in a class that we call inverted tree reducible and is provably tractable for several subclasses of this class by using macros to store partial plans that recur frequently in the solution the algorithm is polynomial in time and space even for exponentially long plans we generalize the inverted tree reducible class in several ways and describe modifications of the algorithm to deal with these new classes theoretical results are validated in experiments
