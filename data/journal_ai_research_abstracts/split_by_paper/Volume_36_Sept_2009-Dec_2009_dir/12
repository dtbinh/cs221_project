in this paper we describe our autonomous bidding agent roxybot who emerged victorious in the travel division of the 2006 trading agent competition in a photo finish  at a high level the design of many successful trading agents can be summarized as follows i price prediction build a model of market prices and ii optimization solve for an approximately optimal set of bids given this model  to predict roxybot builds a stochastic model of market prices by simulating simultaneous ascending auctions  to optimize roxybot relies on the sample average approximation method a stochastic optimization technique
