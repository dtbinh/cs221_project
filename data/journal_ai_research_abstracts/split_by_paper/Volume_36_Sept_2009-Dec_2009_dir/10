c  domshlak j  hoffmann and a  sabharwal 2009 friends or foes on planning as satisfiability and abstract cnf encodings volume 36 pages 415469

planning as satisfiability as implemented in for instance the satplan tool is a highly competitive method for finding parallel stepoptimal plans a bottleneck in this approach is to prove the absence of plans of a certain length specifically if the optimal plan has n steps then it is typically very costly to prove that there is no plan of length n1 we pursue the idea of leading this proof within solution length preserving abstractions overapproximations of the original planning task this is promising because the abstraction may have a much smaller state space related methods are highly successful in model checking in particular we design a novel abstraction technique based on which one can in several widely used planning benchmarks construct abstractions that have exponentially smaller state spaces while preserving the length of an optimal plan
