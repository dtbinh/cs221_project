machine transliteration is a method for automatically converting words in one language into phonetically equivalent ones in another language machine transliteration plays an important role in natural language applications such as information retrieval and machine translation especially for handling proper nouns and technical terms four machine transliteration models  graphemebased transliteration model phonemebased transliteration model hybrid transliteration model and correspondencebased transliteration model  have been proposed by several researchers to date however there has been little research on a framework in which multiple transliteration models can operate simultaneously furthermore there has been no comparison of the four models within the same framework and using the same data we addressed these problems by 1 modeling the four models within the same framework 2 comparing them under the same conditions and 3 developing a way to improve machine transliteration through this comparison our comparison showed that the hybrid and correspondencebased models were the most effective and that the four models can be used in a complementary manner to improve machine transliteration performance

this paper considers global optimization with a blackbox unknown objective function that can be nonconvex and nondifferentiable such a difficult optimization problem arises in many realworld applications such as parameter tuning in machine learning engineering design problem and planning with a complex physics simulator this paper proposes a new global optimization algorithm called locally oriented global optimization logo to aim for both fast convergence in practice and finitetime error bound in theory the advantage and usage of the new algorithm are illustrated via theoretical analysis and an experiment conducted with 11 benchmark test functions further we modify the logo algorithm to specifically solve a planning problem via policy search with continuous stateaction space and long time horizon while maintaining its finitetime error bound we apply the proposed planning method to accident management of a nuclear power plant the result of the application study demonstrates the practical utility of our method

finding satisfying assignments for the variables involved in a set of constraints can be cast as a bounded model generation problem search for bounded models of a theory in some logic the stateoftheart approach for bounded model generation for rich knowledge representation languages like asp and fo and a csp modeling language such as zinc is groundandsolve reduce the theory to a ground or propositional one and apply a search algorithm to the resulting theory

an important bottleneck is the blowup of the size of the theory caused by the grounding phase lazily grounding the theory during search is a way to overcome this bottleneck we present a theoretical framework and an implementation in the context of the fo knowledge representation language instead of grounding all parts of a theory justifications are derived for some parts of it given a partial assignment for the grounded part of the theory and valid justifications for the formulas of the nongrounded part the justifications provide a recipe to construct a complete assignment that satisfies the nongrounded part when a justification for a particular formula becomes invalid during search a new one is derived if that fails the formula is split in a part to be grounded and a part that can be justified experimental results illustrate the power and generality of this approach











j  c beck and n  wilson 2007 proactive algorithms for job shop scheduling with probabilistic durations volume 28 pages 183232



various tasks in decision making and decision support systems require selecting a preferred subset of a given set of items here we focus on problems where the individual items are described using a set of characterizing attributes and a generic preference specification is required that is a specification that can work with an arbitrary set of items for example preferences over the content of an online newspaper should have this form at each viewing the newspaper contains a subset of the set of articles currently available our preference specification over this subset should be provided offline but we should be able to use it to select a subset of any currently available set of articles eg based on their tags  we present a general approach for lifting formalisms for specifying preferences over objects with multiple attributes into ones that specify preferences over subsets of such objects we also show how we can compute an optimal subset given such a specification in a relatively efficient manner we provide an empirical evaluation of the approach as well as some worstcase complexity results

we give the analysis of the computational complexity of coalition structure generation over graphs given an undirected graph g  ne and a valuation function v  pn 8594 r over the subsets of nodes the problem is to find a partition of n into connected subsets that maximises the sum of the components values this problem is generally npcomplete in particular it is hard for a defined class of valuation functions which are independent of disconnected membersthat is two nodes have no effect on each others marginal con tribution to their vertex separator nonetheless for all such functions we provide bounds on the complexity of coalition structure generation over general and minorfree graphs our proof is constructive and yields algorithms for solving corresponding instances of the problem furthermore we derive linear time bounds for graphs of bounded treewidth however as we show the problem remains npcomplete for planar graphs and hence for any kk minorfree graphs where k 8805 5 moreover a 3sat problem with m clauses can be represented by a coalition structure generation problem over a planar graph with om2 nodes importantly our hardness result holds for a particular subclass of valuation functions termed edge sum where the value of each subset of nodes is simply determined by the sum of given weights of the edges in the induced subgraph





we develop an online mechanism for the allocation of an expiring resource to a dynamic agent population each agent has a nonincreasing marginal valuation function for the resource and an upper limit on the number of units that can be allocated in any period we propose two versions on a truthful allocation mechanism each modifies the decisions of a greedy online assignment algorithm by sometimes cancelling an allocation of resources one version makes this modification immediately upon an allocation decision while a second waits until the point at which an agent departs the market adopting a priorfree framework we show that the second approach has better worstcase allocative efficiency and is more scalable on the other hand the first approach with immediate cancellation may be easier in practice because it does not need to reclaim units previously allocated we consider an application to recharging plugin hybrid electric vehicles phevs using data from a realworld trial of phevs in the uk we demonstrate higher system performance than a fixed price system performance comparable with a standard but nontruthful scheduling heuristic and the ability to support 50 more vehicles at the same fuel cost than a simple randomized policy

designing a search heuristic for constraint programming that is reliable across problem domains has been an important research topic in recent years this paper concentrates on one family of candidates countingbased search such heuristics seek to make branching decisions that preserve most of the solutions by determining what proportion of solutions to each individual constraint agree with that decision whereas most generic search heuristics in constraint programming rely on local information at the level of the individual variable our search heuristics are based on more global information at the constraint level we design several algorithms that are used to count the number of solutions to specific families of constraints and propose some search heuristics exploiting such information the experimental part of the paper considers eight problem domains ranging from wellestablished benchmark puzzles to rostering and sport scheduling an initial empirical analysis identifies heuristic maxsd as a robust candidate among our proposalsewe then evaluate the latter against the state of the art including the latest generic search heuristics restarts and discrepancybased tree traversals experimental results show that countingbased search generally outperforms other generic heuristics

in this article we present a threestep methodology for dynamically improving a statistical machine translation smt system by incorporating human feedback in the form of free edits on the system translations we target at feedback provided by casual users which is typically errorprone thus we first propose a filtering step to automatically identify the better useredited translations and discard the useless ones a second step produces a pivotbased alignment between source and useredited sentences focusing on the errors made by the system finally a third step produces a new translation model and combines it linearly with the one from the original system we perform a thorough evaluation on a realworld dataset collected from the reversonet translation service and show that every step in our methodology contributes significantly to improve a general purpose smt system interestingly the quality improvement is not only due to the increase of lexical coverage but to a better lexical selection reordering and morphology finally we show the robustness of the methodology by applying it to a different scenario in which the new examples come from an automatically webcrawled parallel corpus using exactly the same architecture and models provides again a significant improvement of the translation quality of a general purpose baseline smt system







realtime search methods are suited for tasks in which the agent is interacting with an initially unknown environment in real time in such simultaneous planning and learning problems the agent has to select its actions in a limited amount of time while sensing only a local part of the environment centered at the agents current location realtime heuristic search agents select actions using a limited lookahead search and evaluating the frontier states with a heuristic function over repeated experiences they refine heuristic values of states to avoid infinite loops and to converge to better solutions the wide spread of such settings in autonomous software and hardware agents has led to an explosion of realtime search algorithms over the last two decades not only is a potential user confronted with a hodgepodge of algorithms but he also faces the choice of control parameters they use in this paper we address both problems the first contribution is an introduction of a simple threeparameter framework named lrts which extracts the core ideas behind many existing algorithms we then prove that lrta epsilonlrta sla and gammatrap algorithms are special cases of our framework thus they are unified and extended with additional features second we prove completeness and convergence of any algorithm covered by the lrts framework third we prove several upperbounds relating the control parameters and solution quality finally we analyze the influence of the three control parameters empirically in the realistic scalable domains of realtime navigation on initially unknown maps from a commercial roleplaying game as well as routing in ad hoc sensor networks

social causality is the inference an entity makes about the social behavior of other entities and self besides physical cause and effect social causality involves reasoning about epistemic states of agents and coercive circumstances based on such inference responsibility judgment is the process whereby one singles out individuals to assign responsibility credit or blame for multiagent activities social causality and responsibility judgment are a key aspect of social intelligence and a model for them facilitates the design and development of a variety of multiagent interactive systems based on psychological attribution theory this paper presents a domainindependent computational model to automate social inference and judgment process according to an agents causal knowledge and observations of interaction we conduct experimental studies to empirically validate the computational model the experimental results show that our model predicts human judgments of social attributions and makes inferences consistent with what most people do in their judgments therefore the proposed model can be generically incorporated into an intelligent system to augment its social and cognitive functionality





loopy and generalized belief propagation are popular algorithms for approximate inference in markov random fields and bayesian networks fixed points of these algorithms have been shown to correspond to extrema of the bethe and kikuchi free energy both of which are approximations of the exact helmholtz free energy however belief propagation does not always converge which motivates approaches that explicitly minimize the kikuchibethe free energy such as cccp and ups

here we describe a class of algorithms that solves this typically nonconvex constrained minimization problem through a sequence of  convex constrained minimizations of upper bounds on the kikuchi free energy intuitively one would expect tighter bounds to lead to faster algorithms which is indeed convincingly demonstrated in our simulations several ideas are applied to obtain tight convex bounds that yield dramatic speedups over cccp

researchers and scientists increasingly find themselves in the position of having to quickly understand large amounts of technical material our goal is to effectively serve this need by using bibliometric text mining and summarization techniques to generate summaries of scientific literature  we show how we can use citations to produce automatically generated readily consumable technical extractive summaries we first propose clexrank a model for summarizing single scientific articles based on citations which employs community detection and extracts salient informationrich sentences next we further extend our experiments  to summarize a set of papers which cover the same scientific topic we generate extractive summaries of a set of question answering qa and dependency parsing dp papers their abstracts and their citation sentences and show that citations have unique information amenable to creating a summary







r  elyaniv and d  pechyony 2009 transductive rademacher complexity and its applications volume 35 pages 193234



we develop a technique for deriving datadependent error bounds for transductive learning algorithms based on transductive rademacher complexity our technique is based on a novel general error bound for transduction in terms of transductive rademacher complexity together with a novel bounding technique for rademacher averages for particular algorithms in terms of their unlabeledlabeled representation this technique is relevant to many advanced graphbased transductive algorithms and we demonstrate its effectiveness by deriving error bounds to three well known algorithms finally we present a new pacbayesian bound for mixtures of transductive algorithms based on our rademacher bounds





in this article we present a threestep methodology for dynamically improving a statistical machine translation smt system by incorporating human feedback in the form of free edits on the system translations we target at feedback provided by casual users which is typically errorprone thus we first propose a filtering step to automatically identify the better useredited translations and discard the useless ones a second step produces a pivotbased alignment between source and useredited sentences focusing on the errors made by the system finally a third step produces a new translation model and combines it linearly with the one from the original system we perform a thorough evaluation on a realworld dataset collected from the reversonet translation service and show that every step in our methodology contributes significantly to improve a general purpose smt system interestingly the quality improvement is not only due to the increase of lexical coverage but to a better lexical selection reordering and morphology finally we show the robustness of the methodology by applying it to a different scenario in which the new examples come from an automatically webcrawled parallel corpus using exactly the same architecture and models provides again a significant improvement of the translation quality of a general purpose baseline smt system







realtime search methods are suited for tasks in which the agent is interacting with an initially unknown environment in real time in such simultaneous planning and learning problems the agent has to select its actions in a limited amount of time while sensing only a local part of the environment centered at the agents current location realtime heuristic search agents select actions using a limited lookahead search and evaluating the frontier states with a heuristic function over repeated experiences they refine heuristic values of states to avoid infinite loops and to converge to better solutions the wide spread of such settings in autonomous software and hardware agents has led to an explosion of realtime search algorithms over the last two decades not only is a potential user confronted with a hodgepodge of algorithms but he also faces the choice of control parameters they use in this paper we address both problems the first contribution is an introduction of a simple threeparameter framework named lrts which extracts the core ideas behind many existing algorithms we then prove that lrta epsilonlrta sla and gammatrap algorithms are special cases of our framework thus they are unified and extended with additional features second we prove completeness and convergence of any algorithm covered by the lrts framework third we prove several upperbounds relating the control parameters and solution quality finally we analyze the influence of the three control parameters empirically in the realistic scalable domains of realtime navigation on initially unknown maps from a commercial roleplaying game as well as routing in ad hoc sensor networks

social causality is the inference an entity makes about the social behavior of other entities and self besides physical cause and effect social causality involves reasoning about epistemic states of agents and coercive circumstances based on such inference responsibility judgment is the process whereby one singles out individuals to assign responsibility credit or blame for multiagent activities social causality and responsibility judgment are a key aspect of social intelligence and a model for them facilitates the design and development of a variety of multiagent interactive systems based on psychological attribution theory this paper presents a domainindependent computational model to automate social inference and judgment process according to an agents causal knowledge and observations of interaction we conduct experimental studies to empirically validate the computational model the experimental results show that our model predicts human judgments of social attributions and makes inferences consistent with what most people do in their judgments therefore the proposed model can be generically incorporated into an intelligent system to augment its social and cognitive functionality





loopy and generalized belief propagation are popular algorithms for approximate inference in markov random fields and bayesian networks fixed points of these algorithms have been shown to correspond to extrema of the bethe and kikuchi free energy both of which are approximations of the exact helmholtz free energy however belief propagation does not always converge which motivates approaches that explicitly minimize the kikuchibethe free energy such as cccp and ups

here we describe a class of algorithms that solves this typically nonconvex constrained minimization problem through a sequence of  convex constrained minimizations of upper bounds on the kikuchi free energy intuitively one would expect tighter bounds to lead to faster algorithms which is indeed convincingly demonstrated in our simulations several ideas are applied to obtain tight convex bounds that yield dramatic speedups over cccp
