in this paper we present two alternative approaches to defining answer sets for logic programs with arbitrary types of abstract constraint atoms catoms these approaches generalize the fixpointbased and the level mapping based answer set semantics of normal logic programs to the case of logic programs with arbitrary types of catoms the results are four different answer set definitions which are equivalent when applied to normal logic programs  

we show that the newly defined semantics coincide with previously introduced semantics for logic programs with monotone catoms and they extend the original answer set semantics of normal logic programs we also study some properties of answer sets of programs with catoms and relate our definitions to several semantics for logic programs with aggregates presented in the literature
