numerous formalisms and dedicated algorithms have been designed in the last decades to model and solve decision making problems some formalisms such as constraint networks can express simple decision problems while others are designed to take into account uncertainties unfeasible decisions and utilities even in a single formalism several variants are often proposed to model different types of uncertainty probability possibility or utility additive or not  in this article we introduce an algebraic graphical model that encompasses a large number of such formalisms 1 we first adapt previous structures from friedman chu and halpern for representing uncertainty utility and expected utility in order to deal with generic forms of sequential decision making 2 on these structures we then introduce composite graphical models that express information via variables linked by local functions thanks to conditional independence 3 on these graphical models we finally define a simple class of queries which can represent various scenarios in terms of observabilities and controllabilities a natural decisiontree semantics for such queries is completed by an equivalent operational semantics which induces generic algorithms  the proposed framework called the plausibilityfeasibilityutility pfu framework  not only provides a better understanding of the links between existing formalisms but it also covers yet unpublished frameworks such as possibilistic influence diagrams and unifies formalisms such as quantified boolean formulas and influence diagrams our backtrack and variable elimination generic algorithms are a first step towards unified algorithms
