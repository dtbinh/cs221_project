a major achievement of mechanism design theory is a general method for the construction of truthful mechanisms called vcg vickrey  clarke  groves when applying this method to complex problems such as combinatorial auctions a difficulty arises vcg mechanisms are required to compute optimal outcomes and are therefore computationally infeasible however if the optimal outcome is replaced by the results of a suboptimal algorithm the resulting mechanism termed vcgbased is no longer necessarily truthful the first part of this paper studies this phenomenon in depth and shows that it is near universal  specifically we prove that essentially all reasonable approximations or heuristics for combinatorial auctions as well as a wide class of cost minimization problems yield nontruthful vcgbased mechanisms we generalize these results for affine maximizers

the second part of this paper proposes a general method for circumventing the above problem we introduce a modification of vcgbased mechanisms in which the agents are given a chance to improve the output of the underlying algorithm when the agents behave truthfully the welfare obtained by the mechanism is at least as good as the one obtained by the algorithms output we provide a strong rationale for truthtelling behavior our method satisfies individual rationality as well
