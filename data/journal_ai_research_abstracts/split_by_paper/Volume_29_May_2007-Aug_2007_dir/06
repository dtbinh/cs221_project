this paper introduces and analyzes a battery of inference models for the problem of semantic role labeling one based on constraint satisfaction and several strategies that model the inference as a metalearning problem using discriminative classifiers these classifiers are developed with a rich set of novel features that encode proposition and sentencelevel information to our knowledge this is the first work that a performs a thorough analysis of learningbased inference models for semantic role labeling and b compares several inference strategies in this context we evaluate the proposed inference strategies in the framework of the conll2005 shared task using only automaticallygenerated syntactic information  the extensive experimental evaluation and analysis indicates that all the proposed inference strategies are successful they all outperform the current best results reported in the conll2005 evaluation exercise but each of the proposed approaches has its advantages and disadvantages several important traits of a stateoftheart srl combination strategy emerge from this analysis i individual models should be combined at the granularity of candidate arguments rather than at the granularity of complete solutions ii the best combination strategy uses an inference model based in learning and iii the learningbased inference benefits from maxmargin classifiers and  global feedback
