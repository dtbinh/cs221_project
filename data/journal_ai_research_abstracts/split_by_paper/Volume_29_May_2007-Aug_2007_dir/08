j  huang and a  darwiche 2007 the language of search volume 29 pages 191219

this paper is concerned with a class of algorithms that perform exhaustive search on propositional knowledge bases we show that each of these algorithms defines and generates a propositional language specifically we show that the trace of a search can be interpreted as a combinational circuit and a search algorithm then defines a propositional language consisting of circuits that are generated across all possible executions of the algorithm in particular we show that several versions of exhaustive dpll search correspond to such wellknown languages as fbdd obdd and a preciselydefined subset of ddnnf by thus mapping search algorithms to propositional languages we provide a uniform and practical framework in which successful search techniques can be harnessed for compilation of knowledge into various languages of interest and a new methodology whereby the power and limitations of search algorithms can be understood by looking up the tractability and succinctness of the corresponding propositional languages
