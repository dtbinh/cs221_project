research on agent communication languages has typically taken the speech acts paradigm as its starting point despite their manifest attractions speechact models of communication have several serious disadvantages as a foundation for communication in artificial agent systems in particular it has proved to be extremely difficult to give a satisfactory semantics to speechact based agent communication languages in part the problem is that speechact semantics typically make reference to the mental states of agents their beliefs desires and intentions and there is in general no way to attribute such attitudes to arbitrary computational agents in addition agent programming languages have only had their semantics formalised for abstract standalone versions neglecting aspects such as communication primitives with respect to communication implemented agent programming languages have tended to be rather ad hoc this paper addresses both of these problems by giving semantics to speechact based messages received by an agentspeak agent agentspeak is a logicbased agent programming language which incorporates the main features of the prs model of reactive planning systems the paper builds upon a structural operational semantics to agentspeak that we developed in previous work the main contributions of this paper are as follows an extension of our earlier work on the theoretical foundations of agentspeak interpreters a computationally grounded semantics for the core performatives used in speechact based agent communication languages and a welldefined extension of agentspeak that supports agent communication
