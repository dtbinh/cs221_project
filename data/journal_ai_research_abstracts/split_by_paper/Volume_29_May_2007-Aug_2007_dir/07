we consider the problem of computing a lightest derivation of a global structure using a set of weighted rules  a large variety of inference problems in ai can be formulated in this framework  we generalize a search and heuristics derived from abstractions to a broad class of lightest derivation problems  we also describe a new algorithm that searches for lightest derivations using a hierarchy of abstractions  our generalization of a gives a new algorithm for searching andor graphs in a bottomup fashion
