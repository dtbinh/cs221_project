solutionguided multipoint constructive search sgmpcs is a novel constructive search technique that performs a series of resourcelimited tree searches where each search begins either from an empty solution as in randomized restart or from a solution that has been encountered during the search a small number of these elite solutions is maintained during the search we introduce the technique and perform three sets of experiments on the job shop scheduling problem first a systematic fully crossed study of sgmpcs is carried out to evaluate the performance impact of various parameter settings second we inquire into the diversity of the elite solution set showing contrary to expectations that a less diverse set leads to stronger performance finally we compare the best parameter setting of sgmpcs from the first two experiments to chronological backtracking limited discrepancy search randomized restart and a sophisticated tabu search algorithm on a set of wellknown benchmark problems results demonstrate that sgmpcs is significantly better than the other constructive techniques tested though lags behind the tabu search
