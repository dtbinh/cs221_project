in this article we work towards the goal of developing agents that can learn to act in complex worlds  we develop a probabilistic relational planning rule representation that compactly models noisy nondeterministic action effects and show how such rules can be effectively learned  through experiments in simple planning domains and a 3d simulated blocks world with realistic physics we demonstrate that this learning algorithm allows agents to effectively model world dynamics
