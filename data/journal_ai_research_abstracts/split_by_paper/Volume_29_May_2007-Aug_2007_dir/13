r  jurca and b  faltings 2007 obtaining reliable feedback for sanctioning reputation mechanisms volume 29 pages 391419

reputation mechanisms offer an effective alternative to verification authorities for building trust in electronic markets with moral hazard future clients guide their business decisions by considering the feedback from past transactions if truthfully exposed cheating behavior is sanctioned and thus becomes irrational

it therefore becomes important to ensure that rational clients have the right incentives to report honestly as an alternative to sidepayment schemes that explicitly reward truthful reports we show that honesty can emerge as a rational behavior when clients have a repeated presence in the market to this end we describe a mechanism that supports an equilibrium where truthful feedback is obtained then we characterize the set of paretooptimal equilibria of the mechanism and derive an upper bound on the percentage of false reports that can be recorded by the mechanism an important role in the existence of this bound is played by the fact that rational clients can establish a reputation for reporting honestly
