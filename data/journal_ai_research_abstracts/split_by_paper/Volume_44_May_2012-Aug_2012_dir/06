we present algorithms for generating alternative solutions for explicit acyclic andor structures in nondecreasing order of cost the proposed algorithms use a best first search technique and report the solutions using an implicit representation ordered by cost in this paper we present two versions of the search algorithm  a an initial version of the best first search algorithm asg which may present one solution more than once while generating the ordered solutions and b another version lasg which avoids the construction of the duplicate solutions the actual solutions can be reconstructed quickly from the implicit compact representation used we have applied the methods on a few test domains some of them are synthetic while the others are based on well known problems including the search space of the 5peg tower of hanoi problem the matrixchain multiplication problem and the problem of finding secondary structure of rna experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithms over the existing approach our proposed algorithms have potential use in various domains ranging from knowledge based frameworks to service composition where the andor structure is widely used for representing problems
