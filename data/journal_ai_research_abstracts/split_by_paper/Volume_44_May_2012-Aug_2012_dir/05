w  mao and j  gratch 2012 modeling social causality and responsibility judgment in multiagent interactions volume 44 pages 223273

social causality is the inference an entity makes about the social behavior of other entities and self besides physical cause and effect social causality involves reasoning about epistemic states of agents and coercive circumstances based on such inference responsibility judgment is the process whereby one singles out individuals to assign responsibility credit or blame for multiagent activities social causality and responsibility judgment are a key aspect of social intelligence and a model for them facilitates the design and development of a variety of multiagent interactive systems based on psychological attribution theory this paper presents a domainindependent computational model to automate social inference and judgment process according to an agents causal knowledge and observations of interaction we conduct experimental studies to empirically validate the computational model the experimental results show that our model predicts human judgments of social attributions and makes inferences consistent with what most people do in their judgments therefore the proposed model can be generically incorporated into an intelligent system to augment its social and cognitive functionality
