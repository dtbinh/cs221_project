compact representations of objects is a common concept in  computer science  automated planning can be viewed as a case of this concept a planning instance is a compact implicit representation of a graph and the problem is to find a path a plan in this graph  while the graphs themselves are represented compactly as planning instances the paths are usually represented explicitly as sequences of actions  some cases are known where the plans always have compact representations for example using macros  we show that these results do not extend to the general case by proving a number of bounds for compact representations of plans under various criteria like efficient sequential or random access of actions  in addition to this we show that our results have consequences for what can be gained from reformulating planning into some other problem  as a contrast to this we also prove a number of positive results demonstrating restricted cases where plans do have useful compact representations as well as proving that macro plans have favourable access properties  our results are finally discussed in relation to other relevant contexts
