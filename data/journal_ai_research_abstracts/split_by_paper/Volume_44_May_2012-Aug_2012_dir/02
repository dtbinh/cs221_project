we present a new algorithm for exactly solving decision making problems represented as influence diagrams we do not require the usual assumptions of no forgetting and regularity this allows us to solve problems with simultaneous decisions and limited information the algorithm is empirically shown to outperform a stateoftheart algorithm on randomly generated problems of up to 150 variables and 1064 solutions we show that these problems are nphard even if the underlying graph structure of the problem has low treewidth and the variables take on a bounded number of  states and that they admit no provably good approximation if variables can take on an arbitrary number of states
