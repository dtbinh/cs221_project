p  d turney 2012 domain and function a dualspace model of semantic relations and compositions volume 44 pages 533585

given appropriate representations of the semantic relations between carpenter and wood and between mason and stone for example vectors in a vector space model a suitable algorithm should be able to recognize that these relations are highly similar carpenter is to wood as mason is to stone the relations are analogous likewise with representations of dog house and kennel an algorithm should be able to recognize that the semantic composition of dog and house dog house is highly similar to kennel dog house and kennel are synonymous it seems that these two tasks recognizing relations and compositions are closely connected however up to now the best models for relations are significantly different from the best models for compositions in this paper we introduce a dualspace model that unifies these two tasks this model matches the performance of the best previous models for relations and compositions the dualspace model consists of a space for measuring domain similarity and a space for measuring function similarity carpenter and wood share the same domain the domain of carpentry mason and stone share the same domain the domain of masonry carpenter and mason share the same function the function of artisans wood and stone share the same function the function of materials in the composition dog house kennel has some domain overlap with both dog and house the domains of pets and buildings the function of kennel is similar to the function of house the function of shelters by combining domain and function similarities in various ways we can model relations compositions and other aspects of semantics
