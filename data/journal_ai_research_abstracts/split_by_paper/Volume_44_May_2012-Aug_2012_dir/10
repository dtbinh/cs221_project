e  albacete j  calle e  castro and d  cuadra 2012 semantic similarity measures applied to an ontology for humanlike interaction volume 44 pages 397421

the focus of this paper is the calculation of similarity between two concepts from an ontology for a humanlike interaction system in order to facilitate this calculation a similarity function is proposed based on five dimensions sort compositional essential restrictive and descriptive constituting the structure of ontological knowledge the paper includes a proposal for computing a similarity function for each dimension of knowledge later on the similarity values obtained are weighted and aggregated to obtain a global similarity measure in order to calculate those weights associated to each dimension four training methods have been proposed the training methods differ in the element to fit the user concepts or pairs of concepts and a hybrid approach for evaluating the proposal the knowledge base was fed from wordnet and extended by using a knowledge editing toolkit cognos the evaluation of the proposal is carried out through the comparison of system responses with those given by human test subjects both providing a measure of the soundness of the procedure and revealing ways in which the proposal may be improved
