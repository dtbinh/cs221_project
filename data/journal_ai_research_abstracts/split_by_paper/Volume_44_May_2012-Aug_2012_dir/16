j  hoffmann i  weber and f  m kraft 2012 sap speaks pddl exploiting a softwareengineering model for planning in business process management volume 44 pages 587632

planning is concerned with the automated solution of action sequencing problems described in declarative languages giving the action preconditions and effects one important application area for such technology is the creation of new processes in business process management bpm which is essential in an ever more dynamic business environment a major obstacle for the application of planning in this area lies in the modeling obtaining a suitable model to plan with  ideally a description in pddl the most commonly used planning language  is often prohibitively complicated andor costly our core observation in this work is that this problem can be ameliorated by leveraging synergies with modelbased software development our application at sap one of the leading vendors of enterprise software demonstrates that even onetoone model reuse is possible

we compile sam into a variant of pddl and adapt an offtheshelf planner to solve this kind of problem thanks to the resulting technology business experts may create new processes simply by specifying the desired behavior in terms of status variable value changes effectively by describing the process in their own language
