efficient use of multiple batteries is a practical problem with wide and growing application the problem can be cast as a planning problem under uncertainty we describe the approach we have adopted to modelling and solving this problem seen as a markov decision problem building effective policies for battery switching in the face of stochastic load profiles 

application of the approach leads to construction of policies that in simulation significantly outperform those that are currently in use and the best published solutions to the battery management problem we achieve solutions that achieve more than 99 efficiency in simulation compared with the theoretical limit and do so with far fewer battery switches than existing policies behaviour of physical batteries does not exactly match the simulated models for many reasons so to confirm that our theoretical results can lead to real measured improvements in performance we also conduct and report experiments using a physical test system these results demonstrate that we can obtain 515 improvement in lifetimes in the case of a two battery system
