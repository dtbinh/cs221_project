p  nakov and h t  ng 2012 improving statistical machine translation for a resourcepoor language using related resourcerich languages volume 44 pages 179222

we propose a novel languageindependent approach for improving machine translation for resourcepoor languages by exploiting their similarity to resourcerich ones more precisely we improve the translation from a resourcepoor source language x1 into a resourcerich language y given a bitext containing a limited number of parallel sentences for x1y and a larger bitext for x2y for some resourcerich language x2 that is closely related to x1 this is achieved by taking advantage of the opportunities that vocabulary overlap and similarities between the languages x1 and x2 in spelling word order and syntax offer 1 we improve the word alignments for the resourcepoor language 2 we further augment it with additional translation options and 3 we take care of potential spelling differences through appropriate transliteration the evaluation for indonesian english using malay and for spanish  english using portuguese and pretending spanish is resourcepoor shows an absolute gain of up to 135 and 337 bleu points respectively which is an improvement over the best rivaling approaches while using much less additional data overall our method cuts the amount of necessary real training data by a factor of 25
