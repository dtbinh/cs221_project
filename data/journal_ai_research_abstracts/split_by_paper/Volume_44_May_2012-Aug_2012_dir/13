m  c cooper and s  zivny 2012 tractable triangles and crossfree convexity in discrete optimisation volume 44 pages 455490

the minimisation problem of a sum of unary and pairwise functions of discrete variables is a general nphard problem with wide applications such as computing map configurations in markov random fields mrf minimising gibbs energy or solving binary valued constraint satisfaction problems vcsps

furthermore we introduce a class of problems with convex cardinality functions on crossfree sets of assignments we prove that while imposing only one of the two conditions renders the problem nphard the conjunction of the two gives rise to a novel tractable class satisfying the crossfree convexity property which generalises the jointwinner property to problems of unbounded arity
