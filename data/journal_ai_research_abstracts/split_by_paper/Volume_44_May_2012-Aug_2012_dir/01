in this paper we describe colin a forwardchaining heuristic search planner capable of reasoning with continuous linear numeric change in addition to the full temporal semantics of pddl  through this work we make two advances to the stateoftheart in terms of expressive reasoning capabilities of planners the handling of continuous linear change and the handling of durationdependent effects in combination with duration inequalities both of which require tightly coupled temporal and numeric reasoning during planning  colin combines ffstyle forward chaining search with the use of a linear program lp to check the consistency of the interacting temporal and numeric constraints at each state  the lp is used to compute bounds on the values of variables in each state reducing the range of actions that need to be considered for application  in addition we develop an extension of the temporal relaxed planning graph heuristic of crikey3 to support reasoning directly with continuous change  we extend the range of task variables considered to be suitable candidates for specifying the gradient of the continuous numeric change effected by an action  finally we explore the potential for employing mixed integer programming as a tool for optimising the timestamps of the actions in the plan once a solution has been found to support this we further contribute a selection of extended benchmark domains that include continuous numeric effects  we present results for colin that demonstrate its scalability on a range of benchmarks and compare to existing stateoftheart planners
