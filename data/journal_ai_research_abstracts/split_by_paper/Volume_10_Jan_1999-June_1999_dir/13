this paper considers the problem of learning the ranking of    a set of stochastic alternatives based upon incomplete information    ie a limited number of samples  we describe a system that at    each decision cycle outputs either a complete ordering on the    hypotheses or decides to gather additional information ie    observations at some cost  the ranking problem is a generalization    of the previously studied hypothesis selection problem  in selection    an algorithm must select the single best hypothesis while in ranking    an algorithm must order all the hypotheses      the central problem we address is achieving the desired ranking    quality while minimizing the cost of acquiring additional samples  we    describe two algorithms for hypothesis ranking and their application    for the probably approximately correct pac and expected loss el    learning criteria  empirical results are provided to demonstrate the    effectiveness of these ranking procedures on both synthetic and    realworld datasets
