n  friedman and  j  y halpern 1999 modeling  belief  in  dynamic  systems part  ii  revision  and  update volume 10 pages 117167

the study of belief change has been an active area in    philosophy and ai  in recent years two special cases of belief    change belief revision and belief update have been studied in    detail  in a companion paper friedman  halpern 1997 we introduce    a new framework to model belief change this framework combines    temporal and epistemic modalities with a notion of plausibility    allowing us to examine the change of beliefs over time in this paper    we show how belief revision and belief update can be captured in our    framework  this allows us to compare the assumptions made by each    method and to better understand the principles underlying them  in    particular it shows that katsuno and mendelzons notion of belief    update katsuno  mendelzon 1991a depends on several strong    assumptions that may limit its applicability in artificial    intelligence  finally our analysis allow us to identify a notion of    minimal change that underlies a broad range of belief change    operations including revision and update
