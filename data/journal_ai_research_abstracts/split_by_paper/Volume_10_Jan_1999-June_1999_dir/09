stacked generalization is a general method of using a    highlevel model to combine lowerlevel models to achieve greater    predictive accuracy  in this paper we address two crucial issues    which have been considered to be a black art in classification tasks    ever since the introduction of stacked generalization in 1992 by    wolpert the type of generalizer that is suitable to derive the    higherlevel model and the kind of attributes that should be used as    its input  we find that best results are obtained when the    higherlevel model combines the confidence and not just the    predictions of the lowerlevel ones   we demonstrate the effectiveness of stacked generalization for combining     three different types of learning algorithms for classification tasks    we also compare the performance of stacked generalization with    majority vote and published results of arcing and bagging
