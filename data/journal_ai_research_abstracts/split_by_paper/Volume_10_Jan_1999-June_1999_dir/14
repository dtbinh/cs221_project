a  borgida 1999 extensible knowledge representation the case of description reasoners volume 10 pages 399434

this paper offers an approach to extensible knowledge    representation and reasoning for a family of formalisms known as    description logics the approach is based on the notion of adding new    concept constructors and includes a heuristic methodology for    specifying the desired extensions as well as a modularized software    architecture that supports implementing extensions  the architecture    detailed here falls in the normalizecompared paradigm and supports    both intentional reasoning subsumption involving concepts and    extensional reasoning involving individuals after incremental updates    to the knowledge base      the resulting approach can be used to extend the reasoner with    specialized notions that are motivated by specific problems or    application areas such as reasoning about dates plans etc in    addition it provides an opportunity to implement constructors that    are not currently yet sufficiently well understood theoretically but    are needed in practice also for constructors that are provably hard    to reason with eg ones whose presence would lead to    undecidability it allows the implementation of incomplete reasoners    where the incompleteness is tailored to be acceptable for the    application at hand
