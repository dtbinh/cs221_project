j  rintanen 1999 constructing conditional plans by a theoremprover volume 10 pages 323352

the research on conditional planning rejects the assumptions    that there is no uncertainty or incompleteness of knowledge with    respect to the state and changes of the system the plans operate on    without these assumptions the sequences of operations that achieve the    goals depend on the initial state and the outcomes of nondeterministic    changes in the system  this setting raises the questions of how to    represent the plans and how to perform plan search the answers are    quite different from those in the simpler classical framework  in    this paper we approach conditional planning from a new viewpoint that    is motivated by the use of satisfiability algorithms in classical    planning  translating conditional planning to formulae in the    propositional logic is not feasible because of inherent computational    limitations  instead we translate conditional planning to quantified    boolean formulae  we discuss three formalizations of conditional    planning as quantified boolean formulae and present experimental    results obtained with a theoremprover
