d  long and  m  fox 1999 efficient implementation of the plan graph in stan volume 10 pages 87115

stan is a graphplanbased planner socalled because it uses    a variety of state analysis techniques to enhance its performance    stan competed in the aips98 planning competition where it compared    well with the other competitors in terms of speed finding solutions    fastest to many of the problems posed although the domain analysis    techniques stan exploits are an important factor in its overall    performance we believe that the speed at which stan solved the    competition problems is largely due to the implementation of its plan    graph the implementation is based on two insights that many of the    graph construction operations can be implemented as bitlevel logical    operations on bit vectors and that the graph should not be explicitly    constructed beyond the fix point this paper describes the    implementation of stans plan graph and provides experimental results    which demonstrate the circumstances under which advantages can be    obtained from using this implementation
