t  hogg 1999 solving highly constrained search problems with quantum computers volume 10 pages 3966

a previously developed quantum search algorithm for solving    1sat problems in a single step is generalized to apply to a range    of highly constrained ksat problems we identify a bound on the    number of clauses in satisfiability problems for which the    generalized algorithm can find a solution in a constant number of    steps as the number of variables increases this performance    contrasts with the linear growth in the number of steps required by    the best classical algorithms and the exponential number required    by classical and quantum methods that ignore the problem    structure in some cases the algorithm can also guarantee that    insoluble problems in fact have no solutions unlike previously    proposed quantum search algorithms
