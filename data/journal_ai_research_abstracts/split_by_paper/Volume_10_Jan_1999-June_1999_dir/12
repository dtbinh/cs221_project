we describe a general approach to optimization which we term    squeaky wheel optimization swo  in swo a greedy algorithm is    used to construct a solution which is then analyzed to find the    trouble spots ie those elements that if improved are likely to    improve the objective function score  the results of the analysis are    used to generate new priorities that determine the order in which the    greedy algorithm constructs the next solution  this    constructanalyzeprioritize cycle continues until some limit is    reached or an acceptable solution is found         swo can be viewed as operating on two search spaces solutions and    prioritizations  successive solutions are only indirectly related    via the reprioritization that results from analyzing the prior    solution  similarly successive prioritizations are generated by    constructing and analyzing solutions  this coupled search has some    interesting properties which we discuss         we report encouraging experimental results on two domains scheduling    problems that arise in fiberoptic cable manufacturing and graph    coloring problems  the fact that these domains are very different    supports our claim that swo is a general technique for optimization
