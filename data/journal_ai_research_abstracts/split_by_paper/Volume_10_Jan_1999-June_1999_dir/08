there are many applications in which it is desirable to    order rather than classify instances here we consider the problem of    learning how to order instances given feedback in the form of    preference judgments ie statements to the effect that one instance    should be ranked ahead of another  we outline a twostage approach in    which one first learns by conventional means a binary preference    function indicating whether it is advisable to rank one instance    before another here we consider an online algorithm for learning    preference functions that is based on freund and schapires hedge    algorithm  in the second stage new instances are ordered so as to    maximize agreement with the learned preference function  we show that    the problem of finding the ordering that agrees best with a learned    preference function is npcomplete  nevertheless we describe simple    greedy algorithms that are guaranteed to find a good approximation    finally we show how metasearch can be formulated as an ordering    problem and present experimental results on learning a combination of    search experts each of which is a domainspecific query expansion    strategy for a web search engine
