d  fuchs and  m  fuchs 1999 cooperation between topdown and bottomup theorem provers volume 10 pages 169198

topdown and bottomup theorem proving approaches each    have specific advantages and disadvantages  bottomup provers profit    from strong redundancy control but suffer from the lack of    goalorientation whereas topdown provers are goaloriented but often    have weak calculi when their proof lengths are considered  in order    to integrate both approaches we try to achieve cooperation between a    topdown and a bottomup prover in two different ways the first    technique aims at supporting a bottomup with a topdown prover a    topdown prover generates subgoal clauses they are then processed by    a bottomup prover  the second technique deals with the use of    bottomup generated lemmas in a topdown prover we apply our concept    to the areas of model elimination and superposition  we discuss the    ability of our techniques to shorten proofs as well as to reorder the    search space in an appropriate manner furthermore in order to    identify subgoal clauses and lemmas which are actually relevant for    the proof task we develop methods for a relevancybased filtering    experiments with the provers setheo and spass performed in the problem    library tptp reveal the high potential of our cooperation approaches
