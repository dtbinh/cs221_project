e  davis 1999 order of magnitude comparisons of distance volume 10 pages 138

order of magnitude reasoning  reasoning by rough    comparisons of the sizes of quantities  is often called back of    the envelope calculation with the implication that the calculations    are quick though approximate  this paper exhibits an interesting    class of constraint sets in which order of magnitude reasoning is    demonstrably fast  specifically we present a polynomialtime    algorithm that can solve a set of constraints of the form points a    and b are much closer together than points c and d  we prove that    this algorithm can be applied if much closer together is    interpreted either as referring to an infinite difference in scale or    as referring to a finite difference in scale as long as the    difference in scale is greater than the number of variables in the    constraint set  we also prove that the firstorder theory over such    constraints is decidable
