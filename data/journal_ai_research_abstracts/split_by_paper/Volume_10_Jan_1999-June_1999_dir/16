as was shown recently many important ai problems require    counting the number of models of propositional formulas the problem    of counting models of such formulas is according to present    knowledge computationally intractable in a worst case based on the    davisputnam procedure we present an algorithm cdp that computes    the exact number of models of a propositional cnf or dnf formula    f let m and n be the number of clauses and variables of f    respectively and let p denote the probability that a literal l of f    occurs in a clause c of f then the average running time of cdp is    shown to be onmd where d1log1p  the practical    performance of cdp has been estimated in a series of experiments on a    wide variety of cnf formulas
