we describe a variational approximation method for efficient    inference in largescale probabilistic models  variational methods    are deterministic procedures that provide approximations to marginal    and conditional probabilities of interest  they provide alternatives    to approximate inference methods based on stochastic sampling or    search  we describe a variational approach to the problem of    diagnostic inference in the quick medical reference qmr network    the qmr network is a largescale probabilistic graphical model built    on statistical and expert knowledge  exact probabilistic inference is    infeasible in this model for all but a small set of cases  we    evaluate our variational inference algorithm on a large set of    diagnostic test cases comparing the algorithm to a stateoftheart    stochastic sampling method
