t  lukasiewicz 1999 probabilistic deduction with conditional constraints over basic events volume 10 pages 199241

we study the problem of probabilistic deduction with    conditional constraints over basic events we show that globally    complete probabilistic deduction with conditional constraints over    basic events is nphard we then concentrate on the special case of    probabilistic deduction in conditional constraint trees we elaborate    very efficient techniques for globally complete probabilistic    deduction in detail for conditional constraint trees with point    probabilities we present a local approach to globally complete    probabilistic deduction which runs in linear time in the size of the    conditional constraint trees for conditional constraint trees with    interval probabilities we show that globally complete probabilistic    deduction can be done in a global approach by solving nonlinear    programs we show how these nonlinear programs can be transformed into    equivalent linear programs which are solvable in polynomial time in    the size of the conditional constraint trees
