we describe a new paradigm for implementing inference in    belief networks which consists of two steps 1 compiling a belief    network into an arithmetic expression called a query dag qdag and    2 answering queries using a simple evaluation algorithm each node    of a qdag represents a numeric operation a number or a symbol for    evidence  each leaf node of a qdag represents the answer to a    network query that is the probability of some event of interest it    appears that qdags can be generated using any of the standard    algorithms for exact inference in belief networks we show how they    can be generated using clustering and conditioning algorithms the    time and space complexity of a qdag generation algorithm is no worse    than the time complexity of the inference algorithm on which it is    based the complexity of a qdag evaluation algorithm is linear in the    size of the qdag and such inference amounts to a standard evaluation    of the arithmetic expression it represents the intended value of    qdags is in reducing the software and hardware resources required to    utilize belief networks in online realworld applications the    proposed framework also facilitates the development of online    inference on different software and hardware platforms due to the    simplicity of the qdag evaluation algorithm interestingly enough    qdags were found to serve other purposes simple techniques for    reducing qdags tend to subsume relatively complex optimization    techniques for beliefnetwork inference such as networkpruning and    computationcaching
