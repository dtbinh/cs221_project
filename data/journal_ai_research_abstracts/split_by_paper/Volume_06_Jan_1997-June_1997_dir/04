we argue that the analysis of agentenvironment interactions should be extended to include the conventions and invariants maintained by agents throughout their activity  we refer to this thicker notion of environment as a lifeworld and present a partial set of formal tools for describing structures of lifeworlds and the ways in which they computationally simplify activity  as one specific example we apply the tools to the analysis of the toast system and show how versions of the system with very different control structures in fact implement a common control structure together with different conventions for encoding task state in the positions or states of objects in the environment
