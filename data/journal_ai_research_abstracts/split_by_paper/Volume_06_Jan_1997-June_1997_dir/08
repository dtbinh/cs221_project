several recent studies have compared the relative efficiency    of alternative flaw selection strategies for partialorder causal link    pocl planning  we review this literature and present new    experimental results that generalize the earlier work and explain some    of the discrepancies in it  in particular we describe the leastcost    flaw repair lcfr strategy developed and analyzed by joslin and    pollack 1994 and compare it with other strategies including    gerevini and schuberts 1996 zlifo strategy  lcfr and zlifo make    very different and apparently conflicting claims about the most    effective way to reduce searchspace size in pocl planning  we    resolve this conflict arguing that much of the benefit that gerevini    and schubert ascribe to the lifo component of their zlifo strategy is    better attributed to other causes  we show that for many problems a    strategy that combines leastcost flaw selection with the delay of    separable threats will be effective in reducing searchspace size and    will do so without excessive computational overhead  although such a    strategy thus provides a good default we also show that certain    domain characteristics may reduce its effectiveness
