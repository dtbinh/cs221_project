t  drakengren and  p  jonsson 1997 a complete classification of tractability in rcc5 volume 6 pages 211221

we investigate the computational properties of the spatial    algebra rcc5 which is a restricted version of the rcc framework for    spatial reasoning  the satisfiability problem for rcc5 is known to    be npcomplete but not much is known about its approximately four    billion subclasses we provide a complete classification of    satisfiability for all these subclasses into polynomial and    npcomplete respectively in the process we identify all maximal    tractable subalgebras which are four in total
