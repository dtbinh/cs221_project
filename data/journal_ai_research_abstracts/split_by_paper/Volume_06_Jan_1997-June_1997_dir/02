s  wermter and  v  weber 1997 screen learning a flat syntactic and semantic spoken language analysis using artificial neural networks volume 6 pages 3585

previous approaches of analyzing spontaneously spoken    language often have been based on encoding syntactic and semantic    knowledge manually and symbolically while there has been some    progress using statistical or connectionist language models many    current spoken language systems still use a relatively brittle    handcoded symbolic grammar or symbolic semantic component        in contrast we describe a socalled screening approach for learning    robust processing of spontaneously spoken language  a screening    approach is a flat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category    representations for analyzing an utterance at various syntactic    semantic and dialog levels  rather than using a deeply structured    symbolic analysis we use a flat connectionist analysis  this    screening approach aims at supporting speech and language processing    by using 1 datadriven learning and 2 robustness of connectionist    networks  in order to test this approach we have developed the    screen system which is based on this new robust learned and flat    analysis        in this paper we focus on a detailed description of screens    architecture the flat syntactic and semantic analysis the    interaction with a speech recognizer and a detailed evaluation    analysis of the robustness under the influence of noisy or incomplete    input  the main result of this paper is that flat representations    allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken language than    deeply structured representations  in particular we show how the    faulttolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can    support a flat analysis for providing more robust spokenlanguage    processing within an overall hybrid symbolicconnectionist framework
