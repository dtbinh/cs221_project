g  de giacomo and  m  lenzerini 1997 a uniform framework for concept definitions in description logics volume 6 pages 87110

most modern formalisms used in databases and artificial    intelligence for describing an application domain are based on the    notions of class or concept and relationship among classes  one    interesting feature of such formalisms is the possibility of defining    a class ie providing a set of properties that precisely    characterize the instances of the class  many recent articles point    out that there are several ways of assigning a meaning to a class    definition containing some sort of recursion  in this paper we argue    that instead of choosing a single style of semantics we achieve    better results by adopting a formalism that allows for different    semantics to coexist we demonstrate the feasibility of our argument    by presenting a knowledge representation formalism the description    logic mualcq with the above characteristics  in addition to the    constructs for conjunction disjunction negation quantifiers and    qualified number restrictions mualcq includes special fixpoint    constructs to express suitably interpreted recursive definitions    these constructs enable the usual framebased descriptions to be    combined with definitions of recursive data structures such as    directed acyclic graphs lists streams etc  we establish several    properties of mualcq including the decidability and the computational    complexity of reasoning by formulating a correspondence with a    particular modal logic of programs called the modal mucalculus
