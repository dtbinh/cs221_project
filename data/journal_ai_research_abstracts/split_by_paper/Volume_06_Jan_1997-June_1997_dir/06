an algorithm that learns from a set of examples should    ideally be able to exploit the available resources of a abundant    computing power and b domainspecific knowledge to improve its    ability to generalize  connectionist theoryrefinement systems which    use background knowledge to select a neural networks topology and    initial weights have proven to be effective at exploiting    domainspecific knowledge however most do not exploit available    computing power this weakness occurs because they lack the ability to    refine the topology of the neural networks they produce thereby    limiting generalization especially when given impoverished domain    theories we present the regent algorithm which uses a domainspecific     knowledge to help create an initial population of knowledgebased    neural networks and b genetic operators of crossover and mutation    specifically designed for knowledgebased networks to continually    search for better network topologies experiments on three realworld    domains indicate that our new algorithm is able to significantly    increase generalization compared to a standard connectionist    theoryrefinement system as well as our previous algorithm for    growing knowledgebased networks
