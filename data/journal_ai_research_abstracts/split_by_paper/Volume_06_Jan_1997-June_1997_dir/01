d  r wilson and  t  r martinez 1997 improved heterogeneous distance functions volume 6 pages 134

instancebased learning techniques typically handle    continuous and linear input values well but often do not handle    nominal input attributes appropriately  the value difference metric    vdm was designed to find reasonable distance values between nominal    attribute values but it largely ignores continuous attributes    requiring discretization to map continuous values into nominal values    this paper proposes three new heterogeneous distance functions called    the heterogeneous value difference metric hvdm the interpolated    value difference metric ivdm and the windowed value difference    metric wvdm  these new distance functions are designed to handle    applications with nominal attributes continuous attributes or both    in experiments on 48 applications the new distance metrics achieve    higher classification accuracy on average than three previous distance    functions on those datasets that have both nominal and continuous    attributes
