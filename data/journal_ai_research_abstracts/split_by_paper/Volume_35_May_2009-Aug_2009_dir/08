r  sebastiani and m  vescovi 2009 automated reasoning in modal and description logics via sat encoding the case study of kmalcsatisfiability volume 35 pages 343389

in the last two decades modal and description logics have been applied to numerous areas of computer science including knowledge representation formal verification database theory distributed computing and more recently semantic web and ontologies for this reason the problem of automated reasoning in modal and description logics has been thoroughly investigated in particular many approaches have been proposed for efficiently handling the satisfiability of the core normal modal logic km and of its notational variant the description logic alc although simple in structure kmalc is computationally very hard to reason on its satisfiability being pspacecomplete  

in this paper we start exploring the idea of performing automated reasoning tasks in modal and description logics by encoding them into sat so that to be handled by stateoftheart sat tools as with most previous approaches we begin our investigation from the satisfiability in km we propose an efficient encoding and we test it on an extensive set of benchmarks comparing the approach with the main stateoftheart tools available although the encoding is necessarily worstcase exponential from our experiments we notice that in practice this approach can handle most or all the problems which are at the reach of  the other approaches with performances which are comparable with or even better than those of the current stateoftheart tools
