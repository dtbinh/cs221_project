we develop a technique for deriving datadependent error bounds for transductive learning algorithms based on transductive rademacher complexity our technique is based on a novel general error bound for transduction in terms of transductive rademacher complexity together with a novel bounding technique for rademacher averages for particular algorithms in terms of their unlabeledlabeled representation this technique is relevant to many advanced graphbased transductive algorithms and we demonstrate its effectiveness by deriving error bounds to three well known algorithms finally we present a new pacbayesian bound for mixtures of transductive algorithms based on our rademacher bounds
