we study the complexity of influencing elections through bribery how computationally complex is it for an external actor to determine whether by paying certain voters to change their preferences a specified candidate can be made the elections winner  we study this problem for election systems as varied as scoring protocols and dodgson voting and in a variety of settings regarding homogeneousvsnonhomogeneous electorate bribability boundedsizevsarbitrarysized candidate sets weightedvsunweighted voters and succinctvsnonsuccinct input specification  we obtain both polynomialtime bribery algorithms and proofs of the intractability of bribery and indeed our results show that the complexity of bribery is extremely sensitive to the setting  for example we find settings in which bribery is npcomplete but manipulation by voters is in p and we find settings in which bribing weighted voters is npcomplete but bribing voters with individual bribe thresholds is in p  for the broad class of elections including plurality borda kapproval and veto known as scoring protocols we prove a dichotomy result for bribery of weighted voters we find a simpletoevaluate condition that classifies every case as either npcomplete or in p
