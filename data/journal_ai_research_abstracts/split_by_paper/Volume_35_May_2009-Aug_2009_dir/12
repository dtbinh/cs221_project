a weighted constraint satisfaction problem wcsp is a constraint satisfaction problem in which preferences among solutions can be expressed bucket elimination is a complete technique commonly used to solve this kind of constraint satisfaction problem when the memory required to apply bucket elimination is too high a heuristic method based on it denominated minibuckets can be used to calculate bounds for the optimal solution nevertheless the curse of dimensionality makes these techniques impractical on large scale problems in response to this situation we present a memetic algorithm for wcsps in which bucket elimination is used as a mechanism for recombining solutions providing the best possible child from the parental set subsequently a multilevel model in which this exactmetaheuristic hybrid is further hybridized with branchandbound techniques and minibuckets is studied as a case study we have applied these algorithms to the resolution of the maximum density still life problem a hard constraint optimization problem based on conways game of life the resulting algorithm consistently finds optimal patterns for up to date solved instances in less time than current approaches moreover it is shown that this proposal provides new best known solutions for very large instances
