honorable mention for the 2012 ijcaijair best paper prize

many realworld decision making tasks require us to choose among several expensive observations in a sensor network for example it is important to select the subset of sensors that is expected to provide the strongest reduction in uncertainty in medical decision making tasks one needs to select which tests to administer before deciding on the most effective treatment it has been general practice to use heuristicguided procedures for selecting observations in this paper we present the first efficient optimal algorithms for selecting observations for a class of probabilistic graphical models for example our algorithms allow to optimally label hidden variables in hidden markov models hmms we provide results for both selecting the optimal subset of observations and for obtaining an optimal conditional observation plan

in addition we consider several extensions such as using our algorithms for scheduling observation selection for multiple sensors we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several realworld datasets including a prototype sensor network deployment for energy conservation in buildings
