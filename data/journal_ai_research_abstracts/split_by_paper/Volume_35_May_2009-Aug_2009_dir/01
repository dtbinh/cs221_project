complex questions that require inferencing and synthesizing information from multiple documents can be seen as a kind of topicoriented informative multidocument summarization where the goal is to produce a single text as a compressed version of a set of documents with a minimum loss of relevant information in this paper we experiment with one empirical method and two unsupervised statistical machine learning techniques kmeans and expectation maximization em for computing relative importance of the sentences we compare the results of these approaches our experiments show that the empirical approach outperforms the other two techniques and em performs better than kmeans however the performance of these approaches depends entirely on the feature set used and the weighting of these features in order to measure the importance and relevance to the user query we extract different kinds of features ie lexical lexical semantic cosine similarity basic element tree kernel based syntactic and shallowsemantic for each of the document sentences we use a local search technique to learn the weights of the features to the best of our knowledge no study has used tree kernel functions to encode syntacticsemantic information for more complex tasks such as computing the relatedness between the query sentences and the document sentences in order to generate queryfocused summaries or answers to complex questions for each of our methods of generating summaries ie empirical kmeans and em we show the effects of syntactic and shallowsemantic features over the bagofwords bow features
