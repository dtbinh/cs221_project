r  daly and q  shen 2009 learning bayesian network equivalence classes with ant colony optimization volume 35 pages 391447

bayesian networks are a useful tool in the representation of uncertain knowledge this paper proposes a new algorithm called acoe to learn the structure of a bayesian network it does this by conducting a search through the space of equivalence classes of bayesian networks using ant colony optimization aco to this end two novel extensions of traditional aco techniques are proposed and implemented firstly multiple types of moves are allowed secondly moves can be given in terms of indices that are not based on construction graph nodes the results of testing show that acoe performs better than a greedy search and other stateoftheart and metaheuristic algorithms whilst searching in the space of equivalence classes
