v  conitzer 2009 eliciting singlepeaked preferences using comparison queries volume 35 pages 161191

voting is a general method for aggregating the preferences of multiple agents  each agent ranks all the possible alternatives and based on this an aggregate ranking of the alternatives or at least a winning alternative is produced  however when there are many alternatives it is impractical to simply ask agents to report their complete preferences rather the agents preferences or at least the relevant parts thereof need to be elicited  this is done by asking the agents a hopefully small number of simple queries about their preferences such as comparison queries which ask an agent to compare two of the alternatives  prior work on preference elicitation in voting has focused on the case of unrestricted preferences  it has been shown that in this setting it is sometimes necessary to ask each agent almost as many queries as would be required to determine an arbitrary ranking of the alternatives  in contrast in this paper we focus on singlepeaked preferences  we show that such preferences can be elicited using only a linear number of comparison queries if either the order with respect to which preferences are singlepeaked is known or at least one other agents complete preferences are known  we show that using a sublinear number of queries does not suffice  we also consider the case of cardinally singlepeaked preferences  for this case we show that if the alternatives cardinal positions are known then an agents preferences can be elicited using only a logarithmic number of queries however we also show that if the cardinal positions are not known then a sublinear number of queries does not suffice  we present experimental results for all elicitation algorithms  we also consider the problem of only eliciting enough information to determine the aggregate ranking and show that even for this more modest objective a sublinear number of queries per agent does not suffice for known ordinal or unknown cardinal positions  finally we discuss whether and how these techniques can be applied when preferences are almost singlepeaked
