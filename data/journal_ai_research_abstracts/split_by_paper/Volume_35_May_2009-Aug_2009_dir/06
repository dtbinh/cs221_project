m  petrik and s  zilberstein 2009 a bilinear programming approach for multiagent planning volume 35 pages 235274

multiagent planning and coordination problems are common and known to be computationally hard  we show that a wide range of twoagent problems can be formulated as bilinear programs  we present a successive approximation algorithm that significantly outperforms the coverage set algorithm which is the stateoftheart method for this class of multiagent problems because the algorithm is formulated for bilinear programs it is more general and simpler to implement the new algorithm can be terminated at any time andunlike the coverage set algorithmit facilitates the derivation of a useful online performance bound it is also much more efficient on average reducing the computation time of the optimal solution by about four orders of magnitude  finally we introduce an automatic dimensionality reduction method that improves the effectiveness of the algorithm extending its applicability to new domains and providing a new way to analyze a subclass of bilinear programs
