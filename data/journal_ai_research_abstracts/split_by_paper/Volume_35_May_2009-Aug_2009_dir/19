as fragments of firstorder logic description logics dls do not provide nonmonotonic features such as defeasible inheritance and default rules since many applications would benefit from the availability of such features several families of nonmonotonic dls have been developed that are mostly based on default logic and autoepistemic logic in this paper we consider circumscription as an interesting alternative approach to nonmonotonic dls that in particular supports defeasible inheritance in a natural way we study dls extended with circumscription under different language restrictions and under different constraints on the sets of minimized fixed and varying predicates and pinpoint the exact computational complexity of reasoning for dls ranging from alc to alcio and alcqo  when the minimized and fixed predicates include only concept names but no role names then reasoning is complete for nexptimenp  it becomes complete for npnexptime when the number of minimized and fixed predicates is bounded by a constant  if roles can be minimized or fixed then complexity ranges from nexptimenp to undecidability
