k  su a  sattar g  lv and y  zhang 2009 variable forgetting in reasoning about knowledge volume 35 pages 677716

in this paper we investigate knowledge reasoning within a simple framework called knowledge structure we use variable forgetting as a basic operation for one agent to reason about its own or other agents knowledge in our framework two notions namely agents observable variables and the weakest sufficient condition play important roles in knowledge reasoning given a background knowledge base and a set of observable variables for each agent we show that the notion of an agent knowing a formula can be defined as a weakest sufficient condition of the formula under background knowledge base moreover we show how to capture the notion of common knowledge by using a generalized notion of weakest sufficient condition also we show that public announcement operator can be conveniently dealt with via our notion of knowledge structure further we explore the computational complexity of the problem whether an epistemic formula is realized in a knowledge structure in the general case this problem is pspacehard however for some interesting subcases it can be reduced to conp finally we discuss possible applications of our framework in some interesting domains such as the automated analysis of the wellknown muddy children puzzle and the verification of the revised needhamschroeder protocol we believe that there are many scenarios where the natural presentation of the available information about knowledge is under the form of a knowledge structure what makes it valuable compared with the corresponding multiagent s5 kripke structure is that it can be much more succinct
