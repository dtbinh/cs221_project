vickreyclarkegroves vcg mechanisms are often used to allocate tasks to selfish and rational agents vcg mechanisms are  incentive compatible direct mechanisms that are efficient ie maximise social utility and individually rational ie agents prefer to join rather than opt out however an important assumption of these mechanisms is that the agents will always successfully complete their allocated tasks clearly this assumption is unrealistic in many realworld applications where agents can and  often do fail in their endeavours moreover whether an agent is deemed to have failed may be perceived differently by different agents such subjective perceptions about an agents probability of succeeding at a given task are often captured and reasoned about using the notion of trust given this background in this paper we investigate the design of novel mechanisms that take into account the  trust between agents when allocating tasks
