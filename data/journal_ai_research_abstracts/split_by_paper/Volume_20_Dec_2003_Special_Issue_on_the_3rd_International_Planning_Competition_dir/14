vhpop is a partial order causal link pocl planner loosely based on ucpop  it draws from the experience gained in the early to mid 1990s on flaw selection strategies for pocl planning and combines this with more recent developments in the field of domain independent planning such as distance based heuristics and reachability analysis  we present an adaptation of the additive heuristic for plan space planning and modify it to account for possible reuse of existing actions in a plan  we also propose a large set of novel flaw selection strategies and show how these can help us solve more problems than previously possible by pocl planners  vhpop also supports planning with durative actions by incorporating standard techniques for temporal constraint reasoning  we demonstrate that the same heuristic techniques used to boost the performance of classical pocl planning can be effective in domains with durative actions as well  the result is a versatile heuristic pocl planner competitive with established cspbased and heuristic state space planners
