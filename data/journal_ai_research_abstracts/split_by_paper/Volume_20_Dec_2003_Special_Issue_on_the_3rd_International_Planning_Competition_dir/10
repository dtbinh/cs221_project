we present some techniques for planning in domains specified with the recent standard language pddl21 supporting durative actions and numerical quantities these techniques are implemented in lpg a domainindependent planner that took part in the 3rd international planning competition ipc lpg is an incremental any time system  producing multicriteria quality plans the core of the system is  based on a stochastic local search method and on a graphbased  representation called temporal action graphs tagraphs   this paper focuses on temporal planning introducing tagraphs and proposing some techniques to guide the search in lpg using this representation the experimental results of the 3rd ipc as well as further results presented in this paper show that our techniques  can be very effective often lpg outperforms all other fullyautomated  planners of the 3rd ipc in terms of speed to derive a solution or  quality of the solutions that can be produced
