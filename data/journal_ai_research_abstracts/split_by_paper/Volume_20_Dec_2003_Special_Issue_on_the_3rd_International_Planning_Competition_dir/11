j  hoffmann 2003 the metricff planning system translating ignoring delete lists to numeric state variables volume 20 pages 291341

planning with numeric state variables has been a challenge for many years and was a part of the 3rd international planning competition ipc3 currently one of the most popular and successful algorithmic techniques in strips planning is to guide search by a heuristic function where the heuristic is based on relaxing the planning task by ignoring the delete lists of the available actions     we present a natural extension of ignoring delete lists to numeric state variables preserving the relevant theoretical properties of the strips relaxation under the condition that the numeric task at hand is monotonic we then identify a subset of the numeric ipc3 competition language linear tasks where monotonicity can be achieved by preprocessing based on that we extend the algorithms used in the heuristic planning system ff to linear tasks the resulting system metricff is according to the ipc3 results which we discuss one of the two currently most efficient numeric planners
