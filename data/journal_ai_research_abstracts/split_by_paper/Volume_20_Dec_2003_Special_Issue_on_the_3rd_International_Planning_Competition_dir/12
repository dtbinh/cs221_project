talplanner is a forwardchaining planner that relies on domain knowledge in the shape of temporal logic formulas in order to prune irrelevant parts of the search space talplanner recently participated in the third international planning competition which had a clear emphasis on increasing the complexity of the problem domains being used as benchmark tests and the expressivity required to represent these domains in a planning system  like many other planners talplanner had support for some but not all aspects of this increase in expressivity and a number of changes to the planner were required after a short introduction to talplanner this article describes some of the changes that were made before and during the competition  we also describe the process of introducing suitable domain knowledge for several of the competition domains
