sapa is a domainindependent heuristic forward chaining planner  that can handle durative actions metric resource constraints  and deadline goals it is designed to be capable of handling the  multiobjective nature of metric temporal planning  our technical  contributions include i planninggraph based methods for deriving  heuristics that are sensitive to both cost and makespan ii  techniques for adjusting the heuristic estimates to take action  interactions and metric resource limitations into account and  iii a linear time greedy postprocessing technique to improve  execution flexibility of the solution plans an implementation of sapa using many of the techniques presented in this paper was one of the best domain independent planners for domains with metric and temporal constraints in the third international planning competition held at aips02 we describe the technical details of extracting the heuristics and present an empirical evaluation of the current implementation of sapa
