francesco  parisi and john  grant 2016 knowledge representation in probabilistic spatiotemporal knowledge bases volume 55 pages 743798



we represent knowledge as integrity constraints in a formalization of probabilistic spatiotemporal knowledge bases we start by defining the syntax and semantics of a formalization called pst knowledge bases  this definition generalizes an earlier version called spot which is a declarative framework for the representation and processing of probabilistic spatiotemporal data where probability is represented as an interval because the exact value is unknown we augment the previous definition by adding a type of nonatomic formula that expresses integrity constraints the result is a highly expressive formalism for knowledge representation dealing with probabilistic spatiotemporal data  we obtain complexity results both for checking the consistency of pst knowledge bases and for answering queries in pst knowledge bases and also specify tractable cases  all the domains in the pst framework are finite but we extend our results also to arbitrarily large finite domains



we study a general framework for query rewriting in the presence of an arbitrary firstorder logic ontology over a database signature the framework supports deciding the existence of a saferange firstorder equivalent reformulation of a query in terms of the database signature and if so it provides an effective approach to construct the reformulation based on interpolation using standard theorem proving techniques eg tableau since the reformulation is a saferange formula it is effectively executable as an sql query at the end we present a nontrivial application of the framework with ontologies in the very expressive alchoiq description logic by providing effective means to compute saferange firstorder exact reformulations of queries









t  janhunen e  oikarinen h  tompits and s  woltran 2009 modularity aspects of disjunctive stable models volume 35 pages 813857



practically all programming languages allow the programmer to split a program into several modules which brings along several advantages in software development in this paper we are interested in the area of answerset programming where fully declarative and nonmonotonic languages are applied in this context obtaining a modular structure for programs is by no means straightforward since the output of an entire program cannot in general be composed from the output of its components to better understand the effects of disjunctive information on modularity we restrict the scope of analysis to the case of disjunctive logic programs dlps subject to stablemodel semantics we define the notion of a dlpfunction where a welldefined inputoutput interface is provided and establish a novel module theorem which indicates the compositionality of stablemodel semantics for dlpfunctions the module theorem extends the wellknown splittingset theorem and enables the decomposition of dlpfunctions given their strongly connected components based on positive dependencies induced by rules in this setting it is also possible to split shared disjunctive rules among components using a generalized shifting technique the concept of modular equivalence is introduced for the mutual comparison of dlpfunctions using a generalization of a translationbased verification method

d  bergman a  a cire and w  van hoeve 2014 mdd propagation for sequence constraints volume 50 pages 697722



we study propagation for the sequence constraint in the context of constraint programming based on limitedwidth mdds our first contribution is proving that establishing mddconsistency for sequence is nphard yet we also show that this task is fixed parameter tractable with respect to the length of the subsequences in addition we propose a partial filtering algorithm that relies on a specific decomposition of the constraint and a novel extension of mdd filtering to node domains we experimentally evaluate the performance of our proposed filtering algorithm and demonstrate that the strength of the mdd propagation increases as the maximum width is increased in particular mdd propagation can outperform conventional domain propagation for sequence by reducing the search tree size and solving time by several orders of magnitude similar improvements are observed with respect to the current best mdd approach that applies the decomposition of sequence into among constraints



this  paper defines the notion of analogical dissimilarity between four objects with a special focus on objects structured as sequences firstly it studies the case where the four objects have a null analogical dissimilarity ie are in analogical proportion secondly when one of these objects is unknown it gives algorithms to compute it thirdly it tackles the problem of defining  analogical dissimilarity which is a measure of how far four objects are from being in analogical proportion in particular when objects are sequences it gives a definition and an algorithm based on an optimal alignment of the four sequences it gives also learning algorithms ie methods to find the  triple of objects in a learning sample which has the least analogical dissimilarity with a given object two practical experiments are described the first is a classification problem on benchmarks of binary and nominal data the second shows how the generation of sequences by solving analogical equations enables a handwritten character recognition system to rapidly be adapted to a new writer
