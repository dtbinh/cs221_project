c  domshlak and j  hoffmann 2007 probabilistic planning via heuristic forward search and weighted model counting volume 30 pages 565620

we present a new algorithm for probabilistic planning with no observability  our algorithm called  probabilisticff extends the heuristic forwardsearch machinery of conformantff to problems with probabilistic uncertainty about both the initial state and action effects specifically  probabilisticff combines conformantffs techniques with a powerful machinery for weighted model counting in weighted cnfs serving to elegantly define both the search space and the heuristic function our evaluation of  probabilisticff shows its fine scalability in a range of probabilistic domains constituting a several orders of magnitude improvement over previous results in this area we use a problematic case to point out the main open issue to be addressed by further research
