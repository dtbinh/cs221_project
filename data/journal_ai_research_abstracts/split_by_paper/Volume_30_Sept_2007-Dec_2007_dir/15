s  i hill and a  doucet 2007 a framework for kernelbased multicategory classification volume 30 pages 525564

a geometric framework for understanding multicategory classification is introduced through which many existing alltogether algorithms can be understood  the structure enables parsimonious optimisation through a direct extension of the binary methodology  the focus is on support vector classification with parallels drawn to related methods

it is also described how this architecture provides insights regarding how to further improve on the speed of existing multicategory classification algorithms  an initial example of how this might be achieved is developed in the formulation of a straightforward multicategory sequential minimal optimisation algorithm  proofofconcept experimental results have shown that this combined with the mapping of pairwise results is comparable with benchmark optimisation speeds
