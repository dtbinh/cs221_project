exact maxsat solvers compared with sat solvers apply little inference at each node of the proof tree commonly used sat inference rules like unit propagation produce a simplified formula that preserves satisfiability but unfortunately solving the maxsat problem for the simplified formula is not equivalent to solving it for the original formula in this paper we define a number of original inference rules that besides being applied efficiently transform maxsat instances into equivalent maxsat instances which are easier to solve the soundness of the rules that can be seen as refinements of unit resolution adapted to maxsat are proved in a novel and simple way via an integer programming transformation with the aim of finding out how powerful the inference rules are in practice we have developed a new maxsat solver called maxsatz which incorporates those rules and performed  an experimental investigation the results provide empirical evidence that maxsatz is very competitive at least on random max2sat random max3sat maxcut and graph 3coloring instances as well as on the benchmarks from the maxsat evaluation 2006
