s  greco i  trubitsyna and e  zumpano 2007 on the semantics of logic programs with preferences volume 30 pages 501523

this work is a contribution to prioritized reasoning in logic programming in the presence of preference relations involving atoms the  technique providing a new interpretation for prioritized logic programs is inspired by the semantics of prioritized logic programming and enriched with the use of structural information of preference of answer set optimization programming specifically the analysis  of the logic program is carried out together with the analysis of preferences in order to determine the choice order and the sets of comparable models the new semantics is compared with other approaches known in the literature and complexity analysis is also performed showing that with respect to other similar approaches previously proposed the complexity of computing preferred stable models does not increase
