a pattern database pdb is a heuristic function implemented as a lookup table that stores the lengths of optimal solutions for subproblem instances standard pdbs have a distinct entry in the table for each subproblem instance in this paper we investigate compressing pdbs by merging several entries into one thereby allowing the use of pdbs that exceed available memory in their uncompressed form we introduce a number of methods for determining which entries to merge and discuss their relative merits these vary from domainindependent approaches that allow any set of entries in the pdb to be merged to more intelligent methods that take into account the structure of the problem the choice of the best compression method is based on domaindependent attributes we present experimental results on a number of combinatorial problems including the fourpeg towers of hanoi problem the slidingtile puzzles and the topspin puzzle for the towers of hanoi we show that the search time can be reduced by up to three orders of magnitude by using compressed pdbs compared to uncompressed pdbs of the same size more modest improvements were observed for the other domains
