entity resolution is the problem of reconciling database references corresponding to the same realworld entities given the abundance of publicly available databases that have unresolved entities we motivate the problem of querytime entity resolution quick and accurate resolution for answering queries over such unclean databases at querytime  since collective entity resolution approaches  where related references are resolved jointly  have been shown to be more accurate than independent attributebased resolution for offline entity resolution we focus on developing new algorithms for collective resolution for answering entity resolution queries at querytime  for this purpose we first formally show that for collective resolution precision and recall for individual entities follow a geometric progression as neighbors at increasing distances are considered unfolding this progression leads naturally to a two stage expand and resolve query processing strategy in this strategy we first extract the related records for a query using two novel expansion operators and then resolve the extracted records collectively we then show how the same strategy can be adapted for querytime entity resolution by identifying and resolving only those database references that are the most helpful for processing the query we validate our approach on two large realworld publication databases where we show the usefulness of collective resolution and at the same time demonstrate the need for adaptive strategies for query processing we then show how the same queries can be answered in realtime using our adaptive approach while preserving the gains of collective resolution in addition to experiments on real datasets we use synthetically generated data to empirically demonstrate the validity of the performance trends predicted by our analysis of collective entity resolution over a wide range of structural characteristics in the data
