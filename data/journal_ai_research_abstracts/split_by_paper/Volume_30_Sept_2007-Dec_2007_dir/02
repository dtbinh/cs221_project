realtime heuristic search methods are used by situated agents in applications that require the amount of planning per move to be independent of the problem size such agents plan only a few actions at a time in a local search space and avoid getting trapped in local minima by improving their heuristic function over time we extend a wide class of realtime search algorithms with automaticallybuilt state abstraction and prove completeness and convergence of the resulting family of algorithms we then analyze the impact of abstraction in an extensive empirical study in realtime pathfinding abstraction is found to improve efficiency by providing better trading offs between planning time learning speed and other negatively correlated performance measures
