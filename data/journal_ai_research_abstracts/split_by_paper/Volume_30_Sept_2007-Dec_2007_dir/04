in this paper we present and evaluate a general framework for the design of truthful auctions for matching agents in a dynamic twosided market a single commodity such as a resource or a task is bought and sold by multiple buyers and sellers that arrive and depart over time our algorithm chain provides the first framework that allows a truthful dynamic double auction da to be constructed from a truthful singleperiod  ie static doubleauction rule the pricing and matching method of the chain construction is unique amongst dynamicauction rules that adopt the same building block  we examine experimentally the allocative efficiency of chain when instantiated on various singleperiod rules including the canonical mcafee doubleauction rule for a baseline we also consider nontruthful double auctions populated with zerointelligence plusstyle learning agents chainbased auctions perform well in comparison with other schemes especially as arrival intensity falls and agent valuations become more volatile
