f  mairesse m  a walker m  r mehl and r  k moore 2007 using linguistic cues for the automatic recognition of personality in conversation and text volume 30 pages 457500

it is well known that utterances convey a great deal of information about the speaker in addition to their semantic content  one such type of information consists of cues to the speakers personality traits the most fundamental dimension of variation between humans  recent work explores the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic variation in text and conversation such as emotion deception speaker charisma dominance point of view subjectivity opinion and sentiment personality affects these other aspects of linguistic production and thus personality recognition may be useful for these tasks in addition to many other potential applications  however to date there is little work on the automatic recognition of personality traits  this article reports experimental results for recognition of all big five personality traits in both conversation and text utilising both self and observer ratings of personality  while other work reports classification results we experiment with classification regression and ranking models for each model we analyse the effect of different feature sets on accuracy results show that for some traits any type of statistical model performs significantly better than the baseline but ranking models perform best overall we also present an experiment suggesting that ranking models are more accurate than multiclass classifiers for modelling personality in addition recognition models trained on observed personality perform better than models trained using selfreports and the optimal feature set depends on the personality trait a qualitative analysis of the learned models confirms previous findings linking language and personality while revealing many new linguistic markers
