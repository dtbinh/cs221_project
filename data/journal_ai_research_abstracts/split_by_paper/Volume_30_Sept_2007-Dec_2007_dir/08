a  mccallum x  wang and a  corradaemmanuel 2007 topic and role discovery in social networks with experiments on enron and academic email volume 30 pages 249272

previous work in social network analysis sna has modeled the existence of links from one entity to another but not the attributes such as language content or topics on those links we present the authorrecipienttopic art model for social network analysis which learns topic distributions based on the directionsensitive messages sent between entities the model builds on latent dirichlet allocation lda and the authortopic at model adding the key attribute that distribution over topics is conditioned distinctly on both the sender and recipientsteering the discovery of topics according to the relationships between people we give results on both the enron email corpus and a researchers email archive providing evidence not only that clearly relevant topics are discovered but that the art model better predicts peoples roles and gives lower perplexity on previously unseen messages we also present the roleauthorrecipienttopic rart model an extension to art that explicitly represents peoples roles
