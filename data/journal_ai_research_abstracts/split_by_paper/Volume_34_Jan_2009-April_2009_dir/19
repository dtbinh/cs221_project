o  gim233nez and a  jonsson 2009 planning over chain causal graphs for variables with domains of size 5 is nphard volume 34 pages 675706

recently considerable focus has been given to the problem of determining the boundary between tractable and intractable planning problems in this paper we study the complexity of planning in the class cn of planning problems characterized by unary operators and directed path causal graphs although this is one of the simplest forms of causal graphs a planning problem can have we show that planning is intractable for cn unless p  np even if the domains of state variables have bounded size in particular we show that plan existence for cnk is nphard for k5 by reduction from cnfsat here k denotes the upper bound on the size of the state variable domains our result reduces the complexity gap for the class cnk to cases k3 and k4 only since cn2 is known to be tractable
