t  a cohn and m  lapata 2009 sentence compression as tree transduction volume 34 pages 637674

this paper presents a treetotree transduction method for sentence compression our model is based on synchronous tree substitution grammar a formalism that allows local distortion of the tree topology and can thus naturally capture structural mismatches we describe an algorithm for decoding in this framework and show how the model can be trained discriminatively within a large margin framework  experimental results on sentence compression bring significant improvements over a stateoftheart model
