inference in bayes nets bayes is an important problem with numerous applications in probabilistic reasoning counting the number of satisfying assignments of a propositional formula sat is a closely related problem of fundamental theoretical importance both these problems and others are members of the class of sumofproducts sumprod problems in this paper we show that standard backtracking search when augmented with a simple memoization scheme caching can solve any sumofproducts problem with time complexity that is at least as good any other stateoftheart exact algorithm and that it can also achieve the best known timespace tradeoff furthermore backtrackings ability to utilize more flexible variable orderings allows us to prove that it can achieve an exponential speedup over other standard algorithms for sumprod on some instances

the ideas presented here have been utilized in a number of solvers that have been applied to various types of sumofproduct problems these systems have exploited the fact that backtracking can naturally exploit more of the problems structure to achieve improved performance on a range of probleminstances empirical evidence of this performance gain has appeared in published works describing these solvers and we provide references to these works
