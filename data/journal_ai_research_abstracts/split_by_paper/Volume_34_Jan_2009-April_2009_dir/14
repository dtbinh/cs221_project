v  ruiz de angulo and c  torras 2009 exploiting singlecycle symmetries in continuous constraint problems volume 34 pages 499520

symmetries in discrete constraint satisfaction problems have been explored and exploited in the last years but symmetries in continuous constraint problems have not received the same attention here we focus on permutations of the variables consisting of one single cycle we propose a procedure that takes advantage of these symmetries by interacting with a continuous constraint solver without interfering with it a key concept in this procedure are the classes of symmetric boxes formed by bisecting a ndimensional cube at the same point in all dimensions at the same time we analyze these classes and quantify them as a function of the cube dimensionality moreover we propose a simple algorithm to generate the representatives of all these classes for any number of variables at very high rates a problem example from the chemical 64257eld and the cyclic nroots problem are used to show the performance of the approach in practice
