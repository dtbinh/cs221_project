the need for efficient monitoring of spatiotemporal dynamics in large environmental applications such as the water quality monitoring in rivers and lakes motivates the use of robotic sensors in order to achieve sufficient spatial coverage typically these robots have bounded resources such as limited battery or limited amounts of time to obtain measurements thus careful coordination of their paths is required in order to maximize the amount of information collected while respecting the resource constraints in this paper we present an efficient approach for nearoptimally solving the nphard optimization problem of planning such informative paths in particular we first develop esip efficient singlerobot informative path planning an approximation algorithm for optimizing the path of a single robot hereby we use a gaussian process to model the underlying phenomenon and use the mutual information between the visited locations and remainder of the space to quantify the amount of information collected we prove that the mutual information collected using paths obtained by using esip is close to the information obtained by an optimal solution we then provide a general technique sequential allocation which can be used to extend any single robot planning algorithm such as esip for the multirobot problem this procedure approximately generalizes any guarantees for the singlerobot problem to the multirobot case we extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on several experiments performed infield for two important environmental sensing applications lake and river monitoring and simulation experiments performed using several real world sensor network data sets
