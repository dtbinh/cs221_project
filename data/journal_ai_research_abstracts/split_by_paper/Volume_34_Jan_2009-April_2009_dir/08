the task of identifying synonymous relations and objects or synonym resolution is critical for highquality information extraction this paper investigates synonym resolution in the context of unsupervised information extraction where neither handtagged training examples nor domain knowledge is available the paper presents a scalable fullyimplemented system that runs in okn log n time in the number of extractions n and the maximum number of synonyms per word k the system called resolver  introduces a probabilistic relational model for predicting whether two strings are coreferential based on the similarity of the assertions containing them on a set of two million assertions extracted from the web resolver resolves objects with 78 precision and 68 recall and resolves relations with 90 precision and 35 recall several variations of resolvers probabilistic model are explored and experiments demonstrate that under appropriate conditions these variations can improve f1 by 5 an extension to the basic resolver system allows it to handle polysemous names with 97 precision and 95 recall on a data set from the trec corpus
