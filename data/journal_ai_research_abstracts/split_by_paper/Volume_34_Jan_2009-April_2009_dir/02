we consider the problem of optimal planning in stochastic domains with resource constraints where the resources are continuous and the choice of action at each step depends on resource availability  we introduce the hao algorithm a generalization of the ao algorithm that performs search in a hybrid state space that is modeled using both discrete and continuous state variables where the continuous variables represent monotonic resources  like other heuristic search algorithms hao leverages knowledge of the start state and an admissible heuristic to focus computational effort on those parts of the state space that could be reached from the start state by following an optimal policy  we show that this approach is especially effective when resource constraints limit how much of the state space is reachable  experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in the domain that motivates our research automated planning for planetary exploration rovers
