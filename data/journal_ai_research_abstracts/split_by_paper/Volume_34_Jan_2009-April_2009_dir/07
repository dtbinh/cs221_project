r  jurca and b  faltings 2009 mechanisms for making crowds truthful volume 34 pages 209253

we consider schemes for obtaining truthful reports on a common but hidden signal from large groups of rational selfinterested agents one example are online feedback mechanisms where users provide observations about the quality of a product or service so that other users can have an accurate idea of what quality they can expect however i providing such feedback is costly and ii there are many motivations for providing incorrect feedback

in this paper we extend existing methods for designing incentivecompatible rewards by also considering collusion we analyze different scenarios where for example some or all of the agents collude for each scenario we investigate whether a collusionresistant incentivecompatible reward scheme exists and use automated mechanism design to specify an algorithm for deriving an efficient reward mechanism
