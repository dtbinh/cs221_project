s  a wallace 2009 behavior bounding an efficient method for highlevel behavior comparison volume 34 pages 165208

in this paper we explore methods for comparing agent behavior with human behavior to assist with validation our exploration begins by considering a simple method of behavior comparison motivated by shortcomings in this initial approach we introduce behavior bounding an automated modelbased approach for comparing behavior that is inspired in part by mitchells version spaces we show that behavior bounding can be used to compactly represent both human and agent behavior we argue that relatively low amounts of human e64256ort are required to build maintain and use the data structures that underlie behavior bounding and we provide a theoretical basis for these arguments using notions of pac learnability next we show empirical results indicating that this approach is e64256ective at identifying differences in certain types of behaviors and that it performs well when compared against our initial benchmark methods finally we demonstrate that behavior bounding can produce information that allows developers to identify and 64257x problems in an agents behavior much more e64259ciently than standard debugging techniques
