lifted probabilistic inference algorithms exploit regularities in the structure of graphical models to perform inference more efficiently more specifically they identify groups of interchangeable variables and perform inference once per group as opposed to once per variable the groups are defined by means of constraints so the flexibility of the grouping is determined by the expressivity of the constraint language existing approaches for exact lifted inference use specific languages for inequality constraints which often have limited expressivity in this article we decouple lifted inference from the constraint language we define operators for lifted inference in terms of relational algebra operators so that they operate on the semantic level the constraints extension rather than on the syntactic level making them languageindependent as a result lifted inference can be performed using more powerful constraint languages which provide more opportunities for lifting we empirically demonstrate that this can improve inference efficiency by orders of magnitude allowing exact inference where until now only approximate inference was feasible
