the causal graph of a planning instance is an important tool for planning both in practice and in theory the theoretical studies of causal graphs have largely analysed the computational complexity of planning for instances where the causal graph has a certain structure often in combination with other parameters like the domain size of the variables chen and gim233nez ignored even the structure and considered only the size of the weakly connected components they proved that planning is tractable if the components are bounded by a constant and otherwise intractable their intractability result was however conditioned by an assumption from parameterised complexity theory that has no known useful relationship with the standard complexity classes we approach the same problem from the perspective of standard complexity classes and prove that planning is nphard for classes with unbounded components under an additional restriction we refer to as spclosed we then argue that most nphardness theorems for causal graphs are difficult to apply and thus prove a more general result even if the component sizes grow slowly and the class is not densely populated with graphs planning still cannot be tractable unless the polynomial hierachy collapses both these results still hold when restricted to the class of acyclic causal graphs we finally give a partial characterization of the borderline between nphard and npintermediate classes giving further insight into the problem
