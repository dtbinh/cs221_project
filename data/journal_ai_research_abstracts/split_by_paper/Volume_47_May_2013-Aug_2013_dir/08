we consider how selfish agents are likely to share revenues derived from maintaining connectivity between important network servers we model a network where a failure of one node may disrupt communication between other nodes as a cooperative game called the vertex connectivity game cg in this game each agent owns a vertex and controls all the edges going to and from that vertex a coalition of agents wins if it fully connects a certain subset of vertices in the graph called the primary vertices

we also investigate finding stable payoff divisions of the revenues in cgs captured by the game theoretic solution of the core and its relaxations the epsiloncore and least core we show a polynomial algorithm for computing the core of a cg but show that testing whether an imputation is in the epsiloncore is conpcomplete finally we show that for trees it is possible to test for epsiloncore imputations in polynomial time
