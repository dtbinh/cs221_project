t  leaute and b  faltings 2013 protecting privacy through distributed computation in multiagent decision making volume 47 pages 649695

as largescale theft of data from corporate servers is becoming increasingly common it becomes interesting to examine alternatives to the paradigm of centralizing sensitive data into large databases instead one could use cryptography and distributed computation so that sensitive data can be supplied and processed in encrypted form and only the final result is made known in this paper we examine how such a paradigm can be used to implement constraint satisfaction a technique that can solve a broad class of ai problems such as resource allocation planning scheduling and diagnosis most previous work on privacy in constraint satisfaction only attempted to protect specific types of information in particular the feasibility of particular combinations of decisions we formalize and extend these restricted notions of privacy by introducing four types of private information including the feasibility of decisions and the final decisions made but also the identities of the participants and the topology of the problem we present distributed algorithms that allow computing solutions to constraint satisfaction problems while maintaining these four types of privacy we formally prove the privacy properties of these algorithms and show experiments that compare their respective performance on benchmark problems
