l  cigler and b  faltings 2013 decentralized anticoordination through multiagent learning volume 47 pages 441473

to achieve an optimal outcome in many situations agents need to choose distinct actions from one another this is the case notably in many resource allocation problems where a single resource can only be used by one agent at a time how shall a designer of a multiagent system program its identical agents to behave each in a different way

we present a multiagent learning algorithm that converges in polynomial number of steps to a correlated equilibrium of a channel allocation game a variant of the resource allocation game we show that the agents learn to play for each coordination signal value a randomly chosen purestrategy nash equilibrium of the game therefore the outcome is an efficient correlated equilibrium this ce becomes more fair as the number of the available coordination signal values increases
