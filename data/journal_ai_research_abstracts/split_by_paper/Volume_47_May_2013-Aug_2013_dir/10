we introduce the framework of qualitative optimization problems or simply optimization problems to represent preference theories the formalism uses separate modules to describe the space of outcomes to be compared the generator and the preferences on outcomes the selector we consider two types of optimization problems they differ in the way the generator which we model by a propositional theory is interpreted by the standard propositional logic semantics and by the equilibriummodel answerset semantics under the latter interpretation of generators optimization problems directly generalize answerset optimization programs proposed previously we study strong equivalence of optimization problems which guarantees their interchangeability within any larger context we characterize several versions of strong equivalence obtained by restricting the class of optimization problems that can be used as extensions and establish the complexity of associated reasoning tasks understanding strong equivalence is essential for modular representation of optimization problems and rewriting techniques to simplify them without changing their inherent properties
