s  vesic 2013 identifying the class of maxiconsistent operators in argumentation volume 47 pages 7193

dungs abstract argumentation theory can be seen as a general framework for nonmonotonic reasoning an important question is then what is the class of logics that can be subsumed as instantiations of this theory the goal of this paper is to identify and study the large class of logicbased instantiations of dungs theory which correspond to the maxiconsistent operator ie to the function which returns maximal consistent subsets of an inconsistent knowledge base in other words we study the class of instantiations where very extension of the argumentation system corresponds to exactly one maximal consistent subset of the knowledge base we show that an attack relation belonging to this class must be conflictdependent must not be valid must not be conflictcomplete must not be symmetric etc then we show that some attack relations serve as lower or upper bounds of the class eg if an attack relation contains canonical undercut then it is not a member of this class by using our results we show for all existing attack relations whether or not they belong to this class we also define new attack relations which are members of this class finally we interpret our results and discuss more general questions like what is the added value of argumentation in such a setting we believe that this work is a first step towards achieving our longterm goal which is to better understand the role of argumentation and particularly the expressivity of logicbased instantiations of dungstyle argumentation frameworks
