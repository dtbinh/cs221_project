in this article we introduce the arcade learning environment ale both a challenge problem and a platform and methodology for evaluating the development of general domainindependent ai technology  ale provides an interface to hundreds of atari 2600 game environments each one different interesting and designed to be a challenge for human players  ale presents significant research challenges for reinforcement learning model learning modelbased planning imitation learning transfer learning and intrinsic motivation  most importantly it provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating and comparing approaches to these problems  we illustrate the promise of ale by developing and benchmarking domainindependent agents designed using wellestablished ai techniques for both reinforcement learning and planning  in doing so we also propose an evaluation methodology made possible by ale reporting empirical results on over 55 different games  all of the software including the benchmark agents is publicly available
