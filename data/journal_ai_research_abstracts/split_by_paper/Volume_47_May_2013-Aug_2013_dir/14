s  joty g  carenini and r  t ng 2013 topic segmentation and labeling in asynchronous conversations volume 47 pages 521573

topic segmentation and labeling is often considered a prerequisite for higherlevel conversation analysis and has been shown to be useful in many natural language processing nlp applications we present two new corpora of email and blog conversations annotated with topics and evaluate annotator reliability for the segmentation and labeling tasks in these asynchronous conversations we propose a complete computational framework for topic segmentation and labeling in asynchronous conversations our approach extends stateoftheart methods by considering a finegrained structure of an asynchronous conversation along with other conversational features by applying recent graphbased methods for nlp for topic segmentation we propose two novel unsupervised models that exploit the finegrained conversational structure and a novel graphtheoretic supervised model that combines lexical conversational and topic features for topic labeling we propose two novel unsupervised random walk models that respectively capture conversation specific clues from two different sources the leading sentences and the finegrained conversational structure empirical evaluation shows that the segmentation and the labeling performed by our best models beat the stateoftheart and are highly correlated with human annotations
