m  mosurovic n  krdzavac h  graves and m  zakharyaschev 2013 a decidable extension of sroiq with complex role chains and unions volume 47 pages 809851

we design a decidable extension of the description logic sroiq underlying the web ontology language owl 2 the new logic called sroiq supports a controlled use of role axioms whose righthand side may contain role chains or role unions we give a tableau algorithm for checking concept satisfiability with respect to sroiq ontologies and prove its soundness completeness and termination
