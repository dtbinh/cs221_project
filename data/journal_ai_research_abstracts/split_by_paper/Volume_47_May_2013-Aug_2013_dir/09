p  r costa and l  m botelho 2013 learning by observation of agent software images volume 47 pages 313349

learning by observation can be of key importance whenever agents sharing similar features want to learn from each other this paper presents an agent architecture that enables software agents to learn by direct observation of the actions executed by expert agents while they are performing a task this is possible because the proposed architecture displays information that is essential for observation making it possible for software agents to observe each other 

results show that agents are able to learn in conditions where common supervised learning algorithms fail such as when agents do not know the results of their actions a priori or when not all the effects of the actions are visible the results also show that our approach provides better results than other learning methods since it requires shorter learning periods
