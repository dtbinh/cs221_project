answering conjunctive queries cqs over a set of facts extended with existential rules is a prominent problem in knowledge representation and databases this problem can be solved using the chase algorithm which extends the given set of facts with fresh facts in order to satisfy the rules if the chase terminates then cqs can be evaluated directly in the resulting set of facts the chase however does not terminate necessarily and checking whether the chase terminates on a given set of rules and facts is undecidable numerous acyclicity notions were proposed as sufficient conditions for chase termination in this paper we present two new acyclicity notions called modelfaithful acyclicity mfa and modelsummarising acyclicity msa furthermore we investigate the landscape of the known acyclicity notions and establish a complete taxonomy of all notions known to us finally we show that mfa and msa generalise most of these notions
