n  betzler a  slinko and j  uhlmann 2013 on the computation of fully proportional representation volume 47 pages 475519

we investigate two systems of fully proportional representation suggested by chamberlin courant and monroe both systems assign a representative to each voter so that the sum of misrepresentations is  minimized the winner determination problem for both systems is known to be nphard hence this work aims at investigating whether there are variants of the proposed rules andor specific electorates for which these problems can be solved efficiently as a variation of these rules instead of minimizing the sum of misrepresentations we considered minimizing the maximal misrepresentation introducing effectively two new rules in the general case  these minimax versions of classical rules appeared to be still nphard
