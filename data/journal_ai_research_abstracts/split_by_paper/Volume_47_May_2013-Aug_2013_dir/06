this article presents our approach to developing watsons gameplaying strategies comprising development of a faithful simulation model and then using learning and montecarlo methods within the simulator to optimize watsons strategic decisionmaking after giving a detailed description of each of our gamestrategy algorithms we then focus in particular on validating the accuracy of the simulators predictions and documenting performance improvements using our methods quantitative performance benefits are shown with respect to both simple heuristic strategies and actual human contestant performance in historical episodes  we further extend our analysis of human play to derive a number of valuable and counterintuitive examples illustrating how human contestants may improve their performance on the show
