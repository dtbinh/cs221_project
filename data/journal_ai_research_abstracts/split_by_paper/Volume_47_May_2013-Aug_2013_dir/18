e  burns w  ruml and m  b do 2013 heuristic search when time matters volume 47 pages 697740

in many applications of shortestpath algorithms it is impractical to   find a provably optimal solution one can only hope to achieve an appropriate balance between search time and solution cost that respects the users preferences preferences come in many forms we consider utility functions that linearly tradeoff search time and solution cost many natural utility functions can be expressed in this form for example when solution cost represents the makespan of a plan equally weighting search time and plan makespan minimizes the time from the arrival of a goal until it is achieved current stateoftheart approaches to optimizing utility functions rely on anytime algorithms and the use of extensive training data to compute a termination policy we propose a more direct approach called bugsy that incorporates the utility function directly into the search obviating the need for a separate termination policy we describe a new method based on offline parameter tuning and a novel benchmark domain for planning under time pressure based on platformstyle video games we then present what we believe to be the first empirical study of applying anytime monitoring to heuristic search and we compare it with our proposals our results suggest that the parameter tuning technique can give the best performance if a representative set of training instances is available if not then bugsy is the algorithm of choice as it performs well and does not require any offline training this work extends the tradition of research on metareasoning for search by illustrating the benefits of embedding lightweight reasoning about time into the search algorithm itself
