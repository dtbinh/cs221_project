m  aramon bajestani and j c  beck 2013 scheduling a dynamic aircraft repair shop with limited repair resources volume 47 pages 3570

we address a dynamic repair shop scheduling problem in the context of military aircraft fleet management where the goal is to maintain a full complement of aircraft over the longterm a number of flights each with a requirement for a specific number and type of aircraft are already scheduled over a long horizon we need to assign aircraft to flights and schedule repair activities while considering the flights requirements repair capacity and aircraft failures the number of aircraft awaiting repair dynamically changes over time due to failures and it is therefore necessary to rebuild the repair schedule online to solve the problem we view the dynamic repair shop as successive static repair scheduling subproblems over shorter time periods we propose a complete approach based on the logicbased benders decomposition to solve the static subproblems and design different rescheduling policies to schedule the dynamic repair shop computational experiments demonstrate that the benders model is able to find and prove optimal solutions on average four times faster than a mixed integer programming model the rescheduling approach having both aspects of scheduling over a longer horizon and quickly adjusting the schedule increases aircraft available in the long term by 10 compared to the approaches having either one of the aspects alone
