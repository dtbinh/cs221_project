this work is a contribution to prioritized reasoning in logic programming in the presence of preference relations involving atoms the  technique providing a new interpretation for prioritized logic programs is inspired by the semantics of prioritized logic programming and enriched with the use of structural information of preference of answer set optimization programming specifically the analysis  of the logic program is carried out together with the analysis of preferences in order to determine the choice order and the sets of comparable models the new semantics is compared with other approaches known in the literature and complexity analysis is also performed showing that with respect to other similar approaches previously proposed the complexity of computing preferred stable models does not increase

in this paper we show that there is a close relation between consistency in a constraint network and set intersection a proof schema is provided as a generic way to obtain consistency properties from properties on set intersection this approach not only simplifies the understanding of and unifies many existing consistency results but also directs the study of consistency to that of set intersection properties in many situations as demonstrated by the results on the convexity and tightness of constraints in this paper specifically we identify a new class of tree convex constraints where local consistency ensures global consistency this generalizes row convex constraints various consistency results are also obtained on constraint networks where only some in contrast to all in the existing workconstraints are tight

matteo  venanzi john  guiver pushmeet  kohli and nicholas  r jennings 2016 timesensitive bayesian information aggregation for crowdsourcing systems volume 56 pages 517545



many aspects of the design of efficient crowdsourcing processes such as defining workers bonuses fair prices and time limits of the tasks involve knowledge of the likely duration of the task at hand in this work we introduce a new timesensitive bayesian aggregation method that simultaneously estimates a tasks duration and obtains reliable aggregations of crowdsourced judgments our method called bcctime uses latent variables to represent the uncertainty about the workers completion time the tasks duration and the workers accuracy to relate the quality of a judgment to the time a worker spends on a task our model assumes that each task is completed within a latent time window within which all workers with a propensity to genuinely attempt the labelling task ie no spammers are expected to submit their judgments in contrast workers with a lower propensity to valid labelling such as spammers bots or lazy labellers are assumed to perform tasks considerably faster or slower than the time required by normal workers specifically we use efficient messagepassing bayesian inference to learn approximate posterior probabilities of i the confusion matrix of each worker ii the propensity to valid labelling of each worker iii the unbiased duration of each task and iv the true label of each task using two real world public datasets for entity linking tasks we show that bcctime produces up to 11 more accurate classifications and up to 100 more informative estimates of a tasks duration compared to stateoftheart methods



logic programs with aggregates lpa are one of the major linguistic extensions to logic programming lp in this work we propose a generalization of the notions of unfounded set and wellfounded semantics for programs with monotone and antimonotone aggregates lpama programs in particular we present a new notion of unfounded set for lpama programs which is a sound generalization of the original definition for standard aggregatefree lp on this basis we define a wellfounded operator for lpama programs the fixpoint of which is called wellfounded model or wellfounded semantics for lpama programs the most important properties of unfounded sets and the wellfounded semantics for standard lp are retained by this generalization notably existence and uniqueness of the wellfounded model together with a strong relationship to the answer set semantics for lpama programs we show that one of the dwellfounded semantics defined by pelov denecker and bruynooghe for a broader class of aggregates using approximating operators coincides with the wellfounded model as defined in this work on lpama programs we also discuss some complexity issues most importantly we give a formal proof of tractable computation of the wellfounded model for lpa programs moreover we prove that for general lpa programs which may contain aggregates that are neither monotone nor antimonotone deciding satisfaction of aggregate expressions with respect to partial interpretations is conpcomplete as a consequence a wellfounded semantics for general lpa programs that allows for tractable computation is unlikely to exist which justifies the restriction on lpama programs finally we present a prototype system extending dlv which supports the wellfounded semantics for lpama programs at the time of writing the only implemented system that does so experiments with this prototype show significant computational advantages of aggregate constructs over equivalent aggregatefree encodings

s  joty g  carenini and r  t ng 2013 topic segmentation and labeling in asynchronous conversations volume 47 pages 521573



topic segmentation and labeling is often considered a prerequisite for higherlevel conversation analysis and has been shown to be useful in many natural language processing nlp applications we present two new corpora of email and blog conversations annotated with topics and evaluate annotator reliability for the segmentation and labeling tasks in these asynchronous conversations we propose a complete computational framework for topic segmentation and labeling in asynchronous conversations our approach extends stateoftheart methods by considering a finegrained structure of an asynchronous conversation along with other conversational features by applying recent graphbased methods for nlp for topic segmentation we propose two novel unsupervised models that exploit the finegrained conversational structure and a novel graphtheoretic supervised model that combines lexical conversational and topic features for topic labeling we propose two novel unsupervised random walk models that respectively capture conversation specific clues from two different sources the leading sentences and the finegrained conversational structure empirical evaluation shows that the segmentation and the labeling performed by our best models beat the stateoftheart and are highly correlated with human annotations

minh  daotran thomas  eiter michael  fink and thomas  krennwallner 2015 distributed evaluation of nonmonotonic multicontext systems volume 52 pages 543600



multicontext systems mcss are a formalism for systems consisting of knowledge bases possibly heterogeneous and nonmonotonic that are interlinked via bridge rules where the global system semantics emerges from the local semantics of the knowledge bases also called contexts in an equilibrium while mcss and related formalisms are inherently targeted for distributed set tings no truly distributed algorithms for their evaluation were available we address this short coming and present a suite of such algorithms which includes a basic algorithm dmcs an ad vanced version dmcsopt that exploits topologybased optimizations and a streaming algorithm dmcsstreaming that computes equilibria in packages of bounded size the algorithms be have quite differently in several respects as experienced in thorough experimental evaluation of a system prototype from the experimental results we derive a guideline for choosing the appropriate algorithm and running mode in particular situations determined by the parameter settings





symmetries in discrete constraint satisfaction problems have been explored and exploited in the last years but symmetries in continuous constraint problems have not received the same attention here we focus on permutations of the variables consisting of one single cycle we propose a procedure that takes advantage of these symmetries by interacting with a continuous constraint solver without interfering with it a key concept in this procedure are the classes of symmetric boxes formed by bisecting a ndimensional cube at the same point in all dimensions at the same time we analyze these classes and quantify them as a function of the cube dimensionality moreover we propose a simple algorithm to generate the representatives of all these classes for any number of variables at very high rates a problem example from the chemical 64257eld and the cyclic nroots problem are used to show the performance of the approach in practice







j  garcia and f  fernandez 2012 safe exploration of state and action spaces in reinforcement learning volume 45 pages 515564



in this paper we consider the important problem of safe exploration in reinforcement learning while reinforcement learning is wellsuited to domains with complex transition dynamics and highdimensional stateaction spaces an additional challenge is posed by the need for safe and efficient exploration traditional exploration techniques are not particularly useful for solving dangerous tasks where the trial and error process may lead to the selection of actions whose execution in some states may result in damage to the learning system or any other system consequently when an agent begins an interaction with a dangerous and highdimensional stateaction space an important question arises namely that of how to avoid or at least minimize damage caused by the exploration of the stateaction space we introduce the pisrl algorithm which safely improves suboptimal albeit robust behaviors for continuous state and action control tasks and which efficiently learns from the experience gained from the environment we evaluate the proposed method in four complex tasks automatic car parking polebalancing helicopter hovering and business management

in order to meet usability requirements most logicbased applications provide explanation facilities for reasoning services this holds also for description logics where research has focused on the explanation of both tbox reasoning and more recently query answering besides explaining the  presence of a tuple in a query answer it is important to explain also why a   given tuple is missing we address the latter problem for instance and  conjunctive query answering over dllite ontologies by adopting abductive  reasoning that is we look for additions to the abox that force a given  tuple to be in the result as reasoning tasks we consider existence and recognition of an explanation and relevance and necessity of a given  assertion for an explanation we characterize the computational complexity of  these problems for arbitrary subset minimal and cardinality minimal

a  altman and m  tennenholtz 2008 axiomatic foundations for ranking systems volume 31 pages 473495



reasoning about agent preferences on a set of alternatives and the aggregation of such preferences into some social ranking is a fundamental issue in reasoning about multiagent systems when the set of agents and the set of alternatives coincide we get the ranking systems setting a famous type of ranking systems are page ranking systems in the context of search engines in this paper we present an extensive axiomatic study of ranking systems in particular we consider two fundamental axioms transitivity and ranked independence of irrelevant alternatives surprisingly we find that there is no general social ranking rule that satisfies both requirements furthermore we show that our impossibility result holds under various restrictions on the class of ranking problems considered however when transitivity is weakened an interesting possibility result is obtained in addition we show a complete axiomatization of approval voting using ranked iia 



daan  bloembergen karl  tuyls daniel  hennes and michael  kaisers 2015 evolutionary dynamics of multiagent learning a survey volume 53 pages 659697



the interaction of multiple autonomous agents gives rise to highly dynamic and nondeterministic environments contributing to the complexity in applications such as automated financial markets smart grids or robotics due to the sheer number of situations that may arise it is not possible to foresee and program the optimal behaviour for all agents beforehand consequently it becomes essential for the success of the system that the agents can learn their optimal behaviour and adapt to new situations or circumstances the past two decades have seen the emergence of reinforcement learning both in single and multiagent settings as a strong robust and adaptive learning paradigm progress has been substantial and a wide range of algorithms are now available an important challenge in the domain of multiagent learning is to gain qualitative insights into the resulting system dynamics in the past decade tools and methods from evolutionary game theory have been successfully employed to study multiagent learning dynamics formally in strategic interactions this article surveys the dynamical models that have been derived for various multiagent reinforcement learning algorithms making it possible to study and compare them qualitatively furthermore new learning algorithms that have been introduced using these evolutionary game theoretic tools are reviewed the evolutionary models can be used to study complex strategic interactions examples of such analysis are given for the domains of automated trading in stock markets and collision avoidance in multirobot systems the paper provides a roadmap on the progress that has been achieved in analysing the evolutionary dynamics of multiagent learning by highlighting the main results and accomplishments

online offerings such as web search news portals and ecommerce applications face the challenge of providing highquality service to a large heterogeneous user base recent efforts have highlighted the potential to improve performance by introducing methods to personalize services based on special knowledge about users and their context for example a users demographics location and past search and browsing may be useful in enhancing the results offered in response to web search queries  however reasonable concerns about privacy by both users providers and government agencies acting on behalf of citizens may limit access by services to such information   we introduce and explore an economics of privacy in personalization where people can opt to share personal information in a standing or ondemand manner in return for expected enhancements in the quality of an online service we focus on the example of web search and formulate realistic objective functions for search efficacy and privacy we demonstrate how we can find a provably nearoptimal optimization of the utilityprivacy tradeoff in an efficient manner  we evaluate our methodology on data drawn from a log of the search activity of volunteer participants we separately assess users preferences about privacy and utility via a largescale survey aimed at eliciting preferences about peoples willingness to trade the sharing of personal data in returns for gains in search efficiency we show that a significant level of personalization can be achieved using a relatively small amount of information about users







p  yang and w  gao 2014 informationtheoretic multiview domain adaptation a theoretical and empirical study volume 49 pages 501525



multiview learning aims to improve classification performance by leveraging the consistency among different views of data the incorporation of multiple views was paid little attention in the studies of domain adaptation where the view consistency based on source data is largely violated in the target domain due to the distribution gap between different domain data in this paper we leverage multiple views for crossdomain document classification the central idea is to strengthen the views consistency on target data by identifying the associations of domainspecific features from different domains we present an informationtheoretic multiview adaptation model imam using a multiway clustering scheme where word and link clusters can draw together seemingly unrelated features across domains which boosts the consistency between document clusterings that are based on the respective word and link views moreover we demonstrate that imam can always find the document clustering with the minimal disagreement rate to the overlap of viewbased clusterings we provide both theoretical and empirical justifications of the proposed method our experiments show that imam significantly outperforms traditional multiview algorithm cotraining the cotrainingbased adaptation algorithm coda the singleview transfer model cocc and the largemarginbased multiview transfer model mvtllm

d  h wolpert and j  w bono 2013 predicting behavior in unstructured bargaining with a probability distribution volume 46 pages 579605



in experimental tests of human behavior in unstructured bargaining games typically many joint utility outcomes are found to occur not just one this suggests we predict the outcome of such a game as a probability distribution this is in contrast to what is conventionally done eg in the nash bargaining solution which is predict a single outcome we show how to translate nashs bargaining axioms to provide a distribution over outcomes rather than a single outcome we then prove that a subset of those axioms forces the distribution over utility outcomes to be a powerlaw distribution unlike nashs original result our result holds even if the feasible set is finite when the feasible set is convex and comprehensive the mode of the power law distribution is the harsanyi bargaining solution and if we require symmetry it is the nash bargaining solution however in general these modes of the joint utility distribution are not the experimentalists bayesoptimal predictions for the joint utility nor are the bargains corresponding to the modes of those joint utility distributions the modes of the distribution over bargains in general since more than one bargain may result in the same joint utility after introducing distributional bargaining solution concepts we show how an external regulator can use them to optimally design an unstructured bargaining scenario throughout we demonstrate our analysis in computational experiments involving flight rerouting negotiations in the national airspace system we emphasize that while our results are formulated for unstructured bargaining they can also be used to make predictions for noncooperative games where the modeler knows the utility functions of the players over possible outcomes of the game but does not know the move spaces the players use to determine those outcomes

a  rahman and v  ng 2011 narrowing the modeling gap a clusterranking approach to coreference resolution volume 40 pages 469521



traditional learningbased coreference resolvers operate by training the mentionpair model for determining whether two mentions are coreferent or not though conceptually simple and easy to understand the mentionpair model is linguistically rather unappealing and lags far behind the heuristicbased coreference models proposed in the prestatistical nlp era in terms of sophistication two independent lines of recent research have attempted to improve the mentionpair model one by acquiring the mentionranking model to rank preceding mentions for a given anaphor and the other by training the entitymention model to determine whether a preceding cluster is coreferent with a given mention we propose a clusterranking approach to coreference resolution which combines the strengths of the mentionranking model and the entitymention model and is therefore theoretically more appealing than both of these models in addition we seek to improve cluster rankers via two extensions 1 lexicalization and 2 incorporating knowledge of anaphoricity by jointly modeling anaphoricity determination and coreference resolution experimental results on the ace data sets demonstrate the superior performance of cluster rankers to competing approaches as well as the effectiveness of our two extensions

j  huang a  kapoor and c  guestrin 2012 riffled independence for efficient inference with partial rankings volume 44 pages 491532



distributions over rankings are used to model data in a multitude of real world settings such as preference analysis and political elections modeling such distributions presents several computational challenges however due to the factorial size of the set of rankings over an item set some of these challenges are quite familiar to the artificial intelligence community such as how to compactly represent a distribution over a combinatorially large space and how to efficiently perform probabilistic inference with these representations with respect to ranking however there is the additional challenge of what we refer to as human task complexity  users are rarely willing to provide a full ranking over a long list of candidates instead often preferring to provide partial ranking information

simultaneously addressing all of these challenges  ie designing a compactly representable model which is amenable to efficient inference and can be learned using partial ranking data  is a difficult task but is necessary if we would like to scale to problems with nontrivial size in this paper we show that the recently proposed riffled independence assumptions cleanly and efficiently address each of the above challenges in particular we establish a tight mathematical connection between the concepts of riffled independence and of partial rankings this correspondence not only allows us to then develop efficient and exact algorithms for performing inference tasks using riffled independence based represen tations with partial rankings but somewhat surprisingly also shows that efficient inference is not possible for riffle independent models in a certain sense with observations which do not take the form of partial rankings finally using our inference algorithm we introduce the first method for learning riffled independence based models from partially ranked data
