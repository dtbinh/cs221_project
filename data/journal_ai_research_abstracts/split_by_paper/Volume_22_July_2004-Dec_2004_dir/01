many researchers in artificial intelligence are beginning to explore the use of soft constraints to express a set of possibly conflicting problem  requirements a soft constraint is a function defined on a collection of  variables which associates some measure of desirability with each possible  combination of values for those variables however the crucial question of  the computational complexity of finding the optimal solution to a collection of soft constraints has so far received very little attention in this paper we identify a class of soft binary constraints for which the problem of  finding the optimal solution is tractable in other words we show that for  any given set of such constraints there exists a polynomial time algorithm  to determine the assignment having the best overall combined measure of  desirability this tractable class includes many commonlyoccurring soft constraints such as as near as possible or as soon as possible after as well as crisp constraints such as greater than finally we show that  this tractable class is maximal in the sense that adding any other form of  soft binary constraint which is not in the class gives rise to a class of  problems which is nphard
