an accepted belief is a proposition considered likely enough by an agent to be inferred from as if it were true this paper bridges the gap between probabilistic and logical representations of accepted beliefs to this end natural properties of relations on propositions describing relative strength of belief are augmented with some conditions ensuring that accepted beliefs form a deductively closed set this requirement turns out to be very restrictive in particular it is shown that the sets of accepted belief of an agent can always be derived from a family of possibility rankings of states an agent accepts a proposition in a given context if this proposition is considered more possible than its negation in this context for all possibility rankings in the family these results are closely connected to the nonmonotonic preferential inference system of kraus lehmann and magidor and the socalled plausibility functions of friedman and halpern the extent to which probability theory is compatible with acceptance relations is laid bare a solution to the lottery paradox which is considered as a major impediment to the use of nonmonotonic inference is proposed using a special kind of probabilities called lexicographic or bigstepped the setting of acceptance relations also proposes another way of approaching the theory of belief change after the works of grdenfors and colleagues our view considers the acceptance relation as a primitive object from which belief sets are derived in various contexts
