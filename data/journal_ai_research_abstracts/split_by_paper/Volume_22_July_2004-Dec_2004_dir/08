many known planning tasks have inherent constraints concerning the best order in which to achieve the goals a number of research efforts have been made to detect such constraints and to use them for guiding search in the hope of speeding up the planning process     we go beyond the previous approaches by considering ordering constraints not only over the toplevel goals but also over the subgoals that will necessarily arise during planning landmarks are facts that must be true at some point in every valid solution plan  we extend koehler and hoffmanns definition of reasonable orders between top level goals to the more general case of landmarks we show how landmarks can be found how their reasonable orders can be approximated and how this information can be used to decompose a given planning task into several smaller subtasks our methodology is completely domain and plannerindependent the implementation demonstrates that the approach can yield significant runtime performance improvements when used as a control loop around stateoftheart suboptimal planning systems as exemplified by ff and lpg
