formal treatment of collaborative multiagent systems has been lagging behind the rapid progress in sequential decision making by individual agents  recent work in the area of decentralized markov decision processes mdps has contributed to closing this gap but the computational complexity of these models remains a serious obstacle to overcome this complexity barrier we identify a specific class of decentralized mdps in which the agents transitions are independent the class consists of independent collaborating agents that are tied together through a structured global reward function that depends on all of their histories of states and actions  we present a novel algorithm for solving this class of problems and examine its properties both as an optimal algorithm and as an anytime algorithm to our best knowledge this is the first algorithm to optimally solve a nontrivial subclass of decentralized mdps  it lays the foundation for further work in this area on both exact and approximate algorithms
