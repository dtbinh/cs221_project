multiagent learning is a necessary yet challenging problem as multiagent systems become more prevalent and environments become more dynamic  much of the groundbreaking work in this area draws on notable results from game theory in particular the concept of nash equilibria  learners that directly learn an equilibrium obviously rely on their existence  learners that instead seek to play optimally with respect to the other players also depend upon equilibria since equilibria are fixed points for learning  from another perspective agents with limitations are real and common  these may be undesired physical limitations as well as selfimposed rational limitations such as abstraction and approximation techniques used to make learning tractable  this article explores the interactions of these two important concepts equilibria and limitations in learning  we introduce the question of whether equilibria continue to exist when agents have limitations  we look at the general effects limitations can have on agent behavior and define a natural extension of equilibria that accounts for these limitations  using this formalization we make three major contributions i a counterexample for the general existence of equilibria with limitations ii sufficient conditions on limitations that preserve their existence iii three general classes of games and limitations that satisfy these conditions  we then present empirical results from a specific multiagent learning algorithm applied to a specific instance of limited agents  these results demonstrate that learning with limitations is feasible when the conditions outlined by our theoretical analysis hold
