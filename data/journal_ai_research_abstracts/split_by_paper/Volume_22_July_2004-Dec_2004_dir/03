c  j meek and  w  p birmingham 2004 a comprehensive trainable error model for sung music queries volume 22 pages 5791

we propose a model for errors in sung queries a variant of the hidden markov model hmm this is a solution to the problem of identifying the degree of similarity between a typically errorladen sung query and a potential target in a database of musical works an important problem in the field of music information retrieval similarity metrics are a critical component of querybyhumming qbh applications which search audio and multimedia databases for strong matches to oral queries our model comprehensively expresses the types of m error or variation between target and query cumulative and noncumulative local errors transposition tempo and tempo changes insertions deletions and modulation the model is not only expressive but automatically trainable or able to learn and generalize from query examples we present results of simulations designed to assess the discriminatory potential of the model and tests with real sung queries to demonstrate relevance to realworld applications
