decentralized control of cooperative systems captures the operation of a group of decision makers that share a single global objective  the difficulty in solving optimally such problems arises when the agents lack full observability of the global state of the system when they operate the general problem has been shown to be nexpcomplete in this paper we identify classes of decentralized control problems whose complexity ranges between nexp and p in particular we study problems characterized by independent transitions independent observations and goaloriented objective functions  two algorithms are shown to solve optimally useful classes of goaloriented decentralized processes in polynomial time  this paper also studies information sharing among the decisionmakers which can improve their performance we distinguish between three ways in which agents can exchange information indirect communication direct communication and sharing state features that are not controlled by the agents  our analysis shows that for every class of problems we consider introducing direct or indirect communication does not change the worstcase complexity  the results provide a better understanding of the complexity of decentralized control problems that arise in practice and facilitate the development of planning algorithms for these problems
