honorable mention for the 2008 ijcaijair best paper prize

efficient implementations of dpll with the addition of clause learning are the fastest complete boolean satisfiability solvers and can handle many significant realworld problems such as verification planning and design despite its importance little is known of the ultimate strengths and limitations of the technique this paper presents the first precise characterization of clause learning as a proof system cl and begins the task of understanding its power by relating it to the wellstudied resolution proof system in particular we show that with a new learning scheme cl can provide exponentially shorter proofs than many proper refinements of general resolution res satisfying a natural property these include regular and davisputnam resolution which are already known to be much stronger than ordinary dpll we also show that a slight variant of cl with unlimited restarts is as powerful as res itself translating these analytical results to practice however presents a challenge because of the nondeterministic nature of clause learning algorithms we propose a novel way of exploiting the underlying problem structure in the form of a high level problem description such as a graph or pddl specification to guide clause learning algorithms toward faster solutions we show that this leads to exponential speedups on grid and randomized pebbling problems as well as substantial improvements on certain ordering formulas
