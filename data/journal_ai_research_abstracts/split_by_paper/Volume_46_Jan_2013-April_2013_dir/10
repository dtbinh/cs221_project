although the use of metric fluents is fundamental to many practical planning problems the study of heuristics to support fully automated planners working with these fluents remains relatively unexplored the most widely used heuristic is the relaxation of metric fluents into intervalvalued variables  an idea first proposed a decade ago other heuristics depend on domain encodings that supply additional information about fluents such as capacity constraints or other resourcerelated annotations 

we present a heuristic for numeric planning problems building on the propositional relaxed planning graph but using a mathematical program for numeric reasoning  we define a class of producerconsumer planning problems and demonstrate how the numeric constraints in these can be modelled in a mixed integer program mip  this mip is then combined with a metric relaxed planning graph rpg heuristic to produce an integrated hybrid heuristic the mip tracks resource use more accurately than the usual relaxation but relaxes the ordering of actions while the rpg captures the causal propositional aspects of the problem  we discuss how these two components interact to produce a single unified heuristic and go on to explore how further numeric features of planning problems can be integrated into the mip we show that encoding a limited subset of the propositional problem to augment the mip can yield more accurate guidance partly by exploiting structure such as propositional landmarks and propositional resources  our results show that the use of this heuristic enhances scalability on problems where numeric resource interaction is key in finding a solution
