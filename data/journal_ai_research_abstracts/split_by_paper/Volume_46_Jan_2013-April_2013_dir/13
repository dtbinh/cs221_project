this paper presents a modelbased planner called the probabilistic sulu planner  or the psulu planner which controls stochastic systems in a goal directed manner within userspecified risk bounds the objective of the psulu planner is to allow users to command continuous stochastic systems such as unmanned aerial and space vehicles in a manner that is both intuitive and safe to this end we first develop a new plan representation called a chanceconstrained qualitative state plan ccqsp through which users can specify the desired evolution of the plant state as well as the acceptable level of risk an example of a ccqsp statement is go to a through b within 30 minutes with less than 0001 probability of failure  we then develop the psulu planner which can tractably solve a ccqsp planning problem in order to enable ccqsp planning we develop the following two capabilities in this paper 1 risksensitive planning with risk bounds and 2 goaldirected planning in a continuous domain with temporal constraints the first capability is to ensures that the probability of failure is bounded the second capability is essential for the planner to solve problems with a continuous state space such as vehicle path planning we demonstrate the capabilities of the psulu planner by simulations on two realworld scenarios the path planning and scheduling of a personal aerial vehicle as well as the space rendezvous of an autonomous cargo spacecraft
