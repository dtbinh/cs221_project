h  zhao x  zhang and c  kit 2013 integrative semantic dependency parsing via efficient largescale feature selection volume 46 pages 203233

semantic parsing ie the automatic derivation of meaning representation such as an instantiated predicateargument structure for a sentence plays a critical role in deep processing of natural language unlike all other top systems of semantic dependency parsing that have to rely on a pipeline framework to chain up a series of submodels each specialized for a specific subtask the one presented in this article integrates everything into one model in hopes of achieving desirable integrity and practicality for real applications while maintaining a competitive performance this integrative approach tackles semantic parsing as a word pair classification problem using a maximum entropy classifier we leverage adaptive pruning of argument candidates and largescale feature selection engineering to allow the largest feature space ever in use so far in this field it achieves a stateoftheart performance on the evaluation data set for conll2008 shared task on top of all but one top pipeline system confirming its feasibility and effectiveness
