c  sauper and r  barzilay 2013 automatic aggregation by joint modeling of aspects and values volume 46 pages 89127

we present a model for aggregation of product review snippets by joint aspect identification and sentiment analysis  our model simultaneously identifies an underlying set of ratable aspects presented in the reviews of a product eg sushi and miso for a japanese restaurant and determines the corresponding sentiment of each aspect  this approach directly enables discovery of highlyrated or inconsistent aspects of a product  our generative model admits an efficient variational meanfield inference algorithm  it is also easily extensible and we describe several modifications and their effects on model structure and inference  we test our model on two tasks joint aspect identification and sentiment analysis on a set of yelp reviews and aspect identification alone on a set of medical summaries  we evaluate the performance of the model on aspect identification sentiment analysis and perword labeling accuracy  we demonstrate that our model outperforms applicable baselines by a considerable margin yielding up to 32 relative error reduction on aspect identification and up to 20 relative error reduction on sentiment analysis
