anomaly detection is being regarded as an unsupervised learning task as anomalies stem from adversarial or unlikely events with unknown distributions however the predictive performance of purely unsupervised anomaly detection  often fails to match the required detection rates in many tasks and there exists a need for labeled data to guide the model generation our first contribution shows that  classical semisupervised approaches originating from a supervised classifier are inappropriate and hardly detect  new and unknown anomalies we argue that semisupervised anomaly detection  needs to ground on the unsupervised learning paradigm and devise a novel algorithm that meets this requirement although being intrinsically nonconvex we further show that the optimization problem has a convex equivalent under relatively mild assumptions additionally we propose an active learning strategy to automatically filter candidates for  labeling in an empirical study on network intrusion detection data we observe that the proposed learning methodology requires much less labeled data than the stateoftheart while achieving higher detection accuracies
