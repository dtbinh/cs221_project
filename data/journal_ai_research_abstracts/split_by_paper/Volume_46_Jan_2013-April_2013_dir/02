e  huang and r  e korf 2013 optimal rectangle packing an absolute placement approach volume 46 pages 4787

we consider the problem of finding all enclosing rectangles of minimum area that can contain a given set of rectangles without overlap  our rectangle packer chooses the xcoordinates of all the rectangles before any of the ycoordinates we then transform the problem into a perfectpacking problem with no empty space by adding additional rectangles to determine the ycoordinates we branch on the different rectangles that can be placed in each empty position our packer allows us to extend the known solutions for a consecutivesquare benchmark from 27 to 32 squares we also introduce three new benchmarks avoiding properties that make a benchmark easy such as rectangles with shared dimensions our third benchmark consists of rectangles of increasingly high precision to pack them efficiently we limit the rectangles coordinates and the bounding box dimensions to the set of subset sums of the rectangles dimensions overall our algorithms represent the current stateoftheart for this problem outperforming other algorithms by orders of magnitude depending on the benchmark
