this paper presents a structured power and energyflowbased qualitative modelling approach that is applicable to a variety of system types including electrical and fluid flow the modelling is split into two parts

the novel aspects of the work are an order of magnitudeom qualitative network analyser to represent any power domain and topology including multiple power sources a feature that was not required for earlier specialised electrical versions of the approach secondly the representation of generalised energy related behaviour as statebased local models is presented as a modelling strategy that can be more vivid and intuitive for a range of topologically complex applications than qualitative equationbased representationsthe twolevel modelling strategy allows the broad system behaviour coverage of qualitative simulation to be exploited for the fmea task while limiting the difficulties of qualitative ambiguity explanation that can arise from abstracted numerical models we have used the method to support an automated fmea system with examples of an aircraft fuel system and domestic a heating system discussed in this paper
