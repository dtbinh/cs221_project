this article presents the stateoftheart in optimal solution methods for decentralized partially observable markov decision processes decpomdps which are general models for collaborative multiagent planning under uncertainty building off the generalized multiagent a gmaa algorithm which reduces the problem to a tree of oneshot collaborative bayesian games cbgs we describe several advances that greatly expand the range of decpomdps that can be solved optimally  first we introduce lossless incremental clustering of the cbgs solved by gmaa which achieves exponential speedups without sacrificing optimality  second we introduce incremental expansion of nodes in the gmaa search tree which avoids the need to expand all children the number of which is in the worst case doubly exponential in the nodes depth  this is particularly beneficial when little clustering is possible  in addition we introduce new hybrid heuristic representations that are more compact and thereby enable the solution of larger decpomdps  we provide theoretical guarantees that when a suitable heuristic is used both incremental clustering and incremental expansion yield algorithms that are both complete and search equivalent  finally we present extensive empirical results demonstrating that gmaaice an algorithm that synthesizes these advances can optimally solve decpomdps of unprecedented size
