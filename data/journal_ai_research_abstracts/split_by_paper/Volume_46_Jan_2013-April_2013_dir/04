the family of groves mechanisms which includes the wellknown vcg mechanism also known as the clarke mechanism is a family of efficient and strategyproof mechanisms unfortunately the groves mechanisms are generally not budget balanced that is under such mechanisms payments may flow into or out of the system of the agents resulting in deficits or reduced utilities for the agents we consider the following problem within the family of groves mechanisms we want to identify mechanisms that give the agents the highest utilities under the constraint that these mechanisms must never incur deficits
