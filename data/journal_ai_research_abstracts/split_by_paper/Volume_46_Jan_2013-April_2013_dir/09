a  metodi m  codish and p  j stuckey 2013 boolean equipropagation for concise and efficient sat encodings of  combinatorial problems volume 46 pages 303341

we present an approach to propagationbased sat encoding of combinatorial problems boolean equipropagation where constraints are modeled as boolean functions which propagate information about equalities between boolean literals  this information is then applied to simplify the cnf encoding of the constraints  a key factor is that considering only a small fragment of a constraint model at one time enables us to apply stronger and even complete reasoning to detect equivalent literals in that fragment once detected equivalences apply to simplify the entire constraint model and facilitate further reasoning on other fragments equipropagation in combination with partial evaluation and constraint simplification provide the foundation for a powerful approach to satbased finite domain constraint solving  we introduce a tool called bee bengurion equipropagation encoder based on these ideas and demonstrate for a variety of benchmarks that our approach leads to a considerable reduction in the size of cnf encodings and subsequent speedups in sat solving times
