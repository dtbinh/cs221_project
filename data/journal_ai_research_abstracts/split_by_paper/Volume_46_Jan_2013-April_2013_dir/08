bayesian network structure learning is the notoriously difficult problem of discovering a bayesian network that optimally represents a given set of training data  in this paper we study the computational worstcase complexity of exact bayesian network structure learning under graph theoretic restrictions on the directed superstructure  the superstructure is an undirected graph that contains as subgraphs the skeletons of solution networks we introduce the directed superstructure as a natural generalization of its undirected counterpart our results apply to several variants of scorebased bayesian network structure learning where the score of a network decomposes into local scores of its nodes

results we show that exact bayesian network structure learning can be carried out in nonuniform polynomial time if the superstructure has bounded treewidth and in linear time if in addition the superstructure has bounded maximum degree furthermore we show that if the directed superstructure is acyclic then exact bayesian network structure learning can be carried out in quadratic time we complement these positive results with a number of hardness results we show that both restrictions treewidth and degree are essential and cannot be dropped without loosing uniform polynomial time tractability subject to a complexitytheoretic assumption similarly exact bayesian network structure learning remains nphard for almost acyclic directed superstructures  furthermore we show that the restrictions remain essential if we do not search for a globally optimal network but aim to improve a given network by means of at most k arc additions arc deletions or arc reversals kneighborhood local search
