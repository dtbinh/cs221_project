the minimum vertex cover mvc problem is a prominent nphard combinatorial optimization problem of great importance in both theory and application local search has proved successful for this problem however there are two main drawbacks in stateoftheart mvc local search algorithms first they select a pair of vertices to exchange simultaneously which is timeconsuming secondly although using edge weighting techniques to diversify the search these algorithms lack mechanisms for decreasing the weights to address these issues we propose two new strategies twostage exchange and edge weighting with forgetting the twostage exchange strategy selects two vertices to exchange separately and performs the exchange in two stages the strategy of edge weighting with forgetting not only increases weights of uncovered edges but also decreases some weights for each edge periodically these two strategies are used in designing a new mvc local search algorithm which is referred to as numvc

we conduct extensive experimental studies on the standard benchmarks namely dimacs and bhoslib the experiment comparing numvc with stateoftheart heuristic algorithms show that numvc is at least competitive with the nearest competitor namely pls on the dimacs benchmark and clearly dominates all competitors on the bhoslib benchmark also experimental results indicate that numvc finds an optimal solution much faster than the current best exact algorithm for maximum clique on random instances as well as some structured ones moreover we study the effectiveness of the two strategies and the runtime behaviour through experimental analysis
