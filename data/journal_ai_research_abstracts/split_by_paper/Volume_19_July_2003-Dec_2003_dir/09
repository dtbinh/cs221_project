as examples such as the monty hall puzzle show applying conditioning to update a probability distribution on a naive space which does not take into account the protocol used can often lead to counterintuitive results  here we examine why  a criterion known as car coarsening at random in the statistical literature characterizes when naive conditioning in a naive space works  we show that the car condition holds rather infrequently and we provide a procedural characterization of it by giving a randomized algorithm that generates all and only distributions for which car holds this substantially extends previous characterizations of car  we also consider more generalized notions of update such as jeffrey conditioning and minimizing relative entropy mre  we give a generalization of the car condition that characterizes when jeffrey conditioning leads to appropriate answers and show that there exist some very simple settings in which mre essentially never gives the right results  this generalizes and interconnects previous results obtained in the literature on car and mre
