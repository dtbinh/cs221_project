l  finkelstein  s  markovitch and  e  rivlin 2003 optimal schedules for parallelizing anytime algorithms the case of shared resources volume 19 pages 73138

the performance of anytime algorithms can be improved by simultaneously solving several instances of algorithmproblem pairs these pairs may include different instances of a problem such as starting from a different initial state different algorithms if several alternatives exist or several runs of the same algorithm for nondeterministic algorithms in this paper we present a methodology for designing an optimal scheduling policy based on the statistical characteristics of the algorithms involved we formally analyze the case where the processes share resources a singleprocessor model and provide an algorithm for optimal scheduling  we analyze theoretically and empirically the behavior of our scheduling algorithm for various distribution types  finally we present empirical results of applying our scheduling algorithm to the latin square problem
