f  lin 2003 compiling causal theories to successor state axioms and stripslike systems volume 19 pages 279314

we describe a system for specifying the effects of actions unlike those commonly used in ai planning our system uses an action description language that allows one to specify the effects of actions using domain rules which are state constraints that can entail new action effects from old ones declaratively an action domain in our language corresponds to a nonmonotonic causal theory in the situation calculus procedurally such an action domain is compiled into a set of    logical theories one for each action in the domain from which fully instantiated  successor statelike axioms and stripslike systems are then generated we expect the system to be a useful tool for knowledge engineers writing action specifications for classical ai planning systems golog systems and other systems where formal specifications of actions are needed
