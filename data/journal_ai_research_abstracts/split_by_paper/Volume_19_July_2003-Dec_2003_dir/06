p  maynardzhang and  d  lehmann 2003 representing and aggregating conflicting beliefs volume 19 pages 155203

we consider the twofold problem of representing collective beliefs and aggregating these beliefs we propose a novel representation for collective beliefs that uses modular transitive relations over possible worlds they allow us to represent conflicting opinions and they have a clear semantics thus improving upon the quasitransitive relations often used in social choice we then describe a way to construct the belief state of an agent informed by a set of sources of varying degrees of reliability this construction circumvents arrows impossibility theorem in a satisfactory manner by accounting for the explicitly encoded conflicts we give a simple settheorybased operator for combining the information of multiple agents we show that this operator satisfies the desirable invariants of idempotence commutativity and associativity and thus is wellbehaved when iterated and we describe a computationally effective way of computing the resulting belief state finally we extend our framework to incorporate voting
