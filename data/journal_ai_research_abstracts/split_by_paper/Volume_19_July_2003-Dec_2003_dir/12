hierarchical task decomposition is a method used in many agent systems to organize agent knowledge  this work shows how the combination of a hierarchy and persistent assertions of knowledge can lead to difficulty in maintaining logical consistency in asserted knowledge we explore the problematic consequences of persistent assumptions in the reasoning process and introduce novel potential solutions  having implemented one of the possible solutions dynamic hierarchical justification its effectiveness is demonstrated with an empirical analysis
