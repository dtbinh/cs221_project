the automatic generation of decision trees based on offline reasoning on models of a domain is a reasonable compromise between the advantages of using a modelbased approach in technical domains and the constraints imposed by embedded applications  in this paper we extend the approach to deal with temporal information we introduce a notion of temporal decision tree which is designed to make use of relevant information as long as it is acquired and we present an algorithm for compiling such trees from a modelbased reasoning system
