b  zanuttini 2003 new polynomial classes for logicbased abduction volume 19 pages 110

we address the problem of propositional logicbased    abduction ie the problem of searching for a best explanation for a    given propositional observation according to a given propositional    knowledge base we give a general algorithm based on the notion of    projection then we study restrictions over the representations of the    knowledge base and of the query and find new polynomial classes of    abduction problems
