supply chain formation is the process of determining the structure and terms of exchange relationships to enable a multilevel multiagent production activity  we present a simple model of supply chains highlighting two characteristic features hierarchical subtask decomposition and resource contention  to decentralize the formation process we introduce a market price system over the resources produced along the chain  in a competitive equilibrium for this system agents choose locally optimal allocations with respect to prices and outcomes are optimal overall  to determine prices we define a market protocol based on distributed progressive auctions and myopic nonstrategic agent bidding policies  in the presence of resource contention this protocol produces better solutions than the greedy protocols common in the artificial intelligence and multiagent systems literature  the protocol often converges to highvalue supply chains and when competitive equilibria exist typically to approximate competitive equilibria  however complementarities in agent production technologies can cause the protocol to wastefully allocate inputs to agents that do not produce their outputs  a subsequent decommitment phase recovers a significant fraction of the lost surplus
