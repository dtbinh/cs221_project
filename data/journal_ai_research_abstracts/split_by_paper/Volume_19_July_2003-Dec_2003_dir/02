r  i brafman and  m  tennenholtz 2003 learning to coordinate efficiently a modelbased approach volume 19 pages 1123

in commoninterest stochastic games all players receive an identical payoff players participating in such games must learn to coordinate with each other in order to receive the highestpossible value a number of reinforcement learning algorithms have been proposed for this problem and some have been shown to converge to good solutions in the limit in this paper we show that using very simple modelbased algorithms much better ie polynomial convergence rates can be attained moreover our modelbased algorithms are guaranteed to converge to the optimal value unlike many of the existing algorithms
