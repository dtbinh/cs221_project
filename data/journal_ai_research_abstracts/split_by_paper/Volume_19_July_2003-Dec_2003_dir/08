auctions are becoming an increasingly popular method for transacting business especially over the internet  this article presents a general approach to building autonomous bidding agents to bid in multiple simultaneous auctions for interacting goods  a core component of our approach learns a model of the empirical price dynamics based on past data and uses the model to analytically calculate to the greatest extent possible optimal bids  we introduce a new and general boostingbased algorithm for conditional density estimation problems of this kind ie supervised learning problems in which the goal is to estimate the entire conditional distribution of the realvalued label  this approach is fully implemented as attac2001 a topscoring agent in the second trading agent competition tac01 we present experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of our boostingbased price predictor relative to several reasonable alternatives
