multiagent planning in stochastic environments can be framed formally as a decentralized markov decision problem many reallife distributed problems that arise in manufacturing multirobot coordination and information gathering scenarios can be formalized using this framework however finding the optimal solution in the general case is hard limiting the applicability of recently developed algorithms this paper provides a practical approach for solving decentralized control problems when communication among the decision makers is possible but costly  we develop the notion of communicationbased mechanism that allows us to decompose a decentralized mdp into multiple singleagent problems in this framework referred to as decentralized semimarkov decision process with direct communication decsmdpcom agents operate separately between communications we show that finding an optimal mechanism is equivalent to solving optimally a decsmdpcom we also provide a heuristic search algorithm that converges on the optimal decomposition  restricting the decomposition to some specific types of local behaviors reduces significantly the complexity of planning in particular we present a polynomialtime algorithm for the case in which individual agents perform goaloriented behaviors between communications the paper concludes with an additional tractable algorithm that enables the introduction of human knowledge thereby reducing the overall problem to finding the best time to communicate empirical results show that these approaches provide good approximate solutions
