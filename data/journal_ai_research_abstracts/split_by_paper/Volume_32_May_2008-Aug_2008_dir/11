b  c csaji and l  monostori 2008 adaptive stochastic resource control a machine learning approach volume 32 pages 453486

the paper investigates stochastic resource allocation problems with scarce reusable resources and nonpreemtive timedependent interconnected tasks this approach is a natural generalization of several standard resource management problems such as scheduling and transportation problems first reactive solutions are considered and defined as control policies of suitably reformulated markov decision processes mdps we argue that this reformulation has several favorable properties such as it has finite state and action spaces it is aperiodic hence all policies are proper and the space of control policies can be safely restricted next approximate dynamic programming adp methods such as fitted qlearning are suggested for computing an efficient control policy in order to compactly maintain the costtogo function two representations are studied hash tables and support vector regression svr particularly nusvrs several additional improvements such as the application of limitedlookahead rollout algorithms in the initial phases action space decomposition task clustering and distributed sampling are investigated too finally experimental results on both benchmark and industryrelated data are presented
