in this paper we explore a class of belief update operators in which the definition of the operator is compositional with respect to the sentence to be added the goal is to provide an update operator that is intuitive in that its definition is based on a recursive decomposition of the update sentences structure and that may be reasonably implemented  in addressing update we first provide a definition phrased in terms of the models of a knowledge base  while this operator satisfies a core group of the benchmark katsunomendelzon update postulates not all of the postulates are satisfied  other katsunomendelzon postulates can be obtained by suitably restricting the syntactic form of the sentence for update as we show  in restricting the syntactic form of the sentence for update we also obtain a hierarchy of update operators with winsletts standard semantics as the most basic interesting approach captured  we subsequently give an algorithm which captures this approach in the general case the algorithm is exponential but with some notunreasonable assumptions we obtain an algorithm that is linear in the size of the knowledge base  hence the resulting approach has much better complexity characteristics than other operators in some situations  we also explore other compositional belief change operators erasure is developed as a dual operator to update we show that a forget operator is definable in terms of update and we give a definition of the compositional revision operator  we obtain that compositional revision under the most natural definition yields the satoh revision operator
