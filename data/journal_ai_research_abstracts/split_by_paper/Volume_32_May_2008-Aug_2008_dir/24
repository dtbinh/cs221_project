n  c a moore and p  prosser 2008 the ultrametric constraint and its application to phylogenetics volume 32 pages 901938

a phylogenetic tree shows the evolutionary relationships among species internal nodes of the tree represent speciation events and leaf nodes correspond to species a goal of phylogenetics is to combine such trees into larger trees called supertrees whilst respecting the relationships in the original trees  a rooted tree exhibits an ultrametric property that is for any three leaves of the tree it must be that one pair has a deeper most recent common ancestor than the other pairs or that all three have the same most recent common ancestor this inspires a constraint programming encoding for rooted trees we present an efficient constraint that enforces the ultrametric property over a symmetric array of constrained integer variables with the inevitable property that the lower bounds of any three variables are mutually supportive we show that this allows an efficient constraintbased solution to the supertree construction problem we demonstrate that the versatility of constraint programming can be exploited to allow solutions to variants of the supertree construction problem
