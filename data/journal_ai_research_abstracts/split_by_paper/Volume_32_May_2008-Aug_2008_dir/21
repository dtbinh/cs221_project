this  paper defines the notion of analogical dissimilarity between four objects with a special focus on objects structured as sequences firstly it studies the case where the four objects have a null analogical dissimilarity ie are in analogical proportion secondly when one of these objects is unknown it gives algorithms to compute it thirdly it tackles the problem of defining  analogical dissimilarity which is a measure of how far four objects are from being in analogical proportion in particular when objects are sequences it gives a definition and an algorithm based on an optimal alignment of the four sequences it gives also learning algorithms ie methods to find the  triple of objects in a learning sample which has the least analogical dissimilarity with a given object two practical experiments are described the first is a classification problem on benchmarks of binary and nominal data the second shows how the generation of sequences by solving analogical equations enables a handwritten character recognition system to rapidly be adapted to a new writer
