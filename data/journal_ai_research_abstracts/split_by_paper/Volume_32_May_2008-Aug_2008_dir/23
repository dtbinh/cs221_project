y  wang n  l zhang and t  chen 2008 latent tree models and approximate inference in bayesian networks volume 32 pages 879900

we propose a novel method for approximate inference in bayesian networks bns the idea is to sample data from a bn learn a latent tree model ltm from the data offline and when online make inference with the ltm instead of the original bn because ltms are treestructured inference takes linear time in the meantime they can represent complex relationship among leaf nodes and hence the approximation accuracy is often good empirical evidence shows that our method can achieve good approximation accuracy at low online computational cost
