ontologies and automated reasoning are the building blocks of the semantic web initiative derivation rules can be included in an ontology to define derived concepts based on base concepts for example rules allow to define the extension of a class or property based on a complex relation between the extensions of the same or other classes and properties on the other hand the inclusion of negative information both in the form of negationasfailure and explicit negative information is also needed to enable various forms of reasoning in this paper we extend rdf graphs with weak and strong negation as well as derivation rules the erdf stable model semantics of the extended framework extended rdf is defined extending rdfs semantics a distinctive feature of our theory which is based on partial logic is that both truth and falsity extensions of properties and classes are considered allowing for truth value gaps our framework supports both closedworld and openworld reasoning through the explicit representation of the particular closedworld assumptions and the erdf ontological categories of total properties and total classes
