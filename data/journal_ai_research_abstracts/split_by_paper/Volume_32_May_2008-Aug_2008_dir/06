m  katz and c  domshlak 2008 new islands of tractability of costoptimal planning volume 32 pages 203288

we study the complexity of costoptimal classical planning over propositional state variables and unaryeffect actions we discover novel problem fragments for which such optimization is tractable and identify certain conditions that differentiate between tractable and intractable problems these results are based on exploiting both structural and syntactic characteristics of planning problems specifically following brafman and domshlak 2003 we relate the complexity of planning and the topology of the causal graph the main results correspond to tractability of costoptimal planning for propositional problems with polytree causal graphs that either have o1bounded indegree or are induced by actions having at most one prevail condition each almost all our tractability results are based on a constructive proof technique that connects between certain tools from planning and tractable constraint optimization and we believe this technique is of interest on its own due to a clear evidence for its robustness
