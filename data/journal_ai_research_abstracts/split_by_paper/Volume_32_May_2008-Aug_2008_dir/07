decisiontheoretic planning is a popular approach to sequential decision making problems because it treats uncertainty in sensing and acting in a principled way in singleagent frameworks like mdps and pomdps planning can be carried out by resorting to qvalue functions an optimal qvalue function q is computed in a recursive manner by dynamic programming and then an optimal policy is extracted from q in this paper we study whether similar qvalue functions can be defined for decentralized pomdp models decpomdps and how policies can be extracted from such value functions we define two forms of the optimal qvalue function for decpomdps one that gives a normative description as the qvalue function of an optimal pure joint policy and another one that is sequentially rational and thus gives a recipe for computation this computation however is infeasible for all but the smallest problems therefore we analyze various approximate qvalue functions that allow for efficient computation we describe how they relate and we prove that they all provide an upper bound to the optimal qvalue function q  finally unifying some previous approaches for solving decpomdps we describe a family of algorithms for extracting policies from such qvalue functions and perform an experimental evaluation on existing test problems including a new firefighting benchmark problem
