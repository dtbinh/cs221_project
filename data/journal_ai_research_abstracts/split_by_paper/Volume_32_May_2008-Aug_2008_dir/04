d  terekhov and j   c beck 2008 a constraint programming approach for solving a queueing control problem volume 32 pages 123167

in a facility with front room and back room operations it is useful to switch workers between the rooms in order to cope with changing customer demand assuming stochastic customer arrival and service times we seek a policy for switching workers such that the expected customer waiting time is minimized while the expected back room staffing is sufficient to perform all work  three novel constraint programming models and several shaving procedures for these models are presented experimental results show that a model based on closedform expressions together with a combination of shaving procedures is the most efficient this model is able to find and prove optimal solutions for many problem instances within a reasonable runtime previously the only available approach was a heuristic algorithm furthermore a hybrid method combining the heuristic and the best constraint programming method is shown to perform as well as the heuristic in terms of solution quality over time while achieving the same performance in terms of proving optimality as the pure constraint programming model this is the first work of which we are aware that solves such queueingbased problems with constraint programming
