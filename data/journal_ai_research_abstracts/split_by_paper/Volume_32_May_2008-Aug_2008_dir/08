in this paper we show that a continuous spectrum of randomisation exists in which most existing tree randomisations are only operating around the two ends of the spectrum  that leaves a huge part of the spectrum largely unexplored we propose a base learner vrtree which generates trees with variablerandomness  vrtrees are able to span from the conventional deterministic trees to the completerandom trees using a probabilistic parameter using vrtrees as the base models we explore the entire spectrum of randomised ensembles together with bagging and random subspace  we discover that the two halves of the spectrum have their distinct characteristics and the understanding of which allows us to propose a new approach in building better decision tree ensembles  we name this approach coalescence which coalesces a number of points in the randomhalf of the spectrum coalescence acts as a committee of experts to cater for unforeseeable conditions presented in training data  coalescence is found to perform better than any single operating point in the spectrum without the need to tune to a specific level of randomness  in our empirical study coalescence ranks top among the benchmarking ensemble methods including random forests random subspace and c5 boosting and only coalescence is significantly better than bagging and maxdiverse ensemble among all the methods in the comparison  although coalescence is not significantly better than random forests we have identified conditions under which one will perform better than the other
