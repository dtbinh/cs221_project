realtime heuristic search is a challenging type of agentcentered search because the agents planning time per action is bounded by a constant independent of problem size a common problem that imposes such restrictions is pathfinding in modern computer games where a large number of units must plan their paths simultaneously over large maps common search algorithms eg a ida d ara ad are inherently not realtime and may lose completeness when a constant bound is imposed on peraction planning time realtime search algorithms retain completeness but frequently produce unacceptably suboptimal solutions in this paper we extend classic and modern realtime search algorithms with an automated mechanism for dynamic depth and subgoal selection the new algorithms remain realtime and complete on large computer game maps they find paths within 7 of optimal while on average expanding roughly a single state per action this is nearly a threefold improvement in suboptimality over the existing stateoftheart algorithms and at the same time a 15fold improvement in the amount of planning per action
