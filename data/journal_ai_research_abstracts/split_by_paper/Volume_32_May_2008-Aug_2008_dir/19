in the efficient social choice problem the goal is to assign values subject to side constraints to a set of variables to maximize the total utility across a population of agents where each agent has private information about its utility function in this paper we model the social choice problem as a distributed constraint optimization problem dcop in which each agent can  communicate with other agents that share an interest in one or more variables whereas existing dcop algorithms can be easily manipulated by an agent either by misreporting private  information or deviating from the algorithm we introduce mdpop the first dcop algorithm that provides a faithful distributed implementation for efficient social choice this provides a concrete example of how the methods of mechanism design can be unified with those of distributed optimization faithfulness ensures that no agent can benefit by unilaterally deviating from any aspect of the protocol neither informationrevelation computation nor communication and whatever the private information of other agents we allow for payments by agents to a central bank which is the only central authoritythat we require to achieve faithfulness we carefully integrate the vickreyclarkegroves vcg mechanism with the dpop algorithm such that  each agent is only asked to perform computation report information and send messages that is in its own best interest determining agent is payment requires solving the social choice problem without agent i here we present a method to reuse computation performed in solving the main problem in a way that is robust against manipulation by the excluded agent experimental results on structured problems show that as much as 87 of the computation required for solving the marginal problems can be avoided by reuse providing very good scalability in the number of agents
