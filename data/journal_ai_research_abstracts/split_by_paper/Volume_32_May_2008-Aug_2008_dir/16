l  bordeaux m  cadoli and t  mancini 2008 a unifying framework for structural properties of csps definitions complexity tractability volume 32 pages 607629

literature on constraint satisfaction exhibits the definition of several structural properties that can be possessed by csps like inconsistency substitutability or interchangeability

because of the computational intractability of all the propertydetection problems by following the csp approach we then determine a number of relaxations which provide sufficient conditions for their tractability in particular we exploit forms of language restrictions and local reasoning
