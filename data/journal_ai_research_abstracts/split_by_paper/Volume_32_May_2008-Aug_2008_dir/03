in this article we consider the issue of optimal control in collaborative multiagent systems with stochastic dynamics  the agents have a joint task in which they have to reach a number of target states  the dynamics of the agents contains additive control and additive noise and the autonomous part factorizes over the agents  full observation of the global state is assumed  the goal is to minimize the accumulated joint cost which consists of integrated instantaneous costs and a joint end cost  the joint end cost expresses the joint task of the agents the instantaneous costs are quadratic in the control and factorize over the agents  the optimal control is given as a weighted linear combination of singleagent to singletarget controls  the singleagent to singletarget controls are expressed in terms of diffusion processes  these controls when not closed form expressions are formulated in terms of path integrals which are calculated approximately by metropolishastings sampling  the weights in the control are interpreted as marginals of a joint distribution over agent to target assignments  the structure of the latter is represented by a graphical model and the marginals are obtained by graphical model inference  exact inference of the graphical model will break down in large systems and so approximate inference methods are needed  we use naive mean field approximation and belief propagation to approximate the optimal control in systems with linear dynamics  we compare the approximate inference methods with the exact solution and we show that they can accurately compute the optimal control  finally we demonstrate the control method in multiagent systems with nonlinear dynamics consisting of up to 80 agents that have to reach an equal number of target states
