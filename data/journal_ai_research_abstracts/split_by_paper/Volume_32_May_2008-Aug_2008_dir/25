we derive optimal strategies for a bidding agent that participates in multiple simultaneous secondprice auctions with perfect substitutes we prove that if everyone else bids locally in a single auction the global bidder should always place nonzero bids in all available auctions provided there are no budget constraints with a budget however the optimal strategy is to bid locally if this budget is equal or less than the valuation furthermore for a wide range of valuation distributions we prove that the problem of finding the optimal bids reduces to two dimensions if all auctions are identical finally we address markets with both sequential and simultaneous auctions nonidentical auctions and the allocative efficiency of the market
