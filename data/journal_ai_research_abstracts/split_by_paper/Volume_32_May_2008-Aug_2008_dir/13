we consider the problem of allocating fairly a set of indivisible goods among agents from the point of view of compact representation and computational complexity we start by assuming that agents have dichotomous preferences expressed by propositional formulae we express efficiency and envyfreeness in a logical setting which reveals unexpected connections to nonmonotonic reasoning then we identify the complexity of determining whether there exists an efficient and envyfree allocation for several notions of efficiency when preferences are represented in a succinct way as well as restrictions of this problem we first study the problem under the assumption that preferences are dichotomous and then in the general case
