while in classical planning the objective is to achieve one of the equally attractive goal states at as low total action cost as possible the objective in deterministic oversubscription planning osp is to achieve an as valuable as possible subset of goals within a fixed allowance of the total action cost although numerous applications in various fields share the latter objective no substantial algorithmic advances have been made in deterministic osp tracing the key sources of progress in classical planning we identify a severe lack of effective domainindependent approximations for osp 

with our focus here on optimal planning our goal is to bridge this gap two classes of approximation techniques have been found especially useful in the context of optimal classical planning those based on statespace  abstractions and those based on logical landmarks for goal reachability the question we  study here is whether some similarinspirit yet possibly mathematically  different approximation techniques can be developed for osp in the context of abstractions we define the notion of additive abstractions for osp study the complexity of deriving effective abstractions from a rich space of hypotheses and reveal some  substantial empirically relevant islands of tractability in the context of  landmarks we show how standard goalreachability landmarks of certain classical planning tasks  can be compiled into the osp task of interest resulting in an equivalent osp task with a lower cost allowance and thus with a smaller search space  our empirical evaluation confirms the effectiveness of the proposed techniques and opens a wide gate for further developments in oversubscription planning
