we aim to reduce the burden of programming and deploying autonomous systems to work in concert with people in timecritical domains such as military field operations and disaster response deployment plans for these operations are frequently negotiated onthefly by teams of human planners a human operator then translates the agreedupon plan into machine instructions for the robots we present an algorithm that reduces this translation burden by inferring the final plan from a processed form of the human teams planning conversation our hybrid approach combines probabilistic generative modeling with logical plan validation used to compute a highly structured prior over possible plans enabling us to overcome the challenge of performing inference over a large solution space with only a small amount of noisy data from the team planning session we validate the algorithm through human subject experimentations and show that it is able to infer a human teams final plan with 86 accuracy on average we also describe a robot demonstration in which two people plan and execute a firstresponse collaborative task with a pr2 robot to the best of our knowledge this is the first work to integrate a logical planning technique within a generative model to perform plan inference
