this article proposes a solution to the problem of obtaining plausibility information which is necessary to perform belief revision given a sequence of revisions together with their results derive a possible initial order that has generated them this is different from the usual assumption of starting from an allequal initial order and modifying it by a sequence of revisions four semantics for iterated revision are considered natural restrained lexicographic and reinforcement for each a necessary and sufficient condition to the existence of an order generating a given history of revisions and results is proved complexity is proved conp complete in all cases but one reinforcement revision with unbounded sequence length
