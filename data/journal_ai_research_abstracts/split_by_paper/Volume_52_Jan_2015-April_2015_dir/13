although manipulation and bribery have been extensively studied under weighted voting there has been almost no work done on election control under weighted voting this is unfortunate since weighted voting appears in many important natural settings in this paper we study the complexity of controlling the outcome of weighted elections through adding and deleting voters we obtain polynomialtime algorithms npcompleteness results and for many npcomplete cases approximation algorithms in particular for scoring rules we completely characterize the complexity of weighted voter control our work shows that for quite a few important cases either polynomialtime exact algorithms or polynomialtime approximation algorithms exist
