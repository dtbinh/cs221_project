we present an approach to simultaneously reasoning about a video clip and an entire naturallanguage sentence the compositional nature of language is exploited to construct models which represent the meanings of entire sentences composed out of the meanings of the words in those sentences mediated by a grammar that encodes the predicateargument relations we demonstrate that these models faithfully represent the meanings of sentences and are sensitive to how the roles played by participants nouns their characteristics adjectives the actions performed verbs the manner of such actions adverbs and changing spatial relations between participants prepositions affect the meaning of a sentence and how it is grounded in video we exploit this methodology in three ways in the first a video clip along with a sentence are taken as input and the participants in the event described by the sentence are highlighted even when the clip depicts multiple similar simultaneous events in the second a video clip is taken as input without a sentence and a sentence is generated that describes an event in that clip in the third a corpus of video clips is paired with sentences which describe some of the events in those clips and the meanings of the words in those sentences are learned we learn these meanings without needing to specify which attribute of the video clips each word in a given sentence refers to the learned meaning representations are shown to be intelligible to humans
