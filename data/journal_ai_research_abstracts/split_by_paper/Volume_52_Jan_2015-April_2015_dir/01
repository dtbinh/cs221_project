coherent reasoning under uncertainty can be represented in a very general manner by coherent sets of desirable gambles in a context that does not allow for indecision this leads to an approach that is mathematically equivalent to working with coherent conditional probabilities if we do allow for indecision this leads to a more general foundation for coherent impreciseprobabilistic inference in this framework and for a given finite category set coherent predictive inference under exchangeability can be represented using bernstein coherent cones of multivariate polynomials on the simplex generated by this category set this is a powerful generalisation of de finettis representation theorem allowing for both imprecision and indecision

we define an inference system as a map that associates a bernstein coherent cone of polynomials with every finite category set many inference principles encountered in the literature can then be interpreted and represented mathematically as restrictions on such maps we discuss as particular examples two important inference principles representation insensitivitya strengthened version of walleys representation invarianceand specificity we show that there is an infinity of inference systems that satisfy these two principles amongst which we discuss in particular the skeptically cautious inference system the inference systems corresponding to a modified version of walley and bernards imprecise dirichlet multinomial models idmm the skeptical idmm inference systems and the haldane inference system we also prove that the latter produces the same posterior inferences as would be obtained using haldanes improper prior implying that there is an infinity of proper priors that produce the same coherent posterior inferences as haldanes improper one finally we impose an additional inference principle that allows us to characterise uniquely the immediate predictions for the idmm inference systems
