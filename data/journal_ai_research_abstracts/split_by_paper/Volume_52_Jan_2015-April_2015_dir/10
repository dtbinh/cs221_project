a discourse typically involves numerous entities but few are mentioned more than once distinguishing those that die out after just one mention singleton from those that lead longer lives coreferent would dramatically simplify the hypothesis space for coreference resolution models leading to increased performance to realize these gains we build a classifier for predicting the singletoncoreferent distinction the models feature representations synthesize linguistic insights about the factors affecting discourse entity lifespans especially negation modality and attitude predication with existing results about the benefits of surface partofspeech and ngrambased features for coreference resolution the model is effective in its own right and the feature representations help to identify the anchor phrases in bridging anaphora as well furthermore incorporating the model into two very different stateoftheart coreference resolution systems one rulebased and the other learningbased yields significant performance improvements
