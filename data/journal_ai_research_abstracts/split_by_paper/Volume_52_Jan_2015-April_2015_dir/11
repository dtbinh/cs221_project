the performance of trust models highly depend on the characteristics of the environments where they are applied thus it becomes challenging to choose a suitable trust model for a given emarketplace environment especially when ground truth about the agent buyer and seller behavior is unknown called unknown environment we propose a casebased reasoning framework to choose suitable trust models for unknown environments based on the intuition that if a trust model performs well in one environment it will do so in another similar environment firstly we build a case base with a number of simulated environments with known ground truth along with the trust models most suitable for each of them given an unknown environment casebased retrieval algorithms retrieve the most similar cases and the trust model of the most similar cases is chosen as the most suitable model for the unknown environment evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of our framework in choosing suitable trust models for different emarketplace environments
