multicontext systems mcss are a formalism for systems consisting of knowledge bases possibly heterogeneous and nonmonotonic that are interlinked via bridge rules where the global system semantics emerges from the local semantics of the knowledge bases also called contexts in an equilibrium while mcss and related formalisms are inherently targeted for distributed set tings no truly distributed algorithms for their evaluation were available we address this short coming and present a suite of such algorithms which includes a basic algorithm dmcs an ad vanced version dmcsopt that exploits topologybased optimizations and a streaming algorithm dmcsstreaming that computes equilibria in packages of bounded size the algorithms be have quite differently in several respects as experienced in thorough experimental evaluation of a system prototype from the experimental results we derive a guideline for choosing the appropriate algorithm and running mode in particular situations determined by the parameter settings
