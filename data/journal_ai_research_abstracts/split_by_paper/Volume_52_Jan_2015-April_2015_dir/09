in this article we propose new algorithms for multiobjective coordination graphs mocogs key to the efficiency of these algorithms is that they compute a convex coverage set ccs instead of a pareto coverage set pcs not only is a ccs a sufficient solution set for a large class of problems it also has important characteristics that facilitate more efficient solutions we propose two main algorithms for computing a ccs in mocogs convex multiobjective variable elimination cmove computes a ccs by performing a series of agent eliminations which can be seen as solving a series of local multiobjective subproblems variable elimination linear support vels iteratively identifies the single weight vector w that can lead to the maximal possible improvement on a partial ccs and calls variable elimination to solve a scalarized instance of the problem for w vels is faster than cmove for small and medium numbers of objectives and can compute an 949approximate ccs in a fraction of the runtime in addition we propose variants of these methods that employ andor tree search instead of variable elimination to achieve memory efficiency we analyze the runtime and space complexities of these methods prove their correctness and compare them empirically against a naive baseline and an existing pcs method both in terms of memoryusage and runtime  our results show that by focusing on the ccs these methods achieve much better scalability in the number of agents than the current state of the art
