one approach to conserving endangered species is to purchase and protect a set of land parcels in a way that maximizes the expected future population spread unfortunately an ideal set of parcels may have a cost that is beyond the immediate budget constraints and must thus be purchased incrementally this raises the challenge of deciding how to schedule the parcel purchases in a way that maximizes the flexibility of budget usage while keeping population spread loss in control in this paper we introduce a formulation of this scheduling problem that does not rely on knowing the future budgets of an organization in particular we consider scheduling purchases in a way that achieves a population spread no less than desired but delays purchases as long as possible such schedules offer conservation planners maximum flexibility and use available budgets in the most efficient way we develop the problem formally as a stochastic optimization problem over a network cascade model describing a commonly used model of population spread our solution approach is based on reducing the stochastic problem to a novel variant of the directed steiner tree problem which we call the setweighted directed steiner graph problem we show that this problem is computationally hard motivating the development of a primaldual algorithm for the problem that computes both a feasible solution and a bound on the quality of an optimal solution we evaluate the approach on both real and synthetic conservation data with a standard population spread model the algorithm is shown to produce near optimal results and is much more scalable than more generic offtheshelf optimizers finally we evaluate a variant of the algorithm to explore the tradeoffs between budget savings and population growth
