finding satisfying assignments for the variables involved in a set of constraints can be cast as a bounded model generation problem search for bounded models of a theory in some logic the stateoftheart approach for bounded model generation for rich knowledge representation languages like asp and fo and a csp modeling language such as zinc is groundandsolve reduce the theory to a ground or propositional one and apply a search algorithm to the resulting theory

an important bottleneck is the blowup of the size of the theory caused by the grounding phase lazily grounding the theory during search is a way to overcome this bottleneck we present a theoretical framework and an implementation in the context of the fo knowledge representation language instead of grounding all parts of a theory justifications are derived for some parts of it given a partial assignment for the grounded part of the theory and valid justifications for the formulas of the nongrounded part the justifications provide a recipe to construct a complete assignment that satisfies the nongrounded part when a justification for a particular formula becomes invalid during search a new one is derived if that fails the formula is split in a part to be grounded and a part that can be justified experimental results illustrate the power and generality of this approach
