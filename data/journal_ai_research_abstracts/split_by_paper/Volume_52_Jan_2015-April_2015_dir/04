not all npcomplete problems share the same practical hardness with respect to exact computation  whereas some npcomplete problems are amenable to efficient computational methods others are yet to show any such sign it becomes a major challenge to develop a theoretical framework that is more finegrained than the theory of npcompleteness and that can explain the distinction between the exact complexities of various npcomplete problems this distinction is highly relevant for constraint satisfaction problems under natural restrictions where various shades of hardness can be observed in practice
