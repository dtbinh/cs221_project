the agm framework is the benchmark approach in belief change since the framework assumes an underlying logic containing classical propositional logic it can not be applied to systems with a logic weaker than propositional logic  to remedy this limitation several researchers have studied agmstyle contraction and revision under the horn fragment of propositional logic ie horn logic  in this paper we contribute to this line of research by investigating the horn version of the agm entrenchmentbased contraction  the study is challenging as the construction of entrenchmentbased contraction refers to arbitrary disjunctions which are not expressible under horn logic  in order to adapt the construction to horn logic we make use of a horn approximation technique called horn strengthening we provide a representation theorem for the newly constructed contraction which we refer to as entrenchmentbased horn contraction  ideally contractions defined under horn logic ie horn contractions should be as rational as agm contraction  we propose the notion of horn equivalence which intuitively captures the equivalence between horn contraction and agm contraction  we show that under this notion entrenchmentbased horn contraction is equivalent to a restricted form of entrenchmentbased contraction
