artifact systems are a novel paradigm for specifying and implementing business processes described in terms of interacting modules called artifacts artifacts consist of data and lifecycles accounting respectively for the relational structure of the artifacts states and their possible evolutions over time in this paper we put forward artifactcentric multiagent systems a novel formalisation of artifact systems in the context of multiagent systems operating on them differently from the usual processbased models of services we give a semantics that explicitly accounts for the data structures on which artifact systems are defined
