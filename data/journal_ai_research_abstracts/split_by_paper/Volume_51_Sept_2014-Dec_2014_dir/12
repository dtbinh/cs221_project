s  cai c  luo and k  su 2014 scoring functions based on second level score for ksat with long clauses volume 51 pages 413441

it is widely acknowledged that stochastic local search sls algorithms can efficiently find models for satisfiable instances of the satisfiability sat problem especially for random ksat instances however compared to random 3sat instances where sls algorithms have shown great success random ksat instances with long clauses remain very difficult recently the notion of second level score denoted as score2 was proposed for improving sls algorithms on longclause sat instances and was first used in the powerful ccasat solver as a tie breaker
