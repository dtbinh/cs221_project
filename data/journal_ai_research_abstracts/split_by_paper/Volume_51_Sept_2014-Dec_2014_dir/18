knowledge discovery in databases is a complex process that involves many different data processing and learning operators todays knowledge discovery support systems can contain several hundred operators  a major challenge is to assist the user in designing workflows which are not only valid but also  ideally  optimize some performance measure associated with the user goal  in this paper we present such a system the system relies on a metamining module which analyses past data mining experiments and extracts metamining models which associate dataset characteristics with workflow descriptors in view of workflow performance optimization the metamining model is used within a data mining workflow planner to guide the planner during the workflow planning we learn the metamining models  using a similarity learning approach and extract the workflow descriptors by mining the workflows for generalized relational patterns accounting also for domain knowledge provided by a data mining ontology  we evaluate the quality of the data mining workflows that the system produces on a collection of real world datasets coming from biology and show that it produces workflows that are significantly better than alternative methods that can only do workflow selection and not planning
