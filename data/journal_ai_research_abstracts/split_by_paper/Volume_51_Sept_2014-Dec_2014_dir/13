multiagent pathfinding is a relevant problem in a wide range of domains for example in robotics and video games research formally the problem considers a graph consisting of vertices and edges and a set of agents occupying vertices an agent can only move to an unoccupied neighbouring vertex and the problem of finding the minimal sequence of moves to transfer each agent from its start location to its destination is an nphard problem

in our experiments we compare our approach with the push and swap mapp and bibox algorithms the latter algorithm is restricted to a smaller class of instances as it requires biconnected graphs but can nevertheless be considered state of the art due to its strong performance our experiments show that push and swap suffers from incompleteness mapp is generally not competitive with push and rotate and bibox is better than push and rotate on randomly generated biconnected instances while push and rotate performs better on grids
