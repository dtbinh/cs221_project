r  nissim and r  brafman 2014 distributed heuristic forward search for multiagent planning volume 51 pages 293332

this paper deals with the problem of classical planning for multiple cooperative agents who have private information about their local state and capabilities they do not want to reveal two main approaches have recently been proposed to solve this type of problem  one is based on reduction to distributed constraint satisfaction and the other on partialorder planning techniques in classical singleagent planning constraintbased and partialorder planning techniques are currently dominated by heuristic forward search the question arises whether it is possible to formulate a distributed heuristic forward search algorithm for privacypreserving classical multiagent planning our work provides a positive answer to this question in the form of a general approach to distributed statespace search in which each agent performs only the part of the state expansion relevant to it the resulting algorithms are simple and efficient  outperforming previous algorithms by orders of magnitude  while offering similar flexibility to that of forwardsearch algorithms for singleagent planning furthermore one particular variant of our general approach yields a distributed version of the a algorithm that is the first costoptimal distributed algorithm for privacypreserving planning
