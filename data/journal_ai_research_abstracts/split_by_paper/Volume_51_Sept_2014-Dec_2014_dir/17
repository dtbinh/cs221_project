recently fair division theory has emerged as a promising approach for allocation of multiple computational resources among agents while in reality agents are not all present in the system simultaneously previous work has studied static settings where all relevant information is known upfront our goal is to better understand the dynamic setting on the conceptual level we develop a dynamic model of fair division and propose desirable axiomatic properties for dynamic resource allocation mechanisms on the technical level we construct two novel mechanisms that provably satisfy some of these properties and analyze their performance using real data we believe that our work informs the design of superior multiagent systems and at the same time expands the scope of fair division theory by initiating the study of dynamic and fair resource allocation mechanisms
