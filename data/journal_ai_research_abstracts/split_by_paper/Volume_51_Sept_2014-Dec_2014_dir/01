r  micalizio and p  torasso 2014 cooperative monitoring to diagnose multiagent plans volume 51 pages 170

diagnosing the execution of a multiagent plan map means identifying and explaining action failures ie actions that did not reach their expected effects current approaches to map diagnosis are substantially centralized and assume that action failures are independent of each other

an experimental analysis demonstrates that the cwcm methodology together with the proposed diagnostic inferences are effective in identifying and explaining action failures even in scenarios where the system observability is significantly reduced
