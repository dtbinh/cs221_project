p  kissmann and j  hoffmann 2014 bdd ordering heuristics for classical planning volume 51 pages 779804

symbolic search using binary decision diagrams bdds can often save large amounts of memory due to its concise representation of state sets a decisive factor for this methods success is the chosen variable ordering generally speaking it is plausible that dependent variables should be brought close together in order to reduce bdd sizes in planning variable dependencies are typically captured by means of causal graphs and in preceding work these were taken as the basis for finding bdd variable orderings starting from the observation that the two concepts of dependency are actually quite different we introduce a framework for assessing the strength of variable ordering heuristics in subclasses of planning it turns out that even for extremely simple planning tasks causal graph based variable orders may be exponentially worse than optimal
