m  winikoff and s  cranefield 2014 on the testability of bdi agent systems volume 51 pages 71131

before deploying a software system we need to assure ourselves and stakeholders that the system will behave correctly this assurance is usually done by testing the system however it is intuitively obvious that adaptive systems including agentbased systems  can exhibit complex behaviour and are thus harder to test in this paper we examine this obvious intuition in the case of beliefdesireintention bdi agents  we analyse the size of the behaviour space of bdi agents  and show that although the intuition is correct the factors that influence the size are not what we expected them to be specifically we found that the introduction of failure handling had a much larger effect on the size of the behaviour space than we expected we also discuss the implications of these findings on the testability of bdi agents
