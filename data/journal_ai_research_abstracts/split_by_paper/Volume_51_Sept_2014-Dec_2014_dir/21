c  r shelton and g  ciardo 2014 tutorial on structured continuoustime markov processes volume 51 pages 725778

a continuoustime markov process ctmp is a collection of variables indexed by a continuous quantity time it obeys the markov property that the distribution over a future variable is independent of past variables given the state at the present time we introduce continuoustime markov process representations and algorithms for filtering smoothing expected sufficient statistics calculations and model estimation assuming no prior knowledge of continuoustime processes but some basic knowledge of probability and statistics we begin by describing flat or unstructured markov processes and then move to structured markov processes those arising from state spaces consisting of assignments to variables including kronecker decisiondiagram and continuoustime bayesian network representations we provide the first connection between decisiondiagrams and continuoustime bayesian networks
