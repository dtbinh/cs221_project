a  lopezortiz s  angelopoulos and a  m hamel 2014 optimal scheduling of contract algorithms for anytime problemsolving volume 51 pages 533554

a contract algorithm is an algorithm which is given as part of the input a specified amount of allowable computation time the algorithm must then complete its execution within the allotted time an interruptible algorithm in contrast can be interrupted at an arbitrary point in time at which point it must report its currently best solution it is known that contract algorithms can simulate interruptible algorithms using  iterative deepening techniques this simulation is done at a penalty  in the performance of the solution as measured by the socalled acceleration ratio

lastly we show how to evaluate the average acceleration ratio of the class of exponential strategies in the setting of n problem instances and m parallel processors this is a broad class of schedules that tend to be either optimal or nearoptimal for several variants of the basic problem
