k  woodsend and m  lapata 2014 text rewriting improves semantic role labeling volume 51 pages 133164

largescale annotated corpora are a prerequisite to developing highperformance nlp systems such corpora are expensive to produce limited in size often demanding linguistic expertise in this paper we use text rewriting as a means of increasing the amount of labeled data available for model training our method uses automatically extracted rewrite rules from comparable corpora and bitexts to generate multiple versions of sentences annotated with gold standard labels we apply this idea to semantic role labeling and show that a model trained on rewritten data outperforms the state of the art on the conll2009 benchmark dataset
