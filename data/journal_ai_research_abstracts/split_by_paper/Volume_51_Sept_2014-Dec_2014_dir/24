developing scalable solution algorithms is one of the central problems in computational game theory we present an iterative algorithm for computing an exact nash equilibrium for twoplayer zerosum extensiveform games with imperfect information our approach combines two key elements 1 the compact sequenceform representation of extensiveform games and 2 the algorithmic framework of doubleoracle methods the main idea of our algorithm is to restrict the game by allowing the players to play only selected sequences of available actions after solving the restricted game new sequences are added by finding best responses to the current solution using fast algorithms 

our main contributions include 1 a generic sequenceform doubleoracle algorithm for solving zerosum extensiveform games 2 fast methods for maintaining a valid restricted game model when adding new sequences 3 a search algorithm and pruning methods for computing bestresponse sequences 4 theoretical guarantees about the convergence of the algorithm to a nash equilibrium 5 experimental analysis of our algorithm on several games including an approximate version of the algorithm
