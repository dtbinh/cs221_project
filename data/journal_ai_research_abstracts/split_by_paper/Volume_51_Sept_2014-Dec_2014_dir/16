the workflow satisfiability problem wsp is a problem of practical interest that arises whenever tasks need to be performed by authorized users subject to constraints defined by business rules  we are required to decide whether there exists a plan  an assignment of tasks to authorized users  such that all constraints are satisfied  it is natural to see the wsp as a subclass of the constraint satisfaction problem csp in which the variables are tasks and the domain is the set of users  what makes the wsp distinctive is that the number of tasks is usually very small compared to the number of users so it is appropriate to ask for which constraint languages the wsp is fixedparameter tractable fpt parameterized by the number of tasks

this novel approach to the wsp using techniques from csp has enabled us to  design a generic algorithm which is fpt for several families of workflow constraints considered in the literature furthermore we prove that the union of fpt languages remains fpt if they satisfy a simple compatibility condition  lastly we identify a new fpt constraint language userindependent constraints that includes many of the constraints of interest in business processing systems   we demonstrate that our generic algorithm has provably optimal running time o2klog k for this language where k is the number of tasks
