g  stefanoni b  motik m  kroetzsch and s  rudolph 2014 the complexity of answering conjunctive and navigational queries over owl 2 el knowledge bases volume 51 pages 645705

owl 2 el is a popular ontology language that supports role inclusionsthat is axioms that capture compositional properties of roles role inclusions closely correspond to contextfree grammars which was used to show that answering conjunctive queries cqs over owl 2 el knowledge bases with unrestricted role inclusions is undecidable however owl 2 el inherits from owl 2 dl the syntactic regularity restriction on role inclusions which ensures that role chains implying a particular role can be described using a finite automaton fa this is sufficient to ensure decidability of cq answering however the fas can be worstcase exponential in size so the known approaches do not provide a tight upper complexity bound

in this paper we solve this open problem and show that answering cqs over owl 2 el knowledge bases is pspacecomplete in combined complexity ie the complexity measured in the total size of the input to this end we use a novel encoding of regular role inclusions using boundedstack pushdown automatathat is fas extended with a stack of bounded size apart from theoretical interest our encoding can be used in practical tableau algorithms to avoid the exponential blowup due to role inclusions in addition we sharpen the lower complexity bound and show that the problem is pspacehard even if we consider only role inclusions as part of the input ie the query and all other parts of the knowledge base are fixed finally we turn our attention to navigational queries over owl 2 el knowledge bases and we show that answering positive conversefree conjunctive graph xpath queries is pspacecomplete as well this is interesting since allowing the converse operator in queries is known to make the problem exptimehard thus in this paper we present several important contributions to the landscape of the complexity of answering expressive queries over description logic knowledge bases
