bound propagation is an important artificial intelligence technique used in constraint programming tools to deal with numerical constraints it is typically embedded within a search procedure branch and prune and used at every node of the search tree to narrow down the search space so it is critical that it be fast the procedure invokes constraint propagators until a common fixpoint is reached but the known algorithms for this have a pseudopolynomial worstcase time complexity they are fast indeed when the variables have a small numerical range but they have the wellknown problem of being prohibitively slow when these ranges are large an important question is therefore whether stronglypolynomial algorithms exist that compute the common bound consistent fixpoint of a set of constraints this paper answers this question in particular we show that this fixpoint computation is in fact npcomplete even when restricted to binary linear constraints
