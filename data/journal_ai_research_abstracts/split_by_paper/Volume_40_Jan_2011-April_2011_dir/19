f  wu j  madhavan and a  halevy 2011 identifying aspects for websearch queries volume 40 pages 677700

many websearch queries serve as the beginning of an exploration of an unknown space of information rather than looking for a specific web page to answer such queries effec tively the search engine should attempt to organize the space of relevant information in a way that facilitates exploration

aspector combines two sources of information to compute aspects we discover candidate aspects by analyzing query logs and cluster them to eliminate redundancies we then use a masscollaboration knowledge base eg wikipedia to compute candidate aspects for queries that occur less frequently and to group together aspects that are likely to be semantically related we present a user study that indicates that the aspects we compute are rated favorably against three competing alternatives  related searches proposed by google cluster labels assigned by the clusty search engine and navigational searches proposed by bing
