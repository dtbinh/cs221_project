h  papadopoulos v  vovk and a  gammerman 2011 regression conformal prediction with nearest neighbours volume 40 pages 815840

in this paper we apply conformal prediction cp to the knearest neighbours regression knnr algorithm and propose ways of extending the typical nonconformity measure used for regression so far unlike traditional regression methods which produce point predictions conformal predictors output predictive regions that satisfy a given confidence level the regions produced by any conformal predictor are automatically valid however their tightness and therefore usefulness depends on the nonconformity measure used by each cp in effect a nonconformity measure evaluates how strange a given example is compared to a set of other examples based on some traditional machine learning algorithm we define six novel nonconformity measures based on the knearest neighbours regression algorithm and develop the corresponding cps following both the original transductive and the inductive cp approaches a comparison of the predictive regions produced by our measures with those of the typical regression measure suggests that a major improvement in terms of predictive region tightness is achieved by the new measures
