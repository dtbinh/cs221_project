weighted voting is a classic model of cooperation among agents in decisionmaking domains in such games each player has a weight and a coalition of players wins the game if its total weight meets or exceeds a given quota a players power in such games is usually not directly proportional to his weight and is measured by a power index the most prominent among which are the shapleyshubik index and the banzhaf indexin this paper we investigate by how much a player can change his power as measured by the shapleyshubik index or the banzhaf index by means of a falsename manipulation ie splitting his weight among two or more identities for both indices we provide upper and lower bounds on the effect of weightsplitting we then show that checking whether a beneficial split exists is nphard and discuss efficient algorithms for restricted cases of this problem as well as randomized algorithms for the general case we also provide an experimental evaluation of these algorithms finally we examine related forms of manipulative behavior such as annexation where a player subsumes other players or merging where several players unite into one we characterize the computational complexity of such manipulations and provide limits on their effects for the banzhaf index we describe a new paradox which we term the annexation nonmonotonicity paradox
