x  tannier and p  muller 2011 evaluating temporal graphs built from texts via transitive reduction volume 40 pages 375413

temporal information has been the focus of recent attention in information extraction leading to some standardization effort in particular for the task of relating events in a text this task raises the problem of comparing two annotations of a given text because relations between events in a story are intrinsically interdependent and cannot be evaluated separately  a proper evaluation measure is also crucial in the context of a machine learning approach to the problem  finding a common comparison referent at the text level is not obvious and we argue here in favor of a shift from eventbased measures to measures on a unique textual object a minimal underlying temporal graph or more formally the transitive reduction of the graph of relations between event boundaries we support it by an  investigation of its properties on synthetic data and on a wellknow  temporal corpus
