y  wang c  hang and m  p singh 2011 a probabilistic approach for maintaining trust based on evidence volume 40 pages 221267

leading agentbased trust models address two important needs  first they show how an agent may estimate the trustworthiness of another agent based on prior interactions  second they show how agents may share their knowledge in order to cooperatively assess the trustworthiness of others  however in reallife settings information relevant to trust is usually obtained piecemeal not all at once  unfortunately the problem of maintaining trust has drawn little attention  existing approaches handle trust updates in a heuristic not a principled manner

this paper builds on a formal model that considers probability and certainty as two dimensions of trust  it proposes a mechanism using which an agent can update the amount of trust it places in other agents on an ongoing basis  this paper shows via simulation that the proposed approach a provides accurate estimates of the trustworthiness of agents that change behavior frequently and b captures the dynamic behavior of the agents  this paper includes an evaluation based on a real dataset drawn from amazon marketplace a leading ecommerce site
