a  rahman and v  ng 2011 narrowing the modeling gap a clusterranking approach to coreference resolution volume 40 pages 469521

traditional learningbased coreference resolvers operate by training the mentionpair model for determining whether two mentions are coreferent or not though conceptually simple and easy to understand the mentionpair model is linguistically rather unappealing and lags far behind the heuristicbased coreference models proposed in the prestatistical nlp era in terms of sophistication two independent lines of recent research have attempted to improve the mentionpair model one by acquiring the mentionranking model to rank preceding mentions for a given anaphor and the other by training the entitymention model to determine whether a preceding cluster is coreferent with a given mention we propose a clusterranking approach to coreference resolution which combines the strengths of the mentionranking model and the entitymention model and is therefore theoretically more appealing than both of these models in addition we seek to improve cluster rankers via two extensions 1 lexicalization and 2 incorporating knowledge of anaphoricity by jointly modeling anaphoricity determination and coreference resolution experimental results on the ace data sets demonstrate the superior performance of cluster rankers to competing approaches as well as the effectiveness of our two extensions
