 we offer a new understanding of some aspects of practical satsolvers that are based on dpll with unitclause propagation clauselearning and restarts we do so by analyzing a concrete algorithm which we claim is faithful to what practical solvers do in particular before making any new decision or restart the solver repeatedly applies the unitresolution rule until saturation and leaves no component to the mercy of nondeterminism except for some internal randomness we prove the perhaps surprising fact that although the solver is not explicitly designed for it with high probability it ends up behaving as widthk resolution after no more than on2k2 conflicts and restarts where n is the number of variables in other words widthk resolution can be thought of as on2k2 restarts of the unitresolution rule with learning
