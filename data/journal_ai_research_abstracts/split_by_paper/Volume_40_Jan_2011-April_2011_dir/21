previous studies have demonstrated that encoding a bayesian network into a sat formula and then performing weighted model counting using a backtracking search algorithm can be an effective method for exact inference  in this paper we present techniques for improving this approach for bayesian networks with noisyor and noisymax relationstwo relations that are widely used in practice as they can dramatically reduce the number of probabilities one needs to specify in particular we present two sat encodings for noisyor and two encodings for noisymax that exploit the structure or semantics of the relations to improve both time and space efficiency and we prove the correctness of the encodings we experimentally evaluated our techniques on largescale real and randomly generated bayesian networks  on these benchmarks our techniques gave speedups of up to two orders of magnitude over the best previous approaches for networks with noisyormax relations and scaled up to larger networks as well our techniques extend the weighted model counting approach for exact inference to networks that were previously intractable for the approach
