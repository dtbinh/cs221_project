in 1992 bartholdi tovey and trick opened the study of control attacks on electionsattempts to improve the election outcome by such actions as addingdeleting candidates or voters  that work has led to many results on how algorithms can be used to find attacks on elections and how complexitytheoretic hardness results can be used as shields against attacks however all the work in this line has assumed that the attacker employs just a single type of attack  in this paper we model and study the case in which the attacker launches a multipronged ie multimode attack  we do so to more realistically capture the richness of reallife settings for example an attacker might simultaneously try to suppress some voters attract new voters into the election and introduce a spoiler candidate our model provides a unified framework for such varied attacks  by constructing polynomialtime multiprong attack algorithms we prove that for various election systems even such concerted flexible attacks can be perfectly planned in deterministic polynomial time
