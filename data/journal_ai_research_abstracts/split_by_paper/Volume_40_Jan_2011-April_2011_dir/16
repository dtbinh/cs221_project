in large systems it is important for agents to learn to act effectively but sophisticated multiagent learning algorithms generally do not scale  an alternative approach is to find restricted classes of games where simple efficient algorithms converge  it is shown that stage learning efficiently converges to nash equilibria in large anonymous games if bestreply dynamics converge  two features are identified that improve convergence first rather than making learning more difficult more agents are actually beneficial in many settings  second providing agents with statistical information about the behavior of others can significantly reduce the number of observations needed
