a  hunter and j  p delgrande 2011 iterated belief change due to actions and observations volume 40 pages 269304

in action domains where agents may have erroneous beliefs reasoning about the effects of actions involves reasoning about belief change  in this paper we use a transition system approach to reason about the evolution of an agents beliefs as actions are executed  some  actions cause an agent to perform belief revision while others cause an agent to perform belief update but the interaction between revision and update can be nonelementary  we present a set of rationality properties describing the interaction between revision and update and we introduce a new class of belief change operators for reasoning about alternating sequences of revisions and updates  our belief change operators can be characterized in terms of a natural shifting operation on total preorderings over interpretations  we compare our approach with related work on iterated belief change due to action and we conclude with some directions for future research
