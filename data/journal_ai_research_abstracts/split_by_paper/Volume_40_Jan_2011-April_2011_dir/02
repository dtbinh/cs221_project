y  zhou and y  zhang 2011 a logical study of partial entailment volume 40 pages 2556

we introduce a novel logical notionpartial entailmentto propositional logic in contrast with classical entailment that a formula p partially entails another formula q with respect to a background formula set gamma intuitively means that under the circumstance of gamma if p is true then some part of q will also be true we distinguish three different kinds of partial entailments and formalize them by using an extended notion of prime implicant we study their semantic properties which show that surprisingly partial entailments fail for many simple inference rules then we study the related computational properties which indicate that partial entailments are relatively difficult to be computed finally we consider a potential application of partial entailments in reasoning about rational agents
