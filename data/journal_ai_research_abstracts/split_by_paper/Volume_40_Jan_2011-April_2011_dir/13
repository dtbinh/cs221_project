we present a case study of artificial intelligence techniques applied to the control of production printing equipment  like many other realworld applications this complex domain requires highspeed autonomous decisionmaking and robust continual operation  to our knowledge this work represents the first successful industrial application of embedded domainindependent temporal planning  our system handles execution failures and multiobjective preferences  at its heart is an online algorithm that combines techniques from statespace planning and partialorder scheduling  we suggest that this general architecture may prove useful in other applications as more intelligent systems operate in continual online settings  our system has been used to drive several commercial prototypes and has enabled a new product architecture for our industrial partner  when compared with stateoftheart offline planners our system is hundreds of times faster and often finds better plans  our experience demonstrates that domainindependent ai planning based on heuristic search can flexibly handle time resources replanning and multiple objectives in a highspeed practical application without requiring handcoded control knowledge
