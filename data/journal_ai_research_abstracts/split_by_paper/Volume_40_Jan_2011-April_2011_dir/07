in this paper we propose a comprehensive study of secondorder consistencies ie consistencies identifying inconsistent pairs of values for constraint satisfaction we build a full picture of the relationships existing between four basic secondorder consistencies namely path consistency pc 3consistency 3c dual consistency dc and 2singleton arc consistency 2sac as well as their conservative and strong variants interestingly dual consistency is an original property that can be established by using the outcome of the enforcement of generalized arc consistency gac which makes it rather easy to obtain since constraint solvers typically maintain gac during search  on binary constraint  networks dc is equivalent to pc but its restriction to existing constraints called conservative dual consistency cdc is strictly stronger than  traditional conservative consistencies derived from path consistency namely partial path consistency ppc and conservative path consistency cpc  after introducing a general algorithm to enforce strong cdc we present the results of an experimentation over a wide range of benchmarks that demonstrate the interest of conservative dual consistency  in particular we show that enforcing cdc before search clearly improves the performance of mac the algorithm that maintains gac during search on several binary and nonbinary structured problems
