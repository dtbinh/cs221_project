a  cimatti a  griggio and r  sebastiani 2011 computing small unsatisfiable cores in satisfiability modulo theories volume 40 pages 701728

the problem of finding small unsatisfiable cores for sat formulas has  recently received a lot of interest mostly for its applications in formal verification  however propositional logic is often not expressive  enough for representing many interesting verification problems which can be more naturally addressed in the framework of satisfiability modulo theories smt  surprisingly the problem of finding unsatisfiable cores in smt has received very little attention in the literature

we have evaluated our algorithm with a very extensive empirical test on smtlib benchmarks which confirms the validity and potential of this approach
