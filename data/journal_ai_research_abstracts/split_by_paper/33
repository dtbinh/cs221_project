the optiplan planning system is the first integer programmingbased planner that successfully participated in the international planning competition this engineering note describes the architecture of optiplan and provides the integer programming formulation that enabled it to perform reasonably well in the competition we also touch upon some recent developments that make integer programming encodings significantly more competitive







m  l ginsberg 2011 drfill crosswords and an implemented solver for singly weighted csps volume 42 pages 851886



we describe drfill a program that solves americanstyle crossword puzzles  from a technical perspective drfill works by converting crosswords to weighted csps and then using a variety of novel techniques to find a solution  these techniques include generally applicable heuristics for variable and value selection a variant of limited discrepancy search and postprocessing and partitioning ideas  branch and bound is not used as it was incompatible with postprocessing and was determined experimentally to be of little practical value  drfillls performance on crosswords from the american crossword puzzle tournament suggests that it ranks among the top fifty or so crossword solvers in the world

d  zilli o  parson g  v merrett and a  rogers 2014 a hidden markov modelbased acoustic cicada detector for crowdsourced smartphone biodiversity monitoring volume 51 pages 805827



in recent years the field of computational sustainability has striven to apply artificial intelligence techniques to solve ecological and environmental problems in ecology a key issue for the safeguarding of our planet is the monitoring of biodiversity automated acoustic recognition of species aims to provide a costeffective method for biodiversity monitoring this is particularly appealing for detecting endangered animals with a distinctive call such as the new forest cicada to this end we pursue a crowdsourcing approach whereby the millions of visitors to the new forest where this insect was historically found will help to monitor its presence by means of a smartphone app that can detect its mating call existing research in the field of acoustic insect detection has typically focused upon the classification of recordings collected from fixed field microphones such approaches segment a lengthy audio recording into individual segments of insect activity which are independently classified using cepstral coefficients extracted from the recording as features this paper reports on a contrasting approach whereby we use crowdsourcing to collect recordings via a smartphone app and present an immediate feedback to the users as to whether an insect has been found our classification approach does not remove silent parts of the recording via segmentation but instead uses the temporal patterns throughout each recording to classify the insects present we show that our approach can successfully discriminate between the call of the new forest cicada and similar insects found in the new forest and is robust to common types of environment noise a large scale trial deployment of our smartphone app collected over 6000 reports of insect activity from over 1000 users despite the cicada not having been rediscovered in the new forest the effectiveness of this approach was confirmed for both the detection algorithm which successfully identified the same cicada through the app in countries where the same species is still present and of the crowdsourcing methodology which collected a vast number of recordings and involved thousands of contributors









u  thayasivam and p  doshi 2014 speeding up iterative ontology alignment using blockcoordinate descent volume 50 pages 805845



a phylogenetic tree shows the evolutionary relationships among species internal nodes of the tree represent speciation events and leaf nodes correspond to species a goal of phylogenetics is to combine such trees into larger trees called supertrees whilst respecting the relationships in the original trees  a rooted tree exhibits an ultrametric property that is for any three leaves of the tree it must be that one pair has a deeper most recent common ancestor than the other pairs or that all three have the same most recent common ancestor this inspires a constraint programming encoding for rooted trees we present an efficient constraint that enforces the ultrametric property over a symmetric array of constrained integer variables with the inevitable property that the lower bounds of any three variables are mutually supportive we show that this allows an efficient constraintbased solution to the supertree construction problem we demonstrate that the versatility of constraint programming can be exploited to allow solutions to variants of the supertree construction problem
