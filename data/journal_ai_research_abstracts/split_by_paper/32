dietmar  jannach thomas  schmitz and kostyantyn  shchekotykhin 2016 parallel modelbased diagnosis on multicore computers volume 55 pages 835887



modelbased diagnosis mbd is a principled and domainindependent way of analyzing why a system under examination is not behaving as expected given an abstract description model of the systems components and their behavior when functioning normally mbd techniques rely on observations about the actual system behavior to reason about possible causes when there are discrepancies between the expected and observed behavior due to its generality mbd has been successfully applied in a variety of application domains over the last decades

in many application domains of mbd testing different hypotheses about the reasons for a failure can be computationally costly eg because complex simulations of the system behavior have to be performed in this work we therefore propose different schemes of parallelizing the diagnostic reasoning process in order to better exploit the capabilities of modern multicore computers we propose and systematically evaluate parallelization schemes for reiters hitting set algorithm for finding all or a few leading minimal diagnoses using two different conflict detection techniques furthermore we perform initial experiments for a basic depthfirst search strategy to assess the potential of parallelization when searching for one single diagnosis finally we test the effects of parallelizing direct encodings of the diagnosis problem in a constraint solver



h  papadopoulos v  vovk and a  gammerman 2011 regression conformal prediction with nearest neighbours volume 40 pages 815840



in this paper we apply conformal prediction cp to the knearest neighbours regression knnr algorithm and propose ways of extending the typical nonconformity measure used for regression so far unlike traditional regression methods which produce point predictions conformal predictors output predictive regions that satisfy a given confidence level the regions produced by any conformal predictor are automatically valid however their tightness and therefore usefulness depends on the nonconformity measure used by each cp in effect a nonconformity measure evaluates how strange a given example is compared to a set of other examples based on some traditional machine learning algorithm we define six novel nonconformity measures based on the knearest neighbours regression algorithm and develop the corresponding cps following both the original transductive and the inductive cp approaches a comparison of the predictive regions produced by our measures with those of the typical regression measure suggests that a major improvement in terms of predictive region tightness is achieved by the new measures











a  m s barreto j  pineau and d  precup 2014 policy iteration based on stochastic factorization volume 50 pages 763803



when a transition probability matrix is represented as the product of two stochastic matrices one can swap the factors of the multiplication to obtain another transition matrix that retains some fundamental characteristics of the original since the derived matrix can be much smaller than its precursor this property can be exploited to create a compact version of a markov decision process mdp and hence to reduce the computational cost of dynamic programming building on this idea this paper presents  an approximate policy iteration algorithm called policy iteration based on stochastic factorization or pisf for short in terms of computational complexity pisf replaces standard policy iterations cubic dependence on the size of the mdp with a function that grows only linearly with the number of states in the model the proposed algorithm also enjoys nice theoretical properties it always terminates after a finite number of iterations and returns a decision policy whose performance only depends on the quality of the stochastic factorization in particular if the approximation error in the factorization is sufficiently small  pisf computes the optimal value function of the mdp the paper also discusses practical ways of factoring an mdp and illustrates the usefulness of the proposed algorithm with an application involving a largescale decision problem of real economical interest
