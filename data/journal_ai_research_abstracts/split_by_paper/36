a key challenge in creating a sustainable and energyefficient society is to make consumer demand adaptive to the supply of energy especially to the renewable supply in this article we propose a partiallycentralized organization of consumers or agents namely a consumer cooperative that purchases electricity from the market in the cooperative a central coordinator buys the electricity for the whole group  the technical challenge is that consumers make their own demand decisions based on their private demand constraints and preferences which they do not share with the coordinator or other agents we propose a novel multiagent coordination algorithm to shape the energy demand of the cooperative to coordinate individual consumers under incomplete information the coordinator determines virtual price signals that it sends to the consumers to induce them to shift their demands when required we prove that this algorithm converges to the central optimal solution and minimizes the electric energy cost of the cooperative  additionally we present results on the time complexity of the iterative algorithm and its implications for agents incentive compatibility furthermore we perform simulations based on real world consumption data to a characterize the convergence properties of our algorithm and b understand the effect of differing demand characteristics of participants as well as of different price functions on the cost reduction the results show that the convergence time scales linearly with the agent population size and length of the optimization horizon finally we observe that as participants flexibility of shifting their demands increases cost reduction increases and that the cost reduction is not sensitive to variation in consumption patterns of the consumers



d  gabbay d  pearce and a  valverde 2011 interpolable formulas in equilibrium logic and answer set programming volume 42 pages 917943



interpolation is an important property of classical and many nonclassical logics that has been shown to have interesting applications in computer science and ai here we study the interpolation property for the the nonmonotonic system of equilibrium logic establishing weaker or stronger forms of interpolation depending on the precise interpretation of the inference relation these results also yield a form of interpolation for ground logic programs under the answer sets semantics for disjunctive logic programs we also study the property of uniform interpolation that is closely related to the concept of variable forgetting the firstorder version of equilibrium logic has analogous interpolation properties whenever the collection of equilibrium models is firstorder definable since this is the case for socalled safe programs and theories it applies to the usual situations that arise in practical answer set programming





jiang  guo wanxiang  che david  yarowsky haifeng  wang and ting  liu 2016 a distributed representationbased framework for crosslingual transfer parsing volume 55 pages 9951023



this paper investigates the problem of crosslingual transfer parsing aiming at inducing dependency parsers for lowresource languages while using only training data from a resourcerich language eg english existing model transfer approaches typically dont include lexical features which are not transferable across languages in this paper we bridge the lexical feature gap by using distributed feature representations and their composition we provide two algorithms for inducing crosslingual distributed representations of words which map vocabularies from two different languages into a common vector space consequently both lexical features and nonlexical features can be used in our model for crosslingual transfer furthermore our framework is flexible enough to incorporate additional useful features such as crosslingual word clusters our combined contributions achieve an average relative error reduction of 109 in labeled attachment score as compared with the delexicalized parser trained on english universal treebank and transferred to three other languages it also significantly outperforms stateoftheart delexicalized models augmented with projected cluster features on identical data finally we demonstrate that our models can be further boosted with minimal supervision eg 100 annotated sentences from target languages which is of great significance for practical usage
