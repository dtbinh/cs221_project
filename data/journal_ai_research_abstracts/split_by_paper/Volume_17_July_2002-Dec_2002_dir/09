common wisdom has it that small distinctions in the    probabilities parameters quantifying a belief network do not matter    much for the results of probabilistic queries yet one can develop    realistic scenarios under which small variations in network parameters    can lead to significant changes in computed queries a pending    theoretical question is then to analytically characterize parameter    changes that do or do not matter in this paper we study the    sensitivity of probabilistic queries to changes in network parameters    and prove some tight bounds on the impact that such parameters can    have on queries our analytic results pinpoint some interesting    situations under which parameter changes do or do not matter these    results are important for knowledge engineers as they help them    identify influential network parameters they also help explain some    of the previous experimental results and observations with regards to    network robustness against parameter changes
