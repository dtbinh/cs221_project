we propose a perspective on knowledge compilation which    calls for analyzing different compilation approaches according to two    key dimensions the succinctness of the target compilation language    and the class of queries and transformations that the language    supports in polytime we then provide a knowledge compilation map    which analyzes a large number of existing target compilation languages    according to their succinctness and their polytime transformations and    queries we argue that such analysis is necessary for placing new    compilation approaches within the context of existing ones we also go    beyond classical flat target compilation languages based on cnf and    dnf and consider a richer nested class based on directed acyclic    graphs such as obdds which we show to include a relatively large    number of target compilation languages
