adjustable autonomy refers to entities dynamically varying    their own autonomy transferring decisionmaking control to other    entities typically agents transferring control to human users in key    situations  determining whether and when such transfersofcontrol    should occur is arguably the fundamental research problem in    adjustable autonomy previous work has investigated various approaches    to addressing this problem but has often focused on individual    agenthuman interactions  unfortunately domains requiring    collaboration between teams of agents and humans reveal two key    shortcomings of these previous approaches first these approaches use    rigid oneshot transfers of control that can result in unacceptable    coordination failures in multiagent settings  second they ignore    costs eg in terms of time delays or effects on actions to an    agents team due to such transfersofcontrol     to remedy these problems this article presents a novel approach to    adjustable autonomy based on the notion of a transferofcontrol    strategy  a transferofcontrol strategy consists of a conditional    sequence of two types of actions i actions to transfer    decisionmaking control eg from an agent to a user or vice versa    and ii actions to change an agents prespecified coordination    constraints with team members aimed at minimizing miscoordination    costs the goal is for highquality individual decisions to be made    with minimal disruption to the coordination of the team  we present a    mathematical model of transferofcontrol strategies the model guides    and informs the operationalization of the strategies using markov    decision processes which select an optimal strategy given an    uncertain environment and costs to the individuals and teams the    approach has been carefully evaluated including via its use in a    realworld deployed multiagent system that assists a research group    in its daily activities
