j  y halpern and  r  pucella 2002 a logic for reasoning about upper probabilities volume 17 pages 5781

we present a propositional logic to reason about the uncertainty of events where the uncertainty is modeled by a set of probability measures assigning an interval of probability to each event we give a sound and complete axiomatization for the logic and show that the satisfiability problem is npcomplete no harder than satisfiability for propositional logic
