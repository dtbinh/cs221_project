r  bod 2002 a unified model of structural organization in language and music volume 17 pages 289308

is there a general model that can predict the perceived    phrase structure in language and music while it is usually assumed    that humans have separate faculties for language and music this work    focuses on the commonalities rather than on the differences between    these modalities aiming at finding a deeper faculty our key idea    is that the perceptual system strives for the simplest structure the    simplicity principle but in doing so it is biased by the    likelihood of previous structures the likelihood principle we    present a series of dataoriented parsing dop models that combine    these two principles and that are tested on the penn treebank and the    essen folksong collection our experiments show that 1 a combination    of the two principles outperforms the use of either of them and 2    exactly the same model with the same parameter setting achieves    maximum accuracy for both language and music we argue that our    results suggest an interesting parallel between linguistic and musical    structuring
