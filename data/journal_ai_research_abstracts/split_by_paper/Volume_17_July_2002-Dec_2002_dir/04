recent years are seeing an increasing need for online    monitoring of teams of cooperating agents eg for visualization or    performance tracking however in monitoring deployed teams we often    cannot rely on the agents to always communicate their state to the    monitoring system this paper presents a nonintrusive approach to    monitoring by overhearing where the monitored teams state is    inferred via planrecognition from teammembers routine    communications exchanged as part of their coordinated task execution    and observed overheard by the monitoring system key challenges in    this approach include the demanding runtime requirements of    monitoring the scarceness of observations increasing monitoring    uncertainty and the need to scaleup monitoring to address    potentially large teams to address these we present a set of    complementary novel techniques exploiting knowledge of the social    structures and procedures in the monitored team i an efficient    probabilistic planrecognition algorithm wellsuited for processing    communications as observations ii an approach to exploiting    knowledge of the teams social behavior to predict future observations    during execution reducing monitoring uncertainty and iii    monitoring algorithms that trade expressivity for scalability    representing only certain useful monitoring hypotheses but allowing    for any number of agents and their different activities to be    represented in a single coherent entity we present an empirical    evaluation of these techniques in combination and apart in    monitoring a deployed team of agents running on machines physically    distributed across the country and engaged in complex dynamic task    execution we also compare the performance of these techniques to    human expert and novice monitors and show that the techniques    presented are capable of monitoring at humanexpert levels despite    the difficulty of the task
