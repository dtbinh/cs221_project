this paper presents a new classifier combination    technique based on the dempstershafer theory of evidence the    dempstershafer theory of evidence is a powerful method for    combining measures of evidence from different classifiers however    since each of the available methods that estimates the evidence of    classifiers has its own limitations we propose here a new    implementation which adapts to training data so that the overall    mean square error is minimized the proposed technique is shown to    outperform most available classifier combination methods when    tested on three different classification problems

much work in ai deals with the selection of proper actions    in a given known or unknown environment however the way to select    a proper action when facing other agents is quite unclear most work    in ai adopts classical gametheoretic equilibrium analysis to predict    agent behavior in such settings this approach however does not    provide us with any guarantee for the agent in this paper we    introduce competitive safety analysis this approach bridges the gap    between the desired normative ai approach where a strategy should be    selected in order to guarantee a desired payoff and equilibrium    analysis  we show that a safety level strategy is able to guarantee    the value obtained in a nash equilibrium in several classical    computer science settings  then we discuss the concept of    competitive safety strategies and illustrate its use in a    decentralized load balancing setting typical to network problems in    particular we show that when we have many agents it is possible to    guarantee an expected payoff which is a factor of 89 of the payoff    obtained in a nash equilibrium  our discussion of competitive safety    analysis for decentralized load balancing is further developed to deal    with many communication links and arbitrary speeds  finally we    discuss the extension of the above concepts to bayesian games and    illustrate their use in a basic auctions setup
