d  gamberger and  n  lavrac 2002 expertguided subgroup discovery methodology and application volume 17 pages 501527

this paper presents an approach to expertguided subgroup    discovery  the main step of the subgroup discovery process the    induction of subgroup descriptions is performed by a heuristic beam    search algorithm using a novel parametrized definition of rule    quality which is analyzed in detail  the other important steps of the    proposed subgroup discovery process are the detection of statistically    significant properties of selected subgroups and subgroup    visualization statistically significant properties are used to enrich    the descriptions of induced subgroups while the visualization shows    subgroup properties in the form of distributions of the numbers of    examples in the subgroups the approach is illustrated by the results    obtained for a medical problem of early detection of patient risk    groups
