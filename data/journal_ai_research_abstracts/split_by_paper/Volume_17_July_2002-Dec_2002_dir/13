a  fern  r  givan and  j  m siskind 2002 specifictogeneral learning for temporal events with application to learning event definitions from video volume 17 pages 379449

we develop analyze and evaluate a novel supervised    specifictogeneral learner for a simple temporal logic and use the    resulting algorithm to learn visual event definitions from video    sequences  first we introduce a simple propositional temporal    eventdescription language called ama that is sufficiently expressive    to represent many events yet sufficiently restrictive to support    learning  we then give algorithms along with lower and upper    complexity bounds for the subsumption and generalization problems for    ama formulas we present a positiveexamplesonly specifictogeneral    learning method based on these algorithms we also present a    polynomialtimecomputable syntactic subsumption test that    implies semantic subsumption without being equivalent to it a    generalization algorithm based on syntactic subsumption can be used in    place of semantic generalization to improve the asymptotic complexity    of the resulting learning algorithm finally we apply this algorithm    to the task of learning relational event definitions from video and    show that it yields definitions that are competitive with handcoded    ones
