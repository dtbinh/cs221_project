joseph  y halpern 2015 weighted regretbased likelihood a new approach to describing uncertainty volume 54 pages 471492

recently halpern and leung suggested representing uncertainty by a set of weighted  probability measures and suggested a way of making decisions based on this representation of uncertainty maximizing weighted regret  their paper does not answer an apparently simpler question what it means according to this representation of uncertainty for an event e to be more likely than an event e    in this paper a notion of comparative likelihood when uncertainty is represented by a set of weighted probability measures is defined  it generalizes the ordering defined by probability and by lower probability in a natural way a generalization of upper probability can also be defined  a complete axiomatic characterization of this notion of regretbased likelihood is given
