hannes  strass 2015 expressiveness of twovalued semantics for abstract dialectical frameworks volume 54 pages 193231

we analyse the expressiveness of brewka and woltrans abstract dialectical frameworks for twovalued semantics by expressiveness we mean the ability to encode a desired set of twovalued interpretations over a given propositional vocabulary a using only atoms from a we also compare adfs expressiveness with that of the twovalued semantics of abstract argumentation frameworks normal logic programs and propositional logic while the computational complexity of the twovalued model existence problem for all these languages is almost the same we show that the languages form a neat hierarchy with respect to their expressiveness we then demonstrate that this hierarchy collapses once we allow to introduce a linear number of new vocabulary elements we finally also analyse and compare the representational succinctness of adfs for twovalued model semantics that is their capability to represent twovalued interpretation sets in a spaceefficient manner
