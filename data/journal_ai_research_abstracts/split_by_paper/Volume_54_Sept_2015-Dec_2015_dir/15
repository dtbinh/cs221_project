ben  strasser adi  botea and daniel  harabor 2015 compressing optimal paths with run length encoding volume 54 pages 593629

we introduce a novel approach to compressed path databases space efficient oracles used to very quickly identify the first edge on a shortest path our algorithm achieves query running times on the 100 nanosecond scale being significantly faster than stateoftheart firstmove oracles from the literature space consumption is competitive due to a compression approach that rearranges rows and columns in a firstmove matrix and then performs run length encoding rle on the contents of the matrix one variant of our implemented system was by a convincing margin the fastest entry in the 2014 gridbased path planning competition

we give a first tractability analysis for the compression scheme used by our algorithm we study the complexity of computing a database of minimum size for general directed and undirected graphs we find that in both cases the problem is npcomplete we also show that for graphs which can be decomposed along articulation points the problem can be decomposed into independent parts with a corresponding reduction in its level of difficulty in particular this leads to simple and tractable algorithms with linear running time which yield optimal compression results for trees
