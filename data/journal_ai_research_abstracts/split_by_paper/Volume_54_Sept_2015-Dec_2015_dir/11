igor  rochlin and david  sarne 2015 constraining information sharing to improve cooperative information gathering volume 54 pages 437469

this paper considers the problem of cooperation between selfinterested agents in acquiring better information regarding the nature of the different options and opportunities available to them by sharing individual findings with others the agents can potentially achieve a substantial improvement in overall and individual expected benefits  unfortunately it is well known that with selfinterested agents equilibrium considerations often dictate solutions that are far from the fully cooperative ones hence the agents do not manage to fully exploit the potential benefits encapsulated in such cooperation  in this paper we introduce analyze and demonstrate the benefit of five methods aiming to improve cooperative information gathering  common to all five that they constrain and limit the information sharing process  nevertheless the decrease in benefit due to the limited sharing is outweighed by the resulting substantial improvement in the equilibrium individual information gathering strategies the equilibrium analysis given in the paper which in itself is an important contribution to the study of cooperation between selfinterested agents enables demonstrating that for a wide range of settings an improved individual expected benefit is achieved for all agents when applying each of the five methods
