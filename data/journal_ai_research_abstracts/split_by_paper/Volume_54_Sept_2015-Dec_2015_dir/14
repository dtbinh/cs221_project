nowadays saturationbased reasoners for the owl el profile of the web ontology language are able to handle large ontologies such as snomed very efficiently however it is currently unclear how saturationbased reasoning procedures can be extended to very expressive description logics such as sroiqthe logical underpinning of the current and second iteration of the web ontology language tableaubased procedures on the other hand are not limited to specific description logic languages or owl profiles but even highly optimised tableaubased reasoners might not be efficient enough to handle large ontologies such as snomed in this paper we present an approach for tightly coupling tableau and saturationbased procedures that we implement in the owl dl reasoner konclude our detailed evaluation shows that this combination significantly improves the reasoning performance for a wide range of ontologies
