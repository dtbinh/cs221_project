in this article we present a threestep methodology for dynamically improving a statistical machine translation smt system by incorporating human feedback in the form of free edits on the system translations we target at feedback provided by casual users which is typically errorprone thus we first propose a filtering step to automatically identify the better useredited translations and discard the useless ones a second step produces a pivotbased alignment between source and useredited sentences focusing on the errors made by the system finally a third step produces a new translation model and combines it linearly with the one from the original system we perform a thorough evaluation on a realworld dataset collected from the reversonet translation service and show that every step in our methodology contributes significantly to improve a general purpose smt system interestingly the quality improvement is not only due to the increase of lexical coverage but to a better lexical selection reordering and morphology finally we show the robustness of the methodology by applying it to a different scenario in which the new examples come from an automatically webcrawled parallel corpus using exactly the same architecture and models provides again a significant improvement of the translation quality of a general purpose baseline smt system
