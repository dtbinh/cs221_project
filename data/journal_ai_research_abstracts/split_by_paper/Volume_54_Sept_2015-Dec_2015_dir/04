in realtime domains such as video games planning happens concurrently with execution and the planning algorithm has a strictly bounded amount of time before it must return the next action for the agent to execute we explore the use of realtime heuristic search in two benchmark domains inspired by video games unlike classic benchmarks such as grid pathfinding and the sliding tile puzzle these new domains feature exogenous change and directed state space graphs we consider the setting in which planning and acting are concurrent and we use the natural objective of minimizing goal achievement time using both the classic benchmarks and the new domains we investigate several enhancements to a leading realtime search algorithm lsslrta we show experimentally that 1 it is better to plan after each action or to use a dynamically sized lookahead 2 abased lookahead can cause undesirable actions to be selected and 3 online debiasing of the heuristic can lead to improved performance we hope this work encourages future research on applying realtime search in dynamic domains
