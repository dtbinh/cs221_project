answering conjunctive queries over ontologyenriched datasets is a core reasoning task for many applications query answering is however computationally very expensive which has led to the development of query answering procedures that sacrifice either expressive power of the ontology language or the completeness of query answers in order to improve scalability in this paper we describe a hybrid approach to query answering over owl 2 ontologies that combines a datalog reasoner with a fullyfledged owl 2 reasoner in order to provide scalable payasyougo performance the key feature of our approach is that it delegates the bulk of the computation to the datalog reasoner and resorts to expensive owl 2 reasoning only as necessary to fully answer the query furthermore although our main goal  is to efficiently answer queries over owl 2 ontologies and data our technical results are very general and our approach is applicable to firstorder knowledge representation languages that can be captured by rules allowing for existential quantification and disjunction in the head our only assumption is the availability of a datalog reasoner and a fullyfledged reasoner for the language of interest  both of which are used as black boxes we have implemented our techniques in the pagoda system which combines the datalog reasoner rdfox and the  owl 2 reasoner hermit our extensive evaluation shows that pagoda succeeds in providing scalable payasyougo query answering for a wide range of owl 2 ontologies datasets and queries
