textual inference is an important component in many applications for understanding natural language classical approaches to textual inference rely on logical representations for meaning which may be regarded as external to the natural language itself however practical applications usually adopt shallower lexical or lexicalsyntactic representations which correspond closely to language structure in many cases such approaches lack a principled meaning representation and inference framework we describe an inference formalism that operates directly on languagebased structures particularly syntactic parse trees new trees are generated by applying inference rules which provide a unified representation for varying types of inferences we use manual and automatic methods to generate these rules which cover generic linguistic structures as well as specific lexicalbased inferences  we also present a novel packed datastructure and a corresponding inference algorithm that allows efficient implementation of this formalism we proved the correctness of the new algorithm and established its efficiency analytically and empirically the utility of our approach was illustrated on two tasks unsupervised relation extraction from a large corpus and the recognizing textual entailment rte benchmarks
