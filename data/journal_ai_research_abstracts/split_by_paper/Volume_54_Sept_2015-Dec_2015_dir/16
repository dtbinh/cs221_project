tatsuya  imai and alex  fukunaga 2015 on a practical  integerlinear programming model for deletefree tasks and its use as a heuristic for costoptimal planning volume 54 pages 631677

we propose a new integerlinear programming model for the delete relaxation in costoptimal planning while a straightforward ip for the delete relaxation is impractical our enhanced model incorporates variable reduction techniques based on  landmarks relevancebased constraints dominated action elimination immediate action application and inverse action constraints resulting in an ip that can be used to directly solve deletefree planning problems we show that our ip model is competitive with previous stateoftheart solvers for deletefree problems the lprelaxation of the ip model is often a very good approximation to the ip providing an approach to approximating the optimal value of the deletefree task that is complementary to the wellknown lmcut heuristic we also show that constraints that partially consider delete effects can be added to our iplp models we embed the new iplp models into a forwardsearch based planner and show that the performance of the resulting planner on standard ipc benchmarks is comparable with the stateoftheart for costoptimal planning
