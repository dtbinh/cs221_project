when to make a decision is a key question in decision making problems characterized by uncertainty in this paper we deal with decision making in environments where information arrives dynamically we address the tradeoff between waiting and stopping strategies on the one hand waiting to obtain more information reduces uncertainty but it comes with a cost stopping and making a decision based on an expected utility reduces the cost of waiting but the decision is based on uncertain information we propose an optimal algorithm and two approximation algorithms we prove that one approximation is optimistic  waits at least as long as the optimal algorithm while the other is pessimistic  stops not later than the optimal algorithm we evaluate our algorithms theoretically and empirically and show that the quality of the decision in both approximations is nearoptimal and much faster than the optimal algorithm also we can conclude from the experiments that the cost function is a key factor to chose the most effective algorithm
