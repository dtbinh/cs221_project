as empirically demonstrated by the word sense disambiguation wsd tasks of the last sensevalsemeval exercises assigning the appropriate meaning to words in context has resisted all attempts to be successfully addressed many authors argue that one possible reason could be the use of inappropriate sets of word meanings in particular wordnet has been used as a defacto standard repository of word meanings in most of these tasks thus instead of using the word senses defined in wordnet some approaches have derived semantic classes representing groups of word senses however the meanings represented by wordnet have been only used for wsd at a very finegrained sense level or at a very coarsegrained semantic class level also called supersenses we suspect that an appropriate level of abstraction could be on between both levels the contributions of this paper are manifold first we propose a simple method to automatically derive semantic classes at intermediate levels of abstraction covering all nominal and verbal wordnet meanings second we empirically demonstrate that our automatically derived semantic classes outperform classical approaches based on word senses and more coarsegrained sense groupings third we also demonstrate that our supervised wsd system benefits from using these new semantic classes as additional semantic features while reducing the amount of training examples finally we also demonstrate the robustness of our supervised semantic classbased wsd system when tested on out of domain corpus
