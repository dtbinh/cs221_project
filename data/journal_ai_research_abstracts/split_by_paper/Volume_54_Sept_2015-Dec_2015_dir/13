we study the problem of computing possible and necessary winners for partially specified weighted and unweighted tournaments this problem arises naturally in elections with incompletely specified votes partially completed sports competitions and more generally in any scenario where the outcome of some pairwise comparisons is not yet fully known we specifically consider a number of wellknown solution conceptsincluding the uncovered set borda ranked pairs and maximinand show that for most of them possible and necessary winners can be identified in polynomial time these positive algorithmic results stand in sharp contrast to earlier results concerning possible and necessary winners given partially specified preference profiles
