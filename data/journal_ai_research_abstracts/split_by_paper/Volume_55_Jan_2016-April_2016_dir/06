accessing or integrating data lexicalized in different languages is a challenge multilingual lexical resources play a fundamental role in reducing the language barriers to map concepts lexicalized in different languages in this paper we present a largescale study on the effectiveness of automatic translations to support two key crosslingual ontology mapping tasks the retrieval of candidate matches and the selection of the correct matches for inclusion in the final alignment  we conduct our experiments using four different large gold standards each one consisting of a pair of mapped wordnets to cover four different families of languages we categorize concepts based on their lexicalization type of words synonym richness position in a subconcept graph and analyze their distributions in the gold standards leveraging this categorization we measure several aspects of translation effectiveness such as wordtranslation correctness word sense coverage synset and synonym coverage finally we thoroughly discuss several findings of our study which we believe are helpful for the design of more sophisticated crosslingual mapping algorithms
