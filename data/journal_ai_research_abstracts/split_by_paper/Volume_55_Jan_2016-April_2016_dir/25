natalia  flerova radu  marinescu and rina  dechter 2016 searching for the m best solutions in graphical models volume 55 pages 889952

  the paper focuses on finding the m best solutions to combinatorial optimization problems using bestfirst or depthfirst branch and bound search  specifically we present a new algorithm ma extending the wellknown a to the mbest task and for the first time prove that all its desirable properties including soundness completeness and optimal efficiency are maintained since bestfirst algorithms require extensive memory we also extend the memoryefficient depthfirst branch and bound to the mbest task

we adapt both algorithms to optimization tasks over graphical models eg weighted csp and mpe in bayesian networks provide complexity analysis and an empirical evaluation our experiments confirm theory that the bestfirst approach is largely superior when memory is available but depthfirst branch and bound is more robust  we also show that our algorithms are competitive with related schemes recently developed for the mbest task
