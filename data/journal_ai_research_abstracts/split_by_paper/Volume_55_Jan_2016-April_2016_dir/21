alberto  garciaduran antoine  bordes nicolas  usunier and yves  grandvalet 2016 combining two and threeway embedding models for link prediction in knowledge bases volume 55 pages 715742

this paper tackles the problem of endogenous link prediction for knowledge base completion knowledge bases can be represented as directed graphs whose nodes correspond to entities and edges to relationships previous attempts either consist of powerful systems with high capacity to model complex connectivity patterns which unfortunately usually end up overfitting on rare relationships or in approaches that trade capacity for simplicity in order to fairly model all relationships frequent or not in this paper we propose tatec a happy medium obtained by complementing a highcapacity model with a simpler one both pretrained separately and then combined we present several variants of this model with different kinds of regularization and combination strategies and show that this approach outperforms existing methods on different types of relationships by achieving stateoftheart results on four benchmarks of the literature
