francesco  parisi and john  grant 2016 knowledge representation in probabilistic spatiotemporal knowledge bases volume 55 pages 743798

we represent knowledge as integrity constraints in a formalization of probabilistic spatiotemporal knowledge bases we start by defining the syntax and semantics of a formalization called pst knowledge bases  this definition generalizes an earlier version called spot which is a declarative framework for the representation and processing of probabilistic spatiotemporal data where probability is represented as an interval because the exact value is unknown we augment the previous definition by adding a type of nonatomic formula that expresses integrity constraints the result is a highly expressive formalism for knowledge representation dealing with probabilistic spatiotemporal data  we obtain complexity results both for checking the consistency of pst knowledge bases and for answering queries in pst knowledge bases and also specify tractable cases  all the domains in the pst framework are finite but we extend our results also to arbitrarily large finite domains
