in todays world we follow news which is distributed globally significant events are reported by different sources and in different languages in this work we address the problem of tracking of events in a large multilingual stream within a recently developed system event registry we examine two aspects of this problem how to compare articles in different languages and how to link collections of articles in different languages which refer to the same event  taking a multilingual stream and clusters of articles from each language we compare different crosslingual document similarity measures based on wikipedia this allows us to compute the similarity of any two articles regardless of language building on previous work we show there are methods which scale well and can compute a meaningful similarity between articles from languages with little or no direct overlap in the training data using this capability we then propose an approach to link clusters of articles across languages which represent the same event we provide an extensive evaluation of the system as a whole as well as an evaluation of the quality and robustness of the similarity measure and the linking algorithm
