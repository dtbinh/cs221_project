decentralized partially observable markov decision processes decpomdps provide a general model for decisionmaking under uncertainty in decentralized settings but are difficult to solve optimally nexpcomplete as a new way of solving these problems we introduce the idea of transforming a decpomdp into a continuousstate deterministic mdp with a piecewiselinear and convex value function this approach makes use of the fact that planning can be accomplished in a centralized offline manner while execution can still be decentralized this new decpomdp formulation which we call an occupancy mdp allows powerful pomdp and continuousstate mdp methods to be used for the first time to provide scalability we refine this approach by combining heuristic search and compact representations that exploit the structure present in multiagent domains without losing the ability to converge to an optimal solution  in particular we introduce a featurebased heuristic search value iteration fbhsvi algorithm that relies on featurebased compact representations pointbased updates and efficient action selection  a theoretical analysis demonstrates that fbhsvi terminates in finite time with an optimal solution we include an extensive empirical analysis using wellknown benchmarks thereby demonstrating that our approach provides significant scalability improvements compared to the state of the art
