osman  ba351kaya and david  jurgens 2016 semisupervised learning with induced word senses for state of the art word sense disambiguation volume 55 pages 10251058

word sense disambiguation wsd aims to determine the meaning of a word in context and successful approaches are known to benefit many applications in natural language processing  although supervised learning has been shown to provide superior wsd performance current senseannotated corpora do not contain a sufficient number of instances per word type to train supervised systems for all words  while unsupervised techniques have been proposed to overcome this data sparsity problem such techniques have not outperformed supervised methods in this paper we propose a new approach to building semisupervised wsd systems that combines a small amount of senseannotated data with information from word sense induction a fullyunsupervised technique that automatically learns the different senses of a word based on how it is used in three experiments we show how sense induction models may be effectively combined to ultimately produce highperformance semisupervised wsd systems that exceed the performance of stateoftheart supervised wsd techniques trained on the same senseannotated data we anticipate that our results and released software will also benefit evaluation practices for sense induction systems and those working in lowresource languages by demonstrating how to quickly produce accurate wsd systems with minimal annotation effort
