how do we parse the languages for which no treebanks are available this contribution addresses the crosslingual viewpoint on statistical dependency parsing in which we attempt to make use of resourcerich source language treebanks to build and adapt models for the underresourced target languages we outline the benefits and indicate the drawbacks of the current major approaches we emphasize synthetic treebanking the automatic creation of target language treebanks by means of annotation projection and machine translation we present competitive results in crosslingual dependency parsing using a combination of various techniques that contribute to the overall success of the method we further include a detailed discussion about the impact of partofspeech label accuracy on parsing results that provide guidance in practical applications of crosslingual methods for truly underresourced languages
