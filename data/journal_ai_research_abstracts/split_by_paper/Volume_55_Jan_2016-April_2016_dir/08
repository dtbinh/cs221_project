ahmad  khwileh debasis   ganguly  and gareth   j f jones  2016 utilisation of metadata fields and query expansion in crosslingual search of usergenerated internet video volume 55 pages 249281

recent years have seen significant efforts in the area of cross language information retrieval clir for text retrieval this work initially focused on formally published content but more recently research has begun to concentrate on clir for informal social media content however despite the current expansion in online multimedia archives there has been little work on clir for this content while there has been some limited work on crosslanguage video retrieval clvr for professional videos such as documentaries or tv news broadcasts there has to date been no significant investigation of clvr for the rapidly growing archives of informal user generated ugc content key differences between such ugc and professionally produced content are the nature and structure of the textual ugc metadata associated with it as well as the form and quality of the content itself in this setting retrieval effectiveness may not only suffer from translation errors common to all clir tasks but also recognition errors associated with the automatic speech recognition asr systems used to transcribe the spoken content of the video and with the informality and inconsistency of the associated usercreated metadata for each video this work proposes and evaluates techniques to improve clir effectiveness of such noisy ugc content our experimental investigation shows that different sources of evidence eg the content from different fields of the structured metadata significantly affect clir effectiveness results from our experiments also show that each metadata field has a varying robustness to query expansion qe and hence can have a negative impact on the clir effectiveness our work proposes a novel adaptive qe technique that predicts the most reliable source for expansion and shows how this technique can be effective for improving the clir effectiveness for ugc content
