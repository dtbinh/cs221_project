felix  brandt and christian  geist 2016 finding strategyproof social choice functions via sat solving volume 55 pages 565602

a promising direction in computational social choice is to address research problems using computeraided proving techniques in particular with sat solvers this approach has been shown to be viable not only for proving classic impossibility theorems such as arrows theorem but also for finding new impossibilities in the context of preference extensions in this paper we demonstrate that these computeraided techniques can also be applied to improve our understanding of strategyproof irresolute social choice functions these functions however requires a more evolved encoding as otherwise the search space rapidly becomes much too large our contribution is twofold we present an efficient encoding for translating such problems to sat and leverage this encoding to prove new results about strategyproofness with respect to kellys and fishburns preference extensions for example we show that no paretooptimal majoritarian social choice function satisfies fishburnstrategyproofness furthermore we explain how humanreadable proofs of such results can be extracted from minimal unsatisfiable cores of the corresponding sat formulas
