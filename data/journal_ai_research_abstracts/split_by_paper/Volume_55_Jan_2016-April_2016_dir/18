we study the complexity of a combinatorial variant of the shift bribery problem in elections in the standard shift bribery problem we are given an election where each voter has a preference order over the set of candidates and where an outside agent the briber can pay each voter to rank the bribers favorite candidate a given number of positions higher the goal is to ensure the victory of the bribers preferred candidate the combinatorial variant of the problem introduced in this paper models settings where it is possible to affect the position of the preferred candidate in multiple votes either positively or negatively with a single bribery action this variant of the problem is particularly interesting in the context of largescale campaign management problems which from the technical side are modeled as bribery problems  we show that in general the combinatorial variant of the problem is highly intractable specifically nphard hard in the parameterized sense and hard to approximate nevertheless we provide parameterized algorithms and approximation algorithms for natural restricted cases
