module extraction is the task of computing a preferably small fragment m of an ontology t that preserves a class of entailments over a signature of interest s extracting modules of minimal size is wellknown to be computationally hard and often algorithmically infeasible especially for highly expressive ontology languages thus practical techniques typically rely on approximations where m provably captures the relevant entailments but is not guaranteed to be minimal existing approximations ensure that m preserves all secondorder entailments of t wrt s which is a stronger condition than is required in many applications and may lead to unnecessarily large modules in practice in this paper we propose a novel approach in which module extraction is reduced to a reasoning problem in datalog our approach generalises existing approximations in an elegant way more importantly it allows extraction of modules that are tailored to preserve only specific kinds of entailments and thus are often significantly smaller our evaluation on a wide range of ontologies confirms the feasibility and benefits of our approach in practice
