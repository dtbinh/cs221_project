linguistic borrowing is the phenomenon of transferring linguistic constructions lexical phonological morphological and syntactic from a donor language to a recipient language as a result of contacts between communities speaking different languages borrowed words are found in all languages andin contrast to cognate relationshipsborrowing relationships may exist across unrelated languages for example about 40 of swahilis vocabulary is borrowed from the unrelated language arabic in this work we develop a model of morphophonological transformations across languages its features are based on universal constraints from optimality theory ot and we show that compared to several standardbut linguistically more na239vebaselines our otinspired model obtains good performance at predicting donor forms from borrowed forms with only a few dozen training examples making this a costeffective strategy for sharing lexical information across languages we demonstrate applications of the lexical borrowing model in machine translation using resourcerich donor language to obtain translations of outofvocabulary loanwords in a lower resource language our framework obtains substantial improvements up to 16 bleu over standard baselines
