modelbased diagnosis mbd is a principled and domainindependent way of analyzing why a system under examination is not behaving as expected given an abstract description model of the systems components and their behavior when functioning normally mbd techniques rely on observations about the actual system behavior to reason about possible causes when there are discrepancies between the expected and observed behavior due to its generality mbd has been successfully applied in a variety of application domains over the last decades

in many application domains of mbd testing different hypotheses about the reasons for a failure can be computationally costly eg because complex simulations of the system behavior have to be performed in this work we therefore propose different schemes of parallelizing the diagnostic reasoning process in order to better exploit the capabilities of modern multicore computers we propose and systematically evaluate parallelization schemes for reiters hitting set algorithm for finding all or a few leading minimal diagnoses using two different conflict detection techniques furthermore we perform initial experiments for a basic depthfirst search strategy to assess the potential of parallelization when searching for one single diagnosis finally we test the effects of parallelizing direct encodings of the diagnosis problem in a constraint solver
