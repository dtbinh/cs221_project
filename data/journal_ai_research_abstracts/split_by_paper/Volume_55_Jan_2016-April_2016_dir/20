this article discusses the quadratization of markov logic networks which enables efficient approximate map computation by means of maximum flows the procedure relies on a pseudoboolean representation of the model and allows handling models of any order the employed pseudoboolean representation can be used to identify problems that are guaranteed to be solvable in low polynomialtime results on common benchmark problems show that the proposed approach finds optimal assignments for most variables in excellent computational time and approximate solutions that match the quality of ilpbased solvers
