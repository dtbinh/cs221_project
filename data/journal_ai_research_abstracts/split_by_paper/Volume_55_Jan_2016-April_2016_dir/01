with the increasingly global nature of our everyday interactions the need for multilin gual technologies to support efficient and effective information access and communication cannot be overemphasized computational modeling of language has been the focus of natural language processing a subdiscipline of artificial intelligence one of the current challenges for this discipline is to design methodologies and algorithms that are cross language in order to create multilingual technologies rapidly the goal of this jair special issue on crosslanguage algorithms and applications claa is to present leading re search in this area with emphasis on developing unifying themes that could lead to the development of the science of multi and crosslingualism in this introduction we provide the reader with the motivation for this special issue and summarize the contributions of the papers that have been included the selected papers cover a broad range of crosslingual technologies including machine translation domain and language adaptation for sentiment analysis crosslanguage lexical resources dependency parsing information retrieval and knowledge representation we anticipate that this special issue will serve as an invaluable resource for researchers interested in topics of crosslingual natural language processing
