this paper investigates the problem of crosslingual transfer parsing aiming at inducing dependency parsers for lowresource languages while using only training data from a resourcerich language eg english existing model transfer approaches typically dont include lexical features which are not transferable across languages in this paper we bridge the lexical feature gap by using distributed feature representations and their composition we provide two algorithms for inducing crosslingual distributed representations of words which map vocabularies from two different languages into a common vector space consequently both lexical features and nonlexical features can be used in our model for crosslingual transfer furthermore our framework is flexible enough to incorporate additional useful features such as crosslingual word clusters our combined contributions achieve an average relative error reduction of 109 in labeled attachment score as compared with the delexicalized parser trained on english universal treebank and transferred to three other languages it also significantly outperforms stateoftheart delexicalized models augmented with projected cluster features on identical data finally we demonstrate that our models can be further boosted with minimal supervision eg 100 annotated sentences from target languages which is of great significance for practical usage
