we describe a hybridisation strategy whose objective is to integrate linguistic resources from shallowtransfer rulebased machine translation rbmt into phrasebased statistical machine translation pbsmt it basically consists of enriching the phrase table of a pbsmt system with bilingual phrase pairs matching transfer rules and dictionary entries from a shallowtransfer rbmt system this new strategy takes advantage of how the linguistic resources are used by the rbmt system to segment the sourcelanguage sentences to be translated and overcomes the limitations of existing hybrid approaches that treat the rbmt systems as a black box experimental results confirm that our approach delivers translations of  higher quality than existing ones and that it is specially useful when the parallel corpus available for training the smt system is small or when translating outofdomain texts that are well covered by the rbmt dictionaries a combination of this approach with a recently proposed unsupervised shallowtransfer rule inference algorithm results in a significantly greater translation quality than that of a baseline pbsmt in this case the only handcrafted resource used are the dictionaries commonly used in rbmt moreover the translation quality achieved by the hybrid system built with automatically inferred rules is similar to that obtained by those built with handcrafted rules
