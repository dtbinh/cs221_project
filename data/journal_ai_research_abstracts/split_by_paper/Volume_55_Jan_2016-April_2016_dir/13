understanding the demographics of users of online social networks has important applications for health marketing and public messaging whereas most prior approaches rely on a supervised learning approach in which individual users are labeled with demographics for training we instead create a distantly labeled dataset by collecting audience measurement data for 1500 websites eg 50 of visitors to gizmodocom are estimated to have a bachelors degree we then fit a regression model to predict these demographics from information about the followers of each website on twitter using patterns derived both from textual content and the social network of each user our final model produces an average heldout correlation of 77 across seven different variables age gender education ethnicity income parental status and political preference we then apply this model to classify individual twitter users by ethnicity gender and political preference finding performance that is surprisingly competitive with a fully supervised approach
