hanxiao  liu wanli  ma yiming  yang and jaime  carbonell 2016 learning concept graphs from online educational data volume 55 pages 10591090

this paper addresses an open challenge in educational data mining ie the problem of automatically mapping online courses from different providers universities moocs etc onto a universal space of concepts and predicting latent prerequisite dependencies directed links among both concepts and courses we propose a novel approach for inference within and across courselevel and conceptlevel directed graphs in the training phase our system projects partially observed courselevel prerequisite links onto directed conceptlevel links in the testing phase the induced conceptlevel links are used to infer the unknown courselevel prerequisite links whereas courses may be specific to one institution concepts are shared across different providers the bidirectional mappings enable our system to perform interlinguastyle transfer learning eg treating the concept graph as the interlingua and transferring the prerequisite relations across universities via the interlingua experiments on our newly collected datasets of courses from mit caltech princeton and cmu show promising results
