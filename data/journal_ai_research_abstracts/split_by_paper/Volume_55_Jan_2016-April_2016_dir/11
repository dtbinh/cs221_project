bayesian optimization techniques have been successfully applied to robotics planning sensor placement recommendation advertising intelligent user interfaces and automatic algorithm configuration despite these successes the approach is restricted to problems of moderate dimension and several workshops on bayesian optimization have identified its scaling to highdimensions as one of the holy grails of the field in this paper we introduce a novel random embedding idea to attack this problem the resulting random embedding bayesian optimization rembo algorithm is very simple has important invariance properties and applies to domains with both categorical and continuous variables we present a thorough theoretical analysis of rembo empirical results confirm that rembo can effectively solve problems with billions of dimensions provided the intrinsic dimensionality is low they also show that rembo achieves stateoftheart performance in optimizing the 47 discrete parameters of a popular mixed integer linear programming solver
