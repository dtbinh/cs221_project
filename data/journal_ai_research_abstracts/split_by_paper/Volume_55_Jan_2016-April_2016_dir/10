crowdsourcing markets have emerged as a popular platform for matching available workers with tasks to complete the payment for a particular task is typically set by the tasks requester and may be adjusted based on the quality of the completed work for example through the use of bonus payments in this paper we study the requesters problem of dynamically adjusting qualitycontingent payments for tasks we consider a multiround version of the wellknown principalagent model whereby in each round a worker makes a strategic choice of the effort level which is not directly observable by the requester in particular our formulation significantly generalizes the budgetfree online task pricing problems studied in prior work we treat this problem as a multiarmed bandit problem with each arm representing a potential contract to cope with the large and in fact infinite number of arms we propose a new algorithm agnosticzooming which discretizes the contract space into a finite number of regions effectively treating each region as a single arm this discretization is adaptively refined so that more promising regions of the contract space are eventually discretized more finely we analyze this algorithm showing that it achieves regret sublinear in the time horizon and substantially improves over nonadaptive discretization which is the only competing approach in the literature our results advance the state of art on several different topics the theory of crowdsourcing markets principalagent problems multiarmed bandits and dynamic pricing
