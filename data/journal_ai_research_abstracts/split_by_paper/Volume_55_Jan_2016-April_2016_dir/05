domain adaptation da techniques aim at enabling machine learning methods learn effective classifiers for a target domain when the only available training data belongs to a different source domain in this paper we present the distributional correspondence indexing dci method for domain adaptation in sentiment classification dci derives term representations in a vector space common to both domains where each dimension reflects its distributional correspondence to a pivot ie to a highly predictive term that behaves similarly across domains term correspondence is quantified by means of a distributional correspondence function dcf we propose a number of efficient dcfs that are motivated by the distributional hypothesis ie the hypothesis according to which terms with similar meaning tend to have similar distributions in text experiments show that dci obtains better performance than current stateoftheart techniques for crosslingual and crossdomain sentiment classification dci also brings about a significantly reduced computational cost and requires a smaller amount of human intervention as a final contribution we discuss a more challenging formulation of the domain adaptation problem in which both the crossdomain and crosslingual dimensions are tackled simultaneously
