in this paper we propose a set of tasks that are relevant for the modular reuse of ontologies in order to formalize these tasks as reasoning problems we introduce the notions of conservative extension safety and module for a very general class of logicbased ontology languages we investigate the general properties of and relationships between these notions  and study the relationships between the relevant reasoning problems we have previously identified to study the computability of these problems we   consider in particular description logics dls which provide the formal underpinning of the w3c web ontology language owl and show that all the  problems we consider are undecidable or algorithmically unsolvable for the description logic underlying owl dl  in order to achieve a practical solution we identify conditions sufficient for an ontology to reuse a set of symbols safelythat is without changing their meaning we provide the notion of a safety class which characterizes any sufficient condition for safety and identify a family of safety classescalled localitywhich enjoys a collection of desirable properties  we use the notion of a safety class to extract modules from ontologies and we provide various modularization algorithms that are appropriate to the properties of the particular safety class in use  finally we show practical benefits of our safety checking and module extraction algorithms
