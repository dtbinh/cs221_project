reasoning about agent preferences on a set of alternatives and the aggregation of such preferences into some social ranking is a fundamental issue in reasoning about multiagent systems when the set of agents and the set of alternatives coincide we get the ranking systems setting a famous type of ranking systems are page ranking systems in the context of search engines in this paper we present an extensive axiomatic study of ranking systems in particular we consider two fundamental axioms transitivity and ranked independence of irrelevant alternatives surprisingly we find that there is no general social ranking rule that satisfies both requirements furthermore we show that our impossibility result holds under various restrictions on the class of ranking problems considered however when transitivity is weakened an interesting possibility result is obtained in addition we show a complete axiomatization of approval voting using ranked iia
