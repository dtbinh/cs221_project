probabilistic planning problems are typically modeled as a markov decision process mdp mdps while an otherwise expressive model allow only for sequential nondurative actions this poses severe restrictions in modeling and solving a real world planning problem we extend the mdp model to incorporate  1 simultaneous action execution 2 durative actions and 3 stochastic durations we develop several algorithms to combat the computational explosion introduced by these features the key theoretical ideas used in building these algorithms are  modeling a complex problem as an mdp in extended stateaction space pruning of irrelevant actions sampling of relevant actions using informed heuristics to guide the search hybridizing different planners to achieve benefits of both approximating the problem and replanning our empirical evaluation illuminates the different merits in using various algorithms viz optimality empirical closeness to optimality theoretical error bounds and speed
