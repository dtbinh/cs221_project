f  heras j  larrosa and a  oliveras 2008 minimaxsat an efficient weighted maxsat solver volume 31 pages 132

in this paper we introduce minimaxsat a new maxsat solver that is built on top of minisat it incorporates the best current sat and maxsat techniques it can handle hard clausesclauses of mandatory satisfaction as in sat soft clauses clauses whose falsification is penalized by a cost as in maxsat as well as pseudoboolean objective functions and constraints  its main features are learning and  backjumping on hard clauses resolutionbased and substractionbased  lower bounding and lazy propagation with the twowatched literal scheme  our empirical evaluation comparing a wide set of solving alternatives on a broad set of optimization benchmarks indicates that the performance of minimaxsat is usually close to the best specialized alternative and in some cases even better
