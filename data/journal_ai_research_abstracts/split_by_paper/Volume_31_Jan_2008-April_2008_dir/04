y  zhang and y  ding 2008 ctl model update for system modifications volume 31 pages 113155

model checking is a promising technology which has been applied for verification of many hardware and software systems in this paper we introduce the concept of model update towards the development of an automatic system modification tool that extends model checking functions we define primitive update operations on the models of computation tree logic ctl and formalize the principle of minimal change for ctl model update these primitive update operations together with the underlying minimal change principle serve as the foundation for ctl model update essential semantic and computational characterizations are provided for our ctl model update approach we then describe a formal algorithm that implements this approach we also illustrate two case studies of ctl model updates for the wellknown microwave oven example and the andrew file system 1 from which we further propose a method to optimize the update results in complex system modifications
