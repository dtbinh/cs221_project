y  engel and m  p wellman 2008 cui networks a graphical representation for conditional utility independence volume 31 pages 83112

we introduce cui networks a compact graphical representation of utility functions over multiple attributes cui networks model multiattribute utility functions using the wellstudied and widely applicable utility independence concept we show how conditional utility independence leads to an effective functional decomposition that can be exhibited graphically and how local compact data at the graph nodes can be used to calculate joint utility we discuss aspects of elicitation network construction and optimization and contrast our new representation with previous graphical preference modeling
