artificial intelligence research is ushering in a new era of sophisticated massmarket transportation technology while computers can already fly a passenger jet better than a trained human pilot people are still faced with the dangerous yet tedious task of driving automobiles intelligent transportation systems its is the field that focuses on integrating information technology with vehicles and transportation infrastructure to make transportation safer cheaper and more efficient recent advances in its point to a future in which vehicles themselves handle the vast majority of the driving task once autonomous vehicles become popular autonomous interactions amongst multiple vehicles will be possible current methods of vehicle coordination which are all designed to work with human drivers will be outdated the bottleneck for roadway efficiency will no longer be the drivers but rather the mechanism by which those drivers actions are coordinated while openroad driving is a wellstudied and moreorlesssolved problem urban traffic scenarios especially intersections are much more challenging

we believe current methods for controlling traffic specifically at intersections will not be able to take advantage of the increased sensitivity and precision of autonomous vehicles as compared to human drivers in this article we suggest an alternative mechanism for coordinating the movement of autonomous vehicles through intersections drivers and intersections in this mechanism are treated as autonomous agents in a multiagent system in this multiagent system intersections use a new reservationbased approach built around a detailed communication protocol which we also present we demonstrate in simulation that our new mechanism has the potential to significantly outperform current intersection control technology  traffic lights and stop signs because our mechanism can emulate a traffic light or stop sign it subsumes the most popular current methods of intersection control this article also presents two extensions to the mechanism the first extension allows the system to control humandriven vehicles in addition to autonomous vehicles the second gives priority to emergency vehicles without significant cost to civilian vehicles the mechanism including both extensions is implemented and tested in simulation and we present experimental results that strongly attest to the efficacy of this approach
