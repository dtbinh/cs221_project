y  liu and g  lakemeyer 2008 on the expressiveness of levesques normal form volume 31 pages 259272

levesque proposed a generalization of a database called a proper knowledge base kb which is equivalent to a possibly infinite consistent set of ground literals in contrast to databases proper kbs do not make the closedworld assumption and hence the entailment  problem becomes undecidable levesque then proposed a limited but efficient inference method v for proper kbs which is sound and when the query is in a certain normal form also logically complete  he conjectured that for every firstorder query there is an equivalent one in normal form in this note we show that this conjecture is false in fact we show that any class of formulas for which v is complete must be strictly less expressive than full firstorder logic moreover in the propositional case it is very unlikely that a formula always has a polynomialsize normal form
