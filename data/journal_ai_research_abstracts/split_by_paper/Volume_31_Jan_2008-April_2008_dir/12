j  clarke and m  lapata 2008 global inference for sentence compression an integer linear programming approach volume 31 pages 399429

sentence compression holds promise for many applications ranging from summarization to subtitle generation  our work views sentence compression as an optimization problem and uses integer linear programming ilp to infer globally optimal compressions in the presence of linguistically motivated constraints we show how previous formulations of sentence compression can be recast as ilps and extend these models with novel global constraints experimental results on written and spoken texts demonstrate improvements over stateoftheart models
