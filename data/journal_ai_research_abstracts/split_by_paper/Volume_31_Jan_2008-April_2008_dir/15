m  rk ryan 2008 exploiting subgraph structure in multirobot path planning volume 31 pages 497542

multirobot path planning is difficult due to the combinatorial explosion of the search space with every new robot added complete search of the combined statespace soon becomes intractable in this paper we present a novel form of abstraction that allows us to plan much more efficiently the key to this abstraction is the partitioning of the map into subgraphs of known structure with entry and exit restrictions which we can represent compactly planning then becomes a search in the much smaller space of subgraph configurations once an abstract plan is found it can be quickly resolved into a correct but possibly suboptimal concrete plan without the need for further search we prove that this technique is sound and complete and demonstrate its practical effectiveness on a real map
