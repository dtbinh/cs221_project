o  gimenez and a  jonsson 2008 the complexity of planning problems with simple causal graphs volume 31 pages 319351

we present three new complexity results for classes of planning problems with simple causal graphs first we describe a polynomialtime algorithm that uses macros to generate plans for the class 3s of planning problems with binary state variables and acyclic causal graphs this implies that plan generation may be tractable even when a planning problem has an exponentially long minimal solution we also prove that the problem of plan existence for planning problems with multivalued variables and chain causal graphs is nphard finally we show that plan existence for planning problems with binary state variables and polytree causal graphs is npcomplete
