we investigate the space efficiency of a propositional    knowledge representation pkr formalism intuitively the space    efficiency of a formalism f in representing a certain piece of    knowledge a is the size of the shortest formula of f that    represents a in this paper we assume that knowledge is    either a set of propositional interpretations models or a set of    propositional formulae theorems we provide a formal way of    talking about the relative ability of pkr formalisms to compactly    represent a set of models or a set of theorems we introduce two new    compactness measures the corresponding classes and show that the    relative space efficiency of a pkr formalism in representing    modelstheorems is directly related to such classes in particular    we consider formalisms for nonmonotonic reasoning such as    circumscription and default logic as well as belief revision    operators and the stable model semantics for logic programs with    negation one interesting result is that formalisms with the same    time complexity do not necessarily belong to the same space    efficiency class
