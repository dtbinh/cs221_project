partially observable markov decision processes pomdps    provide an elegant mathematical framework for modeling complex    decision and planning problems in stochastic domains in which states    of the system are observable only indirectly via a set of imperfect    or noisy observations the modeling advantage of pomdps however    comes at a price  exact methods for solving them are computationally    very expensive and thus applicable in practice only to very simple    problems we focus on efficient approximation heuristic methods that    attempt to alleviate the computational problem and trade off accuracy    for speed we have two objectives here first we survey various    approximation methods analyze their properties and relations and    provide some new insights into their differences second we present a    number of new approximation methods and novel refinements of existing    techniques the theoretical results are supported by experiments on a    problem from the agent navigation domain
