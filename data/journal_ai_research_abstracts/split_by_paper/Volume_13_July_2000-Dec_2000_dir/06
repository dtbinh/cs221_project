recently model checking representation and search techniques    were shown to be efficiently applicable to planning in particular to    nondeterministic planning such planning approaches use ordered    binary decision diagrams obdds to encode a planning domain as a    nondeterministic finite automaton and then apply fast algorithms from    model checking to search for a solution obdds can effectively scale    and can provide universal plans for complex planning domains we are    particularly interested in addressing the complexities arising in    nondeterministic multiagent domains  in this article we present    umop a new universal obddbased planning framework for    nondeterministic multiagent domains we introduce a new planning    domain description language nadl to specify nondeterministic    multiagent domains  the language contributes the explicit definition    of controllable agents and uncontrollable environment agents we    describe the syntax and semantics of nadl and show how to build an    efficient obddbased representation of an nadl description  the umop    planning system uses nadl and different obddbased universal planning    algorithms it includes the previously developed strong and strong    cyclic planning algorithms in addition we introduce our new    optimistic planning algorithm that relaxes optimality guarantees and    generates plausible universal plans in some domains where no strong    nor strong cyclic solution exists we present empirical results    applying umop to domains ranging from deterministic and singleagent    with no environment actions to nondeterministic and multiagent with    complex environment actions umop is shown to be a rich and efficient    planning system
