we tackle the problem of planning in nondeterministic    domains by presenting a new approach to conformant planning    conformant planning is the problem of finding a sequence of actions    that is guaranteed to achieve the goal despite the nondeterminism of    the domain our approach is based on the representation of the    planning domain as a finite state automaton we use symbolic model    checking techniques in particular binary decision diagrams to    compactly represent and efficiently search the automaton in this    paper we make the following contributions first we present a general    planning algorithm for conformant planning which applies to fully    nondeterministic domains with uncertainty in the initial condition    and in action effects the algorithm is based on a breadthfirst    backward search and returns conformant plans of minimal length if a    solution to the planning problem exists otherwise it terminates    concluding that the problem admits no conformant solution second we    provide a symbolic representation of the search space based on binary    decision diagrams bdds which is the basis for search techniques    derived from symbolic model checking the symbolic representation    makes it possible to analyze potentially large sets of states and    transitions in a single computation step thus providing for an    efficient implementation  third we present cmbp conformant model    based planner an efficient implementation of the data structures and    algorithm described above directly based on bdd manipulations which    allows for a compact representation of the search layers and an    efficient implementation of the search steps finally we present an    experimental comparison of our approach with the stateoftheart    conformant planners cgp qbfplan and gpt our analysis includes all    the planning problems from the distribution packages of these systems    plus other problems defined to stress a number of specific factors    our approach appears to be the most effective cmbp is strictly more    expressive than qbfplan and cgp and in all the problems where a    comparison is possible cmbp outperforms its competitors sometimes by    orders of magnitude
