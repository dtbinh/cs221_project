the goal of this research is to develop agents that     are adaptive and predictable and timely at first blush     these three requirements seem contradictory for example      adaptation risks introducing undesirable side effects     thereby making agents behavior less predictable furthermore    although formal verification can assist in ensuring    behavioral predictability it is known to be timeconsuming  our solution to the challenge of satisfying all three    requirements is the following agents have finitestate    automaton plans which are adapted online via evolutionary    learning perturbation operators to ensure that critical    behavioral constraints are always satisfied agents plans    are first formally verified they are then reverified after    every adaptation if reverification concludes that constraints    are violated the plans are repaired the main objective of     this paper is to improve the efficiency of reverification     after learning so that agents have a sufficiently rapid     response time we present two solutions positive results     that certain learning operators are a priori guaranteed to    preserve useful classes of behavioral assurance constraints    which implies that no reverification is needed for these     operators and efficient incremental reverification algorithms     for those learning operators that have negative a priori results
