as planning is applied to larger and richer domains the    effort involved in constructing domain descriptions increases and    becomes a significant burden on the human application designer if    general planners are to be applied successfully to large and complex    domains it is necessary to provide the domain designer with some    assistance in building correctly encoded domains  one way of doing    this is to provide domainindependent techniques for extracting from    a domain description knowledge that is implicit in that description    and that can assist domain designers in debugging domain    descriptions this knowledge can also be exploited to improve the    performance of planners several researchers have explored the    potential of state invariants in speeding up the performance of    domainindependent planners in this paper we describe a process by    which state invariants can be extracted from the automatically    inferred type structure of a domain these techniques are being    developed for exploitation by stan a graphplan based planner that    employs state analysis techniques to enhance its performance
