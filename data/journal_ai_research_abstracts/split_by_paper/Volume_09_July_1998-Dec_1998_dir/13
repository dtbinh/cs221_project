a  artale and  e  franconi 1998 a temporal description logic for reasoning about actions and plans volume 9 pages 463506

a class of intervalbased temporal languages for uniformly    representing and reasoning about actions and plans is presented    actions are represented by describing what is true while the action    itself is occurring and plans are constructed by temporally relating    actions and world states  the temporal languages are members of the    family of description logics which are characterized by high    expressivity combined with good computational properties  the    subsumption problem for a class of temporal description logics is    investigated and sound and complete decision procedures are given the    basic language tlf is considered first it is the composition of a    temporal logic tl  able to express interval temporal networks     together with the nontemporal logic f  a feature description logic    it is proven that subsumption in this language is an npcomplete    problem then it is shown how to reason with the more expressive    languages tlufu and tlalcf the former adds disjunction both at the    temporal and nontemporal sides of the language the latter extends    the nontemporal side with setvalued features ie roles and a    propositionally complete language
