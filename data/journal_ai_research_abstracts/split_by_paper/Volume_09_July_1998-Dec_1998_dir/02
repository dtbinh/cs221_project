honorable mention for the 2003 ijcaijair best paper prize

we examine the computational complexity of testing and    finding small plans in probabilistic planning domains with both flat    and propositional representations  the complexity of plan evaluation    and existence varies with the plan type sought we examine totally    ordered plans acyclic plans and looping plans and partially ordered    plans under three natural definitions of plan value  we show that    problems of interest are complete for a variety of complexity classes    pl p np conp pp nppp conppp and pspace  in the process of    proving that certain planning problems are complete for nppp we    introduce a new basic npppcomplete problem emajsat which    generalizes the standard boolean satisfiability problem to    computations involving probabilistic quantities our results suggest    that the development of good heuristics for emajsat could be    important for the creation of efficient algorithms for a wide variety    of problems
