it is common to view programs as a combination of logic and    control the logic part defines what the program must do the control    part  how to do it  the logic programming paradigm was developed    with the intention of separating the logic from the control    recently extensive research has been conducted on automatic    generation of control for logic programs  only a few of these works    considered the issue of automatic generation of control for improving    the efficiency of logic programs  in this paper we present a novel    algorithm for automatic finding of lowestcost subgoal orderings  the    algorithm works using the divideandconquer strategy  the given set    of subgoals is partitioned into smaller sets based on cooccurrence    of free variables the subsets are ordered recursively and merged    yielding a provably optimal order  we experimentally demonstrate the    utility of the algorithm by testing it in several domains and discuss    the possibilities of its cooperation with other existing methods
