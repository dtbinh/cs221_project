we present a new approach to path planning called the    ariadnes clew algorithm it is designed to find paths in    highdimensional continuous spaces and applies to robots with many    degrees of freedom in static as well as dynamic environments  ones    where obstacles may move the ariadnes clew algorithm comprises two    subalgorithms called search and explore applied in an interleaved    manner explore builds a representation of the accessible space while    search looks for the target both are posed as optimization problems    we describe a real implementation of the algorithm to plan paths for a    six degrees of freedom arm in a dynamic environment where another six    degrees of freedom arm is used as a moving obstacle experimental    results show that a path is found in about one second without any    preprocessing
