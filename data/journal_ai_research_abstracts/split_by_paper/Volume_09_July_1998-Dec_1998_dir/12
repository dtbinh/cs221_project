j  rintanen 1998 complexity of prioritized default logics volume 9 pages 423461

in default reasoning usually not all possible ways of    resolving conflicts between default rules are acceptable  criteria    expressing acceptable ways of resolving the conflicts may be hardwired    in the inference mechanism for example specificity in inheritance    reasoning can be handled this way or they may be given abstractly as    an ordering on the default rules  in this article we investigate    formalizations of the latter approach in reiters default logic  our    goal is to analyze and compare the computational properties of three    such formalizations in terms of their computational complexity the    prioritized default logics of baader and hollunder and brewka and a    prioritized default logic that is based on lexicographic comparison    the analysis locates the propositional variants of these logics on the    second and third levels of the polynomial hierarchy and identifies    the boundary between tractable and intractable inference for    restricted classes of prioritized default theories
