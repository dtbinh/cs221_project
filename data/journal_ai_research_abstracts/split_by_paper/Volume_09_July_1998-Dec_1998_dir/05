many of the artificial intelligence techniques developed to    date rely on heuristic search through large spaces  unfortunately    the size of these spaces and the corresponding computational effort    reduce the applicability of otherwise novel and effective algorithms    a number of parallel and distributed approaches to search have    considerably improved the performance of the search process        our goal is to develop an architecture that automatically selects    parallel search strategies for optimal performance on a variety of    search problems  in this paper we describe one such architecture    realized in the eureka system which combines the benefits of    many different approaches to parallel heuristic search  through    empirical and theoretical analyses we observe that features of the    problem space directly affect the choice of optimal parallel search    strategy  we then employ machine learning techniques to select the    optimal parallel search strategy for a given problem space  when a    new search task is input to the system eureka uses features    describing the search space and the chosen architecture to    automatically select the appropriate search strategy  eureka    has been tested on a mimd parallel processor a distributed network of    workstations and a single workstation using multithreading  results    generated from fifteen puzzle problems robot arm motion problems    artificial search spaces and planning problems indicate that     eureka outperforms any of the tested strategies used exclusively for    all problem instances and is able to greatly reduce the search time    for these applications
