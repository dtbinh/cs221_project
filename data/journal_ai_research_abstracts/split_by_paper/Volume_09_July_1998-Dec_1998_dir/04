c  backstrom 1998 computational aspects of reordering plans volume 9 pages 99137

this article studies the problem of modifying the action    ordering of a plan in order to optimise the plan according to various    criteria  one of these criteria is to make a plan less constrained    and the other is to minimize its parallel execution time  three    candidate definitions are proposed for the first of these criteria    constituting a sequence of increasing optimality guarantees  two of    these are based on deordering plans which means that ordering    relations may only be removed not added while the third one uses    reordering where arbitrary modifications to the ordering are allowed    it is shown that only the weakest one of the three criteria is    tractable to achieve the other two being nphard and even difficult    to approximate  similarly optimising the parallel execution time of    a plan is studied both for deordering and reordering of plans  in the    general case both of these computations are nphard  however it is    shown that optimal deorderings can be computed in polynomial time for    a class of planning languages based on the notions of producers    consumers and threats which includes most of the commonly used    planning languages  computing optimal reorderings can potentially    lead to even faster parallel executions but this problem remains    nphard and difficult to approximate even under quite severe restrictions
