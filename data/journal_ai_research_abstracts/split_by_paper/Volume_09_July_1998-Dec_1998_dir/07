using an improved backtrack algorithm with sophisticated    pruning techniques we revise previous observations correlating a high    frequency of hard to solve hamiltonian cycle instances with the gnm    phase transition between hamiltonicity and nonhamiltonicity instead    all tested graphs of 100 to 1500 vertices are easily solved       when we artificially restrict the degree sequence with a bounded    maximum degree although there is some increase in difficulty the    frequency of hard graphs is still low  when we consider more regular    graphs based on a generalization of knights tours we observe    frequent instances of really hard graphs but on these the average    degree is bounded by a constant  we design a set of graphs with a    feature our algorithm is unable to detect and so are very hard for our    algorithm but in these we can vary the average degree from o1 to    on  we have so far found no class of graphs correlated with the    gnm phase transition which asymptotically produces a high frequency    of hard instances
