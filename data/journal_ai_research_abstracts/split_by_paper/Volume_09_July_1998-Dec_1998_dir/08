scheduling dialogs during which people negotiate the    times of appointments are common in everyday life  this paper    reports the results of an indepth empirical investigation of    resolving explicit temporal references in scheduling dialogs  there    are four phases of this work data annotation and evaluation model    development system implementation and evaluation and model    evaluation and analysis  the system and model were developed    primarily on one set of data and then applied later to a much more    complex data set to assess the generalizability of the model for the    task being performed  many different types of empirical methods are    applied to pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of the approach    detailed annotation instructions were developed and an intercoder    reliability study was performed showing that naive annotators can    reliably perform the targeted annotations  a fully automatic system    has been developed and evaluated on unseen test data with good    results on both data sets  we adopt a pure realization of a    recencybased focus model to identify precisely when it is and is not    adequate for the task being addressed  in addition to system results    an indepth evaluation of the model itself is presented based on    detailed manual annotations  the results are that few errors occur    specifically due to the model of focus being used and the set of    anaphoric relations defined in the model are low in ambiguity for both    data sets
