this paper introduces antnet a novel approach to the    adaptive learning of routing tables in communications networks    antnet is a distributed mobile agents based monte carlo system that    was inspired by recent work on the ant colony metaphor for solving    optimization problems antnets agents concurrently explore the    network and exchange collected information  the communication among    the agents is indirect and asynchronous mediated by the network    itself this form of communication is typical of social insects and is    called stigmergy  we compare our algorithm with six stateoftheart    routing algorithms coming from the telecommunications and machine    learning fields  the algorithms performance is evaluated over a set    of realistic testbeds  we run many experiments over real and    artificial ip datagram networks with increasing number of nodes and    under several paradigmatic spatial and temporal traffic distributions    results are very encouraging  antnet showed superior performance    under all the experimental conditions with respect to its competitors    we analyze the main characteristics of the algorithm and try to    explain the reasons for its superiority
