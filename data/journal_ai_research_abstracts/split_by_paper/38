we consider the problem of belief tracking in a planning setting where states are valuations over a set of variables that are partially observable and beliefs stand for the sets of states that are possible while the problem is intractable in the worst case it has been recently shown that in deterministic conformant and contingent problems belief tracking is exponential in a width parameter that is often bounded and small in this work we extend these results in two ways first we introduce a width notion that applies to nondeterministic problems as well develop a factored belief tracking algorithm that is exponential in the problem width and show how it applies to existing benchmarks second we introduce a meaningful powerful and sound approximation scheme beam tracking that is exponential in a smaller parameter  the problem causal width and has much broader applicability we illustrate the value of this algorithm over large instances of problems such as battleship minesweeper and wumpus where it yields stateoftheart performance in realtime



word sense disambiguation wsd aims to determine the meaning of a word in context and successful approaches are known to benefit many applications in natural language processing  although supervised learning has been shown to provide superior wsd performance current senseannotated corpora do not contain a sufficient number of instances per word type to train supervised systems for all words  while unsupervised techniques have been proposed to overcome this data sparsity problem such techniques have not outperformed supervised methods in this paper we propose a new approach to building semisupervised wsd systems that combines a small amount of senseannotated data with information from word sense induction a fullyunsupervised technique that automatically learns the different senses of a word based on how it is used in three experiments we show how sense induction models may be effectively combined to ultimately produce highperformance semisupervised wsd systems that exceed the performance of stateoftheart supervised wsd techniques trained on the same senseannotated data we anticipate that our results and released software will also benefit evaluation practices for sense induction systems and those working in lowresource languages by demonstrating how to quickly produce accurate wsd systems with minimal annotation effort
