multilingual text classification mltc is a text classification task in which documents are written each in one among a set l of natural languages and in which all documents must be classified under the same classification scheme irrespective of language there are two main variants of mltc namely crosslingual text classification cltc and polylingual text classification pltc in pltc which is the focus of this paper we assume differently from cltc that for each language in l there is a representative set of training documents pltc consists of improving the accuracy of each of the l monolingual classifiers by also leveraging the training documents written in the other l 8722 1 languages the obvious solution consisting of generating a single polylingual classifier from the juxtaposed monolingual vector spaces is usually infeasible since the dimensionality of the resulting vector space is roughly l times that of a monolingual one and is thus often unmanageable as a response the use of machine translation tools or multilingual dictionaries has been proposed however these resources are not always available or are not always free to use

one machinetranslationfree and dictionaryfree method that to the best of our knowledge has never been applied to pltc before is random indexing ri we analyse ri in terms of space and time efficiency and propose a particular configuration of it that we dub lightweight random indexing  lri by running experiments on two well known public benchmarks reuters rcv1rcv2 a comparable corpus and jrcacquis a parallel one we show lri to outperform both in terms of effectiveness and efficiency a number of previously proposed machinetranslationfree and dictionaryfree pltc methods that we use as baselines
