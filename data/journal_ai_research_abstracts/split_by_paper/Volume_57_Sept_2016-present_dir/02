karsten  martiny and ralf  m246ller 2016 pdt logic a probabilistic doxastic temporal logic for reasoning about beliefs in multiagent systems volume 57 pages 39112

we present probabilistic doxastic temporal pdt logic a formalism to represent and reason about probabilistic beliefs and their temporal evolution in multiagent systems this formalism enables the quantification of agents beliefs through probability intervals and incorporates an explicit notion of time we discuss how over time agents dynamically change their beliefs in facts temporal rules and other agents beliefs with respect to any new information they receive we introduce an appropriate formal semantics for pdt logic and show that it is decidable alternative options of specifying problems in pdt logic are possible for these problem specifications we develop different satisfiability checking algorithms and provide complexity results for the respective decision problems the use of probability intervals enables a formal representation of probabilistic knowledge without enforcing possibly incorrect exact probability values by incorporating an explicit notion of time pdt logic provides enriched possibilities to represent and reason about temporal relations
