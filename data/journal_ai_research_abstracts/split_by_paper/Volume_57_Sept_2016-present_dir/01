simone  villa and fabio  stella 2016 learning continuous time bayesian networks in nonstationary domains volume 57 pages 137

nonstationary continuous time bayesian networks are introduced they allow the parents set of each node to change over continuous time three settings are developed for learning nonstationary continuous time bayesian networks from data known transition times known number of epochs and unknown number of epochs a score function for each setting is derived and the corresponding learning algorithm is developed a set of numerical experiments on synthetic data is used to compare the effectiveness of nonstationary continuous time bayesian networks to that of nonstationary dynamic bayesian networks furthermore the performance achieved by nonstationary continuous time bayesian networks is compared to that achieved by stateoftheart algorithms on four realworld datasets namely drosophila saccharomyces cerevisiae songbird and macroeconomics
