p  d turney 1995 costsensitive classification empirical evaluation of a hybrid    genetic decision tree induction algorithm volume 2 pages 369409

this paper introduces icet a new algorithm for   costsensitive classification icet uses a genetic algorithm to evolve   a population of biases for a decision tree induction algorithm the   fitness function of the genetic algorithm is the average cost of   classification when using the decision tree including both the costs   of tests features measurements and the costs of classification   errors icet is compared here with three other algorithms for   costsensitive classification  eg2 csid3 and idx  and also with   c45 which classifies without regard to cost the five algorithms are   evaluated empirically on five realworld medical datasets three sets   of experiments are performed  the first set examines the baseline   performance of the five algorithms on the five datasets and   establishes that icet performs significantly better than its   competitors the second set tests the robustness of icet under a   variety of conditions and shows that icet maintains its advantage the   third set looks at icets search in bias space and discovers a way to   improve the search
