theory revision integrates inductive learning and background   knowledge by combining training examples with a coarse domain theory   to produce a more accurate theory  there are two challenges that   theory revision and other theoryguided systems face  first a   representation language appropriate for the initial theory may be   inappropriate for an improved theory  while the original   representation may concisely express the initial theory a more   accurate theory forced to use that same representation may be bulky   cumbersome and difficult to reach  second a theory structure   suitable for a coarse domain theory may be insufficient for a   finetuned theory  systems that produce only small local changes to   a theory have limited value for accomplishing complex structural   alterations that may be required      consequently advanced theoryguided learning systems require flexible    representation and flexible structure  an analysis of various theory    revision systems and theoryguided learning systems reveals specific    strengths and weaknesses in terms of these two desired properties     designed to capture the underlying qualities of each system a new    system uses theoryguided constructive induction  experiments in    three domains show improvement over previous theoryguided systems     this leads to a study of the behavior limitations and potential of    theoryguided constructive induction
