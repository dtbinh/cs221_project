we present algorithms that learn certain classes of   functionfree recursive logic programs in polynomial time from   equivalence queries  in particular we show that a single kary   recursive constantdepth determinate clause is learnable twoclause   programs consisting of one learnable recursive clause and one   constantdepth determinate nonrecursive clause are also learnable if   an additional basecase oracle is assumed  these results   immediately imply the paclearnability of these classes  although   these classes of learnable recursive programs are very constrained it   is shown in a companion paper that they are maximally general in that   generalizing either class in any natural way leads to a   computationally difficult learning problem  thus taken together with   its companion paper this paper establishes a boundary of efficient   learnability for recursive logic programs
