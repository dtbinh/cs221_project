multiclass learning problems involve finding a definitionfor an unknown function ifix whose range is a discrete setcontaining iki  2 values ie iki classes  thedefinition is acquired by studying collections of training examples ofthe form xi i f ixi  existing approaches tomulticlass learning problems include direct application of multiclassalgorithms such as the decisiontree algorithms c45 and cartapplication of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individualbinary functions for each of the i k i classes and application ofbinary concept learning algorithms with distributed outputrepresentations  this paper compares these three approaches to a newtechnique in which errorcorrecting codes are employed as adistributed output representation  we show that these outputrepresentations improve the generalization performance of both c45and backpropagation on a wide range of multiclass learning tasks  wealso demonstrate that this approach is robust with respect to changesin the size of the training sample the assignment of distributedrepresentations to particular classes and the application ofoverfitting avoidance techniques such as decisiontree pruningfinally we show thatlike the other methodsthe errorcorrectingcode technique can provide reliable class probability estimatestaken together these results demonstrate that errorcorrecting outputcodes provide a generalpurpose method for improving the performanceof inductive learning programs on multiclass problems
