p  david 1995 using pivot consistency to decompose and solve functional csps volume 2 pages 447474

many studies have been carried out in order to increase thesearch efficiency of constraint satisfaction problems among themsome make use of i structural i properties of the constraintnetwork others take into account i semantic i properties of theconstraints generally assuming that i all i the constraints possessthe given property  in this paper we propose a new decompositionmethod benefiting from both semantic properties of i functional iconstraints not i bijective i constraints and structuralproperties of the network furthermore not all the constraints needto be functional  we show that under some conditions the existenceof solutions can be guaranteed  we first characterize a particularsubset of the variables which we name a i root seti   we thenintroduce i pivot consistency i a new local consistency which is aweak form of path consistency and can be achieved in on2d2complexity instead of on3d3 for path consistency and wepresent associated properties in particular we show that anyconsistent instantiation of the root set can be linearly extended to a solution which leads to the presentation of the aforementioned new method for solving by decomposing functional csps
