for many years the intuitions underlying partialorder   planning were largely taken for granted only in the past few years   has there been renewed interest in the fundamental principles   underlying this paradigm  in this paper we present a rigorous   comparative analysis of partialorder and totalorder planning by   focusing on two specific planners that can be directly compared we   show that there are some subtle assumptions that underly the   widespread intuitions regarding the supposed efficiency of   partialorder planning for instance the superiority ofpartialorder   planning can depend critically upon the search strategy and the   structure of the search space  understanding the underlying   assumptions is crucial for constructing efficient planners
