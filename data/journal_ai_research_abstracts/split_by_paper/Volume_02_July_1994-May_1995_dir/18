s  j russell and  d  subramanian 1995 provably boundedoptimal agents volume 2 pages 575609

since its inception artificial intelligence has relied  upon a theoretical foundation centered around i perfect rationality i as   the desired property of intelligent systems we argue as others have   done that this foundation is inadequate because it imposes   fundamentally unsatisfiable requirements as a result there has   arisen a wide gap between theory and practice in ai hindering   progress in the field we propose instead a property called i bounded   optimalityi roughly speaking an agent is boundedoptimal if its   program is a solution to the constrained optimization problem   presented by its architecture and the task environment we show how to   construct agents with this property for a simple class of machine   architectures in a broad class of realtime environments we   illustrate these results using a simple model of an automated mail   sorting facility  we also define a weaker property i asymptotic   bounded optimalityi abo that generalizes the notion of optimality in   classical complexity theory  we then construct i universal i abo   programs ie programs that are abo no matter what realtime   constraints are applied  universal abo programs can be used as   building blocks for more complex systems we conclude with a   discussion of the prospects for bounded optimality as a theoretical   basis for ai and relate it to similar trends in philosophy   economics and game theory
