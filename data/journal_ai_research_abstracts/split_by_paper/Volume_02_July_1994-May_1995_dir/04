s  safra and  m  tennenholtz 1994 on planning while learning volume 2 pages 111129

this paper introduces a framework for planning while   learning where an agent is given a goal to achieve in anenvironment   whose behavior is only partially known to the agent      we discuss the tractability of various plandesign processes we   show that for a large natural class of planning while learning   systems a plan can be presented and verified in a reasonable time   however coming up algorithmically with a plan even for simple   classes of systems is apparently intractable      we emphasize the role of offline plandesign processes andshow   that in most natural cases the verification projection part canbe   carried out in an efficient algorithmic manner
