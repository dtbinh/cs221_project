j  ortega 1995 on the informativeness of the dna promoter sequences domain theory volume 2 pages 361367

the dna promoter sequences domain theory and database havebecome popular for testing systems that integrate empirical andanalytical learning  this note reports a simple change andreinterpretation of the domain theory in terms of mofn conceptsinvolving no learning that results in an accuracy of 934 on the 106items of the database  moreover an exhaustive search of the space ofmofn domain theory interpretations indicates that the expectedaccuracy of a randomly chosen interpretation is 765 and that amaximum accuracy of 972 is achieved in 12 cases  this demonstratesthe informativeness of the domain theory without the complications ofunderstanding the interactions between various learning algorithms andthe theory  in addition our results help characterize the difficultyof learning using the dna promoters theory
