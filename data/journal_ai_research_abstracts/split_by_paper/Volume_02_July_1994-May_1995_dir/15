we study the process of multiagent reinforcement learning in the context ofload balancing in a distributed system without use of either centralcoordination or explicit communication  we first define a precise frameworkin which to study adaptive load balancing important features of which are itsstochastic nature and the purely local information available to individualagents  given this framework we show illuminating results on the interplaybetween basic adaptive behavior parameters and their effect on systemefficiency  we then investigate the properties of adaptive load balancing inheterogeneous populations and address the issue of exploration vsexploitation in that context  finally we show that naive use ofcommunication may not improve and might even harm system efficiency
