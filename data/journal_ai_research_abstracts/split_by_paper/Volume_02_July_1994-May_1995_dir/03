information extraction is the task of automaticallypicking   up information of interest from an unconstrained text  informationof   interest is usually extracted in two steps  first sentence level   processing locates relevant pieces of information scatteredthroughout   the text second discourse processing merges coreferential   information to generate the output  in the first step pieces of   information are locally identified without recognizing any   relationships among them  a key word search or simple patternsearch   can achieve this purpose  the second step requires deeperknowledge   in order to understand relationships among separately identified   pieces of information  previous information extraction systems   focused on the first step partly because they were not required to   link up each piece of information with other pieces  to link the   extracted pieces of information and map them onto a structuredoutput   format complex discourse processing is essential  this paperreports   on a japanese information extraction system that merges information   using a pattern matcher and discourse processor  evaluationresults   show a high level of system performance which approaches human   performance
