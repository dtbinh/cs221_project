given a knowledge base ikbi containing firstorder and statistical facts we consider a principled method called the irandomworlds methodi for computing a degree of belief that some formula iphii holds given ikbi  if  we are reasoning about a world or system consisting of ini individuals then we can consider all possible worlds or firstorder models withdomain i1ni that satisfy ikbi and compute thefraction of them in which iphii is true we define the degree of belief to be the asymptotic value of this fraction as ini grows large  we show that when the vocabulary underlying iphii andikbi uses constants and unary predicates only we can naturally associate an ientropyi with each world as ini grows largerthere are many more worlds with higher entropy  therefore we can usea i maximumentropyi computation to compute the degree of belief this result is in a similar spirit to previous work in physics and artificial intelligence but is far more general  of equal interest to the result itself are the limitations on its scope  most importantly the restriction to unary predicates seems necessary although the randomworlds method makes sense in general the connection to maximum entropy seems to disappear in the nonunary case  these observations suggest unexpected limitations to the applicability of maximumentropy methods
