s  soderland and  w  lehnert 1994 wrapup a trainable discourse module for information extraction volume 2 pages 131158

the vast amounts of online text now available have ledto   renewed interest in information extraction ie systems thatanalyze   unrestricted text producing a structured representation ofselected   information from the text this paper presents a novel approachthat   uses machine learning to acquire knowledge for some of the higher   level ie processing  wrapup is a trainable ie discourse component   that makes intersentential inferences and identifies logicalrelations   among information extracted from the text  previous corpusbased   approaches were limited to lower level processing such as   partofspeech tagging lexical disambiguation and dictionary   construction  wrapup is fully trainable and not onlyautomatically   decides what classifiers are needed but even derives the featureset   for each classifier automatically performance equals that of a   partially trainable discourse module requiring manual customization   for each domain
