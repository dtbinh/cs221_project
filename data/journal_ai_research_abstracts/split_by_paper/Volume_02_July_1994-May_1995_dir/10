the paradigms of transformational planning casebased   planning and plan debugging all involve a process known as i plan   adaptation i  modifying or repairing an old plan so it solves a new   problem  in this paper we provide a domainindependent algorithm for   plan adaptation demonstrate that it is sound complete and   systematic and compare it to other adaptation algorithms in the   literature    our approach is based on a view of planning as searching a graph of   partial plans  generative planning starts at the graphs root and   moves from node to node using planrefinement operators  in planning   by adaptation a library plan  an arbitrary node in the plan   graph  is the starting point for the search and the planadaptation   algorithm can apply both the same refinement operators available to a   generative planner and can also retract constraints and steps from the   plan  our algorithms completeness ensures that the adaptation   algorithm will eventually search the entire graph and its systematicity    ensures that it will do so without redundantly searching any parts of   the graph
