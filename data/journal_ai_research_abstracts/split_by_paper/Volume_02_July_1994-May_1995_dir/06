w  l buntine 1994 operations for learning with graphical models volume 2 pages 159225

this paper is a multidisciplinary review of empirical  statistical learning from a graphical model perspective  wellknown  examples of graphical models include bayesian networks directed  graphs representing a markov chain and undirected networks  representing a markov field  these graphical models are extended to  model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of  plates  graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a  problem are provided including decomposition differentiation andthe  manipulation of probability models from the exponential family  two  standard algorithm schemas for learning are reviewed in a graphical  framework gibbs sampling and the expectation maximizationalgorithm  using these operations and schemas some popular algorithms can be  synthesized from their graphical specification  this includes  versions of linear regression techniques for feedforward networks  and learning gaussian and discrete bayesian networks from data  the  paper concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and  summarizing how some popular algorithms fall within the framework  presented  the main original contributions here are the decompositiontechniques  and the demonstration that graphical models provide a framework for  understanding and developing complex learning algorithms
