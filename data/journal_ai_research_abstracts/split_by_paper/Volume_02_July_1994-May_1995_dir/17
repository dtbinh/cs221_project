in a companion paper it was shown that the class of constantdepth determinate kary recursive clauses is efficiently learnable in this paper we present negative results showing that any natural generalization of this class is hard to learn in valiants model of paclearnability in particular we show that the following program classes are cryptographically hard to learn programs with an unbounded number of constantdepth linear recursive clauses programs with one constantdepth determinate clause containing an unbounded number of recursive calls and programs with one linear recursive clause of constant locality these results immediately imply the nonlearnability of any more general class of programs we also show that learning a constantdepth determinate program with either two linear recursive clauses or one linear recursive clause and one nonrecursive clause is as hard as learning boolean dnf together with positive results from the companion paper these negative results establish a boundary of efficient learnability for recursive functionfree clauses
