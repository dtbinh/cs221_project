this article describes a new system for induction ofoblique   decision trees  this system oc1 combines deterministic   hillclimbing with two forms of randomization to find a goodoblique   split in the form of a hyperplane at each node of a decisiontree   oblique decision tree methods are tuned especially for domains in   which the attributes are numeric although they can be adapted to   symbolic or mixed symbolicnumeric attributes  we presentextensive   empirical studies using both real and artificial data thatanalyze   oc1s ability to construct oblique trees that are smaller and more   accurate than their axisparallel counterparts  we also examinethe   benefits of randomization for the construction of oblique decisiontrees
