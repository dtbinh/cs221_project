we propose a stochastic fault diagnosis algorithm called safari which trades off guarantees of computing minimal diagnoses for computational efficiency we empirically demonstrate using the 74xxx and iscas85 suites of benchmark combinatorial circuits that safari achieves several ordersofmagnitude speedup over two wellknown deterministic algorithms cda and ha for multiplefault diagnoses further safari can compute a range of multiplefault diagnoses that cda and ha cannot we also prove that safari is optimal for a range of propositional fault models such as the widelyused weakfault models models with ignorance of abnormal behavior we discuss the optimality of safari in a class of strongfault circuit models with stuckat failure modes by modeling the algorithm itself as a markov chain we provide exact bounds on the minimality of the diagnosis computed safari also displays strong anytime behavior and will return a diagnosis after any nontrivial inference time
