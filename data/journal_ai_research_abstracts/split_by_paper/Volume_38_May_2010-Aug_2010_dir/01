s  katrenko p  w adriaans and m  van someren 2010 using local alignments for relation recognition volume 38 pages 148

this paper discusses the problem of marrying structural similarity with semantic relatedness for information extraction from text aiming at accurate recognition of relations we introduce local alignment kernels and explore various possibilities of using them for this task we give a definition of a local alignment la kernel based on the smithwaterman score as a sequence similarity measure and proceed with a range of possibilities for computing similarity between elements of sequences we show how distributional similarity measures obtained from unlabeled data can be incorporated into the learning task as semantic knowledge our experiments suggest that the la kernel yields promising results on various biomedical corpora outperforming two baselines by a large margin additional series of experiments have been conducted on the data sets of seven general relation types where the performance of the la kernel is comparable to the current stateoftheart results
