grounding is the task of reducing a firstorder theory and finite domain to an equivalent propositional theory it is used as preprocessing phase in many logicbased reasoning systems such systems provide a rich firstorder input language to a user and can rely on efficient propositional solvers to perform the actual reasoning 

we first present our method for classical firstorder logic fo theories then we extend it to foid the extension of fo with inductive definitions which allows for more concise and comprehensive input theories we discuss implementation issues and experimentally validate the practical applicability of our method
