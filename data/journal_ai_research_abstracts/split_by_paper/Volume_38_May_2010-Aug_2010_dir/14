j  de bruijn and s  heymans 2010 logical foundations of rdfs with datatypes  volume 38 pages 535568

the resource description framework rdf is a semantic web standard that provides a data language simply called rdf as well as a lightweight ontology language called rdf schema we investigate embeddings of rdf in logic and show how standard logic programming and description logic technology can be used for reasoning with rdf we subsequently consider extensions of rdf with datatype support considering d entailment defined in the rdf semantics specification and d entailment a semantic weakening of d entailment introduced by ter horst we use the embeddings and properties of the logics to establish novel upper bounds for the complexity of deciding entailment we subsequently establish two novel lower bounds establishing that rdfs entailment is ptimecomplete and that simpled entailment is conphard when considering arbitrary datatypes both in the size of the entailing graph the results indicate that rdfs may not be as lightweight as one may expect
