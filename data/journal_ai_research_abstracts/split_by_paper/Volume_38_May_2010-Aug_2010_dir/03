distributed constraint optimization dcop problems are a popular way of formulating and solving agentcoordination problems a dcop problem is a problem where several agents coordinate their values such that the sum of the resulting constraint costs is minimal it is often desirable to solve dcop problems with memorybounded and asynchronous algorithms we introduce branchandbound adopt bnbadopt a memorybounded asynchronous dcop search algorithm that uses the messagepassing and communication framework of adopt modi shen tambe  yokoo 2005 a well known memorybounded asynchronous dcop search algorithm but changes the search strategy of adopt from bestfirst search to depthfirst branchandbound search our experimental results show that bnbadopt finds costminimal solutions up to one order of magnitude faster than adopt for a variety of large dcop problems and is as fast as ncbb a memorybounded synchronous dcop search algorithm for most of these dcop problems additionally it is often desirable to find boundederror solutions for dcop problems within a reasonable amount of time since finding costminimal solutions is nphard the existing boundederror approximation mechanism allows users only to specify an absolute error bound on the solution cost but a relative error bound is often more intuitive thus we present two new boundederror approximation mechanisms that allow for relative error bounds and implement them on top of bnbadopt
