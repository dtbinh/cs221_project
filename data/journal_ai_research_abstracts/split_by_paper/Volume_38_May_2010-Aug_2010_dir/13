we provide a series of algorithms demonstrating that solutions according to the fundamental gametheoretic solution concept of closed under rational behavior curb sets in twoplayer normalform games can be computed in polynomial time we also discuss extensions to nplayer games first we describe an algorithm that identifies all of a players best responses conditioned on the belief that the other player will play from within a given subset of its strategy space this algorithm serves as a subroutine in a series of polynomialtime algorithms for finding all minimal curb sets one minimal curb set and the smallest minimal curb set in a game we then show that the complexity of finding a nash equilibrium can be exponential only in the size of a games smallest curb set related to this we show that the smallest curb set can be an arbitrarily small portion of the game but it can also be arbitrarily larger than the supports of its only enclosed nash equilibrium we test our algorithms empirically and find that most commonly studied academic games tend to have either very large or very small minimal curb sets
