j  wu and r  givan 2010 automatic induction of bellmanerror features for probabilistic planning volume 38 pages 687755

domainspecific features are important in representing problem structure throughout machine learning and decisiontheoretic planning in planning once state features are provided domainindependent algorithms such as approximate value iteration can learn weighted combinations of those features that often perform well as heuristic estimates of state value eg distance to the goal successful applications in realworld domains often require features crafted by human experts here we propose automatic processes for learning useful domainspecific feature sets with little or no human intervention our methods select and add features that describe statespace regions of high inconsistency in the bellman equation statewise bellman error during approximate value iteration our method can be applied using any realvaluedfeature hypothesis space and corresponding learning method for selecting features from training sets of statevalue pairs we evaluate the method with hypothesis spaces defined by both relational and propositional feature languages using nine probabilistic planning domains we show that approximate value iteration using a relational feature space performs at the stateoftheart in domainindependent stochastic relational planning our method provides the first domainindependent approach that plays tetris successfully without humanengineered features
