coalitional games serve the purpose of modeling payoff distribution problems in scenarios where agents can collaborate by forming coalitions in order to obtain higher worths than by acting in isolation in the classical transferable utility tu setting coalition worths can be freely distributed amongst agents however in several application scenarios this is not the case and the nontransferable utility setting ntu must be considered where additional applicationoriented constraints are imposed on the possible worth distributions

in this paper an approach to define ntu games is proposed which is based on describing allowed distributions via a set of mixedinteger linear constraints applied to an underlying tu game it is shown that such games allow nontransferable conditions on worth distributions to be specified in a natural and succinct way the properties and the relationships among the most prominent solution concepts for ntu games that hold when they are applied on mixedinteger constrained games are investigated finally a thorough analysis is carried out to assess the impact of issuing constraints on the computational complexity of some of these solution concepts
