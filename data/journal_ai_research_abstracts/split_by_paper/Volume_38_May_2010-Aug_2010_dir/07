call control features eg calldivert voicemail are primitive options to which users can subscribe offline to personalise their  service the configuration of a feature subscription involves choosing and sequencing features from a catalogue and is subject to  constraints that prevent undesirable feature interactions at runtime when the subscription requested by a user is inconsistent one  problem is to find an optimal relaxation  which is a generalisation of the feedback vertex  set problem on directed graphs and thus it is an nphard task we present several constraint programming formulations of the problem we also present formulations using partial  weighted maximum boolean satisfiability and mixed integer linear programming  we study all these formulations by experimentally comparing them  on a variety of randomly generated instances of the feature subscription problem
