this paper proposes a method to construct an adaptive agent that is universal with respect to a given class of experts where each expert is designed specifically for a particular environment this adaptive control problem is formalized as the problem of minimizing the relative entropy of the adaptive agent from the expert that is most suitable for the unknown environment if the agent is a passive observer then the optimal solution is the wellknown bayesian predictor however if the agent is active then its past actions need to be treated as causal interventions on the io stream rather than normal probability conditions here it is shown that the solution to this new variational problem is given by a stochastic controller called the bayesian control rule which implements adaptive behavior as a mixture of experts furthermore it is shown that under mild assumptions the bayesian control rule converges to the control law of the most suitable expert
