m  michelson and c  a knoblock 2010 constructing reference sets from unstructured ungrammatical text volume 38 pages 189221

vast amounts of text on the web are unstructured and ungrammatical such as classified ads auction listings forum postings etc we call such text posts despite their inconsistent structure and lack of grammar posts are full of useful information this paper presents work on semiautomatically building tables of relational information called reference sets by analyzing such posts directly reference sets can be applied to a number of tasks such as ontology maintenance and information extraction our referenceset construction method starts with just a small amount of background knowledge and constructs tuples representing the entities in the posts to form a reference set we also describe an extension to this approach for the special case where even this small amount of background knowledge is impossible to discover and use to evaluate the utility of the machineconstructed reference sets we compare them to manually constructed reference sets in the context of referencesetbased information extraction our results show the reference sets constructed by our method outperform manually constructed reference sets we also compare the referencesetbased extraction approach using the machineconstructed reference set to supervised extraction approaches using generic features these results demonstrate that using machineconstructed reference sets outperforms the supervised methods even though the supervised methods require training data
