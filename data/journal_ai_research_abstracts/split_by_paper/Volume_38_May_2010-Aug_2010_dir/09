in many multiagent domains a set of agents exert effort towards a joint outcome yet the individual effort levels cannot be easily observed a typical example for such a scenario is routing in communication networks where the sender can only observe whether the packet reached its destination but often has no information about the actions of the intermediate routers which influences the final outcome  we study a setting where a principal needs to motivate a team of agents whose combination of hidden efforts stochastically determines an outcome  in a companion paper we devise and study a  basic combinatorial agency model for this setting where the principal is restricted to inducing a pure nash equilibrium  here we study various implications of this restriction first we show that in contrast to the case of observable efforts inducing a mixedstrategies equilibrium may be beneficial for the principal second we present a sufficient condition for technologies for which no gain can be generated third we bound the principals gain for various families of technologies finally we study the robustness of mixed equilibria to coalitional deviations and the computational hardness of the optimal mixed equilibria
