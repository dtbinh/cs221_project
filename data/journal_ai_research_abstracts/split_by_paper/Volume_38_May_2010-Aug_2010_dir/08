binary decision diagram bdd based set bounds propagation is a powerful approach to solving setconstraint satisfaction problems however prior bdd based techniques in cur the significant overhead of constructing and manipulating graphs during search we present a setconstraint solver which combines bddbased setbounds propagators with the learning abilities of a modern sat solver together with a number of improvements beyond the basic algorithm this solver is highly competitive with existing propagation based set constraint solvers
