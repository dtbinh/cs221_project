because an agents resources dictate what actions it can possibly take it should plan which resources it holds over time carefully considering its inherent limitations such as power or payload restrictions the competing needs of other agents for the same resources and the stochastic nature of the environment such agents can in general achieve more of their objectives if they can use  and even create  opportunities to change which resources they hold at various times  driven by resource constraints the agents could break their overall missions into an optimal series of phases optimally reconfiguring their resources at each phase and optimally using their assigned resources in each phase given their knowledge of the stochastic environment

in this paper we formally define and analyze this constrained sequential optimization problem in both the singleagent and multiagent contexts we present a family of mixed integer linear programming milp formulations of this problem that can optimally create phases when phases are not predefined accounting for costs and limitations in phase creation  because our formulations multaneously also find the optimal allocations of resources at each phase and the optimal policies for using the allocated resources at each phase they exploit structure across these coupled problems this allows them to find solutions significantly fasterorders of magnitude faster in larger problems than alternative solution techniques as we demonstrate empirically
