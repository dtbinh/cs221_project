f  fang a  x jiang and m  tambe 2013 protecting moving targets with multiple mobile resources volume 48 pages 583634

in recent years stackelberg security games have been successfully applied to solve resource allocation and scheduling problems in several security domains however previous work has mostly assumed that the targets are stationary relative to the defender and the attacker leading to discrete game models with finite numbers of pure strategies this paper in contrast focuses on protecting mobile targets that leads to a continuous set of strategies for the players the problem is motivated by several realworld domains including protecting ferries with escort boats and protecting refugee supply lines our contributions include i a new game model for multiple mobile defender resources and moving targets with a discretized strategy space for the defender and a continuous strategy space for the attacker ii an efficient linearprogrammingbased solution that uses a compact representation for the defenders mixed strategy while accurately modeling the attackers continuous strategy using a novel subinterval analysis method iii discussion and analysis of multiple heuristic methods for equilibrium refinement to improve robustness of defenders mixed strategy iv discussion of approaches to sample actual defender schedules from the defenders mixed strategy iv detailed experimental analysis of our algorithms in the ferry protection domain
