sequential decisionmaking problems with multiple objectives arise naturally in practice and pose unique challenges for research in decisiontheoretic planning and learning which has largely focused on singleobjective settings this article surveys algorithms designed for sequential decisionmaking problems with multiple objectives though there is a growing body of literature on this subject little of it makes explicit under what circumstances special methods are needed to solve multiobjective problems therefore we identify three distinct scenarios in which converting such a problem to a singleobjective one is impossible infeasible or undesirable furthermore we propose a taxonomy that classifies multiobjective methods according to the applicable scenario the nature of the scalarization function which projects multiobjective values to scalar ones and the type of policies considered we show how these factors determine the nature of an optimal solution which can be a single policy a convex hull or a pareto front using this taxonomy we survey the literature on multiobjective methods for planning and learning finally we discuss key applications of such methods and outline opportunities for future work
