g  casini and u  straccia 2013 defeasible inheritancebased description logics volume 48 pages 415473

defeasible inheritance networks are a nonmonotonic framework that deals with hierarchical knowledge on the other hand rational closure is acknowledged as a landmark of the preferential approach to nonmonotonic reasoning we will combine these two approaches and define a new nonmonotonic closure operation for propositional knowledge bases that combines the advantages of both then we redefine such a procedure for description logics dls a family of logics wellsuited to model structured information in both cases we will provide a simple reasoning method that is built on top of the classical entailment relation and thus is amenable of an implementation based on existing reasoners eventually we evaluate our approach on wellknown landmark test examples
