the beth definability property a wellknown property from classical logic is investigated in the context of description logics if a general ltbox implicitly defines an lconcept in terms of a given signature where l is a description logic then does there always exist over this signature an explicit definition in l for the concept this property has been studied before and used to optimize reasoning in description logics in this paper a complete classification of beth definability is provided for extensions of the basic description logic alc with transitive roles inverse roles role hierarchies andor functionality restrictions both on arbitrary and on finite structures moreover we present a tableaubased algorithm which computes explicit definitions of at most double exponential size this algorithm is optimal because it is also shown that the smallest explicit definition of an implicitly defined concept may be double exponentially long in the size of the input tbox finally if explicit definitions are allowed to be expressed in firstorder logic then we show how to compute them in single exponential time
