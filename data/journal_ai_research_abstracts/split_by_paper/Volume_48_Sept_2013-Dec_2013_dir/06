i  p gent 2013 optimal implementation of watched literals and more general techniques volume 48 pages 231252

i prove that an implementation technique for scanning lists in backtracking search algorithms is optimal  the result applies to a simple general framework which i present applications include watched literal unit propagation in sat and a number of examples in constraint satisfaction  techniques like watched literals are known to be highly space efficient and effective in practice  when implemented in the circular approach described here  these techniques also have optimal run time per branch in bigo terms when amortized across a search tree  this also applies when multiple list elements must be found  the constant factor overhead of the worst case is only 2  replacing the existing nonoptimal implementation of unit propagation in minisat speeds up propagation by 29 though this is not enough to improve overall run time significantly
