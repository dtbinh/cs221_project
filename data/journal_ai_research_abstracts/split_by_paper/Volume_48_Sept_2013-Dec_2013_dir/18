for almost two decades monotonic or delete free relaxation has been one of the key auxiliary tools in the practice of domainindependent deterministic planning in the particular contexts of both satisficing and optimal planning it  underlies most stateoftheart heuristic functions while satisficing planning for monotonic tasks is polynomialtime optimal planning for monotonic tasks is npequivalent here we establish both negative and positive results on the complexity of some wide fragments of optimal monotonic planning with the fragments being defined around the causal graph topology our results shed some light on the link between the complexity of general  optimal planning and the complexity of optimal planning for the respective  monotonic relaxations
