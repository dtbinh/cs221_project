i  kollia and b  glimm 2013 optimizing sparql query answering over owl ontologies volume 48 pages 253303

the sparql query language is currently being extended by the world wide web consortium w3c with socalled entailment regimes an entailment regime defines how queries are evaluated under more expressive semantics than sparqls standard simple entailment which is based on subgraph matching the queries are very expressive since variables can occur within complex concepts and can also bind to concept or role names

we provide a prototypical implementation and evaluate the efficiency of the proposed optimizations our experimental study shows that the static ordering usually outperforms the dynamic one when accurate statistics are available this changes however when the statistics are less accurate eg due to nondeterministic reasoning decisions for queries that go beyond conjunctive instance queries we observe an improvement of up to three orders of magnitude due to the proposed optimizations
