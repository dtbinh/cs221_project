a  cal236 g  gottlob and m  kifer 2013 taming the infinite chase query answering under expressive relational constraints volume 48 pages 115174

the chase algorithm is a fundamental tool for query evaluation and for testing query containment under tuplegenerating dependencies tgds and equalitygenerating dependencies egds  so far most of the research on this topic has focused on cases where the chase procedure terminates  this paper introduces expressive classes of tgds defined via syntactic restrictions guarded tgds gtgds and weakly guarded sets of tgds wgtgds  for these classes the chase procedure is not guaranteed to terminate and thus may have an infinite outcome nevertheless we prove that the problems of conjunctivequery answering and query containment under such tgds are decidable  we provide decision procedures and tight complexity bounds for these problems  then we show how egds can be incorporated into our results by providing conditions under which egds do not harmfully interact with tgds and do not affect the decidability and complexity of query answering  we show applications of the aforesaid classes of constraints to the problem of answering conjunctive queries in flogic lite an objectoriented ontology language and in some tractable description logics
