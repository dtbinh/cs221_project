this paper proposes the formalization and implementation of a novel class of constraints aimed at modeling problems related to placement of multibody systems in the 3dimensional space each multibody is a system composed of body elements connected by joint relationships and constrained by geometric properties the emphasis of this investigation is the use of multibody systems to model native conformations of protein structureswhere each body represents an entity of the protein eg an amino acid a small peptide and the geometric constraints are related to the spatial properties of the composing atoms the paper explores the use of the proposed class of constraints to support a variety of different structural analysis of proteins such as loop modeling and structure prediction

the declarative nature of a constraintbased encoding provides elaboration tolerance and the ability to make use of any additional knowledge in the analysis studies the filtering capabilities of the proposed constraints also allow to control the number of representative solutions that are withdrawn from the conformational space of the protein by means of criteria driven by uniform distribution sampling principles in this scenario it is possible to select the desired degree of precision andor number of solutions the filtering component automatically excludes configurations that violate the spatial and geometric properties of the composing multibody system the paper illustrates the implementation of a constraint solver based on the multibody perspective and its empirical evaluation on protein  structure analysis problems
