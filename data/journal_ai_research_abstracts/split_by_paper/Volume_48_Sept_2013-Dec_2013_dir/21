e  franconi v  kerhet and n  ngo 2013 exact query reformulation over databases with firstorder and description logics ontologies volume 48 pages 885922

we study a general framework for query rewriting in the presence of an arbitrary firstorder logic ontology over a database signature the framework supports deciding the existence of a saferange firstorder equivalent reformulation of a query in terms of the database signature and if so it provides an effective approach to construct the reformulation based on interpolation using standard theorem proving techniques eg tableau since the reformulation is a saferange formula it is effectively executable as an sql query at the end we present a nontrivial application of the framework with ontologies in the very expressive alchoiq description logic by providing effective means to compute saferange firstorder exact reformulations of queries
