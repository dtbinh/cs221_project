m  alabbas and a  ramsay 2013 natural language inference for arabic using extended tree edit distance with subtrees volume 48 pages 122

many natural language processing nlp applications require the computation of similarities between pairs of syntactic or semantic trees many researchers have used tree edit distance for this task but this technique suffers from the drawback that it deals with single node operations only we have extended the standard tree edit distance algorithm to deal with subtree transformation operations as well as single nodes the extended algorithm with subtree operations tedst is more effective and flexible than the standard algorithm especially for applications that pay attention to relations among nodes eg in linguistic trees deleting a modifier subtree should be cheaper than the sum of deleting its components individually we describe the use of tedst for checking entailment between two arabic text snippets the preliminary results of using tedst were encouraging when compared with two stringbased approaches and with the standard algorithm
