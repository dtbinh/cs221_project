in classical agmstyle belief change it is assumed that the underlying logic contains classical propositional logic this is clearly a limiting assumption particularly in artificial intelligence consequently there has been recent interest in studying belief change in approaches where the full expressivity of classical propositional logic is not obtained in this paper we investigate belief contraction in horn knowledge bases we point out that the obvious extension to the horn case involving horn remainder sets as a starting point is problematic not only do horn remainder sets have undesirable properties but also some desirable horn contraction functions are not captured by this approach for horn belief set contraction we develop an account in terms of a modeltheoretic characterisation involving weak remainder sets maxichoice and partial meet horn contraction is specified and we show that the problems arising with earlier work are resolved by these approaches as well constructions of the specific operators and sets of postulates are provided and representation results are obtained we also examine horn package contraction or contraction by a set of formulas again we give a construction and postulate set linking them via a representation result last we investigate the closelyrelated notion of forgetting in horn clauses this work is arguably interesting since horn clauses have found widespread use in ai as well the results given here may potentially be extended to other areas which make use of hornlike reasoning such as logic programming rulebased systems and description logics finally since horn reasoning is weaker than classical reasoning this work sheds light on the foundations of belief change
