t  xiao and j  zhu 2013 unsupervised subtree alignment for treetotree translation volume 48 pages 733782

this article presents a probabilistic subtree alignment model and its application to treetotree machine translation unlike previous work we do not resort to surface heuristics or expensive annotated data but instead derive an unsupervised model to infer the syntactic correspondence between two languages more importantly the developed model is syntacticallymotivated and does not rely on word alignments as a byproduct our model outputs a subtree alignment matrix encoding a large number of diverse alignments between syntactic structures from which machine translation systems can efficiently extract translation rules that are often filtered out due to the errors in 1best alignment experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms three stateoftheart baseline approaches in both alignment accuracy and grammar quality when applied to machine translation our approach yields a 10 bleu improvement and a 09 ter reduction on the nist machine translation evaluation corpora with tree binarization and fuzzy decoding it even outperforms a stateoftheart hierarchical phrasebased system
