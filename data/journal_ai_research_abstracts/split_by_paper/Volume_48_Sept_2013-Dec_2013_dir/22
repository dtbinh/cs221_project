we study the phase transition of the coalitional manipulation problem for generalized scoring rules previously it has been shown that under some conditions on the distribution of votes if the number of manipulators is osqrtn where n is the number of voters then the probability that a random profile is manipulable by the coalition goes to zero as the number of voters goes to infinity whereas if the number of manipulators is omegasqrtn then the probability that a random profile is manipulable goes to one here we consider the critical window where a coalition has size csqrtn and we show that as c goes from zero to infinity the limiting probability that a random profile is manipulable goes from zero to one in a smooth fashion ie there is a smooth phase transition between the two regimes this result analytically validates recent empirical results and suggests that deciding the coalitional manipulation problem may be of limited computational hardness in practice
