i  androutsopoulos g  lampouras and d  galanis 2013 generating natural language descriptions from owl ontologies the naturalowl system volume 48 pages 671715

we present naturalowl a natural language generation system that produces texts describing individuals or classes of owl ontologies unlike simpler owl verbalizers which typically express a single axiom at a time in controlled often not entirely fluent natural language primarily for the benefit of domain experts we aim to generate fluent and coherent multisentence texts for endusers with a system like naturalowl one can publish information in owl on the web along with automatically produced corresponding texts in multiple languages making the information accessible not only to computer programs and domain experts but also endusers we discuss the processing stages of naturalowl the optional domaindependent linguistic resources that the system can use at each stage and why they are useful we also present trials showing that when the domaindependent llinguistic resources are available naturalowl produces significantly better texts compared to a simpler verbalizer and that the resources can be created with relatively light effort
