in order to meet usability requirements most logicbased applications provide explanation facilities for reasoning services this holds also for description logics where research has focused on the explanation of both tbox reasoning and more recently query answering besides explaining the  presence of a tuple in a query answer it is important to explain also why a   given tuple is missing we address the latter problem for instance and  conjunctive query answering over dllite ontologies by adopting abductive  reasoning that is we look for additions to the abox that force a given  tuple to be in the result as reasoning tasks we consider existence and recognition of an explanation and relevance and necessity of a given  assertion for an explanation we characterize the computational complexity of  these problems for arbitrary subset minimal and cardinality minimal
