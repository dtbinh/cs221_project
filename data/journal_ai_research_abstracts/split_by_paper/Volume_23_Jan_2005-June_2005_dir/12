the graphplan algorithm for generating optimal makespan plans containing parallel sets of actions remains one of the most effective ways to generate such plans  however despite enhancements on a range of fronts the approach is currently dominated in terms of speed by state space planners that employ distancebased heuristics to quickly generate serial plans  we report on a family of strategies that employ available memory to construct a search trace so as to learn from various aspects of graphplans iterative search episodes in order to expedite search in subsequent episodes  the planning approaches can be partitioned into two classes according to the type and extent of search experience captured in the trace  the planners using the more aggressive tracing method are able to avoid much of graphplans redundant search effort while planners in the second class trade off this aspect in favor of a much higher degree of freedom than graphplan in traversing the space of states generated during regression search on the planning graph  the tactic favored by the second approach exploiting the search trace to transform the depthfirst ida nature of graphplans search into an iterative state space view is shown to be the more powerful  we demonstrate that distancebased state space heuristics can be adapted to informed traversal of the search trace used by the second class of planners and develop an augmentation targeted specifically at planning graph search  guided by such a heuristic the stepoptimal version of the planner in this class clearly dominates even a highly enhanced version of graphplan  by adopting beam search on the search trace we then show that virtually optimal parallel plans can be generated at speeds quite competitive with a modern heuristic state space planner
