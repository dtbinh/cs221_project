p  e dunne 2005 extremal behaviour in multiagent contract negotiation volume 23 pages 4178

we examine properties of a model of resource allocation in which several agents exchange resources in order to optimise their individual holdings the schemes discussed relate to wellknown negotiation protocols proposed in earlier work and we consider a number of alternative notions of rationality covering both quantitative measures eg cooperative and individual rationality and more qualitative forms eg pigoudalton transfers while it is known that imposing particular rationality and structural restrictions may result in some reallocations of the resource set becoming unrealisable in this paper we address the issue of the number of restricted rational deals that may be required to implement a particular reallocation when it is possible to do so we construct examples showing that this number may be exponential in the number of resources m even when all of the agent utility functions are monotonic we further show that k agents may achieve in a single deal a reallocation requiring exponentially many rational deals if at most k1 agents can participate this same reallocation being unrealisable by any sequences of rational deals in which at most k2 agents are involved
