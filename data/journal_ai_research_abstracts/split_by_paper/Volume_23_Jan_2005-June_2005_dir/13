multiple sequence alignment msa is a ubiquitous problem in computational biology although it is nphard to find an optimal solution for an arbitrary number of sequences due to the importance of this problem researchers are trying to push the limits of exact algorithms further since msa can be cast as a classical path finding problem it is attracting a growing number of ai researchers interested in heuristic search algorithms as a challenge with actual practical relevance  in this paper we first review two previous complementary lines of research based on hirschbergs algorithm dynamic programming needs oknk1 space to store both the search frontier and the nodes needed to reconstruct the solution path for k sequences of length n best first search on the other hand has the advantage of bounding the search space that has to be explored using a heuristic  however it is necessary to maintain all explored nodes up to the final solution in order to prevent the search from reexpanding them at higher cost  earlier approaches to reduce the closed list are either incompatible with pruning methods for the open list or must retain at least the boundary of the closed list  in this article we present an algorithm that attempts at combining the respective advantages like a it uses a heuristic for pruning the search space but reduces both the maximum open and closed size to oknk1 as in dynamic programming  the underlying idea is to conduct a series of searches with successively increasing upper bounds but using the dp ordering as the key for the open priority queue  with a suitable choice of thresholds in practice a running time below four times that of a can be expected  in our experiments we show that our algorithm outperforms one of the currently most successful algorithms for optimal multiple sequence alignments partial expansion a both in time and memory moreover we apply a refined heuristic based on optimal alignments not only of pairs of sequences but of larger subsets  this idea is not new however to make it practically relevant we show that it is equally important to bound the heuristic computation appropriately or the overhead can obliterate any possible gain  furthermore we discuss a number of improvements in time and space efficiency with regard to practical implementations  our algorithm used in conjunction with higherdimensional heuristics is able to calculate for the first time the optimal alignment for almost all of the problems in reference 1 of the benchmark database balibase
