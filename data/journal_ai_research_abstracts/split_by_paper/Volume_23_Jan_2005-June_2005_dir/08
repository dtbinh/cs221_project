there has been increased interest in devising learning techniques that combine unlabeled data with labeled data  ie semisupervised learning however to the best of our knowledge no study has been performed across various techniques and different types and amounts of labeled and unlabeled data moreover most of the published work on semisupervised learning techniques assumes that the labeled and unlabeled data come from the same distribution it is possible for the labeling process to be associated with a selection bias such that the distributions of data points in the labeled and unlabeled sets are different not correcting for such bias can result in biased function approximation with potentially poor performance in this paper we present an empirical study of various semisupervised learning techniques on a variety of datasets we attempt to answer various questions such as the effect of independence or relevance amongst features the effect of the size of the labeled and unlabeled sets and the effect of noise we also investigate the impact of sampleselection bias on the semisupervised learning techniques under study and implement a bivariate probit technique particularly designed to correct for such bias
