w  zhang and  n  l zhang 2005 restricted value iteration theory and algorithms volume 23 pages 123165

value iteration is a popular algorithm for finding near optimal policies for pomdps  it is inefficient due to the need to account for the entire belief space which necessitates the solution of large numbers of linear programs  in this paper we study value iteration restricted to belief subsets we show that together with properly chosen belief subsets restricted value iteration yields nearoptimal policies and we give a condition for determining whether a given belief subset would bring about savings in space and time we also apply restricted value iteration to two interesting classes of pomdps namely informative pomdps and neardiscernible pomdps
