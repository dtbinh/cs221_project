in this paper we construct and investigate a hierarchy of spatiotemporal formalisms that result from various combinations of propositional spatial and temporal logics such as the propositional temporal logic ptl the spatial logics rcc8 brcc8 s4u and their fragments the obtained results give a clear picture of the tradeoff between expressiveness and computational realisability within the hierarchy we demonstrate how different combining principles as well as spatial and temporal primitives can produce np pspace expspace 2expspacecomplete and even undecidable spatiotemporal logics out of components that are at most np or pspacecomplete
