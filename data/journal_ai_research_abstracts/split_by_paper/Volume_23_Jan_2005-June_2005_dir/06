argumentation is based on the exchange and valuation of interacting arguments followed by the selection of the most acceptable of them for example in order to take a decision to make a choice starting from the framework proposed by dung in 1995 our purpose is to introduce graduality in the selection of the best arguments ie to be able to partition the set of the arguments in more than the two usual subsets of selected and nonselected arguments in order to represent different levels of selection  our basic idea is that an argument is all the more acceptable if it can be preferred to its attackers  first we discuss general principles underlying a gradual valuation of arguments based on their interactions following these principles we define several valuation models for an abstract argumentation system  then we introduce graduality in the concept of acceptability of arguments we propose new acceptability classes and a refinement of existing classes taking advantage of an available gradual valuation
