j  larrosa  e  morancho and  d  niso 2005 on the practical use of variable elimination in constraint optimization problems stilllife as a case study volume 23 pages 421440

variable elimination is a general technique for constraint processing it is often discarded because of its high space complexity however it can be extremely useful when combined with other techniques in this paper we study the applicability of variable elimination to the challenging problem of finding stilllifes  we illustrate several alternatives variable elimination as a standalone algorithm interleaved with search and as a source of good quality lower bounds  we show that these techniques are the best known option both theoretically and empirically in our experiments we have been able to solve the n20 instance which is far beyond reach with alternative approaches
