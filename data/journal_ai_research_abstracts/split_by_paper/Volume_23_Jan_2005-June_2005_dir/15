many description logics dls combine knowledge representation on an abstract logical level with an interface to concrete domains like numbers and strings with builtin predicates such as   and prefixof these hybrid dls have turned out to be useful in several application areas such as reasoning about conceptual database models  we propose to further extend such dls with key constraints that allow the expression of statements like us citizens are uniquely identified by their social security number based on this idea we introduce a number of natural description logics and perform a detailed analysis of their decidability and computational complexity  it turns out that naive extensions with key constraints easily lead to undecidability whereas more careful extensions yield nexptimecomplete dls for a variety of useful concrete domains
