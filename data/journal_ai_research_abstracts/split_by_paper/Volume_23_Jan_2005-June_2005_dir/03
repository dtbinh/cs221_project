in this paper we confront the problem of applying reinforcement learning to agents that perceive the environment through many sensors and that can perform  parallel actions using many actuators as is the case in complex autonomous robots we argue that reinforcement learning can only be successfully applied to this case  if strong assumptions are made on the characteristics of the environment in which  the learning is performed so that the relevant sensor readings and motor commands can be  readily identified the introduction of such assumptions leads to stronglybiased  learning systems that can eventually lose the generality of traditional  reinforcementlearning algorithms  in this line we observe that in realistic situations the reward received by the robot  depends only on a reduced subset of all the executed actions and that only a reduced  subset of the sensor inputs possibly different in each situation and for each action  are relevant to predict the reward we formalize this property in the so called  categorizability assumption and we present an algorithm that takes advantage of  the categorizability of the environment allowing a decrease in the learning time with  respect to existing reinforcementlearning algorithms results of the application of the  algorithm to a couple of simulated realisticrobotic problems landmarkbased navigation  and the sixlegged robot gait generation are reported to validate our approach and to  compare it to existing flat and generalizationbased reinforcementlearning approaches
