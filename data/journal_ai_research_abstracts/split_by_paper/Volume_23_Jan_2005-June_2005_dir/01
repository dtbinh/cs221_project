standard value function approaches to finding policies for partially observable markov decision processes pomdps are generally considered to be intractable for large models the intractability of these algorithms is to a large extent a consequence of computing an exact optimal policy over the entire belief space  however in realworld pomdp problems computing the optimal policy for the full belief space is often unnecessary for good control even for problems with complicated policy classes the beliefs experienced by the controller often lie near a structured lowdimensional subspace embedded in the highdimensional belief space finding a good approximation to the optimal value function for only this subspace can be much easier than computing the full value functionp p  we introduce a new method for solving largescale pomdps by reducing the dimensionality of the belief space we use exponential family principal components analysis collins dasgupta  schapire 2002 to represent sparse highdimensional belief spaces using small sets of learned features of the belief state we then plan only in terms of the lowdimensional belief features by planning in this lowdimensional space we can find policies for pomdp models that are orders of magnitude larger than models that can be handled by conventional techniquesp p we demonstrate the use of this algorithm on a synthetic problem and on mobile robot navigation tasks
