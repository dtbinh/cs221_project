visualization of highdimensional data such as text documents is useful to map out the similarities among various data points in the highdimensional space documents are commonly represented as bags of words with dimensionality equal to the vocabulary size classical approaches to document visualization directly reduce this into visualizable two or three dimensions recent approaches consider an intermediate representation in topic space between word space and visualization space which preserves the semantics by topic modeling while aiming for a good fit between the model parameters and the observed data previous approaches have not considered the local consistency among data instances we consider the problem of semantic visualization by jointly modeling topics and visualization on the intrinsic document manifold modeled using a neighborhood graph each document has both a topic distribution and visualization coordinate specifically we propose an unsupervised probabilistic model called semafore which aims to preserve the manifold in the lowerdimensional spaces through a neighborhood regularization framework designed for the semantic visualization task to validate the efficacy of semafore our comprehensive experiments on a number of reallife text datasets of news articles and web pages show that the proposed methods outperform the stateoftheart baselines on objective evaluation metrics
