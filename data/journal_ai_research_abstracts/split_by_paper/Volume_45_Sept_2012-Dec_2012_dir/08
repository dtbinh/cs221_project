p  gutierrez and p  meseguer 2012 removing redundant messages in nary bnbadopt volume 45 pages 287304

this note considers how to modify  bnbadopt a wellknown algorithm for optimally solving distributed constraint optimization problems with a double aim i   to avoid sending most of the redundant messages and ii to handle cost functions of any arity some of the messages exchanged by bnbadopt  turned out to be redundant removing most of the redundant messages increases substantially communication efficiency the number of exchanged messages is  in most cases  at least three times fewer keeping the other measures almost unchanged and termination and optimality are maintained on the other hand handling nary cost functions was addressed in the original work but the presence of thresholds makes their practical usage more complex both issues  removing most of the redundant messages and efficiently handling nary cost functions  can be combined producing the new version bnbadopt experimentally we show the benefits of this  version over the original one
