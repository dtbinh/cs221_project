g  de cooman and e  miranda 2012 irrelevant and independent natural extension for sets of desirable gambles volume 45 pages 601640

the results in this paper add useful tools to the theory of sets of desirable gambles a growing toolbox for reasoning with partial probability assessments we investigate how to combine a number of marginal coherent sets of desirable gambles into a joint set using the properties of epistemic irrelevance and independence we provide formulas for the smallest such joint called their independent natural extension and study its main properties the independent natural extension of maximal coherent sets of desirable gambles allows us to define the strong product of sets of desirable gambles finally we explore an easy way to generalise these results to also apply for the conditional versions of epistemic irrelevance and independence   having such a set of tools that are easily implemented in computer programs is clearly beneficial to fields like ai with a clear interest in coherent reasoning under uncertainty using general and robust uncertainty models that require no full specification
