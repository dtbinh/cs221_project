j  garcia and f  fernandez 2012 safe exploration of state and action spaces in reinforcement learning volume 45 pages 515564

in this paper we consider the important problem of safe exploration in reinforcement learning while reinforcement learning is wellsuited to domains with complex transition dynamics and highdimensional stateaction spaces an additional challenge is posed by the need for safe and efficient exploration traditional exploration techniques are not particularly useful for solving dangerous tasks where the trial and error process may lead to the selection of actions whose execution in some states may result in damage to the learning system or any other system consequently when an agent begins an interaction with a dangerous and highdimensional stateaction space an important question arises namely that of how to avoid or at least minimize damage caused by the exploration of the stateaction space we introduce the pisrl algorithm which safely improves suboptimal albeit robust behaviors for continuous state and action control tasks and which efficiently learns from the experience gained from the environment we evaluate the proposed method in four complex tasks automatic car parking polebalancing helicopter hovering and business management
