sa  mirroshandel and g  ghassemsani 2012 towards unsupervised learning of temporal relations between events volume 45 pages 125163

automatic extraction of temporal relations between event pairs is an important task for several natural language processing applications such as question answering information extraction and summarization since most existing methods are supervised and require large corpora which for many languages do not exist we have concentrated our efforts to reduce the need for annotated data as much as possible this paper presents two different algorithms towards this goal the first algorithm is a weakly supervised machine learning approach for classification of temporal relations between events in the first stage the algorithm learns a general classifier from an annotated corpus then inspired by the hypothesis of one type of temporal relation per discourse it extracts useful information from a cluster of topically related documents we show that by combining the global information of such a cluster with local decisions of a general classifier a bootstrapping crossdocument classifier can be built to extract temporal relations between events our experiments show that without any additional annotated data the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher than that of several previous successful systems the second proposed method for temporal relation extraction is based on the expectation maximization em algorithm within em we used different techniques such as a greedy bestfirst search and integer linear programming for temporal inconsistency removal we think that the experimental results of our em based algorithm as a first step toward a fully unsupervised temporal relation extraction method is encouraging
