relational data representations have become an increasingly important topic due to the recent proliferation of network datasets eg social biological information networks and a corresponding increase in the application of statistical relational learning srl algorithms to these domains in this article we examine and categorize techniques for transforming graphbased relational data to improve srl algorithms in particular appropriate transformations of the nodes links andor features of the data can dramatically affect the capabilities and results of srl algorithms we introduce an intuitive taxonomy for data representation transformations in relational domains that incorporates link transformation and node transformation as symmetric representation tasks more specifically the transformation tasks for both nodes and links include i predicting their existence ii predicting their label or type iii estimating their weight or importance and iv system atically constructing their relevant features we motivate our taxonomy through detailed examples and use it to survey competing approaches for each of these tasks we also dis cuss general conditions for transforming links nodes and features finally we highlight challenges that remain to be addressed
