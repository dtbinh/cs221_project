b  cuenca grau and b  motik 2012 reasoning over ontologies with hidden content the importbyquery approach volume 45 pages 197255

there is currently a growing interest in techniques for hiding parts of the signature of an ontology kh that is being reused by another ontology kv towards this goal in this paper we propose the importbyquery framework which makes the content of kh accessible through a limited query interface if kv reuses the symbols from kh in a certain restricted way one can reason over kv u kh by accessing only kv and the query interface we map out the landscape of the importbyquery problem in particular we outline the limitations of our framework and prove that certain restrictions on the expressivity of kh and the way in which kv reuses symbols from kh are strictly necessary to enable reasoning in our setting we also identify cases in which reasoning is possible and we present suitable importbyquery reasoning algorithms
