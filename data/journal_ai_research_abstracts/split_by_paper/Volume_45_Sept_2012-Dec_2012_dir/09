a  m rush and m  j  collins 2012 a tutorial on dual decomposition and lagrangian relaxation for inference in natural language processing volume 45 pages 305362

dual decomposition and more generally lagrangian relaxation is a classical method for combinatorial optimization it has recently been applied to several inference problems in natural language processing nlp this tutorial gives an overview of the technique we describe example algorithms describe formal guarantees for the method and describe practical issues in implementing the algorithms while our examples are predominantly drawn from the nlp literature the material should be of general relevance to inference problems in machine learning a central theme of this tutorial is that lagrangian relaxation is naturally applied in conjunction with a broad class of combinatorial algorithms allowing inference in models that go significantly beyond previous work on lagrangian relaxation for inference in graphical models
