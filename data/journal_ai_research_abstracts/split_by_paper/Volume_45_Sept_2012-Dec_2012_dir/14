replanning via determinization is a recent popular approach for online planning in mdps in this paper we adapt this idea to classical nonstochastic domains with partial information and sensing actions presenting a new planner sdr sample determinize replan at each step we generate a  solution plan to a classical planning problem induced by the original problem we execute this plan as long as it is safe to do so when this is no longer the case we replan the classical planning problem we generate is based on the translationbased approach for conformant planning introduced by palacios and geffner the state of the classical planning problem generated in this approach captures the belief state of the agent in the original problem unfortunately when this method is applied to planning problems with sensing it yields a nondeterministic planning problem that is typically very large our main contribution is the introduction of state sampling techniques for overcoming these two problems in addition we introduce a novel lazy regressionbased method for querying the agents belief state during runtime  we provide a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the planner showing that it scales better than the stateoftheart clg planner on existing benchmark problems but also highlighting its weaknesses with new domains  we also discuss its theoretical guarantees
