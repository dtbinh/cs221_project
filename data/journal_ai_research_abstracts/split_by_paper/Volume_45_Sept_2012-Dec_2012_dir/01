f  belardinelli and a  lomuscio 2012 interactions between knowledge and time in a firstorder logic for multiagent systems completeness results volume 45 pages 145

we investigate a class of firstorder temporalepistemic logics for reasoning about multiagent systems we encode typical properties of systems including perfect recall synchronicity no learning and having a unique initial state in terms of variants of quantified interpreted systems a firstorder extension of interpreted systems we identify several monodic fragments of firstorder temporalepistemic logic and show their completeness with respect to their corresponding classes of quantified interpreted systems
