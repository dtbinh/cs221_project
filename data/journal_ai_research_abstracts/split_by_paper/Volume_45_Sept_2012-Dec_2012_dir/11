pseudoboolean constraints are omnipresent in practical applications and thus a significant effort has been devoted to the development of good sat encoding techniques for them some of these encodings first construct a binary decision diagram bdd for the constraint and then encode the bdd into a propositional formula  these bddbased approaches have some important advantages such as not being dependent on the size of the coefficients or being able to share the same bdd for representing many constraints
