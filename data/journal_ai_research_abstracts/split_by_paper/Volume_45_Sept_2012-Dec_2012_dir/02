the constraint satisfaction problem csp is a general problem central to computer science and artificial intelligence  although the csp is nphard in general considerable effort has been spent on identifying tractable subclasses  the main two approaches consider structural properties restrictions on the hypergraph of constraint scopes and relational properties restrictions on the language of constraint relations  recently some authors have considered hybrid properties that restrict the constraint hypergraph and the relations simultaneously
