given a current news event we tackle the problem of generating plausible predictions of future events it might cause  we present a new methodology for modeling and predicting such future news events using machine learning and data mining techniques our pundit algorithm generalizes examples of causality pairs to infer a causality predictor  to obtain precisely labeled causality examples we mine 150 years of news articles and apply semantic natural language modeling techniques to headlines containing certain predefined causality patterns  for generalization the model uses a vast number of world knowledge ontologies  empirical evaluation on real news articles shows that our pundit algorithm performs as well as nonexpert humans
