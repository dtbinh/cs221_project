r  hoshino and k  kawarabayashi 2012 generating approximate solutions to the ttp using a linear distance relaxation volume 45 pages 257286

in some domestic professional sports leagues the home stadiums are located in cities connected by a common train line running in one direction for these instances we can incorporate this geographical information to determine optimal or nearlyoptimal solutions to the nteam traveling tournament problem ttp an nphard sports scheduling problem whose solution is a double roundrobin tournament schedule that minimizes the sum total of distances traveled by all n teams

we conclude the paper by applying this linear distance relaxation to general nonlinear nteam ttp instances where we develop fast approximate solutions by simply assuming the n teams lie on a straight line and solving the modified problem we show that this technique surprisingly generates the distanceoptimal tournament on all benchmark sets on 6 teams as well as closetooptimal schedules for larger n even when the teams are located around a circle or positioned in threedimensional space
