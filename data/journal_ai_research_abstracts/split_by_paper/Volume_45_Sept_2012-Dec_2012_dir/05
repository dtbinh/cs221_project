we give the analysis of the computational complexity of coalition structure generation over graphs given an undirected graph g  ne and a valuation function v  pn 8594 r over the subsets of nodes the problem is to find a partition of n into connected subsets that maximises the sum of the components values this problem is generally npcomplete in particular it is hard for a defined class of valuation functions which are independent of disconnected membersthat is two nodes have no effect on each others marginal con tribution to their vertex separator nonetheless for all such functions we provide bounds on the complexity of coalition structure generation over general and minorfree graphs our proof is constructive and yields algorithms for solving corresponding instances of the problem furthermore we derive linear time bounds for graphs of bounded treewidth however as we show the problem remains npcomplete for planar graphs and hence for any kk minorfree graphs where k 8805 5 moreover a 3sat problem with m clauses can be represented by a coalition structure generation problem over a planar graph with om2 nodes importantly our hardness result holds for a particular subclass of valuation functions termed edge sum where the value of each subset of nodes is simply determined by the sum of given weights of the edges in the induced subgraph
