we study the behavior of the a search algorithm when coupled with a heuristic h satisfying 1epsilon1h  h 1epsilon2h where 0  epsilon1 epsilon2  1 are small constants and h denotes the optimal cost to a solution we prove a rigorous general upper bound on the time complexity of a search on trees that depends on both the accuracy of the heuristic and the distribution of solutions our upper bound is essentially tight in the worst case in fact we show nearly matching lower bounds that are attained even by nonadversarially chosen solution sets induced by a simple stochastic model a consequence of our rigorous results is that the effective branching factor of the search will be reduced as long as epsilon1epsilon2  1 and the number of nearoptimal solutions in the search tree is not too large we go on to provide an upper bound for a search on graphs and in this context establish a bound on running time determined by the spectrum of the graph
