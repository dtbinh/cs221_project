this paper considers the fragment 87078704so of secondorder logic many interesting problems such as conformant planning can be naturally expressed as finite domain satisfiability problems of this logic such satisfiability problems are computationally hard 931p2 and many of these problems are often solved approximately in this paper we develop a general approximative method ie a sound but incomplete method for solving 87078704so satisfiability problems we use a syntactic representation of a constraint propagation method for firstorder logic to transform such an 87078704so satisfiability problem to an 8707soid satisfiability problem secondorder logic extended with inductive definitions the finite domain satisfiability problem for the latter language is in np and can be handled by several existing solvers inductive definitions are a powerful knowledge representation tool and this moti vates us to also approximate 87078704soid problems in order to do this we first show how to perform propagation on such inductive definitions next we use this to approximate 87078704soid satisfiability problems all this provides a general theoretical framework for a number of approximative methods in the literature moreover we also show how we can use this framework for solving practical useful problems such as conformant planning in an effective way
