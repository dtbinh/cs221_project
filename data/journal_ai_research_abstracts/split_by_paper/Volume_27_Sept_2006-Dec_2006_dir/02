a  epshteyn and g  dejong 2006 generative prior knowledge for discriminative classification volume 27 pages 2553

we present a novel framework for integrating prior knowledge into discriminative classifiers  our framework allows discriminative classifiers such as support vector machines svms to utilize prior knowledge specified in the generative setting the dual objective of fitting the data and respecting prior knowledge is formulated as a bilevel program which is solved approximately via iterative application of secondorder cone programming  to test our approach we consider the problem of using wordnet a semantic database of english language to improve lowsample classification accuracy of newsgroup categorization  wordnet is viewed as an approximate but readily available source of background knowledge and our framework is capable of utilizing it in a flexible way
