m  fox and d  long 2006 modelling mixed discretecontinuous domains for planning volume 27 pages 235297

in this paper we present pddl a planning domain description language for modelling mixed discretecontinuous planning domains we describe the syntax and modelling style of pddl showing that the language makes convenient the modelling of complex timedependent effects we provide a formal semantics for pddl by mapping planning instances into constructs of hybrid automata using the syntax of has as our semantic model we construct a semantic mapping to labelled transition systems to complete the formal interpretation of pddl planning instances an advantage of building a mapping from pddl to ha theory is that it forms a bridge between the planning and real time systems research communities one consequence is that we can expect to make use of some of the theoretical properties of has for example for a restricted class of has the reachability problem which is equivalent to plan existence is decidable pddl provides an alternative to the continuous durative action model of pddl21 adding a more flexible and robust model of timedependent behaviour
