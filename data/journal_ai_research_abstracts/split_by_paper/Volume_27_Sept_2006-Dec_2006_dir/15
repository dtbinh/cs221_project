allocating scarce resources among agents to maximize global utility is in general computationally challenging  we focus on problems where resources enable agents to execute actions in stochastic environments modeled as markov decision processes mdps such that the value of a resource bundle is defined as the expected value of the optimal mdp policy realizable given these resources  we present an algorithm that simultaneously solves the resourceallocation and the policyoptimization problems  this allows us to avoid explicitly representing utilities over exponentially many resource bundles leading to drastic often exponential reductions in computational complexity  we then use this algorithm in the context of selfinterested agents to design a combinatorial auction for allocating resources we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by showing that it can in minutes optimally solve problems for which a straightforward combinatorial resourceallocation technique would require the agents to enumerate up to 2100 resource bundles and the auctioneer to solve an npcomplete problem with an input of that size
