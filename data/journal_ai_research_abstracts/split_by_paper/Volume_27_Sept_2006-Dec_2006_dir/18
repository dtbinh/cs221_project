in reallife temporal scenarios uncertainty and preferences are often  essential and coexisting aspects  we present a formalism where quantitative temporal constraints with both preferences and uncertainty can be defined  we show how three classical notions of controllability that is strong weak and dynamic which have been developed for uncertain temporal problems can be generalized to handle preferences as well after defining this general framework we focus on problems where preferences follow the fuzzy approach and with properties that assure tractability for such problems we propose algorithms to check the presence of the controllability properties in particular we show that in such a setting dealing simultaneously with preferences and uncertainty does not increase the complexity of controllability testing  we also develop a dynamic execution algorithm of polynomial complexity that produces temporal plans under uncertainty that are optimal with respect to fuzzy preferences
