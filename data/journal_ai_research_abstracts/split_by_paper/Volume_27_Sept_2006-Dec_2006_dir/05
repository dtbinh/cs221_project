j  oh k  choi and h  isahara 2006 a comparison of different machine transliteration models volume 27 pages 119151

machine transliteration is a method for automatically converting words in one language into phonetically equivalent ones in another language machine transliteration plays an important role in natural language applications such as information retrieval and machine translation especially for handling proper nouns and technical terms four machine transliteration models  graphemebased transliteration model phonemebased transliteration model hybrid transliteration model and correspondencebased transliteration model  have been proposed by several researchers to date however there has been little research on a framework in which multiple transliteration models can operate simultaneously furthermore there has been no comparison of the four models within the same framework and using the same data we addressed these problems by 1 modeling the four models within the same framework 2 comparing them under the same conditions and 3 developing a way to improve machine transliteration through this comparison our comparison showed that the hybrid and correspondencebased models were the most effective and that the four models can be used in a complementary manner to improve machine transliteration performance
