we present a heuristic search algorithm for solving firstorder markov decision processes fomdps our approach combines firstorder state abstraction that avoids evaluating states individually and heuristic search that avoids evaluating all states firstly in contrast to existing systems which start with propositionalizing the fomdp and then perform state abstraction on its propositionalized version we apply state abstraction directly on the fomdp avoiding propositionalization this kind of abstraction is referred to as firstorder state abstraction secondly guided by an admissible heuristic the search is restricted to those states that are reachable from the initial state we demonstrate the usefulness of the above techniques for solving fomdps with a system referred to as flucap formerly fcplanner that entered the probabilistic track of the 2004 international planning competition ipc2004 and demonstrated an advantage over other planners on the problems represented in firstorder terms
