d  geiger c  meek and y  wexler 2006 a variational inference procedure allowing internal structure for overlapping clusters and deterministic constraints volume 27 pages 123

we develop a novel algorithm called vip for structured variational approximate inference this algorithm extends known algorithms to allow efficient multiple potential updates for overlapping clusters and overcomes the difficulties imposed by deterministic constraints the algorithms convergence is proven and its applicability demonstrated  for genetic linkage analysis
