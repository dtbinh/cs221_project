efficient representations and solutions for large decision problems with continuous and discrete variables are among the most important challenges faced by the designers of automated decision support systems in this paper we describe a novel hybrid factored markov decision process mdp model that allows for a compact representation of these problems and a new hybrid approximate linear programming halp framework that permits their efficient solutions the central idea of halp is to approximate the optimal value function by a linear combination of basis functions and optimize its weights by linear programming we analyze both theoretical and computational aspects of this approach and demonstrate its scaleup potential on several hybrid optimization problems
