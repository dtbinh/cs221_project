l  liu and m  truszczynski 2006 properties and applications of programs with monotone and convex constraints volume 27 pages 299334

we study properties of programs with monotone and convex constraints we extend to these formalisms concepts and results from normal logic programming they include the notions of strong and uniform equivalence with their characterizations tight programs and fages lemma program completion and loop formulas our results provide an abstract account of properties of some recent extensions of logic programming with aggregates especially the formalism of lparse programs they imply a method to compute stable models of lparse programs by means of offtheshelf solvers of pseudoboolean constraints which is often much faster than the smodels system
