active learners alleviate the burden of labeling large amounts of data by detecting and asking the user to label only the most informative examples in the domain  we focus here on active learning for multiview domains in which there are several disjoint subsets of features views each of which is sufficient to learn the target concept  in this paper we make several contributions first we introduce cotesting which is the first approach to multiview active learning  second we extend the multiview learning framework by also exploiting weak views which are adequate only for learning a concept that is more generalspecific than the target concept  finally we empirically show that cotesting outperforms existing active learners on a variety of real world domains such as wrapper induction web page classification advertisement removal and discourse tree parsing
