we propose a new model for learning bilingual word representations from nonparallel documentaligned data following the recent advances in word representation learning our model learns dense realvalued word vectors that is bilingual word embeddings bwes unlike prior work on inducing bwes which heavily relied on parallel sentencealigned corpora andor readily available translation resources such as dictionaries the article reveals that bwes may be learned solely on the basis of documentaligned comparable data without any additional lexical resources nor syntactic information we present a comparison of our approach with previous stateoftheart models for learning bilingual word representations from comparable data that rely on the framework of multilingual probabilistic topic modeling muptm as well as with distributional local contextcounting models we demonstrate the utility of the induced bwes in two semantic tasks 1 bilingual lexicon extraction 2 suggesting word translations in context for polysemous words our simple yet effective bwebased models significantly outperform the muptmbased and contextcounting representation models from comparable data as well as prior bwebased models and acquire the best reported results on both tasks for all three tested language pairs

overlapping coalition formation ocf games introduced by chalkiadakis elkind markakis polukarov and jennings in 2010 are cooperative games where players can simultaneously participate in several coalitions capturing the notion of stability in ocf games is a difficult taskdeviating players may continue to contribute resources to joint projects with nondeviators and the crucial question is what payoffs the deviators expect to receive from such projects chalkiadakis et al introduce three stability concepts for ocf gamesthe conservative core the refined core and the optimistic corethat are based on different answers to this question in this paper we propose a unified framework for the study of stability in the ocf setting which encompasses the stability concepts considered by chalkiadakis et al as well as a wide variety of alternative stability concepts  our approach is based on the notion of arbitration functions which determine the payoff obtained by the deviators given their deviation and the current allocation of resources we provide a characterization of stable outcomes under arbitration we then conduct an indepth study of four types of arbitration functions which correspond to four notions of the core these include the three notions of the core considered by chalkiadakis et al our results complement those of chalkiadakis et al and answer questions left open by their work in particular we show that ocf games with the conservative arbitration function are essentially equivalent to nonocf games by relating the conservative core of an ocf game to the core of a nonoverlapping cooperative game and use this result to obtain a strictly weaker sufficient condition for conservative core nonemptiness than the one given by chalkiadakis et al
