dynamic bayesian networks dbns are a general model for stochastic processes with partially observed states belief filtering in dbns is the task of inferring the belief state ie the probability distribution over process states based on incomplete and noisy observations this can be a hard problem in complex processes with large state spaces in this article we explore the idea of accelerating the filtering task by automatically exploiting causality in the process we consider a specific type of causal relation called passivity which pertains to how state variables cause changes in other variables we present the passivitybased selective belief filtering psbf method which maintains a factored belief representation and exploits passivity to perform selective updates over the belief factors psbf produces exact belief states under certain assumptions and approximate belief states otherwise where the approximation error is bounded by the degree of uncertainty in the process we show empirically in synthetic processes with varying sizes and degrees of passivity that psbf is faster than several alternative methods while achieving competitive accuracy furthermore we demonstrate how passivity occurs naturally in a complex system such as a multirobot warehouse and how psbf can exploit this to accelerate the filtering task
