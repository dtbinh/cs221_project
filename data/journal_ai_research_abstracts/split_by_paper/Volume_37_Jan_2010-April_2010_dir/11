 we present dclpc a logic for reasoning about how the abilities of agents and coalitions of agents are altered by transferring control from one agent to another the logical foundation of dclpc is clpc a logic for reasoning about cooperation in which the abilities of agents and coalitions of agents stem from a distribution of atomic boolean variables to individual agents  the choices available to a coalition correspond to assignments to the variables the coalition controls the basic modal constructs of dclpc are of the form coalition c can cooperate to bring about phi dclpc extends clpc with dynamic logic modalities in which atomic programs are of the form agent i gives control of variable p to agent j as usual in dynamic logic these atomic programs may be combined using sequence iteration choice and test operators to form complex programs by combining such dynamic transfer programs with cooperation modalities it becomes possible to reason about how the power of agents and coalitions is affected by the transfer of control we give two alternative semantics for the logic a direct semantics in which we capture the distributions of boolean variables to agents and a more conventional kripke semantics we prove that these semantics are equivalent and then present an axiomatization for the logic we investigate the computational complexity of model checking and satisfiability for dclpc and show that both problems are pspacecomplete and hence no worse than the underlying logic clpc finally we investigate the characterisation of control in dclpc we distinguish between firstorder control  the ability of an agent or coalition to control some state of affairs through the assignment of values to the variables under the control of the agent or coalition  and secondorder control  the ability of an agent to exert control over the control that other agents have by transferring variables to other agents we give a logical characterisation of secondorder control
