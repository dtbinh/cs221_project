p  d turney and p  pantel 2010 from frequency to meaning vector space models of semantics volume 37 pages 141188

computers understand very little of the meaning of human language this profoundly limits our ability to give instructions to computers the ability of computers to explain their actions to us and the ability of computers to analyse and process text vector space models vsms of semantics are beginning to address these limits this paper surveys the use of vsms for semantic processing of text we organize the literature on vsms according to the structure of the matrix in a vsm there are currently three broad classes of vsms based on termdocument wordcontext and pairpattern matrices yielding three classes of applications we survey a broad range of applications in these three categories and we take a detailed look at a specific open source project in each category our goal in this survey is to show the breadth of applications of vsms for semantics to provide a new perspective on vsms for those who are already familiar with the area and to provide pointers into the literature for those who are less familiar with the field
