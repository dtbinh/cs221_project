d  l chen j  kim and r  j mooney 2010 training a multilingual sportscaster using perceptual context to learn language volume 37 pages 397435

we present a novel framework for learning to interpret and generate language using only perceptual context as supervision  we demonstrate its capabilities by developing a system that learns to sportscast simulated robot soccer games in both english and korean without any languagespecific prior knowledge  training employs only ambiguous supervision consisting of a stream of descriptive textual comments and a sequence of events extracted from the simulation trace  the system simultaneously establishes correspondences between individual comments and the events that they describe while building a translation model that supports both parsing and generation we also present a novel algorithm for learning which events are worth describing  human evaluations of the generated commentaries indicate they are of reasonable quality and in some cases even on par with those produced by humans for our limited domain
