r  aras and a  dutech 2010 an investigation into mathematical programming for finite horizon decentralized pomdps volume 37 pages 329396

decentralized planning in uncertain environments is a complex task generally dealt with by using a decisiontheoretic approach mainly through the framework of decentralized partially observable markov decision processes decpomdps although decpomdps are a general and powerful modeling tool solving them is a task with an overwhelming complexity that can be doubly exponential in this paper we study an alternate formulation of decpomdps relying on a sequenceform representation of policies from this formulation we show how to derive mixed integer linear programming milp problems that once solved give exact optimal solutions to the decpomdps we show that these milps can be derived either by using some combinatorial characteristics of the optimal solutions of the decpomdps or by using concepts borrowed from game theory through an experimental validation on classical test problems from the decpomdp literature we compare our approach to existing algorithms results show that mathematical programming outperforms dynamic programming but is less efficient than forward search except for some particular problems

the main contributions of this work are the use of mathematical programming for decpomdps and a better understanding of decpomdps and of their solutions besides we argue that our alternate representation of decpomdps could be helpful for designing novel algorithms looking for approximate solutions to decpomdps
