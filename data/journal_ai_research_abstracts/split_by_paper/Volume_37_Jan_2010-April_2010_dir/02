u  zahavi a  felner n  burch and r  c holte 2010 predicting the performance of ida using conditional distributions volume 37 pages 4183

korf reid and edelkamp introduced a formula to predict the number of nodes ida will expand on a single iteration for a given consistent heuristic and experimentally demonstrated that it could make very accurate predictions in this paper we show that in addition to requiring the heuristic to be consistent their formulas predictions are accurate only at levels of the bruteforce search tree where the heuristic values obey the unconditional distribution that they defined and then used in their formula we then propose a new formula that works well without these requirements ie it can  make accurate predictions of idas performance for inconsistent heuristics and if the heuristic values in any

level do not obey the unconditional distribution in order to achieve this we introduce the conditional distribution of heuristic values which is a generalization of their unconditional heuristic distribution we also provide extensions of our formula that handle individual start states and the augmentation of ida with bidirectional pathmax bpmx a technique for propagating heuristic values when inconsistent heuristics are used experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of our new method and all its variations
