h  r andersen t  hadzic and d  pisinger 2010 interactive cost configuration over decision diagrams volume 37 pages 99139

in many ai domains such as product configuration a user should interactively specify a solution that must satisfy  a set of constraints in such scenarios offline compilation of feasible solutions into a tractable representation is an important approach to delivering efficient backtrackfree  user interaction online in particularbinary decision diagrams bdds have been successfully used as a compilation target for product and service configuration in this paper we discuss how to extend bddbased configuration to scenarios involving cost functions which express user preferences

we first show that an efficient robust and easy to implement extension is possible if the cost function is additive and feasible solutions are represented using multivalued decision diagrams mdds we also discuss the effect on mdd size if the cost function is nonadditive or if it is encoded explicitly into mdd we then discuss interactive configuration in the presence of multiple cost functions we prove that even in its simplest form multiplecost configuration is nphard in the input mdd however for solving twocost configuration we develop a pseudopolynomial scheme and a fully polynomial approximation scheme the applicability of our approach is demonstrated through experiments over realworld configuration models and productcatalogue datasets response times are generally within a fraction of a second even for very large instances
