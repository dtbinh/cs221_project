y  engel and m  p wellman 2010 multiattribute auctions based on generalized additive independence volume 37 pages 479525

we develop multiattribute auctions that accommodate generalized additive independent gai preferences we propose an iterative auction mechanism that maintains prices on potentially overlapping gai clusters of attributes thus decreases elicitation and computational burden and creates an open competition among suppliers over a multidimensional domain most significantly the auction is guaranteed to achieve surplus which approximates optimal welfare up to a small additive factor under reasonable equilibrium strategies of traders the main departure of gai auctions from previous literature is to accommodate nonadditive trader preferences hence allowing traders to condition their evaluation of specific attributes on the value of other attributes at the same time the gai structure supports a compact representation of prices enabling a tractable auction process we perform a simulation study demonstrating and quantifying the significant efficiency advantage of more expressive preference modeling we draw random gaistructured utility functions with various internal structures generate additive functions that approximate the gai utility and compare the performance of the auctions using the two representations we find that allowing traders to express existing dependencies among attributes improves the economic efficiency of multiattribute auctions
