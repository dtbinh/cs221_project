the paper investigates parameterized approximate messagepassing schemes that are based on bounded inference and are inspired by pearls belief propagation algorithm bp we start with the bounded inference miniclustering algorithm and then move to the iterative scheme called iterative joingraph propagation ijgp that combines both iteration and bounded inference algorithm ijgp belongs to the class of generalized belief propagation algorithms a framework that allowed connections with approximate algorithms from statistical physics and is shown empirically to surpass the performance of miniclustering and belief propagation as well as a number of other stateoftheart algorithms on several classes of networks we also provide insight into the accuracy of iterative bp and ijgp by relating these algorithms to well known classes of constraint propagation schemes
