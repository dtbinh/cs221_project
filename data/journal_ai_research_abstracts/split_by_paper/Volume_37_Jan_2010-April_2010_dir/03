s  dobzinski and n  nisan 2010 mechanisms for multiunit auctions volume 37 pages 8598

we present an incentivecompatible polynomialtime approximation scheme for multiunit auctions with general kminded player valuations the mechanism fully optimizes over an appropriately chosen subrange of possible allocations and then uses vcg payments over this subrange we show that obtaining a fully polynomialtime incentivecompatible approximation scheme at least using vcg payments is nphard for the case of valuations given by black boxes we give a polynomialtime incentivecompatible 2approximation mechanism and show that no better is possible at least using vcg payments
