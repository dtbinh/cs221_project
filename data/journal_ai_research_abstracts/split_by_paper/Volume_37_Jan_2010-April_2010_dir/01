the computation of relatedness between two fragments of text in an automated manner requires taking into account a wide range of factors pertaining to the meaning the two fragments convey and the pairwise relations between their words without doubt a measure of relatedness between text segments must take into account both the lexical and the semantic relatedness between words such a measure that captures well both aspects of text relatedness may help in many tasks such as text retrieval classification and clustering in this paper we present a new approach for measuring the semantic relatedness between words based on their implicit semantic links the approach exploits only a word thesaurus in order to devise implicit semantic links between words based on this approach we introduce omiotis a new measure of semantic relatedness between texts which capitalizes on the wordtoword semantic relatedness measure sr and extends it to measure the relatedness between texts we gradually validate our method we first evaluate the performance of the semantic relatedness measure between individual words covering wordtoword similarity and relatedness synonym identification and word analogy then we proceed with evaluating the performance of our method in measuring texttotext semantic relatedness in two tasks namely sentencetosentence similarity and paraphrase recognition experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms every lexiconbased method of semantic relatedness in the selected tasks and the used data sets and competes well against corpusbased and hybrid approaches
