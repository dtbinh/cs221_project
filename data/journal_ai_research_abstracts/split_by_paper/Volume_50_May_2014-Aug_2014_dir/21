in the field of domainindependent planning several powerful planners implementing different techniques have been developed however no one of these systems outperforms all others in every known benchmark domain in this work we propose a multiplanner approach that automatically configures a portfolio of planning techniques for each given domain the configuration process for a given domain uses a set of training instances to i compute and analyze some alternative sets of macroactions for each planner in the portfolio identifying a possibly empty useful set ii select a cluster of planners each one with the identified useful set of macroactions that is expected to perform best and iii derive some additional information for configuring the execution scheduling of the selected planners at planning time the resulting planning system called pbp portfolio based planner has two variants focusing on speed and plan quality different versions of pbp entered and won the learning track of the sixth and seventh international planning competitions in this paper we experimentally analyze pbp considering planning speed and plan quality in depth we provide a collection of results that help to understand pbps behavior and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to configuring a portfolio of planners with macroactions
