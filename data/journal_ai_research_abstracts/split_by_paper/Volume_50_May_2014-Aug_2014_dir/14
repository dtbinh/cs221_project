this paper describes a polynomiallysolvable class of temporal planning problems polynomiality follows from two assumptions firstly by supposing that each subgoal fluent can be established by at most one action we can quickly determine which actions are necessary in any plan secondly the monotonicity of subgoal fluents allows us to express planning as an instance of stp8800 simple temporal problem with difference constraints this class includes temporallyexpressive problems requiring the concurrent execution of actions with potential applications in the chemical pharmaceutical and construction industries 

we also show that any temporal planning problem has a monotone relaxation which can lead to the polynomialtime detection of its unsolvability in certain cases indeed we show that our relaxation is orthogonal to relaxations based on the ignoredeletes approach used in classical planning since it preserves deletes and can also exploit temporal information
