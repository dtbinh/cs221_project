many applications ranging from video games to dynamic robotics require solving singleagent deterministic search problems in partially known environments under very tight time constraints realtime heuristic search rths algorithms are specifically designed for those applications as a subroutine most of them invoke a standard but bounded search algorithm that searches for the goal in this paper we present frit a simple approach for singleagent deterministic search problems under tight constraints and partially known environments that unlike traditional rths does not search for the goal but rather searches for a path that connects the current state with a socalled ideal tree t  when the agent observes that an arc in the tree cannot be traversed in the actual environment it removes such an arc from t and then carries out a reconnection search whose objective is to find a path between the current state and any node in t  the reconnection search is done using an algorithm that is passed as a parameter to frit if such a parameter is an rths algorithm then the resulting algorithm can be an rths algorithm we show in addition that frit may be fed with a bounded complete blindsearch algorithm we evaluate our approach over grid pathfinding benchmarks including game maps and mazes our results show that frit used with rtaa a standard rths algorithm outperforms rtaa significantly by one order of magnitude under tight time constraints in addition fritdartaa substantially outperforms dartaa a stateoftheart rths algorithm usually obtaining solutions 50 cheaper on average when performing the same search effort finally fritbfs ie frit using breadthfirstsearch obtains bestquality solutions when time is limited compared to adaptive a and repeated a finally we show that bug2 a pathfindingspecific navigation algorithm outperforms fritbfs when planning time is extremely limited but when given more time the situation reverses
