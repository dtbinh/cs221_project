in many circumstances where multiple agents need to make a joint decision voting is used to aggregate the agents preferences each agents vote carries a weight and if the sum of the weights of the  agents in favor of some outcome is larger than or equal to a given quota then this outcome is decided upon the distribution of weights leads to a certain distribution of power several power indices have been proposed to measure such power in the socalled inverse problem we are given a target distribution of power and are asked to come up with a game in the form of a quota plus an assignment of weights to the players whose power distribution is as close as possible to the target distribution according to some specied distance measure

we first present a doubly exponential algorithm for enumerating the set of simple games we then improve on this algorithm for the class of weighted voting games and obtain a quadratic exponential ie 2on2 algorithm for enumerating them we show that this improved algorithm runs in outputpolynomial time making it the fastest possible enumeration algorithm up to a polynomial factor finally we propose an exact anytimealgorithm that runs in exponential time for the power index weighted voting game design problem the inverse problem we implement this algorithm to find a weighted voting game with a normalized banzhaf power distribution closest to a target power index and perform experiments to obtain some insights about the set of weighted voting games we remark that our algorithm is applicable to optimizing any exponentialtime computable function the distance of the normalized banzhaf index to a target power index is merely taken as an example
