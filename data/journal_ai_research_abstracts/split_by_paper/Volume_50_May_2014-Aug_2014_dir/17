dynamic scheduling problems consist of both challenging combinatorics as found in classical scheduling problems and stochastics due to uncertainty about the arrival times resource requirements and processing times of jobs to address these two challenges we investigate the integration of queueing theory and scheduling the former reasons about longrun stochastic system characteristics whereas the latter typically deals with shortterm combinatorics we investigate two simple problems to isolate the core differences and potential synergies between the two approaches a twomachine dynamic flowshop and a flexible queueing network we show for the first time that stability a fundamental characteristic in queueing theory can be applied to approaches that periodically solve combinatorial scheduling problems  we empirically demonstrate that for a dynamic flowshop the use of combinatorial reasoning has little impact on schedule quality beyond queueing approaches in contrast for the more complicated flexible queueing network a novel algorithm that combines longterm guidance from queueing theory with shortterm combinatorial decision making outperforms all other tested approaches to our knowledge this is the first time that such a hybrid of queueing theory and scheduling techniques has been proposed and evaluated
