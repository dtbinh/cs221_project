in domains such as  biomedicine ontologies are prominently utilized for annotating data   consequently aligning ontologies facilitates integrating  data   several   algorithms  exist  for  automatically aligning  ontologies   with  diverse  levels   of  performance   as alignment   applications  evolve   and  exhibit   online   run  time constraints performing the alignment in a reasonable amount of time without  compromising the  quality  of the  alignment  is a  crucial challenge  a  large class of alignment algorithms  is iterative and often consumes more time than others in delivering solutions of high quality we present a novel and general approach for speeding up the multivariable  optimization process  utilized  by these  algorithms specifically  we  use  the  technique of  blockcoordinate  descent bcd  which exploits  the subdimensions  of the  alignment problem identified using a partitioning  scheme  we integrate this approach into  multiple wellknown  alignment  algorithms and  show that  the enhanced  algorithms  generate  similar  or improved  alignments  in significantly  less  time on  a  comprehensive  testbed of  ontology pairs  because  bcd does not  overly constrain how we  partition or order the  parts we vary  the partitioning and ordering  schemes in order  to empirically  determine the  best schemes  for each  of the selected  algorithms  as biomedicine  represents a  key application domain  for  ontologies  we  introduce a  comprehensive  biomedical ontology testbed  for the community  in order to  evaluate alignment algorithms  because biomedical ontologies tend to be large default iterative  techniques find it  difficult to  produce a  good quality alignment within a reasonable amount of time we align a significant number  of  ontology  pairs  from this  testbed  using  bcdenhanced algorithms   our contributions represent  an important  step toward making a  significant class of  alignment techniques computationally feasible
