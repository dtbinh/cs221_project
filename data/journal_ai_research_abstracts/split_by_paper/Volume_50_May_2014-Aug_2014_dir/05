when solving instances of problem domains that feature a large branching factor a may generate a large number of nodes whose cost is greater than the cost of the optimal solution we designate such nodes as surplus generating surplus nodes and adding them to the open list may dominate both time and memory of the search a recently introduced variant of a called partial expansion a pea deals with the memory aspect of this problem when expanding a node n pea generates all of its children and puts into open only the children with f  f n n is reinserted in the open list with the f cost of the best discarded child this guarantees that surplus nodes are not inserted into open

in this paper we present a novel variant of a called enhanced partial expansion a epea that advances the idea of pea to address the time aspect given a priori domain and heuristic specific knowledge epea generates only the nodes with f  fn although epea is not always applicable or practical we study several variants of epea which make it applicable to a large number of domains and heuristics in particular the ideas of epea are applicable to ida and to the domains where pattern databases are traditionally used experimental studies show significant improvements in runtime and memory performance for several standard benchmark applications we provide several theoretical studies to facilitate an understanding of the new algorithm
