attackerdefender stackelberg security games ssgs have emerged as an important research area in multiagent systems however existing ssgs models yield fixed static schedules which fail in dynamic domains where defenders face execution uncertainty ie in domains where defenders may face unanticipated disruptions of their schedules a concrete example is an application involving checking fares on trains where a defenders schedule is frequently interrupted by fare evaders making static schedules useless

to address this shortcoming this paper provides four main contributions first we present a novel general bayesian stackelberg game model for security resource allocation in dynamic uncertain domains in this new model execution uncertainty is handled by using a markov decision process mdp for generating defender policies second we study the problem of computing a stackelberg equilibrium for this game and exploit problem structure to reduce it to a polynomialsized optimization problem shifting to evaluation our third contribution shows in simulation that our mdpbased policies overcome the failures of previous ssg algorithms in so doing we can now build a complete system that enables handling of schedule interruptions and consequently to conduct some of the first controlled experiments on ssgs in the field hence as our final contribution we present results from a realworld experiment on metro trains in los angeles validating our mdpbased model and most importantly concretely measuring the benefits of ssgs for security resource allocation
