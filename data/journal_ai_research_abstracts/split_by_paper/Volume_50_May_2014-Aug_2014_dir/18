falsename manipulation refers to the question of whether a player in a weighted voting game can increase her power by splitting into several players and distributing her weight among these false identities  relatedly the beneficial merging problem asks whether a coalition of players can increase their power in a weighted voting game by merging their weights  for the problems of whether merging or splitting players in weighted voting games is beneficial in terms of the shapleyshubik and the normalized banzhaf index merely nphardness lower bounds are known leaving the question about their exact complexity open  for the shapleyshubik and the probabilistic banzhaf index we raise these lower bounds to hardness for pp probabilistic polynomial time a class considered to be by far a larger class than np  for both power indices we provide matching upper bounds for beneficial merging and whenever the new players weights are given also for beneficial splitting thus resolving previous conjectures in the affirmative  relatedly we consider the beneficial annexation problem asking whether a single player can increase her power by taking over other players weights  it is known that annexation is never disadvantageous for the shapleyshubik index and that beneficial annexation is nphard for the normalized banzhaf index  we show that annexation is never disadvantageous for the probabilistic banzhaf index either and for both the shapleyshubik index and the probabilistic banzhaf index we show that it is npcomplete to decide whether annexing another player is advantageous  moreover we propose a general framework for merging and splitting that can be applied to different classes and representations of games
