b  bonet and h  geffner 2014 belief tracking for planning with sensing width complexity and approximations volume 50 pages 923970

we consider the problem of belief tracking in a planning setting where states are valuations over a set of variables that are partially observable and beliefs stand for the sets of states that are possible while the problem is intractable in the worst case it has been recently shown that in deterministic conformant and contingent problems belief tracking is exponential in a width parameter that is often bounded and small in this work we extend these results in two ways first we introduce a width notion that applies to nondeterministic problems as well develop a factored belief tracking algorithm that is exponential in the problem width and show how it applies to existing benchmarks second we introduce a meaningful powerful and sound approximation scheme beam tracking that is exponential in a smaller parameter  the problem causal width and has much broader applicability we illustrate the value of this algorithm over large instances of problems such as battleship minesweeper and wumpus where it yields stateoftheart performance in realtime
