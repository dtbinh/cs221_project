structured prediction is the problem of learning a function that maps structured inputs to structured outputs prototypical examples of structured prediction include partofspeech tagging and semantic segmentation of images inspired by the recent successes of searchbased structured prediction we introduce a new framework for structured prediction called hcsearch given a structured input the framework uses a search procedure guided by a learned heuristic h to uncover high quality candidate outputs and then employs a separate learned cost function c to select a final prediction among those outputs the overall loss of this prediction architecture decomposes into the loss due to h not leading to high quality outputs and the loss due to c not selecting the best among the generated outputs guided by this decomposition we minimize the overall loss in a greedy stagewise manner by first training h to quickly uncover high quality outputs via imitation learning and then training c to correctly rank the outputs generated via h according to their true losses importantly this training procedure is sensitive to the particular loss function of interest and the timebound allowed for predictions experiments on several benchmark domains show that our approach significantly outperforms several stateoftheart methods
