translation rule selection is a task of selecting appropriate translation rules for an ambiguous sourcelanguage segment as translation ambiguities are pervasive in statistical machine translation we introduce two topicbased models for translation rule selection which incorporates global topic information into translation disambiguation we associate each synchronous translation rule with source and targetside topic distributionswith these topic distributions we propose a topic dissimilarity model to select desirable less dissimilar rules by imposing penalties for rules with a large value of dissimilarity of their topic distributions to those of given documents in order to encourage the use of nontopic specific translation rules we also present a topic sensitivity model to balance translation rule selection between generic rules and topicspecific rules furthermore we project targetside topic distributions onto the sourceside topic model space so that we can benefit from topic information of both the source and target language we integrate the proposed topic dissimilarity and sensitivity model into hierarchical phrasebased machine translation for synchronous translation rule selection experiments show that our topicbased translation rule selection model can substantially improve translation quality
