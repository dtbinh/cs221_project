there is a growing interest in intelligent assistants for a variety of applications from sorting email to helping people with disabilities to do their daily chores in this paper we formulate the problem of intelligent assistance in a decisiontheoretic framework and present both theoretical and empirical results we first introduce a class of pomdps called hiddengoal mdps hgmdps which formalizes the problem of interactively assisting an agent whose goal is hidden and whose actions are observable in spite of its restricted nature we show that optimal action selection for hgmdps is pspacecomplete even for deterministic dynamics we then introduce a more restricted model called helper action mdps hamdps which are sufficient for modeling many realworld problems we show classes of hamdps for which efficient algorithms are possible more interestingly for general hamdps we show that a simple myopic policy achieves a near optimal regret compared to an oracle assistant that knows the agents goal we then introduce more sophisticated versions of this policy for the general case of hgmdps that we combine with a novel approach for quickly learning about the agent being assisted we evaluate our approach in two gamelike computer environments where human subjects perform tasks and in a realworld domain of providing assistance during folder navigation in a computer desktop environment the results show that in all three domains the framework results in an assistant that substantially reduces user effort with only modest computation
