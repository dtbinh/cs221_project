property directed reachability pdr is a very promising recent method for deciding reachability in symbolically represented transition systems while originally conceived as a model checking algorithm for hardware circuits it has already been successfully applied in several other areas this paper is the first investigation of pdr from the perspective of automated planning

similarly to the planning as satisfiability paradigm pdr draws its strength from internally employing an efficient satsolver we show that most standard encoding schemes of planning into sat can be directly used to turn pdr into a planning algorithm as a nonobvious alternative we propose to replace the satsolver inside pdr by a planningspecific procedure implementing the same interface this satsolver free variant is not only more efficient but offers additional insights and opportunities for further improvements an experimental comparison to the state of the art planners finds it highly competitive solving most problems on several domains
