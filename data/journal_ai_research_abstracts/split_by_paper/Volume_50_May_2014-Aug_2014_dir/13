assume that each of n voters may or may not approve each of m issues if an agent the lobby may influence up to k voters then the central question of the nphard lobbying problem is whether the lobby can choose the voters to be influenced so that as a result each issue gets a majority of approvals this problem can be modeled as a simple matrix modification problem can one replace k rows of a binary n x mmatrix by k all1 rows such that each column in the resulting matrix has a majority of 1s significantly extending on previous work that showed parameterized intractability w2completeness with respect to the number k of modified rows we study how natural parameters such as n m k or the maximum number of 1s missing for any column to have a majority of 1s referred to as gap value g govern the computational complexity of lobbying among other results we prove that lobbying is fixedparameter tractable for parameter m and provide a greedy logarithmicfactor approximation algorithm which solves lobbying even optimally if m  5 we also show empirically that this greedy algorithm performs well on general instances as a further key result we prove that lobbying is logsnpcomplete for constant values g0 thus providing a first natural complete problem from voting for this complexity class of limited nondeterminism
