y  wang y  zhang y  zhou and m  zhang 2014 knowledge forgetting in answer set programming volume 50 pages 3170

the ability of discarding or hiding irrelevant information has been

recognized as an important feature for knowledge based systems including answer set programming the notion of strong equivalence in answer set programming plays an important role for different problems as it gives rise to a substitution principle and amounts to knowledge equivalence of logic programs in this paper we uniformly propose a semantic knowledge forgetting  called ht and flpforgetting for logic programs under stable model and flpstable model semantics respectively our proposed knowledge forgetting discards exactly the knowledge of a logic program which is relevant to forgotten variables thus it preserves strong equivalence in the sense that strongly equivalent logic programs will remain strongly equivalent after forgetting the same variables we show that this semantic forgetting result is always expressible and we prove a representation theorem stating that the ht and flpforgetting can be precisely characterized by zhangzhous four forgetting postulates under the ht and flpmodel semantics respectively we also reveal underlying connections between the proposed forgetting and the forgetting of propositional logic and provide complexity results for decision problems in relation to the forgetting an application of the proposed forgetting is also considered in a conflict solving scenario
