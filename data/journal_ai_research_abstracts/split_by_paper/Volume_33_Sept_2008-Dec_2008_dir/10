e  amir and a  chang 2008 learning partially observable deterministic action models volume 33 pages 349402

we present exact algorithms for identifying deterministicactions effects and preconditions in dynamic partially observable domains  they apply when one does not know the action modelthe way actions affect the world of a domain and must learn it from partial observations over time such scenarios are common in real world applications they are challenging for ai tasks because traditional domain structures that underly tractability eg conditional independence fail there eg world features become correlated our work departs from traditional assumptions about partial observations and action models in particular it focuses on problems in which actions are deterministic of simple logical structure and observation models have all features observed with some frequency we yield tractable algorithms for the modified problem for such domains
