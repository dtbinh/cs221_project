we investigate the computational complexity of testing dominance and consistency in cpnets previously the complexity of dominance has been determined for restricted classes in which the dependency graph of the  cpnet is acyclic however there are preferences of interest that define cyclic dependency graphs these are modeled with general cpnets in our main results we show here that both dominance and consistency for general cpnets are pspacecomplete we then consider the concept of strong dominance dominance equivalence and dominance incomparability and several notions of optimality and identify the complexity of the corresponding decision problems the reductions used in the proofs are from strips planning and thus reinforce the earlier established connections between both areas
