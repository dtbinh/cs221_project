d  zhang and y  zhang 2008 an ordinal bargaining solution with fixedpoint property volume 33 pages 433464

shapleys impossibility result indicates that the twoperson bargaining problem has no nontrivial ordinal solution with the traditional gametheoretic bargaining model although the result is no longer true for bargaining problems with more than two agents none of the well known bargaining solutions are ordinal searching for meaningful ordinal solutions especially for the bilateral bargaining problem has been a challenging issue in bargaining theory for more than three decades this paper proposes a logicbased ordinal solution to the bilateral bargaining problem we argue that if a bargaining problem is modeled in terms of the logical relation of players physical negotiation items a meaningful bargaining solution can be constructed based on the ordinal structure of bargainers preferences we represent bargainers demands in propositional logic and bargainers preferences over their demands in total preorder we show that the solution satisfies most desirable logical properties such as individual rationality logical version consistency collective rationality as well as a few typical gametheoretic properties such as weak pareto optimality and contraction invariance in addition if all players demand sets are logically closed the solution satisfies a fixedpoint condition which says that the outcome of a negotiation is the result of mutual belief revision finally we define various decision problems in relation to our bargaining model and study their computational complexity
