it is wellknown that acting in an individually rational manner according to the principles of classical game theory may lead to suboptimal solutions in a class of problems named social dilemmas in contrast humans generally do not have much difficulty with social dilemmas as they are able to balance personal benefit and group benefit as agents in multiagent systems are regularly confronted with social dilemmas for instance in tasks such as resource allocation these agents may benefit from the inclusion of mechanisms thought to facilitate human fairness although many of such mechanisms have already been implemented in a multiagent systems context their application is usually limited to rather abstract social dilemmas with a discrete set of available strategies usually two given that many realworld examples of social dilemmas are actually continuous in nature we extend this previous work to more general dilemmas in which agents operate in a continuous strategy space the social dilemma under study here is the wellknown ultimatum game in which an optimal solution is achieved if agents agree on a common strategy we investigate whether a scalefree interaction network facilitates agents to reach agreement especially in the presence of fixedstrategy agents that represent a desired eg human outcome moreover we study the influence of rewiring in the interaction network the agents are equipped with continuousaction learning automata and play a large number of random pairwise games in order to establish a common strategy from our experiments we may conclude that results obtained in discretestrategy games can be generalized to continuousstrategy games to a certain extent a scalefree interaction network structure allows agents to achieve agreement on a common strategy and rewiring in the interaction network greatly enhances the agents ability to reach agreement however it also becomes clear that some alternative mechanisms such as reputation and volunteering have many subtleties involved and do not have convincing beneficial effects in the continuous case
