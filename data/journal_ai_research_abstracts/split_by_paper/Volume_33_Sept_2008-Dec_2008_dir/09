this paper presents the computational logic foundations of a model of agency called the kgp knowledge goals and plan model this model allows the specification of heterogeneous agents that can interact with each other and can exhibit both proactive and reactive behaviour allowing them to function in dynamic environments by adjusting their goals and plans when changes happen in such environments  kgp provides a highly modular agent architecture that integrates a collection of reasoning and physical capabilities synthesised within transitions that update the agents state in response to reasoning sensing and acting transitions are orchestrated by cycle theories that specify the order in which transitions are executed while taking into account the dynamic context and agent preferences as well as selection operators for providing inputs to transitions
