in this paper we elucidate the equivalence between inference in game theory and machine learning our aim in so doing is to establish an equivalent vocabulary between the two domains so as to facilitate developments at the intersection of both 64257elds and as proof of the usefulness of this approach we use recent developments in each 64257eld to make useful improvements to the other more speci64257cally we consider the analogies between smooth best responses in 64257ctitious play and bayesian inference methods initially we use these insights to develop and demonstrate an improved algorithm for learning in games based on probabilistic moderation that is by integrating over the distribution of opponent strategies a bayesian approach within machine learning rather than taking a simple empirical average the approach used in standard 64257ctitious play we derive a novel moderated 64257ctitious play algorithm and show that it is more likely than standard 64257ctitious play to converge to a payoffdominant but riskdominated nash equilibrium in a simple coordination game furthermore we consider the converse case and show how insights from game theory can be used to derive two improved mean 64257eld variational learning algorithms we 64257rst show that the standard update rule of mean 64257eld variational learning is analogous to a cournot adjustment within game theory by analogy with 64257ctitious play we then suggest an improved update rule and show that this results in 64257ctitious variational play an improved mean 64257eld variational learning algorithm that exhibits better convergence in highly or strongly connected graphical models second we use a recent advance in 64257ctitious play namely dynamic 64257ctitious play to derive a derivative action variational learning algorithm that exhibits superior convergence properties on a canonical machine learning problem clustering a mixture distribution
