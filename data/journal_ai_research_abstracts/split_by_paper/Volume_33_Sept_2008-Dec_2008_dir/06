t  de laet j  de schutter and h  bruyninckx 2008 a rigorously bayesian beam model and an adaptive full scan model for range finders in dynamic environments volume 33 pages 179222

this paper proposes and experimentally validates a bayesian network model of a range finder adapted to dynamic environments all modeling assumptions are rigorously explained and all model parameters have a physical interpretation this approach results in a transparent and intuitive model with respect to the state of the art beam model this paper i proposes a different functional form for the probability of range measurements caused by unmodeled objects ii intuitively explains the discontinuity encountered in te state of the art beam model and iii reduces the number of model parameters while maintaining the same representational power for experimental data the proposed beam model is called rbbm short for rigorously bayesian beam model a maximum likelihood and a variational bayesian estimator both based on expectationmaximization are proposed to learn the model parameters
