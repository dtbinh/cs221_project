many ai researchers and cognitive scientists have argued that analogy is the core of cognition the most influential work on computational modeling of analogymaking is structure mapping theory smt and its implementation in the structure mapping engine sme a limitation of sme is the requirement for complex handcoded representations we introduce the latent relation mapping engine lrme which combines ideas from sme and latent relational analysis lra in order to remove the requirement for handcoded representations lrme builds analogical mappings between lists of words using a large corpus of raw text to automatically discover the semantic relations among the words we evaluate lrme on a set of twenty analogical mapping problems ten based on scientific analogies and ten based on common metaphors lrme achieves humanlevel performance on the twenty problems we compare lrme with a variety of alternative approaches and find that they are not able to reach the same level of performance
