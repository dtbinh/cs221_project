s  abdallah and v  lesser 2008 a multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm with nonlinear dynamics volume 33 pages 521549

several multiagent reinforcement learning marl algorithms have been proposed to optimize agents decisions due to the complexity of the problem the majority of the previously developed marl algorithms assumed agents either had some knowledge of the underlying game such as nash equilibria andor observed other agents actions and the rewards they received
