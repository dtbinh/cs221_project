inspired by the recently introduced framework of andor search spaces for graphical models we propose to augment multivalued decision diagrams mdd with and nodes in order to capture function decomposition structure and to extend these compiled data structures to general weighted graphical models eg probabilistic models we present the andor multivalued decision diagram aomdd which compiles a graphical model into a canonical form that supports polynomial eg solution counting belief updating or constant time eg equivalence of graphical models queries we provide two algorithms for compiling the aomdd of a graphical model the first is searchbased and works by applying reduction rules to the trace of the memory intensive andor search algorithm the second is inferencebased and uses a bucket elimination schedule to combine the aomdds of the input functions via the the apply operator for both algorithms the compilation time and the size of the aomdd are in the worst case exponential in the treewidth of the graphical model rather than pathwidth as is known for ordered binary decision diagrams obdds we introduce the concept of semantic treewidth which helps explain why the size of a decision diagram is often much smaller than the worst case bound we provide an experimental evaluation that demonstrates the potential of aomdds
