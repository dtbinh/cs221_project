in the usual models of cooperative game theory the outcome of a coalition formation process is either the grand coalition or a coalition structure that consists of disjoint coalitions however in many domains where coalitions are associated with tasks an agent may be involved in executing more than one task and thus may distribute his resources among several coalitions to tackle such scenarios we introduce a model for cooperative games with overlapping coalitionsor overlapping coalition formation ocf games we then explore the issue of stability in this setting in particular we introduce a notion of the core which generalizes the corresponding notion in the traditional nonoverlapping scenario then under some quite general conditions we characterize the elements of the core and show that any element of the core maximizes the social welfare we also introduce a concept of balancedness for overlapping coalitional games and use it to characterize coalition structures that can be extended to elements of the core finally we generalize the notion of convexity to our setting and show that under some natural assumptions convex games have a nonempty core moreover we introduce two alternative notions of stability in ocf that allow a wider range of deviations and explore the relationships among the corresponding definitions of the core as well as the classic nonoverlapping core and the aubin core we illustrate the general properties of the three cores and also study them from a computational perspective thus obtaining additional insights into their fundamental structure
