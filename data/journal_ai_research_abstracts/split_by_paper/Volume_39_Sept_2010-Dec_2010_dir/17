j  xu and c  r shelton 2010 intrusion detection using continuous time bayesian networks volume 39 pages 745774

intrusion detection systems idss fall into two highlevel categories networkbased systems nids that monitor network behaviors and hostbased systems hids that monitor system calls in this work we present a general technique for both systems we use anomaly detection which identifies patterns not conforming to a historic norm in both types of systems the rates of change vary dramatically over time due to burstiness and over components due to service difference to efficiently model such systems we use continuous time bayesian networks ctbns and avoid specifying a fixed update interval common to discretetime models we build generative models from the normal training data and abnormal behaviors are flagged based on their likelihood under this norm for nids we construct a hierarchical ctbn model for the network packet traces and use raoblackwellized particle filtering to learn the parameters we illustrate the power of our method through experiments on detecting real worms and identifying hosts on two publicly available network traces the mawi dataset and the lbnl dataset for hids we develop a novel learning method to deal with the finite resolution of system log file time stamps without losing the benefits of our continuous time model we demonstrate the method by detecting intrusions in the darpa 1998 bsm dataset
