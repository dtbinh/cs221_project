statespace search with explicit abstraction heuristics is at the state of the art of costoptimal planning these heuristics are inherently limited nonetheless because the size of the abstract space must be bounded by some even if a very large constant targeting this shortcoming we introduce the notion of iadditive implicit abstractionsi in which the planning task is abstracted by instances of tractable fragments of optimal planning we then introduce a concrete setting of this framework called iforkdecompositioni that is based on two novel fragments of tractable costoptimal planning the induced admissible heuristics are then studied formally and empirically this  study testifies for the accuracy of the fork decomposition heuristics yet our empirical evaluation also stresses the tradeoff between their accuracy and the runtime complexity of computing them indeed some of the power of the explicit abstraction heuristics comes from precomputing the heuristic function offline and then determining ihsi for each evaluated state isi by a very fast lookup in a database by contrast while forkdecomposition heuristics can be calculated in polynomial time  computing them is far from being fast to address this problem we show that the timepernode complexity bottleneck of the forkdecomposition heuristics  can be successfully overcome we demonstrate that an equivalent of the explicit abstraction notion of a database exists for the forkdecomposition abstractions as well despite their exponentialsize abstract spaces we then verify empirically that heuristic search with the databased forkdecomposition heuristics favorably competes with the state of the art of costoptimal planning
