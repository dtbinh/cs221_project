to harness modern multicore processors it is imperative to develop parallel versions of fundamental algorithms in this paper we compare different approaches to parallel bestfirst search in a sharedmemory setting we present a new method pbnf that uses abstraction to partition the state space and to detect duplicate states without requiring frequent locking pbnf allows speculative expansions when necessary to keep threads busy we identify and fix potential livelock conditions in our approach proving its correctness using temporal logic our approach is general allowing it to extend easily to suboptimal and anytime heuristic search in an empirical comparison on strips planning grid pathfinding and sliding tile puzzle problems using 8core machines we show that a weighted a and anytime weighted a implemented using pbnf yield faster search than improved versions of previous parallel search proposals
