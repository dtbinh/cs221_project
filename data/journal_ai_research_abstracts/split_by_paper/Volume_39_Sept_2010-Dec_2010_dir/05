m  o riedl and r  m young 2010 narrative planning balancing plot and character volume 39 pages 217268

narrative and in particular storytelling is an important part of the human experience  consequently computational systems that can reason about narrative can be more effective communicators entertainers educators and trainers  one of the central challenges in computational narrative reasoning is narrative generation the automated creation of meaningful event sequences  there are many factors  logical and aesthetic  that contribute to the success of a narrative artifact  central to this success is its understandability  we argue that the following two attributes of narratives are universal a the logical causal progression of plot and b character believability  character believability is the perception by the audience that the actions performed by characters do not negatively impact the audiences suspension of disbelief  specifically characters must be perceived by the audience to be intentional agents  in this article we explore the use of refinement search as a technique for solving the narrative generation problem  to find a sound and believable sequence of character actions that transforms an initial world state into a world state in which goal propositions hold we describe a novel refinement search planning algorithm  the intentbased partial order causal link ipocl planner  that in addition to creating causally sound plot progression reasons about character intentionality by identifying possible character goals that explain their actions and creating plan structures that explain why those characters commit to their goals we present the results of an empirical evaluation that demonstrates that narrative plans generated by the ipocl algorithm support audience comprehension of character intentions better than plans generated by conventional partialorder planners
