realtime heuristic search algorithms satisfy a constant bound on the amount of planning per action independent of problem size as a result they scale up well as problems become larger this property would make them well suited for video games where artificial intelligence controlled agents must react quickly to user commands and to other agents actions on the downside realtime search algorithms employ learning methods that frequently lead to poor solution quality and cause the agent to appear irrational by revisiting the same problem states repeatedly the situation changed recently with a new algorithm d lrta which attempted to eliminate learning by automatically selecting subgoals d lrta is well poised for video games except it has a complex and memorydemanding precomputation phase during which it builds a database of subgoals in this paper we propose a simpler and more memoryefficient way of precomputing subgoals thereby eliminating the main obstacle to applying stateoftheart realtime search methods in video games the new algorithm solves a number of randomly chosen problems offline compresses the solutions into a series of subgoals and stores them in a database when presented with a novel problem online it queries the database for the most similar previously solved case and uses its subgoals to solve the problem in the domain of pathfinding on four large video game maps the new algorithm delivers solutions eight times better while using 57 times less memory and requiring 14 less precomputation time
