online offerings such as web search news portals and ecommerce applications face the challenge of providing highquality service to a large heterogeneous user base recent efforts have highlighted the potential to improve performance by introducing methods to personalize services based on special knowledge about users and their context for example a users demographics location and past search and browsing may be useful in enhancing the results offered in response to web search queries  however reasonable concerns about privacy by both users providers and government agencies acting on behalf of citizens may limit access by services to such information   we introduce and explore an economics of privacy in personalization where people can opt to share personal information in a standing or ondemand manner in return for expected enhancements in the quality of an online service we focus on the example of web search and formulate realistic objective functions for search efficacy and privacy we demonstrate how we can find a provably nearoptimal optimization of the utilityprivacy tradeoff in an efficient manner  we evaluate our methodology on data drawn from a log of the search activity of volunteer participants we separately assess users preferences about privacy and utility via a largescale survey aimed at eliciting preferences about peoples willingness to trade the sharing of personal data in returns for gains in search efficiency we show that a significant level of personalization can be achieved using a relatively small amount of information about users
