b  banerjee and b  chandrasekaran 2010 a constraint satisfaction framework for executing perceptions and actions in diagrammatic reasoning volume 39 pages 373427

diagrammatic reasoning dr is pervasive in human problem solving as a powerful adjunct to symbolic reasoning based on languagelike representations the research reported in this paper is a contribution to building a general purpose dr system as an extension to a soarlike problem solving architecture the work is in a framework in which dr is modeled as a process where subtasks are solved as appropriate either by inference from symbolic representations or by interaction with a diagram ie perceiving specified information from a diagram or modifyingcreating objects in a diagram in specified ways according to problem solving needs the perceptions and actions in most dr systems built so far are handcoded for the specific application even when the rest of the system is built using the general architecture the absence of a general framework for executing perceptionsactions poses as a major hindrance to using them opportunistically  the essence of openended search in problem solving

our goal is to develop a framework for executing a wide variety of specified perceptions and actions across tasksdomains without human intervention we observe that the domaintaskspecific visual perceptionsactions can be transformed into domaintaskindependent spatial problems we specify a spatial problem as a quantified constraint satisfaction problem in the real domain using an openended vocabulary of properties relations and actions involving three kinds of diagrammatic objects  points curves regions solving a spatial problem from this specification requires computing the equivalent simplified quantifierfree expression the complexity of which is inherently doubly exponential we represent objects as configuration of simple elements to facilitate decomposition of complex problems into simpler and similar subproblems we show that if the symbolic solution to a subproblem can be expressed concisely quantifiers can be eliminated from spatial problems in loworder polynomial time using similar previously solved subproblems this requires determining the similarity of two problems the existence of a mapping between them computable in polynomial time and designing a memory for storing previously solved problems so as to facilitate search the efficacy of the idea is shown by time complexity analysis we demonstrate the proposed approach by executing perceptions and actions involved in dr tasks in two army applications
