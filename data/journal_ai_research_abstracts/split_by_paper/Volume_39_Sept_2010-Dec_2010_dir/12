  grids with blocked and unblocked cells are often used to represent terrain in robotics and video games however paths formed by grid edges can be longer than true shortest paths in the terrain since their headings are artificially constrained we present two new correct and complete anyangle pathplanning algorithms that avoid this shortcoming  basic theta and anglepropagation theta are both variants of a that propagate information along grid edges without constraining paths to grid edges basic theta is simple to understand and implement fast and finds short paths however it is not guaranteed to find true shortest paths anglepropagation theta achieves a better worstcase complexity per vertex expansion than basic theta by propagating angle ranges when it expands vertices but is more complex not as fast and finds slightly longer paths we refer to basic theta and anglepropagation theta collectively as theta theta has unique properties which we analyze in detail we show experimentally that it finds shorter paths than both a with postsmoothed paths and field d the only other version of a we know of that propagates information along grid edges without constraining paths to grid edges with a runtime comparable to that of a on grids finally we extend theta to grids that contain unblocked cells with nonuniform traversal costs and introduce variants of theta which provide different tradeoffs between path length and runtime
