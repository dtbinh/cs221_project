modelbased diagnostic reasoning often leads to a large number of diagnostic hypotheses the set of diagnoses can be reduced by taking into account extra observations passive monitoring measuring additional variables probing or executing additional tests sequential diagnosistest sequencing in this paper we combine the above approaches with techniques from automated test pattern generation atpg and modelbased diagnosis mbd into a framework called fractal framework for active testing algorithms apart from the inputs and outputs that connect a system to its environment in active testing we consider additional input variables to which a sequence of test vectors can be supplied we address the computationally hard problem of computing optimal control assignments as defined in fractal in terms of a greedy approximation algorithm called fractalg we compare the decrease in the number of remaining minimal cardinality diagnoses of fractalg to that of two more fractal algorithms fractalatpg and fractalp fractalatpg is based on atpg and sequential diagnosis while fractalp is based on probing and although not an active testing algorithm provides a baseline for comparing the lower bound on the number of reachable diagnoses for the fractal algorithms we empirically evaluate the tradeoffs of the three fractal algorithms by performing extensive experimentation on the iscas8574xxx benchmark of combinational circuits
