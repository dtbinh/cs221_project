s  dasgupta and v  ng 2010 which clustering do you want inducing your ideal clustering with minimal feedback volume 39 pages 581632

while traditional research on text clustering has largely focused on grouping documents by topic it is conceivable that a user may want to cluster documents along other dimensions such as the authors mood gender age or sentiment without knowing the users intention a clustering algorithm will only group documents along the most prominent dimension which may not be the one the user desires to address the problem of clustering documents along the userdesired dimension previous work has focused on learning a similarity metric from data manually annotated with the users intention or having a human construct a feature space in an interactive manner during the clustering process with the goal of reducing reliance on human knowledge for finetuning the similarity function or selecting the relevant features required by these approaches we propose a novel active clustering algorithm which allows a user to easily select the dimension along which she wants to cluster the documents by inspecting only a small number of words we demonstrate the viability of our algorithm on a variety of commonlyused sentiment datasets
