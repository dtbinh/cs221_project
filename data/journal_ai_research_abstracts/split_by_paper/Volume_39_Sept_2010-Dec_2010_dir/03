lama is a classical planning system based on heuristic forward search its core feature is the use of a pseudoheuristic derived from landmarks propositional formulas that must be true in every solution of a planning task lama builds on the fast downward planning system using finitedomain rather than binary state variables and multiheuristic search the latter is employed to combine the landmark heuristic with a variant of the wellknown ff heuristic both heuristics are costsensitive focusing on highquality solutions in the case where actions have nonuniform cost a weighted a search is used with iteratively decreasing weights so that the planner continues to search for plans of better quality until the search is terminated

lama showed best performance among all planners in the sequential satisficing track of the international planning competition 2008 in this paper we present the system in detail and investigate which features of lama are crucial for its performance we present individual results for some of the domains used at the competition demonstrating good and bad cases for the techniques implemented in lama overall we find that using landmarks improves performance whereas the incorporation of action costs into the heuristic estimators proves not to be beneficial we show that in some domains a search that ignores cost solves far more problems raising the question of how to deal with action costs more effectively in the future the iterated weighted a search greatly improves results and shows synergy effects with the use of landmarks
