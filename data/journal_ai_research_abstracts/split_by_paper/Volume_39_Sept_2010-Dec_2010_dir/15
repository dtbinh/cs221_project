g  j228ger and w  zhang 2010 an effective algorithm for and phase transitions of the directed hamiltonian cycle problem volume 39 pages 663687

the hamiltonian cycle problem hcp is an important combinatorial problem with applications in many areas it is among the first  problems used for studying intrinsic properties including phase transitions  of combinatorial problems while thorough theoretical and experimental analyses have been made on the hcp in undirected graphs a limited  amount of work has been done for the hcp in directed graphs dhcp
