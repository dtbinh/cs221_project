functionalitybased recognition systems recognize objects at    the category level by reasoning about how well the objects support the    expected function such systems naturally associate a measure of    goodness or membership value with a recognized object  this    measure of goodness is the result of combining individual measures or    membership values from potentially many primitive evaluations of    different properties of the objects shape a membership function is    used to compute the membership value when evaluating a primitive of a    particular physical property of an object  in previous versions of a    recognition system known as gruff the membership function for each of    the primitive evaluations was handcrafted by the system designer  in    this paper we provide a learning component for the gruff system    called omlet that automatically learns membership functions given a    set of example objects labeled with their desired category measure    the learning algorithm is generally applicable to any problem in which    lowlevel membership values are combined through an andor tree    structure to give a final overall membership value
