this paper presents an approach to learning from situated    interactive tutorial instruction within an ongoing agent  tutorial    instruction is a flexible and thus powerful paradigm for teaching    tasks because it allows an instructor to communicate whatever types of    knowledge an agent might need in whatever situations might arise  to    support this flexibility however the agent must be able to learn    multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of instructional    interactions  our approach called situated explanation achieves    such learning through a combination of analytic and inductive    techniques  it combines a form of explanationbased learning that is    situated for each instruction with a full suite of contextually guided    responses to incomplete explanations  the approach is implemented in    an agent called instructosoar that learns hierarchies of new tasks    and other domain knowledge from interactive natural language    instructions  instructosoar meets three key requirements of flexible    instructability that distinguish it from previous systems 1 it can    take known or unknown commands at any instruction point 2 it can    handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to a    hypothetical situation specified in language as in for instance    conditional instructions and 3 it can learn from instructions    each class of knowledge it uses to perform tasks
