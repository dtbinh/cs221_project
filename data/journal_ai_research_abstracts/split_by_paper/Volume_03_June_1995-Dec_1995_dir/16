p  idestamalmquist 1995 generalization of clauses under implication volume 3 pages 467489

in the area of inductive learning generalization is a main    operation and the usual definition of induction is based on logical    implication  recently there has been a rising interest in clausal    representation of knowledge in machine learning almost all inductive    learning systems that perform generalization of clauses use the    relation thetasubsumption instead of implication the main reason is    that there is a wellknown and simple technique to compute least    general generalizations under thetasubsumption but not under    implication  however generalization under thetasubsumption is    inappropriate for learning recursive clauses which is a crucial    problem since recursion is the basic program structure of logic    programs     we note that implication between clauses is undecidable and we    therefore introduce a stronger form of implication called    timplication which is decidable between clauses we show that for    every finite set of clauses there exists a least general    generalization under timplication  we describe a technique to reduce    generalizations under implication of a clause to generalizations under    thetasubsumption of what we call an expansion of the original    clause moreover we show that for every nontautological clause there    exists a tcomplete expansion which means that every generalization    under timplication of the clause is reduced to a generalization under    thetasubsumption of the expansion
