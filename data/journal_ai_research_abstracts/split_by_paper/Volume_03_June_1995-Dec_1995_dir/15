g  i webb 1995 opus an efficient admissible algorithm for unordered search volume 3 pages 431465

opus is a branch and bound search algorithm that enables    efficient admissible search through spaces for which the order of    search operator application is not significant  the algorithms    search efficiency is demonstrated with respect to very large machine    learning search spaces  the use of admissible search is of potential    value to the machine learning community as it means that the exact    learning biases to be employed for complex learning tasks can be    precisely specified and manipulated  opus also has potential for    application in other areas of artificial intelligence notably truth    maintenance
