d  heckerman and  r  shachter 1995 decisiontheoretic foundations for causal reasoning volume 3 pages 405430

we present a definition of cause and effect in terms of    decisiontheoretic primitives and thereby provide a principled    foundation for causal reasoning  our definition departs from the    traditional view of causation in that causal assertions may vary with    the set of decisions available  we argue that this approach provides    added clarity to the notion of cause  also in this paper we examine    the encoding of causal relationships in directed acyclic graphs  we    describe a special class of influence diagrams those in canonical    form and show its relationship to pearls representation of cause and    effect  finally we show how canonical form facilitates    counterfactual reasoning
