s  m weiss and  n  indurkhya 1995 rulebased machine learning methods for functional prediction volume 3 pages 383403

we describe a machine learning method for predicting the    value of a realvalued function given the values of multiple input    variables the method induces solutions from samples in the form of    ordered disjunctive normal form dnf decision rules a central    objective of the method and representation is the induction of    compact easily interpretable solutions  this rulebased decision    model can be extended to search efficiently for similar cases prior to    approximating function values experimental results on realworld data    demonstrate that the new techniques are competitive with existing    machine learning and statistical methods and can sometimes yield    superior regression performance
