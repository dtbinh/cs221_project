the main aim of this work is the development of a    visionbased road detection system fast enough to cope with the    difficult realtime constraints imposed by moving vehicle    applications  the hardware platform a specialpurpose massively    parallel system has been chosen to minimize system production and    operational costs           this paper presents a novel approach to expectationdriven lowlevel    image segmentation which can be mapped naturally onto meshconnected    massively parallel simd architectures capable of handling hierarchical    data structures  the input image is assumed to contain a distorted    version of a given template a multiresolution stretching process is    used to reshape the original template in accordance with the acquired    image content minimizing a potential function  the distorted    template is the process output
