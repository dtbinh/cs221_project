r  khardon 1995 translating between horn representations and their characteristic models volume 3 pages 349372

characteristic models are an alternative model based    representation for horn expressions it has been shown that these two    representations are incomparable and each has its advantages over the    other it is therefore natural to ask what is the cost of translating    back and forth between these representations interestingly the same    translation questions arise in database theory where it has    applications to the design of relational databases this paper studies    the computational complexity of these problems        our main result is that the two translation problems are equivalent under    polynomial reductions and that they are equivalent to the corresponding    decision problem namely translating is equivalent to deciding whether a    given set of models is the set of characteristic models for a given horn    expression            we also relate these problems to the hypergraph transversal problem a    well known problem which is related to other applications in ai and for    which no polynomial time algorithm is known it is shown that in general    our translation problems are at least as hard as the hypergraph    transversal problem and in a special case they are equivalent to it
