symmetric networks designed for energy minimization such as    boltzman machines and hopfield nets are frequently investigated for    use in optimization constraint satisfaction and approximation of    nphard problems nevertheless finding a global solution ie a    global minimum for the energy function is not guaranteed and even a    local solution may take an exponential number of steps  we propose an    improvement to the standard local activation function used for such    networks  the improved algorithm guarantees that a global minimum is    found in linear time for treelike subnetworks the algorithm called    activate is uniform and does not assume that the network is    treelike  it can identify treelike subnetworks even in cyclic    topologies arbitrary networks and avoid local minima along these    trees  for acyclic networks the algorithm is guaranteed to converge    to a global minimum from any initial state of the system    selfstabilization and remains correct under various types of    schedulers  on the negative side we show that in the presence of    cycles no uniform algorithm exists that guarantees optimality even    under a sequential asynchronous scheduler  an asynchronous scheduler    can activate only one unit at a time while a synchronous scheduler can    activate any number of units in a single time step  in addition no    uniform algorithm exists to optimize even acyclic networks when the    scheduler is synchronous  finally we show how the algorithm can be    improved using the cyclecutset scheme  the general algorithm called    activatewithcutset improves over activate and has some performance    guarantees that are related to the size of the networks cyclecutset
