r  bergmann and  w  wilke 1995 building and refining abstract planning cases by change of representation language volume 3 pages 53118

abstraction is one of the most promising approaches to improve the    performance of problem solvers in several domains abstraction by    dropping sentences of a domain description  as used in most    hierarchical planners  has proven useful in this paper we present    examples which illustrate significant drawbacks of abstraction by    dropping sentences to overcome these drawbacks we propose a more    general view of abstraction involving the change of representation    language we have developed a new abstraction methodology and a    related sound and complete learning algorithm that allows the complete    change of representation language of planning cases from concrete to    abstract  however to achieve a powerful change of the representation    language the abstract language itself as well as rules which describe    admissible ways of abstracting states must be provided in the domain    model this new abstraction approach is the core of paris plan    abstraction and refinement in an integrated system a system in which    abstract planning cases are automatically learned from given concrete    cases an empirical study in the domain of process planning in    mechanical engineering shows significant advantages of the proposed    reasoning from abstract cases over classical hierarchical planning
