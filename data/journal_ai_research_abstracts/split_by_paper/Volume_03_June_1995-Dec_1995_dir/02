m  veloso and  p  stone 1995 flecs planning with a flexible commitment strategy volume 3 pages 2552

there has been evidence that leastcommitment planners can    efficiently handle planning problems that involve difficult goal    interactions  this evidence has led to the common belief that    delayedcommitment is the best possible planning strategy  however    we recently found evidence that eagercommitment planners can handle a    variety of planning problems more efficiently in particular those    with difficult operator choices  resigned to the futility of trying    to find a universally successful planning strategy we devised a    planner that can be used to study which domains and problems are best    for which planning strategies in this article we introduce this new    planning algorithm flecs which uses a flexible commitment strategy    with respect to planstep orderings  it is able to use any strategy    from delayedcommitment to eagercommitment  the combination of    delayed and eager operatorordering commitments allows flecs to take    advantage of the benefits of explicitly using a simulated execution    state and reasoning about planning constraints  flecs can vary its    commitment strategy across different problems and domains and also    during the course of a single planning problem  flecs represents a    novel contribution to planning in that it explicitly provides the    choice of which commitment strategy to use while planning  flecs    provides a framework to investigate the mapping from planning domains    and problems to efficient planning strategies
