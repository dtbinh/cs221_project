q  zhao and  t  nishida 1995 using qualitative hypotheses to identify inaccurate data volume 3 pages 119145

identifying inaccurate data has long been regarded as a    significant and difficult problem in ai in this paper we present a    new method for identifying inaccurate data on the basis of qualitative    correlations among related data first we introduce the definitions    of related data and qualitative correlations among related data  then    we put forward a new concept called support coefficient function    scf scf can be used to extract represent and calculate    qualitative correlations among related data within a dataset we    propose an approach to determining dynamic shift intervals of    inaccurate data and an approach to calculating possibility of    identifying inaccurate data respectively both of the approaches are    based on scf finally we present an algorithm for identifying    inaccurate data by using qualitative correlations among related data    as confirmatory or disconfirmatory evidence we have developed a    practical system for interpreting infrared spectra by applying the    method and have fully tested the system against several hundred real    spectra the experimental results show that the method is    significantly better than the conventional methods used in many    similar systems
