in recent years the task of automatically linking pieces of text anchors  mentioned in a document to wikipedia articles that represent the meaning of these anchors has received extensive research attention typically linktowikipedia systems try to find a set of wikipedia articles that are candidates to represent the meaning of the anchor and later rank these candidates to select the most appropriate one in this ranking process the systems rely on context information obtained from the document where the anchor is mentioned andor from wikipedia in this paper we center our attention in the use of wikipedia links as context information in particular we offer a review of several candidate ranking approaches in the stateoftheart that rely on wikipedia link information in addition we provide a comparative empirical evaluation of the different approaches on five different corpora the tac 2010 corpus and four corpora built from actual  wikipedia articles and news items
