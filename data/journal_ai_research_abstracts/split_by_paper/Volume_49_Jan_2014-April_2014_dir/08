d  berrar 2014 an empirical evaluation of ranking measures with respect to robustness to noise volume 49 pages 241267

ranking measures play an important role in model evaluation and selection using both synthetic and realworld data sets we investigate how different types and levels of noise affect the area under the roc curve auc the area under the roc convex hull the scored auc the kolmogorovsmirnov statistic and the hmeasure in our experiments the auc was overall the most robust among these measures thereby reinvigorating it as a reliable metric despite its wellknown deficiencies this paper also introduces a novel ranking measure which is remarkably robust to noise yet conceptually simple
