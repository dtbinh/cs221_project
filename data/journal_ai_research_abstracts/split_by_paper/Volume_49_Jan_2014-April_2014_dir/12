g  greco and f  scarcello 2014 mechanisms for fair allocation problems nopunishment payment rules in verifiable settings volume 49 pages 403449

mechanism design is considered in the context of fair allocations of indivisible goods with monetary compensation by focusing on problems where agents declarations on allocated goods can be verified before payments are performed a setting is considered where verification might be subject to errors so that payments have to be awarded under the presumption of innocence as incorrect declared values do not necessarily mean manipulation attempts by the agents within this setting a mechanism is designed that is shown to be truthful efficient and budgetbalanced moreover agents utilities are fairly determined by the shapley value of suitable coalitional games and enjoy highly desirable properties such as equal treatment of equals envyfreeness and a stronger one called individualoptimality in particular the latter property guarantees that for every agent herhis utility is the maximum possible one over any alternative optimal allocation 

the computational complexity of the proposed mechanism is also studied it turns out that it is pcomplete so that to deal with applications with many agents involved two polynomialtime randomized variants are also proposed one that is still truthful and efficient and which is approximately budgetbalanced with high probability and another one that is truthful in expectation while still budgetbalanced and efficient
