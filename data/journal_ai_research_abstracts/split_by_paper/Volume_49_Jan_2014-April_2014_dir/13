geographical location is vital to geospatial applications like local search and event detection in this paper we investigate and improve on the task of textbased geolocation prediction of twitter users previous studies on this topic have typically assumed that geographical references eg gazetteer terms dialectal words in a text are indicative of its authors location however these references are often buried in informal ungrammatical and multilingual data and are therefore nontrivial to identify and exploit we present an integrated geolocation prediction framework and investigate what factors impact on prediction accuracy first we evaluate a range of feature selection methods to obtain location indicative words we then evaluate the impact of nongeotagged tweets language and userdeclared metadata on geolocation prediction in addition we evaluate the impact of temporal variance on model generalisation and discuss how users differ in terms of their geolocatability

we achieve stateoftheart results for the textbased twitter user geolocation task and also provide the most extensive exploration of the task to date our findings provide valuable insights into the design of robust practical textbased geolocation prediction systems
