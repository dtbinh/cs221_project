l  cigler and b  faltings 2014 symmetric subgameperfect equilibria in resource allocation volume 49 pages 323361

we analyze symmetric protocols to rationally coordinate on an asymmetric efficient allocation in an infinitely repeated nagent cresource allocation problems where the resources are all homogeneous bhaskar proposed one way to achieve this in 2agent 1resource games agents start by symmetrically randomizing their actions and as soon as they each choose different actions they start to follow a potentially asymmetric convention that prescribes their actions from then on we extend the concept of convention to the general case of infinitely repeated resource allocation games with n agents and c resources we show that for any convention there exists a symmetric subgameperfect equilibrium which implements it we present two conventions bourgeois where agents stick to the first allocation and market where agents pay for the use of resources and observe a global coordination signal which allows them to alternate between different allocations we define price of anonymity of a convention as a ratio between the maximum social payoff of any asymmetric strategy profile and the expected social payoff of the subgameperfect equilibrium which implements the convention we show that while the price of anonymity of the bourgeois convention is infinite the market convention decreases this price by reducing the conflict between the agents
