v  belle and g  lakemeyer 2014 multiagent only knowing in dynamic systems volume 49 pages 363402

	the idea of only knowing a collection of sentences as proposed by levesque has been previously shown to be very useful in characterizing knowledgebased agents in terms of a specification a precise and perspicuous account of the beliefs and nonbeliefs is obtained in a monotonic setting levesques logic is based on a firstorder modal language with quantifyingin thus allowing for de re versus de dicto distinctions among other things however the logic and its recent dynamic extension  only deal with the case of a single agent in this work we propose a firstorder multiagent framework with knowledge actions sensing and only knowing that is shown to inherit all  the features of the single agent version most significantly we prove reduction theorems by means of which reasoning about knowledge and actions in the framework simplifies to nonepistemic nondynamic reasoning about the initial situation
