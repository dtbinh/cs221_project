graphical models such as bayesian networks and markov networks play an important role in artificial intelligence and machine learning inference is a central problem to be solved on these networks this and other problems on these graph models are often known to be hard to solve in general but tractable on graphs with bounded treewidth therefore finding or approximating the treewidth of a graph is a fundamental problem related to inference in graphical models in this paper we study the approximability of a number of graph problems   treewidth and pathwidth of graphs minimum fillin oneshot black and blackwhite pebbling costs of directed acyclic graphs and a variety of different graph layout problems such as minimum cut linear arrangement and interval graph completion  we show that assuming  the recently introduced small set expansion conjecture all of these  problems are nphard to approximate to within any constant factor in polynomial time
