j  w crandall 2014 towards minimizing disappointment in repeated games volume 49 pages 111142

we consider the problem of learning in repeated games against arbitrary associates  specifically we study the ability of expert algorithms to quickly learn effective strategies in repeated games towards the ultimate goal of learning nearoptimal behavior against any arbitrary associate within only a handful of interactions  our contribution is threefold  first we advocate a new metric called disappointment for evaluating expert algorithms in repeated games  unlike minimizing traditional notions of regret minimizing disappointment in repeated games is equivalent to maximizing payoffs  unfortunately eliminating disappointment is impossible to guarantee in general  however it is possible for an expert algorithm to quickly achieve low disappointment against many known classes of algorithms in many games  second we show that popular existing expert algorithms often fail to achieve low disappointment against a variety of associates particularly in early rounds of the game  finally we describe a new metaalgorithm that can be applied to existing expert algorithms to substantially reduce disappointment in many twoplayer repeated games when associates follow various static reinforcement learning and expert algorithms
