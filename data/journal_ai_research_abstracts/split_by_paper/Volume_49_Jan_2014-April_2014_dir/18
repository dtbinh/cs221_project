a dung argumentation framework af is a pair ar a is a set of abstract arguments and r 8838 a215a is a binary relation socalled the attack relation for capturing the conflicting arguments labeling based algorithms for enumerating extensions ie sets of acceptable arguments have been set out such that arguments ie elements of a are the only subject for labeling in this paper we present implemented algorithms for listing extensions by labeling attacks ie elements of r along with arguments specifically these algorithms are concerned with enumerating all extensions of an af under a number of argumentation semantics preferred stable complete semi stable stage ideal and grounded our algorithms have impact in particular on enumerating extensions of afextended models that allow attacks on attacks to demonstrate this impact we instantiate our algorithms for an example of such models namely argumentation frameworks with recursive attacks afra thereby we end up with unified algorithms that enumerate extensions of any afafra
