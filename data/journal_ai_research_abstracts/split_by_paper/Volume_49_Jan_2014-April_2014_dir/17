when making decisions under uncertainty the optimal choices are often difficult to discern especially if not enough information has been gathered two key questions in this regard relate to whether one should stop the information gathering process and commit to a decision stopping criterion and if not what information to gather next selection criterion in this paper we show that the recently introduced notion samedecision probability sdp can be useful as both a stopping and a selection criterion as it can provide additional insight and allow for robust decision making in a variety of scenarios this query has been shown to be highly intractable being ppppcomplete and is exemplary of a class of queries which correspond to the computation of certain expectations we propose the first exact algorithm for computing the sdp and demonstrate its effectiveness on several real and synthetic networks finally we present new complexity results such as the complexity of computing the sdp on models with a naive bayes structure  additionally we prove that computing  the nonmyopic value of information is complete for the  same complexity class as computing the sdp
