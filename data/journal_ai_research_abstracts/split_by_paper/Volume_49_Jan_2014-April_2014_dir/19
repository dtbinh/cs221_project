m  l bonet s  buss and j  johannsen 2014 improved separations of regular resolution from clause learning proof systems volume 49 pages 669703

this paper studies the relationship between resolution and conflict driven clause learning cdcl without restarts and refutes some conjectured possible separations  we prove that the guarded xorified pebbling tautology clauses which urquhart proved are hard for regular resolution as well as the guarded graph tautology clauses of alekhnovich johannsen pitassi and urquhart have polynomial size pool resolution refutations that use only input lemmas as learned clauses  for the latter set of clauses we extend this to prove that a cdcl search without restarts can refute these clauses in polynomial time provided it makes the right choices for decision literals and clause learning  this holds even if the cdcl search is required to greedily process conflicts arising from unit propagation this refutes the conjecture that the guarded graph tautology clauses or the guarded xorified pebbling tautology clauses can be used to separate cdcl without restarts from general resolution  together with subsequent results by buss and kolodziejczyk this means we lack any good conjectures about how to establish the exact logical strength of conflictdriven clause learning without restarts
