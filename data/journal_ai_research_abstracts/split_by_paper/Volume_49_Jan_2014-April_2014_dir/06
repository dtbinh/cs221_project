s  schiffel and m  thielscher 2014 representing and reasoning about the rules of general games with imperfect information volume 49 pages 171206

a general game player is a system that can play previously unknown games just by being given their rules for this purpose the game description language gdl has been developed as a highlevel knowledge representation formalism to communicate game rules to players in this paper we address a fundamental limitation of stateoftheart methods and systems for general game playing namely their being confined to deterministic games with complete information about the game state we develop a simple yet expressive extension of standard gdl that allows for formalising the rules of arbitrary finite nplayer games with randomness and incomplete state knowledge in the second part of the paper we address the intricate reasoning challenge for general gameplaying systems that comes with the new description language we develop a full embedding of extended gdl into the situation calculus augmented by scherl and levesques knowledge fluent we formally prove that this provides a sound and complete reasoning method for players knowledge about game states as well as about the knowledge of the other players
