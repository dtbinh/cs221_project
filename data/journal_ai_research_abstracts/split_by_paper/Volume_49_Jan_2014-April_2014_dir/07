k  r apt and g  schaefer 2014 selfishness level of strategic games volume 49 pages 207240

we introduce a new measure of the discrepancy in strategic games between the social welfare in a nash equilibrium and in a social optimum that we call selfishness level it is the smallest fraction of the social welfare that needs to be offered to each player to achieve that a social optimum is realized in a pure nash equilibrium the selfishness level is unrelated to the price of stability and the price of anarchy and is invariant under positive linear transformations of the payoff functions also it naturally applies to other solution concepts and other forms of games

in particular the selfishness level of finite ordinal potential games is finite while that of weakly acyclic games can be infinite  we derive explicit bounds on the selfishness level of fair cost sharing games and linear congestion games which depend on specific parameters of the underlying game but are independent of the number of players  further we show that the selfishness level of the nplayers prisoners dilemma is cbn1c where b and c are the benefit and cost for cooperation respectively  that of the nplayers public goods game is 1cnc1 where c is the public good multiplier and that of the travelers dilemma game is b12 where b is the bonus finally the selfishness level of cournot competition an example of an infinite ordinal potential game tragedy of the commons and bertrand competition is infinite
