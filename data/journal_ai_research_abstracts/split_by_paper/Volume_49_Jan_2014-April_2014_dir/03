p  m dung and p  m thang 2014 closure and consistency  in logicassociated  argumentation volume 49 pages 79109

properties like logical closure and consistency are  important properties in any logical reasoning system caminada and amgoud showed that not every logicbased argument system satisfies these relevant properties but under  conditions like closure under contraposition or transposition of the monotonic part of the underlying logic aspiclike systems satisfy these properties in contrast the logical closure and  consistency properties are not wellunderstood for other  wellknown and widely applied systems like logic programming or assumption based argumentation though conditions like closure under contraposition or transposition seem intuitive in aspiclike systems they  rule out many sensible aspiclike systems that satisfy both properties of closure and consistency  

we present a new condition referred to as the selfcontradiction axiom that guarantees the consistency property  in both aspiclike and assumptionbased systems and is implied by both properties of closure under  contraposition or transposition we develop a logicassociated abstract argumentation framework by associating abstract argumentation with abstract logics to represent  the conclusions of arguments we show that logicassociated abstract argumentation frameworks  capture  aspiclike systems without preferences and assumptionbased argumentation we present two simple and natural properties of  compactness and cohesion in  logicassociated abstract argumentation frameworks and show that they capture  the logical closure and consistency properties we demonstrate that  in both  assumptionbased argumentation and aspiclike systems  cohesion  follows naturally from the selfcontradiction axiom we further give a translation from aspiclike systems without preferences into equivalent assumptionbased systems that keeps the selfcontradiction axiom invariant
