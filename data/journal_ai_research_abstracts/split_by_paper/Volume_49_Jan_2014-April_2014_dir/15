k  hoki and t  kaneko 2014 largescale optimization for evaluation functions with minimax search volume 49 pages 527568

this paper presents a new method minimax tree optimization mmto to learn a heuristic evaluation function of a practical alphabeta search program the evaluation function may be a linear or nonlinear combination of weighted features and the weights are the parameters to be optimized to control the search results so that the move decisions agree with the game records of human experts a wellmodeled objective function to be minimized is designed moreover a numerical iterative method is used to nd local minima of the objective function and more than forty million parameters are adjusted by using a small number of hyper parameters this method was applied to shogi a major variant of chess in which the evaluation function must handle a larger state space than in chess experimental results show that the largescale optimization of the evaluation function improves the playing strength of shogi programs and the new method performs signicantly better than other methods implementation of the new method in our shogi program bonanza made substantial contributions to the programs rstplace nish in the 2013 world computer shogi championship additionally we present preliminary evidence of broader applicability of our method to other twoplayer games such as chess
