multiview learning aims to improve classification performance by leveraging the consistency among different views of data the incorporation of multiple views was paid little attention in the studies of domain adaptation where the view consistency based on source data is largely violated in the target domain due to the distribution gap between different domain data in this paper we leverage multiple views for crossdomain document classification the central idea is to strengthen the views consistency on target data by identifying the associations of domainspecific features from different domains we present an informationtheoretic multiview adaptation model imam using a multiway clustering scheme where word and link clusters can draw together seemingly unrelated features across domains which boosts the consistency between document clusterings that are based on the respective word and link views moreover we demonstrate that imam can always find the document clustering with the minimal disagreement rate to the overlap of viewbased clusterings we provide both theoretical and empirical justifications of the proposed method our experiments show that imam significantly outperforms traditional multiview algorithm cotraining the cotrainingbased adaptation algorithm coda the singleview transfer model cocc and the largemarginbased multiview transfer model mvtllm
