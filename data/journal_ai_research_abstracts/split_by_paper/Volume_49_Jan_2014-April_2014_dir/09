hexprograms extend logic programs under the answer set semantics with external computations through external atoms as reasoning from ground horn programs with nonmonotonic external atoms of polynomial complexity is already on the second level of the polynomial hierarchy minimality checking of answer set candidates needs special attention to this end we present an approach based on unfounded sets as a generalization of related techniques for asp programs the unfounded set detection is expressed as a propositional sat problem for which we provide two different encodings and optimizations to them we then integrate our approach into a previously developed evaluation framework for hexprograms which is enriched by additional learning techniques that aim at avoiding the reconstruction of the same or related unfounded sets furthermore we provide a syntactic criterion that allows one to skip the minimality check in many cases an experimental evaluation shows that the new approach significantly decreases runtime
