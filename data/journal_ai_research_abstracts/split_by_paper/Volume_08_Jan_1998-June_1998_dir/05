b  srivastava and  s  kambhampati 1998 synthesizing customized planners from specifications volume 8 pages 93128

existing plan synthesis approaches in artificial    intelligence fall into two categories  domain independent and domain    dependent  the domain independent approaches are applicable across a    variety of domains but may not be very efficient in any one given    domain  the domain dependent approaches need to be redesigned for    each domain separately but can be very efficient in the domain for    which they are designed  one enticing alternative to these approaches    is to automatically synthesize domain independent planners given the    knowledge about the domain and the theory of planning in this paper    we investigate the feasibility of using existing automated software    synthesis tools to support such synthesis specifically we describe    an architecture called clay in which the kestrel interactive    development system kids is used to derive a domaincustomized    planner through a semiautomatic combination of a declarative theory    of planning and the declarative control knowledge specific to a given    domain to semiautomatically combine them to derive domaincustomized    planners  we discuss what it means to write a declarative theory of    planning and control knowledge for kids and illustrate our approach    by generating a class of domainspecific planners using state space    refinements  our experiments show that the synthesized planners can    outperform classical refinement planners implemented as    instantiations of ucp kambhampati  srivastava 1995 using the same    control knowledge  we will contrast the costs and benefits of the    synthesis approach with conventional methods for customizing domain    independent planners
