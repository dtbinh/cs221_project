j  fuernkranz 1998 integrative windowing volume 8 pages 129164

in this paper we reinvestigate windowing for rule learning    algorithms  we show that contrary to previous results for decision    tree learning windowing can in fact achieve significant runtime    gains in noisefree domains and explain the different behavior of rule    learning algorithms by the fact that they learn each rule    independently the main contribution of this paper is integrative    windowing a new type of algorithm that further exploits this property    by integrating good rules into the final theory right after they have    been discovered thus it avoids relearning these rules in subsequent    iterations of the windowing process experimental evidence in a    variety of noisefree domains shows that integrative windowing can in    fact achieve substantial runtime gains furthermore we discuss the    problem of noise in windowing and present an algorithm that is able to    achieve runtime gains in a set of experiments in a simple domain with    artificial noise
