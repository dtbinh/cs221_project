a  darwiche 1998 modelbased diagnosis using structured system descriptions volume 8 pages 165222

this paper presents a comprehensive approach for modelbased    diagnosis which includes proposals for characterizing and computing    preferred diagnoses assuming that the system description is augmented    with a system structure a directed graph explicating the    interconnections between system components  specifically we first    introduce the notion of a consequence which is a syntactically    unconstrained propositional sentence that characterizes all    consistencybased diagnoses and show that standard characterizations    of diagnoses such as minimal conflicts correspond to syntactic    variations on a consequence second we propose a new syntactic    variation on the consequence known as negation normal form nnf and    discuss its merits compared to standard variations  third we    introduce a basic algorithm for computing consequences in nnf given a    structured system description we show that if the system structure    does not contain cycles then there is always a linearsize    consequence in nnf which can be computed in linear time for arbitrary    system structures we show a precise connection between the complexity    of computing consequences and the topology of the underlying system    structure  finally we present an algorithm that enumerates the    preferred diagnoses characterized by a consequence the algorithm is    shown to take linear time in the size of the consequence if the    preference criterion satisfies some general conditions
