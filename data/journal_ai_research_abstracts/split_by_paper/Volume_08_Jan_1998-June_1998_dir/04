this paper introduces new algorithms and data structures for    quick counting for machine learning datasets  we focus on the    counting task of constructing contingency tables but our approach is    also applicable to counting the number of records in a dataset that    match conjunctive queries  subject to certain assumptions the costs    of these operations can be shown to be independent of the number of    records in the dataset and loglinear in the number of nonzero entries    in the contingency table      we provide a very sparse data structure the adtree to minimize    memory use we provide analytical worstcase bounds for this structure    for several models of data distribution  we empirically demonstrate    that tractablysized data structures can be produced for large    realworld datasets by a using a sparse tree structure that never    allocates memory for counts of zero b never allocating memory for    counts that can be deduced from other counts and c not bothering to    expand the tree fully near its leaves       we show how the adtree can be used to accelerate bayes net structure    finding algorithms rule learning algorithms and feature selection    algorithms and we provide a number of empirical results comparing    adtree methods against traditional direct counting approaches  we    also discuss the possible uses of adtrees in other machine learning    methods and discuss the merits of adtrees in comparison with    alternative representations such as kdtrees rtrees and frequent sets
