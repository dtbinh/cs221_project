j  engelfriet 1998 monotonicity and persistence in preferential logics volume 8 pages 121

an important characteristic of many logics for artificial    intelligence is their nonmonotonicity this means that adding a    formula to the premises can invalidate some of the consequences there    may however exist formulae that can always be safely added to the    premises without destroying any of the consequences we say they    respect monotonicity also there may be formulae that when they are    a consequence can not be invalidated when adding any formula to the    premises we call them conservative we study these two classes of    formulae for preferential logics and show that they are closely    linked to the formulae whose truthvalue is preserved along the    preferential ordering we will consider some preferential logics for    illustration and prove syntactic characterization results for them    the results in this paper may improve the efficiency of theorem    provers for preferential logics
