in this paper we consider the problem of theory patching    in which we are given a domain theory some of whose components are    indicated to be possibly flawed and a set of labeled training    examples for the domain concept  the theory patching problem is to    revise only the indicated components of the theory such that the    resulting theory correctly classifies all the training examples    theory patching is thus a type of theory revision in which revisions    are made to individual components of the theory  our concern in this    paper is to determine for which classes of logical domain theories the    theory patching problem is tractable  we consider both propositional    and firstorder domain theories and show that the theory patching    problem is equivalent to that of determining what information    contained in a theory is stable regardless of what revisions might    be performed to the theory  we show that determining stability is    tractable if the input theory satisfies two conditions that revisions    to each theory component have monotonic effects on the classification    of examples and that theory components act independently in the    classification of examples in the theory  we also show how the    concepts introduced can be used to determine the soundness and    completeness of particular theory patching algorithms
