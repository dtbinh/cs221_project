approximating a general formula from above and below by horn    formulas its horn envelope and horn core respectively was proposed    by selman and kautz 1991 1996 as a form of knowledge    compilation supporting rapid approximate reasoning on the negative    side this scheme is static in that it supports no updates and has    certain complexity drawbacks pointed out by kavvadias papadimitriou    and sideri 1993  on the other hand the many frameworks and schemes    proposed in the literature for theory update and revision are plagued    by serious complexitytheoretic impediments even in the horn case as    was pointed out by eiter and gottlob 1992 and is further    demonstrated in the present paper  more fundamentally these schemes    are not inductive in that they may lose in a single update any    positive properties of the represented sets of formulas small size    horn structure etc  in this paper we propose a new scheme    incremental recompilation which combines horn approximation and    modelbased updates this scheme is inductive and very efficient free    of the problems facing its constituents  a set of formulas is    represented by an upper and lower horn approximation  to update we    replace the upper horn formula by the horn envelope of its    minimumchange update and similarly the lower one by the horn core of    its update the key fact which enables this scheme is that horn    envelopes and cores are easy to compute when the underlying formula is    the result of a minimumchange update of a horn formula by a clause    we conjecture that efficient algorithms are possible for more complex    updates
