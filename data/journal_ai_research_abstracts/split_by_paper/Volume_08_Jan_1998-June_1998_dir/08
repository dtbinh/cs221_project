one of the most common mechanisms used for speeding up    problem solvers is macrolearning  macros are sequences of basic    operators acquired during problem solving  macros are used by the    problem solver as if they were basic operators  the major problem    that macrolearning presents is the vast number of macros that are    available for acquisition  macros increase the branching factor of    the search space and can severely degrade problemsolving efficiency    to make macro learning useful a program must be selective in    acquiring and utilizing macros  this paper describes a general method    for selective acquisition of macros solvable training problems are    generated in increasing order of difficulty  the only macros acquired    are those that take the problem solver out of a local minimum to a    better state  the utility of the method is demonstrated in several    domains including the domain of nxn slidingtile puzzles after    learning on small puzzles the system is able to efficiently solve    puzzles of any size
