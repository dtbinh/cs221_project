some of the applications of owl and rdf eg biomedical knowledge representation and semantic policy formulation call for extensions of these languages with nonmonotonic constructs such as inheritance with overriding  nonmonotonic description logics have been studied for many years however no practical such knowledge representation languages exist due to a combination of semantic difficulties and high computational complexity independently lowcomplexity description logics such as dllite and el have been introduced and incorporated in the owl standard  therefore it is interesting to see whether the syntactic restrictions characterizing dllite and el bring computational benefits to their nonmonotonic versions too in this paper we extensively investigate the computational complexity of circumscription when knowledge bases are formulated in dlliter el and fragments thereof  we identify fragments whose complexity ranges from p to the second level of the polynomial hierarchy as well as fragments whose complexity raises to pspace and beyond
