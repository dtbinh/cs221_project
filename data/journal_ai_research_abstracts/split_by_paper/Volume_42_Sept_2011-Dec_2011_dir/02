standard belief change assumes an underlying logic containing full classical propositional logic however there are good reasons for considering belief change in less expressive logics as well in this paper we build on recent investigations by delgrande on contraction for horn logic we show that the standard basic form of contraction partial meet is too strong in the horn case this result stands in contrast to delgrandes conjecture that orderly maxichoice is the appropriate form of contraction for horn logic we then define a more appropriate notion of basic contraction for the horn case influenced by the convexity property holding for full propositional logic and which we refer to as infra contraction the main contribution of this work is a result which shows that the construction method for horn contraction for belief sets based on our infra remainder sets corresponds exactly to hanssons classical kernel contraction for belief sets when restricted to horn logic this result is obtained via a detour through contraction for belief bases we prove that kernel contraction for belief bases produces precisely the same results as the belief base version of infra contraction the use of belief bases to obtain this result provides evidence for the conjecture that horn belief change is best viewed as a hybrid version of belief set change and belief base change one of the consequences of the link with base contraction is the provision of a representation result for horn contraction for belief sets in which a version of the coreretainment postulate features
