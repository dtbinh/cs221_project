in this paper we present a novel decentralised management technique that allows electricity microstorage devices deployed within individual homes as part of a smart electricity grid to converge to profitable and efficient behaviours specifically we propose the use of software agents residing on the users smart meters to automate and optimise the charging cycle of microstorage devices in the home to minimise its costs and we present a study of both the theoretical underpinnings and the implications of a practical solution of using software agents for such microstorage management first by formalising the strategic choice each agent makes in deciding when to charge its battery we develop a gametheoretic framework within which we can analyse the competitive equilibria of an electricity grid populated by such agents and hence predict the best consumption profile for that population given their battery properties and individual load profiles our framework also allows us to compute theoretical bounds on the amount of storage that will be adopted by the population second to analyse the practical implications of microstorage deployments in the grid we present a novel algorithm that each agent can use to optimise its battery storage profile in order to minimise its owners costs this algorithm uses a learning strategy that allows it to adapt as the price of electricity changes in realtime and we show that the adoption of these strategies results in the system converging to the theoretical equilibria finally we empirically evaluate the adoption of our microstorage management technique within a complex setting based on the uk electricity market where agents may have widely varying load profiles battery types and learning rates in this case our approach yields savings of up to 14 in energy cost for an average consumer using a storage device with a capacity of less than 45 kwh and up to a 7 reduction in carbon emissions resulting from electricity generation with only domestic consumers adopting microstorage and commercial and industrial consumers not changing their demand moreover corroborating our theoretical bound an equilibrium is shown to exist where no more than 48 of households would wish to own storage devices and where social welfare would also be improved yielding overall annual savings of nearly 16315b
