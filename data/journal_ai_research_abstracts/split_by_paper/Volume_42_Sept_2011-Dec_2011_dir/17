p  r conrad and b  c williams 2011 drake an efficient executive for temporal plans with choice volume 42 pages 607659

this work presents drake a dynamic executive for temporal plans with choice dynamic plan execution strategies allow an autonomous agent to react quickly to unfolding events improving the robustness of the agent prior work developed methods for dynamically dispatching simple temporal networks and further research enriched the expressiveness of the plans executives could handle including discrete choices which are the focus of this work however in some approaches to date these additional choices induce significant storage or latency requirements to make flexible execution possible 

drake is designed to leverage the low latency made possible by a preprocessing step called compilation while avoiding high memory costs through a compact representation we leverage the concepts of labels and environments taken from prior work in assumptionbased truth maintenance systems atms to concisely record the implications of the discrete choices exploiting the structure of the plan to avoid redundant reasoning or storage our labeling and maintenance scheme called the labeled value set maintenance system is distinguished by its focus on properties fundamental to temporal problems and more generally weighted graph algorithms in particular the maintenance system focuses on maintaining a minimal representation of nondominated constraints we benchmark drakes performance on random structured problems and find that drake reduces the size of the compiled representation by a factor of over 500 for large problems while incurring only a modest increase in runtime latency compared to prior work in compiled executives for temporal plans with discrete choices
