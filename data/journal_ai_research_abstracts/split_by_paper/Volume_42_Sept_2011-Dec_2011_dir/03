multiagent path planning is a challenging problem with numerous reallife applications  running a centralized search such as a in the combined state space of all units is complete and costoptimal but scales poorly as the state space size is exponential in the number of mobile units  traditional decentralized approaches such as far and  whca are faster and more scalable being based on problem decomposition  however such methods are incomplete and provide no guarantees with respect to the running time or the solution quality  they are not necessarily able to tell in a reasonable time whether they would succeed in finding a solution to a given instance 

experiments were run on realistic game grid maps  mapp solved 9986 of all mobile units which is 1822 better than the percentage of far and whca  mapp marked 9882 of all units as provably solvable during the first stage of plan computation  parts of mapps computation can be reused across instances on the same map  speedwise mapp is competitive or significantly faster than whca depending on whether mapp performs all computations from scratch  when data that mapp can reuse are preprocessed offline and readily available mapp is slower than the very fast far algorithm by a factor of 218 on average  mapps solutions are on average 20 longer than fars solutions and 731 longer than whcas solutions
