this article discusses two contributions to decisionmaking in complex partially observable stochastic games first we apply two stateoftheart search techniques that use montecarlo sampling to the task of approximating a nashequilibrium ne in such games namely montecarlo tree search mcts and montecarlo counterfactual regret minimization mccfr mcts has been proven to approximate a ne in perfectinformation games we show that the algorithm quickly finds a reasonably strong strategy but not a ne in a complex imperfect information game ie poker mccfr on the other hand has theoretical ne convergence guarantees in such a game we apply mccfr for the first time in poker based on our experiments we may conclude that mcts is a valid approach if one wants to learn reasonably strong strategies fast whereas mccfr is the better choice if the quality of the strategy is most important
