many applications eg web service composition complex system design team formation etc rely on methods for identifying collections of objects or entities satisfying some functional requirement among the collections that satisfy the functional requirement it is often necessary to identify one or more collections that are optimal with respect to user preferences over a set of attributes that describe the nonfunctional properties of the collection

we provide algorithms that use this dominance relation to identify the set of most preferred collections we show that under certain conditions the algorithms are guaranteed to return only sound all complete or at least one weakly complete of the most preferred collections we present results of simulation experiments comparing the proposed algorithms with respect to a the quality of solutions number of most preferred solutions produced by the algorithms and b their performance and efficiency we also explore some interesting conjectures suggested by the results of our experiments that relate the properties of the user preferences the dominance relation and the algorithms
