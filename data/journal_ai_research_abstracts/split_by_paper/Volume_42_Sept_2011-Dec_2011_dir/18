j  m pe241a 2011 finding consensus bayesian network structures volume 42 pages 661687

suppose that multiple experts or learning algorithms provide us with alternative bayesian network bn structures over a domain and that we are interested in combining them into a single consensus bn structure specifically we are interested in that the consensus bn structure only represents independences all the given bn structures agree upon and that it has as few parameters associated as possible in this paper we prove that there may exist several nonequivalent consensus bn structures and that finding one of them is nphard thus we decide to resort to heuristics to find an approximated consensus bn structure in this paper we consider the heuristic proposed by matzkevich and abramson which builds upon two algorithms called methods a and b for efficiently deriving the minimal directed independence map of a bn structure relative to a given node ordering methods a and b are claimed to be correct although no proof is provided a proof is just sketched in this paper we show that methods a and b are not correct and propose a correction of them
