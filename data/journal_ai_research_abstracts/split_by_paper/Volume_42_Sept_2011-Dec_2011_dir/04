r  hoshino and k  kawarabayashi 2011 scheduling bipartite tournaments to minimize total travel distance volume 42 pages 91124

in many professional sports leagues teams from opposing leaguesconferences compete against one another playing interleague games  this is an example of a bipartite tournament  in this paper we consider the problem of reducing the total travel distance of bipartite tournaments by analyzing interleague scheduling from the perspective of discrete optimization  this research has natural applications to sports scheduling especially for leagues such as the national basketball association nba where teams must travel long distances across north america to play all their games thus consuming much time money and greenhouse gas emissions

we introduce the bipartite traveling tournament problem bttp the interleague variant of the wellstudied traveling tournament problem we prove that the 2nteam bttp is npcomplete but for small values of n a distanceoptimal interleague schedule can be generated from an algorithm based on minimumweight 4cyclecovers  we apply our theoretical results to the 12team nippon professional baseball npb league in japan producing a provablyoptimal schedule requiring 42950 kilometres of total team travel a 16 reduction compared to the actual distance traveled by these teams during the 2010 npb season  we also develop a nearlyoptimal interleague tournament for the 30team nba league just 38 higher than the trivial theoretical lower bound
