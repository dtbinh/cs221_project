value iteration is a powerful yet inefficient algorithm for markov decision processes mdps because it puts the majority of its effort into backing up the entire state space which turns out to be unnecessary in many cases in order to overcome this problem many approaches have been proposed among them ilao and variants of rtdp are stateoftheart ones these methods use reachability analysis and heuristic search to avoid some unnecessary backups however none of these approaches build the graphical structure of the state transitions in a preprocessing step or use the structural information to systematically decompose a problem whereby generating an intelligent backup sequence of the state space in this paper we present two optimal mdp algorithms the first algorithm  topological value iteration tvi detects the structure of mdps and backs up states based on topological sequences it 1 divides an mdp into stronglyconnected components sccs and 2 solves these components sequentially tvi outperforms vi and other stateoftheart algorithms vastly when an mdp has multiple closetoequalsized sccs the second algorithm  focused  topological value iteration ftvi is an extension of tvi ftvi restricts its attention to connected components that are relevant for solving the mdp specifically it uses a small amount of heuristic search to eliminate provably suboptimal actions this pruning allows ftvi to find smaller connected components thus running faster  we demonstrate that ftvi outperforms tvi by an order of magnitude averaged across several domains surprisingly ftvi also significantly outperforms popular heuristicallyinformed mdp algorithms such as ilao lrtdp brtdp and bayesianrtdp in many domains sometimes by as much as two orders of magnitude finally we characterize the type of domains where ftvi excels  suggesting a way to an informed choice of solver
