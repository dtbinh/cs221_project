interpolation is an important property of classical and many nonclassical logics that has been shown to have interesting applications in computer science and ai here we study the interpolation property for the the nonmonotonic system of equilibrium logic establishing weaker or stronger forms of interpolation depending on the precise interpretation of the inference relation these results also yield a form of interpolation for ground logic programs under the answer sets semantics for disjunctive logic programs we also study the property of uniform interpolation that is closely related to the concept of variable forgetting the firstorder version of equilibrium logic has analogous interpolation properties whenever the collection of equilibrium models is firstorder definable since this is the case for socalled safe programs and theories it applies to the usual situations that arise in practical answer set programming
