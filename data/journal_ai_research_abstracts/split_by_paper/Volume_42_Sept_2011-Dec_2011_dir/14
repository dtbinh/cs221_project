logic programs with aggregates lpa are one of the major linguistic extensions to logic programming lp in this work we propose a generalization of the notions of unfounded set and wellfounded semantics for programs with monotone and antimonotone aggregates lpama programs in particular we present a new notion of unfounded set for lpama programs which is a sound generalization of the original definition for standard aggregatefree lp on this basis we define a wellfounded operator for lpama programs the fixpoint of which is called wellfounded model or wellfounded semantics for lpama programs the most important properties of unfounded sets and the wellfounded semantics for standard lp are retained by this generalization notably existence and uniqueness of the wellfounded model together with a strong relationship to the answer set semantics for lpama programs we show that one of the dwellfounded semantics defined by pelov denecker and bruynooghe for a broader class of aggregates using approximating operators coincides with the wellfounded model as defined in this work on lpama programs we also discuss some complexity issues most importantly we give a formal proof of tractable computation of the wellfounded model for lpa programs moreover we prove that for general lpa programs which may contain aggregates that are neither monotone nor antimonotone deciding satisfaction of aggregate expressions with respect to partial interpretations is conpcomplete as a consequence a wellfounded semantics for general lpa programs that allows for tractable computation is unlikely to exist which justifies the restriction on lpama programs finally we present a prototype system extending dlv which supports the wellfounded semantics for lpama programs at the time of writing the only implemented system that does so experiments with this prototype show significant computational advantages of aggregate constructs over equivalent aggregatefree encodings
