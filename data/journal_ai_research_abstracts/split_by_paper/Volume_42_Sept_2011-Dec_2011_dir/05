j  lee and y  meng 2011 firstorder stable model semantics and firstorder loop formulas volume 42 pages 125180

lin and zhaos theorem on loop formulas states that in the propositional case the stable model semantics of a logic program can be completely characterized by propositional loop formulas but this result does not fully carry over to the firstorder case we investigate the precise relationship between the firstorder stable model semantics and firstorder loop formulas and study conditions under which the former can be represented by the latter in order to facilitate the comparison we extend the definition of a firstorder loop formula which was limited to a nondisjunctive program to a disjunctive program and to an arbitrary firstorder theory based on the studied relationship we extend the syntax of a logic program with explicit quantifiers which allows us to do reasoning involving nonherbrand stable models using firstorder reasoners such programs can be viewed as a special class of firstorder theories under the stable model semantics which yields more succinct loop formulas than the general language due to their restricted syntax
