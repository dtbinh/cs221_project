c  yuan h  lim and t  lu 2011 most relevant explanation in bayesian networks volume 42 pages 309352

a major inference task in bayesian networks is explaining why some variables are observed in their particular states using a set of target variables existing methods for solving this problem often generate explanations that are either too simple underspecified or too complex overspecified in this paper we introduce a method called most relevant explanation mre which finds a partial instantiation of the target variables that maximizes the generalized bayes factor gbf as the best explanation for the given evidence our study shows that gbf has several theoretical properties that enable mre to automatically identify the most relevant target variables in forming its explanation in particular conditional bayes factor cbf defined as the gbf of a new explanation conditioned on an existing explanation provides a soft measure on the degree of relevance of the variables in the new explanation in explaining the evidence given the existing explanation as a result mre is able to automatically prune less relevant variables from its explanation we also show that cbf is able to capture well the explainingaway phenomenon that is often represented in bayesian networks moreover we define two dominance relations between the candidate solutions and use the relations to generalize mre to find a set of top explanations that is both diverse and representative case studies on several benchmark diagnostic bayesian networks show that mre is often able to find explanatory hypotheses that are not only precise but also concise
