for many election systems bribery and related attacks have been shown nphard using constructions on combinatorially rich structures such as partitions and covers  this paper shows that for voters who follow the most central politicalscience model of electoratessinglepeaked preferencesthose hardness protections vanish  by using singlepeaked preferences to simplify combinatorial covering challenges we for the first time show that nphard bribery problemsincluding those for kemeny and llull electionsfall to polynomial time for singlepeaked electorates  by using singlepeaked preferences to simplify combinatorial partition challenges we for the first time show that nphard partitionofvoters problems fall to polynomial time for singlepeaked electorates  we show that for singlepeaked electorates the winner problems for dodgson and kemeny elections though thetatwocomplete in the general case fall to polynomial time  and we completely classify the complexity of weighted coalition manipulation for scoring protocols in singlepeaked electorates
