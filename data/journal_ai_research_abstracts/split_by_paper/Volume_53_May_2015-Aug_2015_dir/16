we design and analyze deterministic truthful approximation mechanisms for multiunit combinatorial auctions involving only a constant number of distinct goods each in arbitrary limited supply prospective buyers bidders have preferences over multisets of items ie for more than one unit per distinct good our objective is to determine allocations of multisets that maximize the social welfare our main results are for multiminded and submodular bidders in the first setting each bidder has a positive value for being allocated one multiset from a prespecified demand set of alternatives in the second setting each bidder is associated to a submodular valuation function that defines his value for the multiset he is allocated for multiminded bidders we design a truthful fptas that fully optimizes the social welfare while violating the supply constraints on goods within factor 1e for any fixed e0 ie the approximation applies to the constraints and not to the social welfare this result is best possible in that full optimization is impossible without violating the supply constraints for submodular bidders we obtain a ptas that approximates the optimum social welfare within factor 1e for any fixed e0 without violating the supply constraints this result is best possible as well our allocation algorithms are maximalinrange and yield truthful mechanisms when paired with vickreyclarkegroves payments
