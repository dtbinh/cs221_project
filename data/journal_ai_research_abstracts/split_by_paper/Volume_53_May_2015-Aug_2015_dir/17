algorithm selection as techniques  which involve choosing from a set of algorithms the one expected to solve a given problem instance most efficiently  have substantially improved the state of the art in solving many prominent ai problems such as sat csp asp maxsat and qbf although several as procedures have been introduced not too surprisingly none of them dominates all others across all as scenarios furthermore these procedures have parameters whose optimal values vary across as scenarios this holds specifically for the machine learning techniques that form the core of current as procedures and for their hyperparameters therefore to successfully apply as to new problems algorithms and benchmark sets two questions need to be answered i how to select an as approach and ii how to set its parameters effectively we address both of these problems simultaneously by using automated algorithm configuration specifically we demonstrate that we can automatically configure claspfolio 2 which implements a large variety of different as approaches and their respective parameters in a single highlyparameterized algorithm framework our approach dubbed autofolio allows researchers and practitioners across a broad range of applications to exploit the combined power of many different as methods we demonstrate autofolio can significantly improve the performance of claspfolio 2 on 8 out of the 13 scenarios from the algorithm selection library leads to new stateoftheart algorithm selectors for 7 of these scenarios and matches stateoftheart performance statistically on all other scenarios compared to the best single algorithm for each as scenario autofolio achieves average speedup factors between 13 and 154
