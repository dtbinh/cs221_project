the famous archetypical npcomplete problem of boolean satisfiability sat and its pspacecomplete generalization of quantified boolean satisfiability qsat have become central declarative programming paradigms through which realworld instances of various computationally hard problems can be efficiently solved this success has been achieved through several breakthroughs in practical implementations of decision procedures for sat and qsat that is in sat and qsat solvers here simplification techniques for conjunctive normal form cnf for sat and for prenex conjunctive normal form pcnf for qsatthe standard input formats of sat and qsat solvershave recently proven very effective in increasing solver efficiency when applied before ie in preprocessing or during ie in inprocessing satisfiability search

in this article we develop and analyze clause elimination procedures for pre and inprocessing clause elimination procedures form a family of pcnf formula simplification techniques which remove clauses that have specific in practice polynomialtime redundancy properties while maintaining the satisfiability status of the formulas extending known procedures such as tautology subsumption and blocked clause elimination we introduce novel elimination procedures based on asymmetric variants of these techniques and also develop a novel family of socalled covered clause elimination procedures as well as natural liftings of the cnflevel procedures to pcnf we analyze the considered clause elimination procedures from various perspectives furthermore for the variants not preserving logical equivalence under clause elimination we show how to reconstruct solutions to original cnfs from satisfying assignments to simplified cnfs which is important for practical applications for the procedures complementing the more theoretical analysis we present results on an empirical evaluation on the practical importance of the clause elimination procedures in terms of the effect on solver runtimes on standard realworld application benchmarks it turns out that the importance of applying the clause elimination procedures developed in this work is empirically emphasized in the context of stateoftheart qsat solving
