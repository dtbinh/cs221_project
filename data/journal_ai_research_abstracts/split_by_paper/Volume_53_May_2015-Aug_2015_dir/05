this paper explores the use of generalpurpose machine translation mt in assisting the users of computeraided translation cat systems based on translation memory tm to identify the target words in the translation proposals that need to be changed either replaced or removed or kept unedited a task we term as wordkeeping recommendation mt is used as a black box to align source and target subsegments on the fly in the translation units tus suggested to the user sourcelanguage sl and targetlanguage tl segments in the matching tus are segmented into overlapping subsegments of variable length and machinetranslated into the tl and the sl respectively the bilingual subsegments obtained and the matching between the sl segment in the tu and the segment to be translated are employed to build the features that are then used by a binary classifier to determine the target words to be changed and those to be kept unedited in this approach mt results are never presented to the translator two approaches are presented in this work one using a wordkeeping recommendation system which can be trained on the tm used with the cat system and a more basic approach which does not require any training

experiments are conducted by simulating the translation of texts in several language pairs with corpora belonging to different domains and using three different mt systems we compare the performance obtained to that of previous works that have used statistical word alignment for wordkeeping recommendation and show that the mtbased approaches presented in this paper are more accurate in most scenarios in particular our results confirm that the mtbased approaches are better than the alignmentbased approach when using models trained on outofdomain tms additional experiments were performed to check how dependent the mtbased recommender is on the language pair and mt system used for training these experiments confirm a high degree of reusability of the recommendation models across various mt systems but a low level of reusability across language pairs
