we propose coactive learning as a model of interaction between a learning system and a human user where both have the common goal of providing results of maximum utility to the user interactions in the coactive learning model take the following form at each step the system eg search engine receives a context eg query and predicts an object eg ranking the user responds by correcting the system if necessary providing a slightly improved but not necessarily optimal object as feedback we argue that such preference feedback can be inferred in large quantity from observable user behavior eg clicks in web search unlike the optimal feedback required in the expert model or the cardinal valuations required for bandit learning despite the relaxed requirements for the feedback we show that it is possible to adapt many existing online learning algorithms to the coactive framework in particular we provide algorithms that achieve square root regret in terms of cardinal utility even though the learning algorithm never observes cardinal utility values directly we also provide an algorithm with logarithmic regret in the case of strongly convex loss functions an extensive empirical study demonstrates the applicability of our model and algorithms on a movie recommendation task as well as ranking for web search
