the article introduces a ceteris paribus modal logic called cp interpreted on the equivalence classes induced by finite sets of propositional atoms this logic is studied and then used to embed three logics of strategic interaction namely atemporal stit the coalition logic of propositional control cl8722pc and the starless fragment of the dynamic logic of propositional assignments dl8722pa the embeddings highlight a common ceteris paribus structure underpinning the key operators of all these apparently very different logics and show we argue remarkable similarities behind some of the most influential formalisms for reasoning about strategic interaction
