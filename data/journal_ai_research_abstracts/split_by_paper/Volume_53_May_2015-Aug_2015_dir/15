johan  kwisthout 2015 treewidth and the computational complexity of map approximations in bayesian networks volume 53 pages 699720

the problem of finding the most probable explanation to a designated set of variables given partial evidence the map problem is a notoriously intractable problem in bayesian networks both to compute exactly and to approximate it is known both from theoretical considerations and from practical experience that low treewidth is typically an essential prerequisite to efficient exact computations in bayesian networks in this paper we investigate whether the same holds for approximating map we define four notions of approximating map by value structure rank and expectation and argue that all of them are intractable in general we prove that efficient valueapproximations structureapproximations and rankapproximations of map instances with high treewidth will violate the exponential time hypothesis in contrast we show that map can sometimes be efficiently expectationapproximated even in instances with high treewidth if the most probable explanation has a high probability we introduce the complexity class fert analogous to the class ftp to capture this notion of fixedparameter expectationapproximability we suggest a roadmap to future research that yields fixedparameter tractable results for expectationapproximate map even in graphs with high treewidth
