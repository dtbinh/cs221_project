decentralized pomdps provide an expressive framework for multiagent sequential decision making however the complexity of these modelsnexpcomplete even for two agentshas limited their scalability we present a promising new class of approximation algorithms by developing novel connections between multiagent planning and machine learning we show how the multiagent planning problem can be reformulated as inference in a mixture of dynamic bayesian networks dbns this planningasinference approach paves the way for the application of efficient inference techniques in dbns to multiagent decision making to further improve scalability we identify certain conditions that are sufficient to extend the approach to multiagent systems with dozens of agents specifically we show that the necessary inference within the expectationmaximization framework can be decomposed into processes that often involve a small subset of agents thereby facilitating scalability we further show that a number of existing multiagent planning models satisfy these conditions experiments on large planning benchmarks confirm the benefits of our approach in terms of runtime and scalability with respect to existing techniques
