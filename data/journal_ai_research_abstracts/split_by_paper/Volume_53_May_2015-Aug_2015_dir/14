the interaction of multiple autonomous agents gives rise to highly dynamic and nondeterministic environments contributing to the complexity in applications such as automated financial markets smart grids or robotics due to the sheer number of situations that may arise it is not possible to foresee and program the optimal behaviour for all agents beforehand consequently it becomes essential for the success of the system that the agents can learn their optimal behaviour and adapt to new situations or circumstances the past two decades have seen the emergence of reinforcement learning both in single and multiagent settings as a strong robust and adaptive learning paradigm progress has been substantial and a wide range of algorithms are now available an important challenge in the domain of multiagent learning is to gain qualitative insights into the resulting system dynamics in the past decade tools and methods from evolutionary game theory have been successfully employed to study multiagent learning dynamics formally in strategic interactions this article surveys the dynamical models that have been derived for various multiagent reinforcement learning algorithms making it possible to study and compare them qualitatively furthermore new learning algorithms that have been introduced using these evolutionary game theoretic tools are reviewed the evolutionary models can be used to study complex strategic interactions examples of such analysis are given for the domains of automated trading in stock markets and collision avoidance in multirobot systems the paper provides a roadmap on the progress that has been achieved in analysing the evolutionary dynamics of multiagent learning by highlighting the main results and accomplishments
