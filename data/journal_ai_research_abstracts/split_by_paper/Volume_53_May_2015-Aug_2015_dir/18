aaron  hunter and james  delgrande 2015 belief change with uncertain action histories volume 53 pages 779824

we consider the iterated belief change that occurs following an alternating sequence of actions and observations  at each instant an agent has beliefs about the actions that have occurred as well as beliefs about the resulting state of the world  we represent such problems by a sequence of ranking functions so an agent assigns a quantitative plausibility value to every action and every state at each point in time  the resulting formalism is able to represent fallible belief erroneous perception exogenous actions and failed actions  we illustrate that our framework is a generalization of several existing approaches to belief change and it appropriately captures the nonelementary interaction between belief update and belief revision
