stefan  funke andre  nusser and sabine  storandt 2015 placement of loading stations for electric vehicles no detours necessary volume 53 pages 633658

compared to conventional cars electric vehicles evs still suffer from considerably shorter cruising ranges combined with the sparsity of battery loading stations the complete transition to emobility still seems a long way to go in this paper we consider the problem of placing as few loading stations as possible so that on any shortest path there are sufficiently many not to run out of energy we show how to model this problem and introduce heuristics which provide closetooptimal solutions even in large road networks
