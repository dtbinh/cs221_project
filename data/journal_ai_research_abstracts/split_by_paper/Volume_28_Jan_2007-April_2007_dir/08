we describe how to convert the heuristic search algorithm a into an anytime algorithm that finds a sequence of improved solutions and eventually converges to an optimal solution the approach we adopt uses weighted heuristic search to find an approximate solution quickly and then continues the weighted search to find improved solutions as well as to improve a bound on the suboptimality of the current solution when the time available to solve a search problem is limited or uncertain this creates an anytime heuristic search algorithm that allows a flexible tradeoff between search time and solution quality we analyze the properties of the resulting anytime a algorithm and consider its performance in three domains slidingtile puzzles strips planning and multiple sequence alignment to illustrate the generality of this approach we also describe how to transform the memoryefficient search algorithm recursive bestfirst search rbfs into an anytime algorithm
