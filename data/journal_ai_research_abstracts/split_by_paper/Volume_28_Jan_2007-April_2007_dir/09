in the recent years several research efforts have focused on the concept of time granularity and its applications a first stream of research investigated the mathematical models behind the notion of granularity and the algorithms to manage temporal data based on those models a second stream of research investigated symbolic formalisms providing a set of algebraic operators to define granularities in a compact and compositional way however only very limited manipulation algorithms have been proposed to operate directly on the algebraic representation making it unsuitable to use the symbolic formalisms in applications that need manipulation of granularities

from a technical point of view we propose an hybrid algorithm that interleaves the conversion of calendar subexpressions into periodical sets with the minimization of the period length the algorithm returns setbased granularity representations having minimal period length which is the most relevant parameter for the performance of the considered reasoning services extensive experimental work supports the techniques used in the algorithm and shows the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm
