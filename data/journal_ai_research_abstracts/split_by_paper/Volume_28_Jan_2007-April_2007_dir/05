a  d  procaccia and j  s rosenschein 2007 junta distributions and the averagecase complexity of manipulating elections volume 28 pages 157181

encouraging voters to truthfully reveal their preferences in an election has long been an important issue recently computational complexity has been suggested as a means of precluding strategic behavior previous studies have shown that some voting protocols are hard to manipulate but used nphardness as the complexity measure such a worstcase analysis may be an insufficient guarantee of resistance to manipulation

indeed we demonstrate that nphard manipulations may be tractable in the average case for this purpose we augment the existing theory of averagecase complexity with some new concepts in particular we consider elections distributed with respect to junta distributions which concentrate on hard instances we use our techniques to prove that scoring protocols are susceptible to manipulation by coalitions when the number of candidates is constant
