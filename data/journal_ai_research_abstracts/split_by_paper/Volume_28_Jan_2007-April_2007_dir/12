f  lin and y  chen 2007 discovering classes of strongly equivalent logic programs volume 28 pages 431451

in this paper we apply computeraided theorem discovery technique to discover theorems about strongly equivalent logic programs under the answer set semantics our discovered theorems capture new classes of strongly equivalent logic programs that can lead to new program simplification rules that preserve strong equivalence specifically with the help of computers we discovered exact conditions that capture the strong equivalence between a rule and the empty set between two rules between two rules and one of the two rules between two rules and another rule and between three rules and two of the three rules
