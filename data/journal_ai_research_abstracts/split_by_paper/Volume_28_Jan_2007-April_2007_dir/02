merging operators aim at defining the beliefsgoals of a group of agents from the beliefsgoals of each member of the group whenever an agent of the group has preferences over the possible results of the merging process ie the possible merged bases she can try to rig the merging process by lying on her true beliefsgoals if this leads to better merged base according to her point of view obviously strategyproof operators are highly desirable in order to guarantee equity among agents even when some of them are not sincere in this paper we draw the strategyproof landscape for many merging operators from the literature including modelbased ones and formulabased ones both the general case and several restrictions on the merging process are considered
