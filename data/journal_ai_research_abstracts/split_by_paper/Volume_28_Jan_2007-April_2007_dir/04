a  i coles and a  j smith 2007 marvin a heuristic search planner with online macroaction learning volume 28 pages 119156

this paper describes marvin a planner that competed in the fourth international planning competition ipc 4 marvin uses actionsequencememoisation techniques to generate macroactions which are then used during search for a solution plan we provide an overview of its architecture and search behaviour detailing the algorithms used we also empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of its features in various planning domains in particular the effects on performance due to the use of macroactions the novel features of its search behaviour and the native support of adl and derived predicates
