s  r jodogne and j  h piater 2007 closedloop learning of visual control policies volume 28 pages 349391

in this paper we present a general flexible framework for learning mappings from images to actions by interacting with the environment the basic idea is to introduce a featurebased image classifier in front of a reinforcement learning algorithm the classifier partitions the visual space according to the presence or absence of few highly informative local descriptors that are incrementally selected in a sequence of attempts to remove perceptual aliasing we also address the problem of fighting overfitting in such a greedy algorithm finally we show how highlevel visual features can be generated when the power of local descriptors is insufficient for completely disambiguating the aliased states this is done by building a hierarchy of composite features that consist of recursive spatial combinations of visual features we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms by solving three visual navigation tasks and a visual version of the classical car on the hill control problem
