y  gao and j  culberson 2007 consistency and random constraint satisfaction models volume 28 pages 517557

in this paper we study the possibility of designing nontrivial random csp models by exploiting the intrinsic connection between structures and typicalcase hardness we show that constraint consistency a notion that has been developed to improve  the efficiency of csp algorithms is in fact the key to the design of random csp models that have interesting phase transition behavior and guaranteed exponential resolution complexity without putting much restriction on the parameter of constraint tightness or the domain size of the problem  we propose a very flexible framework for constructing problem instances withinteresting behavior and develop a variety of concrete methods to construct specific  random csp models that enforce different levels of constraint consistency 

a series of experimental studies with interesting observations are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of introducing structural elements in random instances to verify the robustness of our proposal and to investigate features of some specific models based on our framework that are highly related to the behavior of backtracking search algorithms
