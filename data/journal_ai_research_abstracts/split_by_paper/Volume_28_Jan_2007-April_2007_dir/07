l  blumrosen n  nisan and i  segal 2007 auctions with severely bounded communication volume 28 pages 233266

we study auctions with severe bounds on the communication allowed each bidder  may only transmit t bits of information to the auctioneer we consider both welfare and profitmaximizing auctions under this communication restriction for both measures we determine the optimal auction and show that the loss incurred relative to unconstrained auctions is mild we prove nonsurprising properties of these kinds of auctions eg that in optimal mechanisms bidders  simply report the interval in which their valuation lies in  as well as some surprising properties eg that asymmetric auctions  are better than symmetric ones and that multiround auctions reduce the communication complexity only by a linear factor
