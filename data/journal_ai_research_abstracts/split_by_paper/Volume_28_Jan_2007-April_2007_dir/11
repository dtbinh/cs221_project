a  s fukunaga and r  e korf 2007 bin completion algorithms for multicontainer packing knapsack and covering problems volume 28 pages 393429

many combinatorial optimization problems such as the bin packing and multiple knapsack problems involve assigning a set of discrete objects to multiple containers these problems can be used to model task and resource allocation problems in multiagent systems and distributed systms and can also be found as subproblems of scheduling problems we propose bin completion a branchandbound strategy for onedimensional multicontainer packing problems  bin completion combines a binoriented search space with a powerful dominance criterion that enables us to prune much of the space the performance of the basic bin completion framework can be enhanced by using a number of extensions including nogoodbased pruning techniques that allow further exploitation of the dominance criterion  bin completion is applied to four problems multiple knapsack bin covering mincost covering and bin packing  we show that our bin completion algorithms yield new stateoftheart results for the multiple knapsack bin covering and mincost covering problems outperforming previous algorithms by several orders of magnitude with respect to runtime on some classes of hard random problem instances  for the bin packing problem we demonstrate significant improvements compared to most previous results but show that bin completion is not competitive with current stateoftheart cuttingstock based approaches
