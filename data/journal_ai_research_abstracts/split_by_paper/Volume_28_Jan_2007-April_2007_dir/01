b  bidyuk and r  dechter 2007 cutset sampling for bayesian networks volume 28 pages 148

the paper presents a new sampling methodology for bayesian networks that samples only a subset of variables and applies exact inference to the rest  cutset sampling is a network structureexploiting application of the raoblackwellisation principle to sampling in bayesian networks  it improves convergence by exploiting memorybased inference algorithms  it can also be viewed as an anytime approximation of the exact cutsetconditioning algorithm developed by pearl  cutset sampling can be implemented efficiently when the sampled variables constitute a loopcutset of the bayesian network and more generally when the induced width of the networks graph conditioned on the observed sampled variables is bounded by a constant w  we demonstrate empirically the benefit of this scheme on a range of benchmarks
