local consistency techniques such as kconsistency are a key  component of specialised solvers for constraint satisfaction problems in this paper we show that the power of using kconsistency techniques on a constraint satisfaction problem is precisely captured by using a particular inference rule which we call negativehyperresolution on the standard direct encoding of the problem into boolean clauses we also show that current clauselearning satsolvers will discover in expected polynomial time any inconsistency that can be deduced from a given set of clauses using negativehyperresolvents of a fixed size we combine these two results to show that without being explicitly designed to do so current clauselearning satsolvers efficiently simulate kconsistency techniques for all fixed values of k we then give some experimental results to show that this feature allows clauselearning satsolvers to efficiently solve certain families of constraint problems which are challenging for conventional constraintprogramming solvers
