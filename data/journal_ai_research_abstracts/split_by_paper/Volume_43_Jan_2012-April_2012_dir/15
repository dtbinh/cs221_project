to achieve scalability of query answering the developers of semantic web applications are often forced to use incomplete owl 2 reasoners which fail to derive all answers for at least one query ontology and data set the lack of completeness guarantees however may be unacceptable for applications in areas such as health care and defence where missing answers can adversely affect the applications functionality furthermore even if an application can tolerate some level of incompleteness it is often advantageous to estimate how many and what kind of answers are being lost

our results thus provide a theoretical and practical foundation for the design of future ontologybased information systems that maximise scalability while minimising or even eliminating incompleteness of query answers
