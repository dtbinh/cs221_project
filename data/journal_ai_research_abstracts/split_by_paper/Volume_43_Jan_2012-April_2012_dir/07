many combinatorial problems deal with preferences and violations the goal of which is to find solutions with the minimum cost  weighted constraint satisfaction is a framework for modeling such problems which consists of a set of cost functions to measure the degree of violation or preferences of different combinations of variable assignments  typical solution methods for weighted constraint satisfaction problems wcsps are based on branchandbound search which are made practical through the use of powerful consistency techniques such as ac fdac edac to deduce hidden cost information and value pruning during search  these techniques however are designed to be efficient only on binary and ternary cost functions which are represented in table form  in tackling many reallife problems high arity or global cost functions are required  we investigate efficient representation scheme and algorithms to bring the benefits of the consistency techniques to also high arity cost functions which are often derived from hard global constraints from classical constraint satisfaction

the literature suggests some global cost functions can be represented as flow networks and the minimum cost flow algorithm can be used to compute the minimum costs of such networks in polynomial time  we show that naive adoption of this flowbased algorithmic method for global cost functions can result in a stronger form of nullinverse consistency  we further show how the method can be modified to handle cost projections and extensions to maintain generalized versions of ac and fdac for cost functions with more than two variables  similar generalization for the stronger edac is less straightforward  we reveal the oscillation problem when enforcing edac on cost functions sharing more than one variable  to avoid oscillation we propose a weak version of edac and generalize it to weak edgac for nonbinary cost functions using various benchmarks involving the soft variants of hard global constraints alldifferent gcc same and regular empirical results demonstrate that our proposal gives improvements of up to an order of magnitude when compared with the traditional constraint optimization approach both in terms of time and pruning
