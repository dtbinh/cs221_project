y  zeng and p  doshi 2012 exploiting model equivalences for solving interactive dynamic influence diagrams volume 43 pages 211255

 we focus on  the problem of sequential decision  making in partially observable environments shared with  other agents of uncertain types having  similar or  conflicting objectives   this problem  has been previously  formalized by multiple  frameworks one  of which  is the interactive  dynamic   influence   diagram  idid   which generalizes  the  wellknown  influence  diagram to  the  multiagent setting  idids are graphical models and may be used to compute the policy  of an agent  given its  belief over  the physical  state and others models which changes as  the agent acts and observes in the  multiagent setting

as we may  expect solving idids is computationally  hard  this is predominantly due to the large space of candidate models ascribed to the other agents  and its exponential growth over  time  we present two methods  for reducing the size  of the model  space and stemming its  exponential  growth  both  these  methods involve  aggregating individual models into equivalence classes  our first method groups together behaviorally equivalent models and selects only those  models for  updating which will result in  predictive behaviors that are distinct  from others  in the updated  model space   the second method further compacts  the model space by focusing  on portions of the   behavioral  predictions    specifically   we  cluster  actionally equivalent models  that prescribe identical actions at a  single  time step  exactly  identifying  the equivalences  would require us to solve all models in the initial set  we avoid this by selectively  solving  some of  the  models  thereby introducing  an approximation    we   discuss   the   error   introduced   by   the approximation and  empirically demonstrate the  improved efficiency in solving idids due to the equivalences
