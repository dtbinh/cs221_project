c  hernandez and j  a baier 2012 avoiding and escaping depressions in realtime heuristic search volume 43 pages 523570

heuristics used for solving hard realtime search problems have regions with depressions  such regions are bounded areas of the search space in which the heuristic function is inaccurate compared to the actual cost to reach a solution early realtime search algorithms like lrta easily become trapped in those regions since the heuristic values of their states may need to be updated multiple times which results in costly solutions stateoftheart realtime search algorithms like lsslrta or lrtak improve lrtas mechanism to update the heuristic resulting in improved performance those algorithms however do not guide search towards avoiding depressed regions this paper presents depression avoidance a simple realtime search principle to guide search towards avoiding states that have been marked as part of a heuristic depression we propose two ways in which depression avoidance can be implemented markandavoid and movetoborder we implement these strategies on top of lsslrta and rtaa producing 4 new realtime heuristic search algorithms alsslrta dalsslrta artaa and dartaa when the objective is to find a single solution by running the realtime search algorithm once we show that dalsslrta and dartaa outperform their predecessors sometimes by one order of magnitude of the four new algorithms dartaa produces the best solutions given a fixed deadline on the average time allowed per planning episode we prove all our algorithms have good theoretical properties in finite search spaces they find a solution if one exists and converge to an optimal after a number of trials
