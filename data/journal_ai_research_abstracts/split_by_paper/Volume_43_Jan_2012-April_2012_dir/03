recent research has shown that surprisingly rich models of human activity can be learned from gps positional data however most effort to date has concentrated on modeling single individuals or statistical properties of groups of people moreover prior work focused solely on modeling actual successful executions and not failed or attempted executions of the activities of interest we in contrast take on the task of understanding human interactions attempted interactions and intentions from noisy sensor data in a fully relational multiagent setting we use a realworld game of capture the flag to illustrate our approach in a welldefined domain that involves many distinct cooperative and competitive joint activities we model the domain using markov logic a statisticalrelational language and learn a theory that jointly denoises the data and infers occurrences of highlevel activities such as a player capturing an enemy our unified model combines constraints imposed by the geometry of the game area the motion model of the players and by the rules and dynamics of the game in a probabilistically and logically sound fashion we show that while it may be impossible to directly detect a multiagent activity due to sensor noise or malfunction the occurrence of the activity can still be inferred by considering both its impact on the future behaviors of the people involved as well as the events that could have preceded it further we show that given a model of successfully performed multiagent activities along with a set of examples of failed attempts at the same activities our system automatically learns an augmented model that is capable of recognizing success and failure as well as goals of peoples actions with high accuracy we compare our approach with other alternatives and show that our unified model which takes into account not only relationships among individual players but also relationships among activities over the entire length of a game although more computationally costly is significantly more accurate finally we demonstrate that explicitly modeling unsuccessful attempts boosts performance on other important recognition tasks
