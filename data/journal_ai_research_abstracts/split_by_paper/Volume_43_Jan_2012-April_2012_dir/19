traffic congestion in urban road networks is a costly problem that affects all major cities in developed countries to tackle this problem it is possible i to act on the supply side increasing the number of roads or lanes in a network ii to reduce the demand restricting the access to urban areas at specific hours or to specific vehicles or iii to improve the efficiency of the existing network by means of a widespread use of socalled intelligent transportation systems its in line with the recent advances in smart transportation management infrastructures its has turned out to be a promising field of application for artificial intelligence techniques in particular multiagent systems seem to be the ideal candidates for the design and implementation of its in fact drivers can be naturally modelled as autonomous agents that interact with the transportation management infrastructure thereby generating a largescale open agentbased system to regulate such a system and maintain a smooth and efficient flow of traffic decentralised mechanisms for the management of the transportation infrastructure are needed

in this article we propose a distributed marketinspired mechanism for the management of a future urban road network where intelligent autonomous vehicles operated by software agents on behalf of their human owners interact with the infrastructure in order to travel safely and efficiently through the road network building on the reservationbased intersection control model proposed by dresner and stone we consider two different scenarios one with a single intersection and one with a network of intersections in the former we analyse the performance of a novel policy based on combinatorial auctions for the allocation of reservations in the latter we analyse the impact that a traffic assignment strategy inspired by competitive markets has on the drivers route choices finally we propose an adaptive management mechanism that integrates the auctionbased traffic control policy with the competitive traffic assignment strategy
