scheduling problems in manufacturing logistics and project management have frequently been modeled using the framework of resource constrained project scheduling problems with minimum and maximum time lags rcpspmax due to the importance of these problems providing scalable solution schedules for rcpspmax problems is a topic of extensive research however all existing methods for solving rcpspmax assume that durations of activities are known with certainty an assumption that does not hold in real world scheduling problems where unexpected external events such as manpower availability weather changes etc lead to delays or advances in completion of activities thus in this paper our focus is on providing a scalable method for solving rcpspmax problems with durational uncertainty to that end we introduce the robust local search method consisting of three key ideas a introducing and studying the properties of two decision rule approximations used to compute start times of activities with respect to dynamic realizations of the durational uncertainty b deriving the expression for robust makespan of an execution strategy based on decision rule approximations and c a robust local search mechanism to efficiently compute activity execution strategies that are robust against durational uncertainty furthermore we also provide enhancements to local search that exploit temporal dependencies between activities our experimental results illustrate that robust local search is able to provide robust execution strategies efficiently
