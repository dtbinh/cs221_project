domain knowledge is crucial for effective performance in autonomous control systems  typically human effort is required to encode this knowledge into a control algorithm  in this paper we present an approach to language grounding which automatically interprets text in the context of a complex control application such as a game and uses domain knowledge extracted from the text to improve control performance  both text analysis and control strategies are learned jointly using only a feedback signal inherent to the application  to effectively leverage textual information our method automatically extracts the text segment most relevant to the current game state and labels it with a taskcentric predicate structure  this labeled text is then used to bias an action selection policy for the game guiding it towards promising regions of the action space  we encode our model for text analysis and game playing in a multilayer neural network representing linguistic decisions via latent variables in the hidden layers and game action quality via the output layer  operating within the montecarlo search framework we estimate model parameters using feedback from simulated games  we apply our approach to the complex strategy game civilization ii using the official game manual as the text guide  our results show that a linguisticallyinformed gameplaying agent significantly outperforms its languageunaware counterpart yielding a 34 absolute improvement and winning over 65 of games when playing against the builtin ai of civilization
