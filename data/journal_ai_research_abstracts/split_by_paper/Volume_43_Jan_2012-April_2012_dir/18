j  lee and r  palla 2012 reformulating the situation calculus and the event calculus in the general theory of stable models and in answer set programming volume 43 pages 571620

circumscription and logic programs under the stable model semantics are two wellknown nonmonotonic formalisms the former has served as a basis of classical logic based action formalisms such as the situation calculus the event calculus and temporal action logics the latter has served as a basis of a family of action languages such as language a and several of its descendants based on the discovery that circumscription and the stable model semantics coincide on a class of canonical formulas we reformulate the situation calculus and the event calculus in the general theory of stable models we also present a translation that turns the reformulations further into answer set programs so that efficient answer set solvers can be applied to compute the situation calculus and the event calculus
