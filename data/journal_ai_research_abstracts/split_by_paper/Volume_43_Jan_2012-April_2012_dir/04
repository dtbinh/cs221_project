t  flati and r  navigli 2012 the cqc algorithm cycling in graphs to semantically enrich and enhance a bilingual dictionary volume 43 pages 135171

bilingual machinereadable dictionaries are knowledge resources useful in many automatic tasks however compared to monolingual computational lexicons like wordnet bilingual dictionaries typically provide a lower amount of structured information such as lexical and semantic relations and often do not cover the entire range of possible translations for a word of interest in this paper we present cycles and quasicycles cqc a novel algorithm for the automated disambiguation of ambiguous translations in the lexical entries of a bilingual machinereadable dictionary the dictionary is represented as a graph and cyclic patterns are sought in the graph to assign an appropriate sense tag to each translation in a lexical entry further we use the algorithms output to improve the quality of the dictionary itself by suggesting accurate solutions to structural problems such as misalignments partial alignments 

and missing entries finally we successfully apply cqc to the task of synonym extraction
