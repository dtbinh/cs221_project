icaps 2011 honorable mention for best student paper

we present two new and efficient algorithms for computing allpairs shortest paths  the algorithms operate on directed graphs with real possibly negative weights  they make use of directed path consistency along a vertex ordering d both algorithms run in on2 wd time where wd is the graph width induced by this vertex ordering  for graphs of constant treewidth this yields on2 time which is optimal  on chordal graphs the algorithms run in onm time in addition we present a variant that exploits graph separators to arrive at a run time of  on wd2  n2 sd on general graphs where sd  wd is the size of the largest minimal separator induced by the vertex ordering d we show empirically that on both constructed and realistic benchmarks in many cases the algorithms outperform floydwarshalls as well as johnsons algorithm which represent the current state of the art with a run time of on3 and onm  n2 log n respectively our algorithms can be used for spatial and temporal reasoning such as for the simple temporal problem which underlines their relevance to the planning and scheduling community
