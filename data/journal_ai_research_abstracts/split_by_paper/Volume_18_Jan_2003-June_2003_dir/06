this paper presents an evolutionary algorithm with a new    goalsequence domination scheme for better decision support in    multiobjective optimization the approach allows the inclusion of    advanced hardsoft priority and constraint information on each    objective component and is capable of incorporating multiple    specifications with overlapping or nonoverlapping objective functions    via logical or and and connectives to drive the search    towards multiple regions of tradeoff in addition we propose a    dynamic sharing scheme that is simple and adaptively estimated    according to the online population distribution without needing any a    priori parameter setting each feature in the proposed algorithm is    examined to show its respective contribution and the performance of    the algorithm is compared with other evolutionary optimization    methods it is shown that the proposed algorithm has performed well in    the diversity of evolutionary search and uniform distribution of    nondominated individuals along the final tradeoffs without    significant computational effort the algorithm is also applied to the    design optimization of a practical servo control system for hard disk    drives with a single voicecoilmotor actuator results of the    evolutionary designed servo control system show a superior closedloop    performance compared to classical pid or rpt approaches
