r  i brafman and  c  domshlak 2003 structure and complexity in planning with unary operators volume 18 pages 315349

unary operator domains  ie domains in which operators    have a single effect  arise naturally in many control problems  in    its most general form the problem of strips planning in unary    operator domains is known to be as hard as the general strips planning    problem  both are pspacecomplete however unary operator domains    induce a natural structure called the domains causal graph this    graph relates between the preconditions and effect of each domain    operator causal graphs were exploited by williams and nayak in order    to analyze plan generation for one of the controllers in nasas    deepspace one spacecraft there they utilized the fact that when    this graph is acyclic a serialization ordering over any subgoal can    be obtained quickly in this paper we conduct a comprehensive study of    the relationship between the structure of a domains causal graph and    the complexity of planning in this domain  on the positive side we    show that a nontrivial polynomial time plan generation algorithm    exists for domains whose causal graph induces a polytree with a    constant bound on its node indegree on the negative side we show    that even plan existence is hard when the graph is a directedpath    singly connected dag  more generally we show that the number of    paths in the causal graph is closely related to the complexity of    planning in the associated domain  finally we relate our results to    the question of complexity of planning with serializable subgoals
