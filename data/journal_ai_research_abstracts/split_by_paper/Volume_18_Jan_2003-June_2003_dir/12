natural language generation nlg systems are computer software    systems that produce texts in english and other human languages often    from nonlinguistic input data nlg systems like most ai systems need    substantial amounts of knowledge  however our experience in two     nlg projects suggests that it is difficult to acquire correct knowledge     for nlg systems indeed every knowledge acquisition ka technique     we tried had significant problems in general terms these problems were     due to the complexity novelty and poorly understood nature of the     tasks our systems attempted and were worsened by the fact that people    write so differently this meant in particular that corpusbased ka     approaches suffered because it was impossible to assemble a sizable     corpus of highquality consistent manually written texts in our domains    and structured expertoriented ka techniques suffered because experts     disagreed and because we could not get enough information about special     and unusual cases to build robust systems we believe that such problems     are likely to affect many other nlg systems as well  in the long term     we hope that new ka techniques may emerge to help nlg system builders      in the shorter term we believe that understanding how individual ka     techniques can fail and using a mixture of different ka techniques     with different strengths and weaknesses can help developers acquire     nlg knowledge that is mostly correct
