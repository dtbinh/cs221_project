p  f patelschneider and  r  sebastiani 2003 a new general method to generate random modal formulae for testing decision procedures volume 18 pages 351389

the recent emergence of heavilyoptimized modal decision    procedures has highlighted the key role of empirical testing in this    domain  unfortunately the introduction of extensive empirical tests    for modal logics is recent and so far none of the proposed test    generators is very satisfactory  to cope with this fact we present a    new random generation method that provides benefits over previous    methods for generating empirical tests  it fixes and much generalizes    one of the bestknown methods the random cnfm test allowing for    generating a much wider variety of problems covering in principle the    whole input space  our new method produces much more suitable test    sets for the current generation of modal decision procedures  we    analyze the features of the new method by means of an extensive    collection of empirical tests

independence  the study of what is relevant to a given    problem of reasoning  has received an increasing attention from the    ai community in this paper we consider two basic forms of    independence namely a syntactic one and a semantic one we show    features and drawbacks of them  in particular while the syntactic    form of independence is computationally easy to check there are cases    in which things that intuitively are not relevant are not recognized    as such  we also consider the problem of forgetting ie distilling    from a knowledge base only the part that is relevant to the set of    queries constructed from a subset of the alphabet while such process    is computationally hard it allows for a simplification of subsequent    reasoning and can thus be viewed as a form of compilation once the    relevant part of a knowledge base has been extracted all reasoning    tasks to be performed can be simplified
