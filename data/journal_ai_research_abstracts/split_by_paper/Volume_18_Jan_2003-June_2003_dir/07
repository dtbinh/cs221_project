d  e wilkins  t  j lee and  p  berry 2003 interactive execution monitoring of agent teams volume 18 pages 217261

there is an increasing need for automated support for humans    monitoring the activity of distributed teams of cooperating agents    both human and machine we characterize the domainindependent    challenges posed by this problem and describe how properties of    domains influence the challenges and their solutions we will    concentrate on dynamic datarich domains where humans are ultimately    responsible for team behavior thus the automated aid should    interactively support effective and timely decision making by the    human we present a domainindependent categorization of the types of    alerts a planbased monitoring system might issue to a user where    each type generally requires different monitoring techniques we    describe a monitoring framework for integrating many domainspecific    and taskspecific monitoring techniques and then using the concept of    value of an alert to avoid operator overload       we use this framework to describe an execution monitoring approach we    have used to implement execution assistants eas in two different    dynamic datarich realworld domains to assist a human in    monitoring team behavior one domain army small unit operations has    hundreds of mobile geographically distributed agents a combination    of humans robots and vehicles the other domain teams of unmanned    ground and air vehicles has a handful of cooperating robots both    domains involve unpredictable adversaries in the vicinity our    approach customizes monitoring behavior for each specific task plan    and situation as well as for user preferences our eas alert the    human controller when reported events threaten plan execution or    physically threaten team members alerts were generated in a timely    manner without inundating the user with too many alerts less than    10 percent of alerts are unwanted as judged by domain experts
