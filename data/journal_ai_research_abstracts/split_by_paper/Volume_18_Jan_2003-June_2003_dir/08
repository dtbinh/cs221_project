d  poole and  n  l zhang 2003 exploiting contextual independence in probabilistic inference volume 18 pages 263313

bayesian belief networks have grown to prominence because    they provide compact representations for many problems for which    probabilistic inference is appropriate and there are algorithms to    exploit this compactness the next step is to allow compact    representations of the conditional probabilities of a variable given    its parents in this paper we present such a representation that    exploits contextual independence in terms of parent contexts which    variables act as parents may depend on the value of other    variables the internal representation is in terms of contextual    factors confactors that is simply a pair of a context and a table    the algorithm contextual variable elimination is based on the    standard variable elimination algorithm that eliminates the nonquery    variables in turn but when eliminating a variable the tables that    need to be multiplied can depend on the context this algorithm    reduces to standard variable elimination when there is no contextual    independence structure to exploit we show how this can be much more    efficient than variable elimination when there is structure to    exploit we explain why this new method can exploit more structure    than previous methods for structured belief network inference and an    analogous algorithm that uses trees
