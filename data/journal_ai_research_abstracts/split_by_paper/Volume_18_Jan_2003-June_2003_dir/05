the proliferation of online information sources has led to an    increased use of wrappers for extracting data from web sources while    most of the previous research has focused on quick and efficient    generation of wrappers the development of tools for wrapper    maintenance has received less attention this is an important research    problem because web sources often change in ways that prevent the    wrappers from extracting data correctly  we present an efficient    algorithm that learns structural information about data from positive    examples alone we describe how this information can be used for two    wrapper maintenance applications wrapper verification and    reinduction the wrapper verification system detects when a wrapper is    not extracting correct data usually because the web source has    changed its format  the reinduction algorithm automatically recovers    from changes in the web source by identifying data on web pages so    that a new wrapper may be generated for this source  to validate our    approach we monitored 27 wrappers over a period of a year the    verification algorithm correctly discovered 35 of the 37 wrapper    changes and made 16 mistakes resulting in precision of 073 and    recall of 095 we validated the reinduction algorithm on ten web    sources we were able to successfully reinduce the wrappers obtaining    precision and recall values of 090 and 080 on the data    extraction task
