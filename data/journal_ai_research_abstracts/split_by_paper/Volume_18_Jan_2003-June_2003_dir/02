a  t cemgil and  b  kappen 2003 monte carlo methods for tempo tracking and rhythm quantization volume 18 pages 4581

we present a probabilistic generative model for timing    deviations in expressive music performance the structure of the    proposed model is equivalent to a switching state space model the    switch variables correspond to discrete note locations as in a musical    score the continuous hidden variables denote the tempo  we formulate    two well known music recognition problems namely tempo tracking and    automatic transcription rhythm quantization as filtering and maximum    a posteriori map state estimation tasks exact computation of    posterior features such as the map state is intractable in this model    class so we introduce monte carlo methods for integration and    optimization we compare markov chain monte carlo mcmc methods such    as gibbs sampling simulated annealing and iterative improvement and    sequential monte carlo methods particle filters our simulation    results suggest better results with sequential methods  the methods    can be applied in both online and batch scenarios such as tempo    tracking and transcription and are thus potentially useful in a number    of music applications such as adaptive automatic accompaniment score    typesetting and music information retrieval
