this paper focuses on a system wolfie word learning from    interpreted examples that acquires a semantic lexicon from a corpus    of sentences paired with semantic representations  the lexicon    learned consists of phrases paired with meaning representations    wolfie is part of an integrated system that learns to transform    sentences into representations such as logical database queries        experimental results are presented demonstrating wolfies ability to    learn useful lexicons for a database interface in four different    natural languages  the usefulness of the lexicons learned by wolfie    are compared to those acquired by a similar system with results    favorable to wolfie  a second set of experiments demonstrates    wolfies ability to scale to larger and more difficult albeit    artificially generated corpora           in natural language acquisition it is difficult to gather the    annotated data needed for supervised learning however unannotated    data is fairly plentiful  active learning methods attempt to select    for annotation and training only the most informative examples and    therefore are potentially very useful in natural language    applications  however most results to date for active learning have    only considered standard classification tasks  to reduce annotation    effort while maintaining accuracy we apply active learning to    semantic lexicons  we show that active learning can significantly    reduce the number of annotated examples required to achieve a given    level of performance
