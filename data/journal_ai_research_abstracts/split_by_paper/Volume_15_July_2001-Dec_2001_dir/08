this paper presents an algorithm for identifying nounphrase    antecedents of pronouns and adjectival anaphors in spanish    dialogues we believe that anaphora resolution requires numerous    sources of information in order to find the correct antecedent of the    anaphor these sources can be of different kinds eg linguistic    information discoursedialogue structure information or topic    information for this reason our algorithm uses various different    kinds of information hybrid information the algorithm is based on    linguistic constraints and preferences and uses an anaphoric    accessibility space within which the algorithm finds the noun    phrase we present some experiments related to this algorithm and this    space using a corpus of 204 dialogues the algorithm is implemented in    prolog according to this study 959 of antecedents were located in    the proposed space a precision of 813 was obtained for pronominal    anaphora resolution and 815 for adjectival anaphora
