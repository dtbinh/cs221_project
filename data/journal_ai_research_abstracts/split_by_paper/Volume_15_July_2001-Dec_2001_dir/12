c  meek 2001 finding a path is harder than finding a tree volume 15 pages 383389

i consider the problem of learning an optimal path graphical    model from data and show the problem to be nphard for the maximum    likelihood and minimum description length approaches and a bayesian    approach this hardness result holds despite the fact that the problem    is a restriction of the polynomially solvable problem of finding the    optimal tree graphical model
