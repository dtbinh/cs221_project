j  hong 2001 goal recognition through goal graph analysis volume 15 pages 130

we present a novel approach to goal recognition based on a    twostage paradigm of graph construction and analysis first a graph    structure called a goal graph is constructed to represent the observed    actions the state of the world and the achieved goals as well as    various connections between these nodes at consecutive time    steps then the goal graph is analysed at each time step to recognise    those partially or fully achieved goals that are consistent with the    actions observed so far the goal graph analysis also reveals valid    plans for the recognised goals or part of these goals        our approach to goal recognition does not need a plan library  it    does not suffer from the problems in the acquisition and handcoding    of large plan libraries neither does it have the problems in    searching the plan space of exponential size we describe two    algorithms for goal graph construction and analysis in this    paradigm these algorithms are both provably sound polynomialtime    and polynomialspace the number of goals recognised by our algorithms    is usually very small after a sequence of observed actions has been    processed thus the sequence of observed actions is well explained by    the recognised goals with little ambiguity we have evaluated these    algorithms in the unix domain in which excellent performance has been    achieved in terms of accuracy efficiency and scalability
