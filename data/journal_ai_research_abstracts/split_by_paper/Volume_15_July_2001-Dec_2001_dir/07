domainindependent planning is a hard combinatorial    problem taking into account plan quality makes the task even more    difficult this article introduces planning by rewriting pbr a new    paradigm for efficient highquality domainindependent planning pbr    exploits declarative planrewriting rules and efficient local search    techniques to transform an easytogenerate but possibly suboptimal    initial plan into a highquality plan in addition to addressing the    issues of planning efficiency and plan quality this framework offers    a new anytime planning algorithm we have implemented this planner and    applied it to several existing domains the experimental results show    that the pbr approach provides significant savings in planning effort    while generating highquality plans
