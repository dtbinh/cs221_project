j  renz and  b  nebel 2001 efficient methods for qualitative spatial reasoning volume 15 pages 289318

the theoretical properties of qualitative spatial reasoning    in the rcc8 framework have been analyzed extensively however no    empirical investigation has been made yet our experiments show that    the adaption of the algorithms used for qualitative temporal reasoning    can solve large rcc8 instances even if they are in the phase    transition region  provided that one uses the maximal tractable    subsets of rcc8 that have been identified by us in particular we    demonstrate that the orthogonal combination of heuristic methods is    successful in solving almost all apparently hard instances in the    phase transition region up to a certain size in reasonable time
