this paper presents grt a domainindependent heuristic    planning system for strips worlds grt solves problems in two    phases in the preprocessing phase it estimates the distance between    each fact and the goals of the problem in a backward direction then    in the search phase these estimates are used in order to further    estimate the distance between each intermediate state and the goals    guiding so the search process in a forward direction and on a    bestfirst basis the paper presents the benefits from the adoption of    opposite directions between the preprocessing and the search phases    discusses some difficulties that arise in the preprocessing phase and    introduces techniques to cope with them moreover it presents several    methods of improving the efficiency of the heuristic by enriching the    representation and by reducing the size of the problem finally a    method of overcoming local optimal states based on domain axioms is    proposed according to it difficult problems are decomposed into    easier subproblems that have to be solved sequentially the    performance results from various domains including those of the    recent planning competitions show that grt is among the fastest    planners
