j  m siskind 2001 grounding the lexical semantics of verbs in visual perception using force dynamics and event logic volume 15 pages 3190

this paper presents an implemented system for recognizing    the occurrence of events described by simple spatialmotion verbs in    short image sequences the semantics of these verbs is specified with    eventlogic expressions that describe changes in the state of    forcedynamic relations between the participants of the event  an    efficient finite representation is introduced for the infinite sets of    intervals that occur when describing liquid and semiliquid events    additionally an efficient procedure using this representation is    presented for inferring occurrences of compound events described with    eventlogic expressions from occurrences of primitive events  using    force dynamics and event logic to specify the lexical semantics of    events allows the system to be more robust than prior systems based on    motion profile
