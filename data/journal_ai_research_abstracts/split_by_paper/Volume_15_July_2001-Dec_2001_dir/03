c  bhattacharyya and  s  s keerthi 2001 mean field methods for a special class of belief networks volume 15 pages 91114

the chief aim of this paper is to propose meanfield    approximations for a broad class of belief networks of which sigmoid    and noisyor networks can be seen as special cases  the     approximations are based on a powerful meanfield theory suggested by    plefka  we show that saul jaakkola and jordan s approach is the    first order approximation in plefkas approach via a variational    derivation  the application of plefkas theory to belief networks is    not computationally tractable  to tackle this problem we propose new    approximations based on taylor series  small scale experiments show    that the proposed schemes are attractive
