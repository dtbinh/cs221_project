visual thinking plays an important role in scientific    reasoning  based on the research in automating diverse reasoning    tasks about dynamical systems nonlinear controllers kinematic    mechanisms and fluid motion we have identified a style of visual    thinking imagistic reasoning  imagistic reasoning organizes    computations around imagelike analogue representations so that    perceptual and symbolic operations can be brought to bear to infer    structure and behavior  programs incorporating imagistic reasoning    have been shown to perform at an expert level in domains that defy    current analytic or numerical methods        we have developed a computational paradigm spatial aggregation to    unify the description of a class of imagistic problem solvers  a    program written in this paradigm has the following properties  it    takes a continuous field and optional objective functions as input    and produces highlevel descriptions of structure behavior or    control actions it computes a multilayer of intermediate    representations called spatial aggregates by forming equivalence    classes and adjacency relations  it employs a small set of generic    operators such as aggregation classification and localization to    perform bidirectional mapping between the informationrich field and    successively more abstract spatial aggregates it uses a data    structure the neighborhood graph as a common interface to modularize    computations  to illustrate our theory we describe the computational    structure of three implemented problem solvers  kam maps and    hipair  in terms of the spatial aggregation generic operators by    mixing and matching a library of commonly used routines
