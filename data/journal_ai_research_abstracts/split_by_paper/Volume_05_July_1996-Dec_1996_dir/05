j  r quinlan 1996 learning firstorder definitions of functions volume 5 pages 139161

firstorder learning involves finding a clauseform    definition of a relation from examples of the relation and relevant    background information  in this paper a particular firstorder    learning system is modified to customize it for finding definitions of    functional relations  this restriction leads to faster learning times    and in some cases to definitions that have higher predictive    accuracy  other firstorder learning systems might benefit from    similar specialization
