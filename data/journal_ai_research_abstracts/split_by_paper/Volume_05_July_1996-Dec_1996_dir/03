d  j litman 1996 cue phrase classification using machine learning volume 5 pages 5394

cue phrases may be used in a discourse sense to explicitly    signal discourse structure but also in a sentential sense to convey    semantic rather than structural information  correctly classifying    cue phrases as discourse or sentential is critical in natural language    processing systems that exploit discourse structure eg for    performing tasks such as anaphora resolution and plan recognition    this paper explores the use of machine learning for classifying cue    phrases as discourse or sentential  two machine learning programs    cgrendel and c45 are used to induce classification models from sets    of preclassified cue phrases and their features in text and speech    machine learning is shown to be an effective technique for not only    automating the generation of classification models but also for    improving upon previous results  when compared to manually derived    classification models already in the literature the learned models    often perform with higher accuracy and contain new linguistic insights    into the data  in addition the ability to automatically construct    classification models makes it easier to comparatively analyze the    utility of alternative feature representations of the data  finally    the ease of retraining makes the learning approach more scalable and    flexible than manual methods
