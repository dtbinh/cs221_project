r  a helzerman and  m  p harper 1996 muse csp an extension to the constraint satisfaction problem volume 5 pages 239288

this paper describes an extension to the constraint    satisfaction problem csp called muse csp multiply segmented    constraint satisfaction problem  this extension is especially useful    for those problems which segment into multiple sets of partially    shared variables  such problems arise naturally in signal processing    applications including computer vision speech processing and    handwriting recognition  for these applications it is often    difficult to segment the data in only one way given the lowlevel    information utilized by the segmentation algorithms  muse csp can be    used to compactly represent several similar instances of the    constraint satisfaction problem  if multiple instances of a csp have    some common variables which have the same domains and constraints    then they can be combined into a single instance of a muse csp    reducing the work required to apply the constraints  we introduce the    concepts of muse node consistency muse arc consistency and muse path    consistency we then demonstrate how muse csp can be used to compactly    represent lexically ambiguous sentences and the multiple sentence    hypotheses that are often generated by speech recognition algorithms    so that grammar constraints can be used to provide parses for all    syntactically correct sentences  algorithms for muse arc and path    consistency are provided  finally we discuss how to create a muse    csp from a set of csps which are labeled to indicate when the same    variable is shared by more than a single csp
