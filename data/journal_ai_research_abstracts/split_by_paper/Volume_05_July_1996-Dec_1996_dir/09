n  l zhang and  d  poole 1996 exploiting causal independence in bayesian network inference volume 5 pages 301328

a new method is proposed for exploiting causal    independencies in exact bayesian network inference  a bayesian    network can be viewed as representing a factorization of a joint    probability into the multiplication of a set of conditional    probabilities  we present a notion of causal independence that    enables one to further factorize the conditional probabilities into a    combination of even smaller factors and consequently obtain a    finergrain factorization of the joint probability  the new    formulation of causal independence lets us specify the conditional    probability of a variable given its parents in terms of an associative    and commutative operator such as or sum or max on the    contribution of each parent  we start with a simple algorithm ve for    bayesian network inference that given evidence and a query variable    uses the factorization to find the posterior distribution of the    query we show how this algorithm can be extended to exploit causal    independence empirical studies based on the cpcs networks for    medical diagnosis show that this method is more efficient than    previous methods and allows for inference in larger networks than    previous algorithms
