g  zlotkin and  j  s rosenschein 1996 mechanisms for automated negotiation in state oriented domains volume 5 pages 163238

this paper lays part of the groundwork for a domain theory of    negotiation that is a way of classifying interactions so that it is    clear given a domain which negotiation mechanisms and strategies are    appropriate  we define state oriented domains a general category of    interaction  necessary and sufficient conditions for cooperation are    outlined  we use the notion of worth in an altered definition of    utility thus enabling agreements in a wider class of jointgoal    reachable situations an approach is offered for conflict resolution    and it is shown that even in a conflict situation partial cooperative    steps can be taken by interacting agents that is agents in    fundamental conflict might still agree to cooperate up to a certain    point     a unified negotiation protocol unp is developed that can be used in    all types of encounters it is shown that in certain borderline    cooperative situations a partial cooperative agreement ie one    that does not achieve all agents goals might be preferred by all    agents even though there exists a rational agreement that would    achieve all their goals     finally we analyze cases where agents have incomplete information on    the goals and worth of other agents first we consider the case where    agents goals are private information and we analyze what goal    declaration strategies the agents might adopt to increase their    utility  then we consider the situation where the agents goals and    therefore standalone costs are common knowledge but the worth they    attach to their goals is private information  we introduce two    mechanisms one strict the other tolerant and analyze their    affects on the stability and efficiency of negotiation outcomes
