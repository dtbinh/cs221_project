l  m de campos 1996 characterizations of decomposable dependency models volume 5 pages 289300

decomposable dependency models possess a number of    interesting and useful properties this paper presents new    characterizations of decomposable models in terms of independence    relationships which are obtained by adding a single axiom to the    wellknown set characterizing dependency models that are isomorphic to    undirected graphs we also briefly discuss a potential application of    our results to the problem of learning graphical models from data
