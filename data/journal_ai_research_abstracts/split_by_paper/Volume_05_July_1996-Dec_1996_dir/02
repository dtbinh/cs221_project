r  beneliyahu 1996 a hierarchy of tractable subsets for computing stable models volume 5 pages 2752

finding the stable models of a knowledge base is a    significant computational problem in artificial intelligence this    task is at the computational heart of truth maintenance systems    autoepistemic logic and default logic  unfortunately it is nphard    in this paper we present a hierarchy of classes of knowledge bases    omega1omega2 with the following properties first omega1 is    the class of all stratified knowledge bases second if a knowledge    base pi is in omegak then pi has at most k stable models and all of    them may be found in time olnk where l is the length of the    knowledge base and n the number of atoms in pi third for an    arbitrary knowledge base pi we can find the minimum k such that pi    belongs to omegak in time polynomial in the size of pi and last    where k is the class of all knowledge bases it is the case that    unioni1 to infty omegai  k that is every knowledge base    belongs to some class in the hierarchy
