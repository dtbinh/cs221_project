m  j streeter and s  f smith 2006 how the landscape of random job shop scheduling instances depends on the ratio of jobs to machines volume 26 pages 247287

we characterize the search landscape of random instances of the job shop scheduling problem jsp  specifically we investigate how the expected values of 1 backbone size 2 distance between nearoptimal schedules and 3 makespan of random schedules vary as a function of the job to machine ratio nm  for the limiting cases nm approaches 0 and nm approaches infinity we provide analytical results while for intermediate values of nm we perform experiments  we prove that as nm approaches 0 backbone size approaches 100 while as nm approaches infinity the backbone vanishes  in the process we show that as nm approaches 0 resp nm approaches infinity simple priority rules almost surely generate an optimal schedule providing theoretical evidence of an easyhardeasy pattern of typicalcase instance difficulty in job shop scheduling  we also draw connections between our theoretical results and the big valley picture of jsp landscapes
