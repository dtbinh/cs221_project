as partial justification of their framework for iterated belief revision darwiche and pearl convincingly argued against boutiliers natural revision and provided a prototypical revision operator that fits into their scheme  we show that the darwichepearl arguments lead naturally to the acceptance of a smaller class of operators which we refer to as admissible admissible revision ensures that the penultimate input is not ignored completely thereby eliminating natural revision but includes the darwichepearl operator nayaks lexicographic revision operator and a newly introduced operator called restrained revision we demonstrate that restrained revision is the most conservative of admissible revision operators  effecting as few changes as possible while lexicographic revision is the least conservative and point out that restrained revision can also be viewed as a composite operator consisting of natural revision preceded by an application of a backwards revision operator previously studied by papini finally we propose the establishment of a principled approach for choosing an appropriate revision operator in different contexts and discuss future work
