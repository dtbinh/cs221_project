fast downward is a classical planning system based on heuristic search it can deal with general deterministic planning problems encoded in the propositional fragment of pddl22 including advanced features like adl conditions and effects and derived predicates axioms like other wellknown planners such as hsp and ff fast downward is a progression planner searching the space of world states of a planning task in the forward direction however unlike other pddl planning systems fast downward does not use the propositional pddl representation of a planning task directly instead the input is first translated into an alternative representation called multivalued planning tasks which makes many of the implicit constraints of a propositional planning task explicit exploiting this alternative representation fast downward uses hierarchical decompositions of planning tasks for computing its heuristic function called the causal graph heuristic which is very different from traditional hsplike heuristics based on ignoring negative interactions of operators
