code optimization and high level synthesis can be posed as constraint satisfaction and optimization problems  such as graph coloring used in register allocation  graph coloring is also used to model more traditional csps relevant to ai such as planning timetabling and scheduling  provably optimal solutions may be desirable for commercial and defense applications additionally for applications such as register allocation and code optimization naturallyoccurring instances    of graph coloring are often small and can be solved optimally a recent  wave of improvements in algorithms for boolean satisfiability sat and 01 integer linear programming ilp suggests generic problemreduction  methods rather than problemspecific heuristics because 1 heuristics may be upset by new constraints 2 heuristics tend to ignore structure and 3 many relevant problems are provably inapproximable
