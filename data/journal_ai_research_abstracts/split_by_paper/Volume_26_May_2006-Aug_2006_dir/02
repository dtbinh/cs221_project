d  bryce s  kambhampati and d  e smith 2006 planning graph heuristics for belief space search volume 26 pages 3599

some recent works in conditional planning have proposed reachability heuristics to improve planner scalability but many lack a formal description of the properties of their distance estimates to place previous work in context and extend work on heuristics for conditional planning we provide a formal basis for distance estimates between belief states  we give a definition for the distance between belief states that relies on aggregating underlying state distance measures  we give several techniques to aggregate state distances and their associated properties  many existing heuristics exhibit a subset of the properties but in order to provide a standardized comparison we present several generalizations of planning graph heuristics that are used in a single planner  we compliment our belief state distance estimate framework by also investigating efficient planning graph data structures that incorporate bdds to compute the most effective heuristics

we developed two planners to serve as testbeds for our investigation  the first caltalt is a conformant regression planner that uses a search  the second pond is a conditional progression planner that uses ao search we show the relative effectiveness of our heuristic techniques within these planners we also compare the performance of these planners with several state of the art approaches in conditional planning
