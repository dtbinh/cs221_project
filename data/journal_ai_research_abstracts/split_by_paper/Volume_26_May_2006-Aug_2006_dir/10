in this paper we present the partitioning of mutualexclusion mutex constraints in temporal planning problems and its implementation in the sgplan4 planner based on the strong locality of mutex constraints observed in many benchmarks of the fourth international planning competition ipc4 we propose to partition the constraints of a planning problem into groups based on their subgoals constraint partitioning leads to significantly easier subproblems that are similar to the original problem and that can be efficiently solved by the same planner with some modifications to its objective function we present a partitionandresolve strategy that looks for locally optimal subplans in constraintpartitioned temporal planning subproblems and that resolves those inconsistent global constraints across the subproblems we also discuss some implementation details of sgplan4 which include the resolution of violated global constraints techniques for handling producible resources landmark analysis path finding and optimization searchspace reduction and modifications of metricff when used as a basic planner in sgplan4  last we show results on the sensitivity of each of these techniques in qualitytime tradeoffs and experimentally demonstrate that sgplan4 is effective for solving the ipc3 and ipc4 benchmarks
