in a field of research about general reasoning mechanisms it is essential to have appropriate benchmarks ideally the benchmarks should reflect possible applications of the developed technology in ai planning researchers more and more tend to draw their testing examples from the benchmark collections used in the international planning competition ipc in the organization of the deterministic part of the fourth ipc  ipc4 the authors therefore invested significant effort to create a useful set of benchmarks they come from five different potential realworld applications of planning airport ground traffic control oil derivative transportation in pipeline networks modelchecking safety properties power supply restoration and umts call setup adapting and preparing such an application for use as a benchmark in the ipc involves at the time inevitable often drastic simplifications as well as careful choice between and engineering of domain encodings for the first time in the ipc we used compilations to formulate complex domain features in simple languages such as strips rather than just dropping the more interesting problem constraints in the simpler language subsets the article explains and discusses the five application domains and their adaptation to form the pddl test suites used in ipc4 we summarize known theoretical results on structural properties of the domains regarding their computational complexity and provable properties of their topology under the h function an idealized version of the relaxed plan heuristic we present new empirical results illuminating properties such as the quality of the most widespread heuristic functions planning graph serial planning graph and relaxed plan the growth of propositional representations over instance size and the number of actions available to achieve each fact we discuss these data in conjunction with the best results achieved by the different kinds of planners participating in ipc4
