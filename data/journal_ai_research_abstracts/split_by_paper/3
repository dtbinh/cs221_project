the constraint satisfaction problem csp is a general problem central to computer science and artificial intelligence  although the csp is nphard in general considerable effort has been spent on identifying tractable subclasses  the main two approaches consider structural properties restrictions on the hypergraph of constraint scopes and relational properties restrictions on the language of constraint relations  recently some authors have considered hybrid properties that restrict the constraint hypergraph and the relations simultaneously

we present a new algorithm for exactly solving decision making problems represented as influence diagrams we do not require the usual assumptions of no forgetting and regularity this allows us to solve problems with simultaneous decisions and limited information the algorithm is empirically shown to outperform a stateoftheart algorithm on randomly generated problems of up to 150 variables and 1064 solutions we show that these problems are nphard even if the underlying graph structure of the problem has low treewidth and the variables take on a bounded number of  states and that they admit no provably good approximation if variables can take on an arbitrary number of states







some recent works in conditional planning have proposed reachability heuristics to improve planner scalability but many lack a formal description of the properties of their distance estimates to place previous work in context and extend work on heuristics for conditional planning we provide a formal basis for distance estimates between belief states  we give a definition for the distance between belief states that relies on aggregating underlying state distance measures  we give several techniques to aggregate state distances and their associated properties  many existing heuristics exhibit a subset of the properties but in order to provide a standardized comparison we present several generalizations of planning graph heuristics that are used in a single planner  we compliment our belief state distance estimate framework by also investigating efficient planning graph data structures that incorporate bdds to compute the most effective heuristics

we developed two planners to serve as testbeds for our investigation  the first caltalt is a conformant regression planner that uses a search  the second pond is a conditional progression planner that uses ao search we show the relative effectiveness of our heuristic techniques within these planners we also compare the performance of these planners with several state of the art approaches in conditional planning
