p  gorniak and  d  roy 2004 grounded semantic composition for visual scenes volume 21 pages 429470

we present a visuallygrounded language understanding model based on a study of how people verbally describe objects in scenes the emphasis of the model is on the combination of individual word meanings to produce meanings for complex referring expressions the model has been implemented and it is able to understand a broad range of spatial referring expressions we describe our implementation of word level visuallygrounded semantics and their embedding in a compositional parsing framework the implemented system selects the correct referents in response to natural language expressions for a large percentage of test cases in an analysis of the systems successes and failures we reveal how visual context influences the semantics of utterances and propose future extensions to the model that take such context into account
