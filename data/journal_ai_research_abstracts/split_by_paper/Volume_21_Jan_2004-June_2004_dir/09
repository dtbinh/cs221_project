abstract we introduce an abductive method for a coherent integration of independent datasources the idea is to compute a list of datafacts that should be inserted to the amalgamated database or retracted from it in order to restore its consistency this method is implemented by an abductive solver called asystem that applies sldnfaresolution on a metatheory that relates different possibly contradicting input databases we also give a pure modeltheoretic analysis of the possible ways to recover consistent data from an inconsistent database in terms of those models of the database that exhibit as minimal inconsistent information as reasonably possible this allows us to characterize the recovered databases in terms of the preferred ie most consistent models of the theory the outcome is an abductivebased application that is sound and complete with respect to a corresponding modelbased preferential semantics and  to the best of our knowledge  is more expressive thus more general than any other implementation of coherent integration of databases
