w  zhang 2004 phase transitions and backbones of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem volume 21 pages 471497

in recent years there has been much interest in phase transitions of combinatorial problems  phase transitions have been successfully used to analyze combinatorial optimization problems characterize their typicalcase features and locate the hardest problem instances  in this paper we study phase transitions of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem atsp an nphard combinatorial optimization problem that has many realworld applications  using random instances of up to 1500 cities in which intercity distances are uniformly distributed we empirically show that many properties of the problem including the optimal tour cost and backbone size experience sharp transitions as the precision of intercity distances increases across a critical value  our experimental results on the costs of the atsp tours and assignment problem agree with the theoretical result that the asymptotic cost of assignment problem is pi 2 6 the number of cities goes to infinity  in addition we show that the average computational cost of the wellknown branchandbound subtour elimination algorithm for the problem also exhibits a thrashing behavior transitioning from easy to difficult as the distance precision increases  these results answer positively an open question regarding the existence of phase transitions in the atsp and provide guidance on how difficult atsp problem instances should be generated
