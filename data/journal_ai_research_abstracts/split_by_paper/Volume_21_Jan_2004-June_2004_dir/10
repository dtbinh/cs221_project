we  propose  a  formalism  for  representation  of  finite  languages referred to  as the class of idlexpressions  which combines concepts that were  only considered in  isolation in existing  formalisms  the suggested  applications  are  in  natural  language  processing  more specifically  in surface  natural language  generation and  in machine translation where a sentence is  obtained by first generating a large set of candidate sentences represented  in a compact way and then by filtering  such a  set  through  a parser   we  study several  formal properties of idlexpressions and compare this new formalism with more standard  ones   we  also  present  a  novel  parsing  algorithm  for idlexpressions  and  prove a  nontrivial  upper  bound  on its  time complexity
