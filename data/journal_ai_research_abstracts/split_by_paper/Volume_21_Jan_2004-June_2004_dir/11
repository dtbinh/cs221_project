j  y halpern and  d  koller 2004 representation dependence in probabilistic inference volume 21 pages 319356

nondeductive reasoning systems are often representation dependent representing the same situation in two different ways may cause such a system to return two different answers  some have viewed this as a significant problem  for example the principle of maximum entropyhas been subjected to much criticism due to its representation dependence there has however been almost no work investigating representation dependence  in this paper we formalize this notion and show that it is not a problem specific to maximum entropy  in fact we show that any representationindependent probabilistic inference procedure that ignores irrelevant information is essentially entailment in a precise sense  moreover we show that representation independence is incompatible with even a weak default assumption of independence  we then show that invariance under a restricted class of representation changes can form a reasonable compromise between representation independence and other desiderata and provide a construction of a family of inference procedures that provides such restricted representation independence using relative entropy
