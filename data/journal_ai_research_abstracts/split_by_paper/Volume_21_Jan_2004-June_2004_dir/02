the 2002 trading agent competition tac presented a challenging market game in the domain of travel shopping  one of the pivotal issues in this domain is uncertainty about hotel prices which have a significant influence on the relative cost of alternative trip schedules  thus virtually all participants employ some method for predicting hotel prices  we survey approaches employed in the tournament finding that agents apply an interesting diversity of techniques taking into account differing sources of evidence bearing on prices  based on data provided by entrants on their agents actual predictions in the tac02 finals and semifinals we analyze the relative efficacy of these approaches  the results show that taking into account gamespecific information about flight prices is a major distinguishing factor  machine learning methods effectively induce the relationship between flight and hotel prices from game data and a purely analytical approach based on competitive equilibrium analysis achieves equal accuracy with no historical data  employing a new measure of prediction quality we relate absolute accuracy to bottomline performance in the game
