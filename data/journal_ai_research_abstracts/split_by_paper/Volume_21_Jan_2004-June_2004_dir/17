p  liberatore 2004 on polynomial sized mdp succinct policies volume 21 pages 551577

policies of markov decision processes mdps determine the next action to execute from the current state and possibly the history the past states when the number of states is large succinct representations are often used to compactly represent both the mdps and the policies in a reduced amount of space in this paper some problems related to the size of succinctly represented policies are analyzed namely it is shown that some mdps have policies that can only be represented in space superpolynomial in the size of the mdp unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses this fact motivates the study of the problem of deciding whether a given mdp has a policy of a given size and reward since some algorithms for mdps work by finding a succinct representation of the value function the problem of deciding the existence of a succinct representation of a value function of a given size and reward is also considered
