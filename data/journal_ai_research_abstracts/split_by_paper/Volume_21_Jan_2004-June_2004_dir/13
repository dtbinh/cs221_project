searching for and making decisions about information is becoming increasingly difficult as the amount of information and number of choices increases  recommendation systems help users find items of interest of a particular type such as movies or restaurants but are still somewhat awkward to use  our solution is to take advantage of the complementary strengths of personalized recommendation systems and dialogue systems creating personalized aides  we present a  system  the adaptive place advisor  that treats item selection as an interactive conversational process with the program inquiring about item attributes and the user responding  individual longterm user preferences are unobtrusively obtained in the course of normal recommendation dialogues and used to direct future conversations with the same user  we present a novel user model that influences both item search and the questions asked during a conversation  we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in significantly reducing the time and number of interactions required to find a satisfactory item as compared to a control group of users interacting with a nonadaptive version of the system
