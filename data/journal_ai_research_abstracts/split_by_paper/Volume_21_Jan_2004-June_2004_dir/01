n  l zhang and  t  kocka 2004 effective dimensions of hierarchical latent class models volume 21 pages 117

hierarchical latent class hlc models are treestructured bayesian networks where leaf nodes are observed while internal nodes are latent  there are no theoretically well justified model selection criteria for hlc models in particular and bayesian networks with latent nodes in general nonetheless empirical studies suggest that the bic score is a reasonable criterion to use in practice for learning hlc models  empirical studies also suggest that sometimes model selection can be improved if standard model dimension is replaced  with effective model dimension in the penalty term of the bic score  effective dimensions are difficult to compute in this paper we prove a theorem that relates the effective dimension of an hlc model to the effective dimensions of a number of latent class models  the theorem makes it computationally feasible to compute the effective dimensions of large hlc models  the theorem can also be used to compute the effective dimensions of general tree models
