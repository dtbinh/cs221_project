we address the problem of finding the shortest path between two points in an unknown real physical environment where a traveling agent must move around in the environment to explore unknown territory  we introduce the physicala algorithm pha for solving this problem pha expands all the mandatory nodes that a would expand and returns the shortest path between the two points  however due to the physical nature of the problem the complexity of the algorithm is measured by the traveling effort of the moving agent and not by the number of generated nodes as in standard a  pha is presented as a twolevel algorithm such that its high level a chooses the next node to be expanded and its low level directs the agent to that node in order to explore it  we present a number of variations for both the highlevel and lowlevel procedures and evaluate their performance theoretically and experimentally  we show that the travel cost of our best variation is fairly close to the optimal travel cost assuming that the mandatory nodes of a are known in advance  we then generalize our algorithm to the multiagent case where a number of cooperative agents are designed to solve the problem  specifically we provide an experimental implementation for such a system  it should be noted that the problem addressed here is not a navigation problem but rather a problem of finding the shortest path between two points for future usage
