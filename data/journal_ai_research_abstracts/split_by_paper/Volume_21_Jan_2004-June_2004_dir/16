j  keppens and  q  shen 2004 compositional model repositories via dynamic constraint satisfaction with orderofmagnitude preferences volume 21 pages 499550

the predominant knowledgebased approach to automated model construction compositional modelling employs a set of models of particular functional components  its inference mechanism takes a scenario describing the constituent interacting components of a system and translates it into a useful mathematical model  this paper presents a novel compositional modelling approach aimed at building model repositories  it furthers the field in two respects  firstly it expands the application domain of compositional modelling to systems that can not be easily described in terms of interacting functional components such as ecological systems  secondly it enables the incorporation of user preferences into the model selection process  these features are achieved by casting the compositional modelling problem as an activitybased dynamic preference constraint satisfaction problem where the dynamic constraints describe the restrictions imposed over the composition of partial models and the preferences correspond to those of the user of the automated modeller in addition the preference levels are represented through the use of symbolic values that differ in orders of magnitude
