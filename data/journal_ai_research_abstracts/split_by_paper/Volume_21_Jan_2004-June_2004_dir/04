k  o stanley and  r  miikkulainen 2004 competitive coevolution through evolutionary complexification volume 21 pages 63100

two major goals in machine learning are the discovery and improvement of solutions to complex problems  in this paper we argue that complexification ie the incremental elaboration of solutions through adding new structure achieves both these goals  we demonstrate the power of complexification through the neuroevolution of augmenting topologies neat method which evolves increasingly complex neural network architectures  neat is applied to an openended coevolutionary robot duel domain where robot controllers compete head to head  because the robot duel domain supports a wide range of strategies and because coevolution benefits from an escalating arms race it serves as a suitable testbed for studying complexification  when compared to the evolution of networks with fixed structure complexifying evolution discovers significantly more sophisticated strategies  the results suggest that in order to discover and improve complex solutions evolution and search in general should be allowed to complexify as well as optimize
