multiagent systems mas promise to offer solutions to    problems where established older paradigms fall short in order to    validate such claims that are repeatedly made in software agent    publications empirical indepth studies of advantages and weaknesses    of multiagent solutions versus conventional ones in practical    applications are needed climate control in large buildings is one    application area where multiagent systems and marketoriented    programming in particular have been reported to be very successful    although central control solutions are still the standard practice    we have therefore constructed and implemented a variety of market    designs for this problem as well as different standard control    engineering solutions this article gives a detailed analysis and    comparison so as to learn about differences between standard versus    agent approaches and yielding new insights about benefits and    limitations of computational markets an important outcome is that    local information plus market communication produces global    control
