planning under uncertainty is a central problem in the study of    automated sequential decision making and has been addressed by    researchers in many different fields including ai planning decision    analysis operations research control theory and economics  while    the assumptions and perspectives adopted in these areas often differ    in substantial ways many planning problems of interest to researchers    in these fields can be modeled as markov decision processes mdps    and analyzed using the techniques of decision theory       this paper presents an overview and synthesis of mdprelated methods    showing how they provide a unifying framework for modeling many    classes of planning problems studied in ai it also describes    structural properties of mdps that when exhibited by particular    classes of problems can be exploited in the construction of optimal    or approximately optimal policies or plans  planning problems    commonly possess structure in the reward and value functions used to    describe performance criteria in the functions used to describe state    transitions and observations and in the relationships among features    used to describe states actions rewards and observations       specialized representations and algorithms employing these    representations can achieve computational leverage by exploiting    these various forms of structure  certain ai techniques  in    particular those based on the use of structured intensional    representations  can be viewed in this way  this paper surveys    several types of representations for both classical and    decisiontheoretic planning problems and planning algorithms that    exploit these representations in a number of different ways to ease    the computational burden of constructing policies or plans  it focuses    primarily on abstraction aggregation and decomposition techniques    based on aistyle representations
