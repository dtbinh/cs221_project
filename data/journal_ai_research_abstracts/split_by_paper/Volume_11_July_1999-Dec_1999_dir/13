localization that is the estimation of a robots location    from sensor data is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics  this    papers presents a version of markov localization which provides    accurate position estimates and which is tailored towards dynamic    environments the key idea of markov localization is to maintain a    probability density over the space of all locations of a robot in its    environment our approach represents this space metrically using a    finegrained grid to approximate densities  it is able to globally    localize the robot from scratch and to recover from localization    failures  it is robust to approximate models of the environment such    as occupancy grid maps and noisy sensors such as ultrasound    sensors  our approach also includes a filtering technique which    allows a mobile robot to reliably estimate its position even in    densely populated environments in which crowds of people block the    robots sensors for extended periods of time  the method described    here has been implemented and tested in several realworld    applications of mobile robots including the deployments of two mobile    robots as interactive museum tourguides
