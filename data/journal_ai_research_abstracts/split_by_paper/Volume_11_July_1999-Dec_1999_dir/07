r  rosati 1999 reasoning about minimal belief and negation as failure volume 11 pages 277300

we investigate the problem of reasoning in the propositional    fragment of mbnf the logic of minimal belief and negation as failure    introduced by lifschitz which can be considered as a unifying    framework for several nonmonotonic formalisms including default    logic autoepistemic logic circumscription epistemic queries and    logic programming  we characterize the complexity and provide    algorithms for reasoning in propositional mbnf  in particular we    show that entailment in propositional mbnf lies at the third level of    the polynomial hierarchy hence it is harder than reasoning in all the    above mentioned propositional formalisms for nonmonotonic reasoning    we also prove the exact correspondence between negation as failure in    mbnf and negative introspection in moores autoepistemic logic
