there are two distinct approaches to solving reinforcement    learning problems namely searching in value function space and    searching in policy space  temporal difference methods and    evolutionary algorithms are wellknown examples of these approaches    kaelbling littman and moore recently provided an informative survey    of temporal difference methods  this article focuses on the    application of evolutionary algorithms to the reinforcement learning    problem emphasizing alternative policy representations credit    assignment methods and problemspecific genetic operators  strengths    and weaknesses of the evolutionary approach to reinforcement learning    are presented along with a survey of representative applications
