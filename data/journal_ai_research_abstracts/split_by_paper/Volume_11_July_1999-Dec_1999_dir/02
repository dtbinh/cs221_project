p  resnik 1999 semantic similarity in a taxonomy an informationbased measure and its application to problems of ambiguity in natural language volume 11 pages 95130

this article presents a measure of semantic similarity in an    isa taxonomy based on the notion of shared information content    experimental evaluation against a benchmark set of human similarity    judgments demonstrates that the measure performs better than the    traditional edgecounting approach  the article presents algorithms    that take advantage of taxonomic similarity in resolving syntactic and    semantic ambiguity along with experimental results demonstrating    their effectiveness
