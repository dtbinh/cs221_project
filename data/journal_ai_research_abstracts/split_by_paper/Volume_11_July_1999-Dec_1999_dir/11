in the recent literature of artificial intelligence an    intensive research effort has been spent for various algebras of    qualitative relations used in the representation of temporal and    spatial knowledge on the problem of classifying the computational    complexity of reasoning problems for subsets of algebras  the main    purpose of these researches is to describe a restricted set of maximal    tractable subalgebras ideally in an exhaustive fashion with respect    to the hosting algebras      in this paper we introduce a novel algebra for reasoning about spatial    congruence show that the satisfiability problem in the spatial    algebra mc4 is npcomplete and present a complete classification of    tractability in the algebra based on the individuation of three    maximal tractable subclasses one containing the basic relations  the    three algebras are formed by 14 10 and 9 relations out of 16 which    form the full algebra
