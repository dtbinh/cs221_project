functional relationships between objects called    attributes are of considerable importance in knowledge    representation languages including description logics dls a study    of the literature indicates that papers have made often implicitly    different assumptions about the nature of attributes whether they are    always required to have a value or whether they can be partial    functions the work presented here is the first explicit study of this    difference for subclasses of the classic dl involving the sameas    concept constructor  it is shown that although determining    subsumption between concept descriptions has the same complexity    though requiring different algorithms the story is different in the    case of determining the least common subsumer lcs for attributes    interpreted as partial functions the lcs exists and can be computed    relatively easily even in this case our results correct and extend    three previous papers about the lcs of dls  in the case where    attributes must have a value the lcs may not exist and even if it    exists it may be of exponential size  interestingly it is possible    to decide in polynomial time if the lcs exists
