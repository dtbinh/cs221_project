the growing need to manage and exploit the proliferation of    online data sources is opening up new opportunities for bringing    people closer to the resources they need  for instance consider a    recommendation service through which researchers can receive daily    pointers to journal papers in their fields of interest we survey some    of the known approaches to the problem of technical paper    recommendation and ask how they can be extended to deal with multiple    information sources more specifically we focus on a variant of this    problem  recommending conference paper submissions to reviewing    committee members  which offers us a testbed to try different    approaches  using whirl  an information integration system  we    are able to implement different recommendation algorithms derived from    information retrieval principles we also use a novel autonomous    procedure for gathering reviewer interest information from the web we    evaluate our approach and compare it to other methods using preference    data provided by members of the aaai98 conference reviewing committee    along with data about the actual submissions
