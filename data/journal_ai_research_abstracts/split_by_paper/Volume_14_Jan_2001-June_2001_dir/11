we describe and evaluate the algorithmic techniques that are    used in the ff planning system like the hsp system ff relies on    forward state space search using a heuristic that estimates goal    distances by ignoring delete lists unlike hsps heuristic our method    does not assume facts to be independent we introduce a novel search    strategy that combines hillclimbing with systematic search and we    show how other powerful heuristic information can be extracted and    used to prune the search space ff was the most successful automatic    planner at the recent aips2000 planning competition we review the    results of the competition give data for other benchmark domains and    investigate the reasons for the runtime performance of ff compared to    hsp
