enforcing local consistencies is one of the main features    of constraint reasoning which level of local consistency should be    used when searching for solutions in a constraint network is a basic    question arc consistency and partial forms of arc consistency have    been widely studied and have been known for sometime through the    forward checking or the mac search algorithms until recently    stronger forms of local consistency remained limited to those that    change the structure of the constraint graph and thus could not be    used in practice especially on large networks this paper focuses on    the local consistencies that are stronger than arc consistency    without changing the structure of the network ie only removing    inconsistent values from the domains in the last five years several    such local consistencies have been proposed by us or by others we    make an overview of all of them and highlight some relations between    them we compare them both theoretically and experimentally    considering their pruning efficiency and the time required to enforce    them
