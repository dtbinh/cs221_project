u  straccia 2001 reasoning within fuzzy description logics volume 14 pages 137166

description logics dls are suitable wellknown logics    for managing structured knowledge  they allow reasoning about    individuals and well defined concepts ie set of individuals with    common properties  the experience in using dls in applications has    shown that in many cases we would like to extend their capabilities    in particular their use in the context of multimedia information    retrieval mir leads to the convincement that such dls should allow    the treatment of the inherent imprecision in multimedia object content    representation and retrieval           in this paper we will present a fuzzy extension of alc combining    zadehs fuzzy logic with a classical dl in particular concepts    becomes fuzzy and thus reasoning about imprecise concepts is    supported  we will define its syntax its semantics describe its    properties and present a constraint propagation calculus for reasoning    in it
