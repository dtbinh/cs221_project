honorable mention for the 2006 ijcaijair best paper prize

this paper investigates the problems arising in the    construction of a program to play the game of contract bridge  these    problems include both the difficulty of solving the games perfect    information variant and techniques needed to address the fact that    bridge is not in fact a perfect information game  gib the program    being described involves five separate technical advances partition    search the practical application of monte carlo techniques to    realistic problems a focus on achievable sets to solve problems    inherent in the monte carlo approach an extension of alphabeta    pruning from total orders to arbitrary distributive lattices and the    use of squeaky wheel optimization to find approximately optimal    solutions to cardplay problems     gib is currently believed to be of approximately expert caliber and    is currently the strongest computer bridge program in the world
