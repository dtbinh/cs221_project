c  boutilier and  r  i brafman 2001 partialorder planning with concurrent interacting actions volume 14 pages 105136

in order to generate plans for agents with multiple    actuators agent teams or distributed controllers we must be able to    represent and plan using concurrent actions with interacting    effects this has historically been considered a challenging task    requiring a temporal planner with the ability to reason explicitly    about time we show that with simple modifications the strips action    representation language can be used to represent interacting actions    moreover algorithms for partialorder planning require only small    modifications in order to be applied in such multiagent domains  we    demonstrate this fact by developing a sound and complete partialorder    planner for planning with concurrent interacting actions pomp that    extends existing partialorder planners in a straightforward    way these results open the way to the use of partialorder planners    for the centralized control of cooperative multiagent systems
