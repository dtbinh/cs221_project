j  y halpern 2001 conditional plausibility measures and bayesian networks volume 14 pages 359389

a general notion of algebraic conditional plausibility    measures is defined  probability measures ranking functions    possibility measures and under the appropriate definitions sets of    probability measures can all be viewed as defining algebraic    conditional plausibility measures it is shown that algebraic    conditional plausibility measures can be represented using bayesian    networks
