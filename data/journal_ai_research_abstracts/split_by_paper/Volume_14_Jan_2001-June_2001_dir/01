r  i brafman 2001 on reachability relevance and resolution in the planning as satisfiability approach volume 14 pages 128

in recent years there is a growing awareness of the    importance of reachability and relevancebased pruning techniques for    planning but little work specifically targets these techniques in    this paper we compare the ability of two classes of algorithms to    propagate and discover reachability and relevance constraints in    classical planning problems the first class of algorithms operates on    sat encoded planning problems obtained using the linear and graphplan    encoding schemes  it applies unitpropagation and more general    resolution steps involving larger clauses to these plan encodings    the second class operates at the plan level and contains two families    of pruning algorithms reachablek and relevantk  reachablek    provides a coherent description of a number of existing forward    pruning techniques used in numerous algorithms while relevantk    captures different grades of backward pruning  our results shed light    on the ability of different planencoding schemes to propagate    information forward and backward and on the relative merit of    planlevel and satlevel pruning methods
