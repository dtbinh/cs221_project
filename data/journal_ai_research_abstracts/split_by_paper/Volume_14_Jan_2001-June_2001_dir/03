x  chen and p  van beek 2001 conflictdirected backjumping revisited volume 14 pages 5381

in recent years many improvements to backtracking algorithms for    solving constraint satisfaction problems have been proposed    the techniques for improving backtracking algorithms can    be conveniently classified as lookahead schemes and    lookback schemes  unfortunately lookahead and lookback    schemes are not entirely orthogonal as it has been observed    empirically that the enhancement of lookahead techniques    is sometimes counterproductive to the effects of lookback    techniques in this paper we focus on the relationship between    the two most important lookahead techniquesusing a variable    ordering heuristic and maintaining a level of local consistency    during the backtracking searchand the lookback technique of    conflictdirected backjumping cbj we show that there exists    a perfect dynamic variable ordering such that cbj becomes    redundant we also show theoretically that as the level of local    consistency that is maintained in the backtracking search is    increased the less that backjumping will be an improvement    our theoretical results partially explain why a backtracking    algorithm doing more in the lookahead phase cannot benefit    more from the backjumping lookback scheme finally we show    empirically that adding cbj to a backtracking algorithm that    maintains generalized arc consistency gac an algorithm that    we refer to as gaccbj can still provide orders of magnitude    speedups our empirical results contrast with bessiere and    regins conclusion 1996 that cbj is useless to an algorithm    that maintains arc consistency
