x  lu h  m schwartz and s  n givigi 2011 policy invariance under reward transformations for generalsum stochastic games volume 41 pages 397406

we extend the potentialbased shaping method from markov decision processes to multiplayer generalsum stochastic games we prove that the nash equilibria in a stochastic game remains unchanged after potentialbased shaping is applied to the environment the property of policy invariance provides a possible way of speeding convergence when learning to play a stochastic game
