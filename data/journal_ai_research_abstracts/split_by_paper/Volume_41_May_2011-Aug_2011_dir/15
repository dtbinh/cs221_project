robots operating in domestic environments generally need to interact with articulated objects such as doors cabinets dishwashers or fridges in this work we present a novel probabilistic framework for modeling articulated objects as kinematic graphs vertices in this graph correspond to object parts while edges between them model their kinematic relationship in particular we present a set of parametric and nonparametric edge models and how they can robustly be estimated from noisy pose observations we furthermore describe how to estimate the kinematic structure and how to use the learned kinematic models for pose prediction and for robotic manipulation tasks we finally present how the learned models can be generalized to new and previously unseen objects  in various experiments using real robots with different camera systems as well as in simulation we show that our approach is valid accurate and efficient further we demonstrate that our approach has a broad set of applications in particular for the emerging fields of mobile manipulation and service robotics
