o  kurland and e  krikon 2011 the opposite of smoothing a language model approach to ranking queryspecific document clusters volume 41 pages 367395

exploiting information induced from queryspecific clustering of topretrieved documents has long been proposed as a means for improving precision at the very top ranks of the returned results we present a novel language model approach to ranking queryspecific clusters by the presumed percentage of relevant documents that they contain while most previous cluster ranking approaches focus on the cluster as a whole our model utilizes also information induced from documents associated with the cluster our model substantially outperforms previous approaches for identifying clusters containing a high relevantdocument percentage furthermore using the model to produce document ranking yields precisionattopranks performance that is consistently better than that of the initial ranking upon which clustering is performed the performance also favorably compares with that of a stateoftheart pseudofeedbackbased retrieval method
