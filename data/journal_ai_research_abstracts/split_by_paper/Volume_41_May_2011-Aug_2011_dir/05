s  p gujar and y  narahari 2011 redistribution mechanisms for assignment of heterogeneous objects volume 41 pages 131154

there are p heterogeneous objects to be assigned to n competing agents n  p each with unit demand it is required to design a groves mechanism for this assignment problem satisfying weak budget balance individual rationality and minimizing the budget imbalance this calls for designing an appropriate rebate function when the objects are identical this problem has been solved which we refer as wco mechanism we measure the performance of such mechanisms by the redistribution index we first prove an impossibility theorem which rules out linear rebate functions with nonzero redistribution index in heterogeneous object assignment motivated by this theorem we explore two approaches to get around this impossibility in the first approach we show that linear rebate functions with nonzero redistribution index are possible when the valuations for the objects have a certain type of relationship and we design a mechanism with linear rebate function that is worst case optimal in the second approach we show that rebate functions with nonzero efficiency are possible if linearity is relaxed we extend the rebate functions of the wco mechanism to heterogeneous objects assignment and conjecture them to be worst case optimal
