there has been significant recent interest in gametheoretic approaches to security with much of the recent research focused on utilizing the leaderfollower stackelberg game model among the major applications are the armor program deployed at lax airport and the iris program in use by the us federal air marshals fams the foundational assumption for using stackelberg games is that security forces leaders acting first commit to a randomized strategy while their adversaries followers choose their best response after surveillance of this randomized strategy  yet in many situations a leader may face uncertainty about the followers surveillance capability previous work fails to address how a leader should compute her strategy given such uncertainty

we provide five contributions in the context of a general class of security games first we show that the nash equilibria in security games are interchangeable thus alleviating the equilibrium selection problem second under a natural restriction on security games any stackelberg strategy is also a nash equilibrium strategy and furthermore the solution is unique in a class of security games of which armor is a key exemplar third when faced with a follower that can attack multiple targets many of these properties no longer hold fourth we show experimentally that in most but not all games where the restriction does not hold the stackelberg strategy is still a nash equilibrium strategy but this is no longer true when the attacker can attack multiple targets finally as a possible direction for future research we propose an extensiveform game model that makes the defenders uncertainty about the attackers ability to observe explicit
