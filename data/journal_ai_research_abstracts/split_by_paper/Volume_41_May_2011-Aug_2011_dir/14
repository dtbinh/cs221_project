w  dvo345225k and s  woltran 2011 on the intertranslatability of argumentation semantics volume 41 pages 445475

translations between different nonmonotonic formalisms always have been an important topic in the field in particular to understand the knowledgerepresentation capabilities those formalisms offer  we provide such an investigation in terms of different semantics proposed for abstract argumentation frameworks a nonmonotonic yet simple formalism which received increasing interest within the last decade although the properties of these different semantics are nowadays well understood there are no explicit results about intertranslatability we provide such translations wrt different properties and also give a few novel complexity results which underlie some negative results
