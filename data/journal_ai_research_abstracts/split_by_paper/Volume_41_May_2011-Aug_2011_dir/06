the ignoring delete lists relaxation is of paramount importance for both satisficing and optimal planning in earlier work it was observed that the optimal relaxation heuristic h has amazing qualities in many classical planning benchmarks in particular pertaining to the complete absence of local minima the proofs of this are handmade raising the question whether such proofs can be lead automatically by domain analysis techniques in contrast to earlier disappointing results  the analysis method has exponential runtime and succeeds only in two extremely simple benchmark domains  we herein answer this question in the affirmative we establish connections between causal graph structure and h topology this results in loworder polynomial time analysis methods implemented in a tool we call torchlight of the 12 domains where the absence of local minima has been proved torchlight gives strong success guarantees in 8 domains empirically its analysis exhibits strong performance in a further 2 of these domains plus in 4 more domains where local minima may exist but are rare in this way torchlight can distinguish easy domains from hard ones by summarizing structural reasons for analysis failure torchlight also provides diagnostic output indicating domain aspects that may cause local minima
