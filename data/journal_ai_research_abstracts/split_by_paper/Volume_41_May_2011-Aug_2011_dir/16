we consider the problem of fully unsupervised learning of grammatical partofspeech categories from unlabeled text the standard maximumlikelihood hidden markov model for this task performs poorly because of its weak inductive bias and large model capacity we address this problem by refining the model and modifying the learning objective to control its capacity via para metric and nonparametric constraints our approach enforces wordcategory association sparsity adds morphological and orthographic features and eliminates hardtoestimate parameters for rare words we develop an efficient learning algorithm that is not much more computationally intensive than standard training we also provide an opensource implementation of the algorithm our experiments on five diverse languages bulgarian danish english portuguese spanish achieve significant improvements compared with previous methods for the same task
