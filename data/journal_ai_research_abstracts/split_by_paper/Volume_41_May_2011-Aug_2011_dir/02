l  xia and v  conitzer 2011 determining possible and necessary winners given partial orders volume 41 pages 2567

usually a voting rule requires agents to give their preferences as linear orders however in some cases it is impractical for an agent to give a linear order over all the alternatives it has been suggested to let agents submit partial orders instead then given a voting rule a profile of partial orders and an alternative candidate c two important questions arise first is it still possible for c to win and second is c guaranteed to win these are the possible winner and necessary winner problems respectively each of these two problems is further divided into two subproblems determining whether c is a unique winner that is c is the only winner or determining whether c is a cowinner that is c is in the set of winners 

we consider the setting where the number of alternatives is unbounded and the votes are unweighted we completely characterize the complexity of possiblenecessary winner problems for the following common voting rules a class of positional scoring rules including borda copeland maximin bucklin ranked pairs voting trees and plurality with runoff
