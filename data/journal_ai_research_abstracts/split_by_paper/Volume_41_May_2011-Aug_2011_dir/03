m  bilgic and l  getoor 2011 value of information lattice exploiting probabilistic independence for effective feature subset acquisition volume 41 pages 6995

we address the costsensitive feature acquisition problem where misclassifying an instance is costly but the expected misclassification cost can be reduced by acquiring the values of the missing features because acquiring the features is costly as well the objective is to acquire the right set of features so that the sum of the feature acquisition cost and misclassification cost is minimized we describe the value of information lattice voila an optimal and efficient feature subset acquisition framework unlike the common practice which is to acquire features greedily voila can reason with subsets of features voila efficiently searches the space of possible feature subsets by discovering and exploiting conditional independence properties between the features and it reuses probabilistic inference computations to further speed up the process through empirical evaluation on five medical datasets we show that the greedy strategy is often reluctant to acquire features as it cannot forecast the benefit of acquiring multiple features in combination
