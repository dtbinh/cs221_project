in a peertopeer inference system each peer can reason locally but can also solicit some of its acquaintances which are peers sharing part of its vocabulary in this paper we consider peertopeer inference systems in which the local theory of each peer is a set of propositional clauses defined upon a local vocabulary an important characteristic of peertopeer inference systems is that the global theory the union of all peer theories is not known as opposed to partitionbased reasoning systems the main contribution of this paper is to provide the first consequence finding algorithm in a peertopeer setting deca it is anytime and computes consequences gradually from the solicited peer to peers that are more and more distant we exhibit a sufficient condition on the acquaintance graph of the peertopeer inference system for guaranteeing the completeness of this algorithm another important contribution is to apply this general distributed reasoning setting to the setting of the semantic web through the somewhere semantic peertopeer data management system the last contribution of this paper is to provide an experimental analysis of the scalability of the peertopeer infrastructure that we propose on large networks of 1000 peers
