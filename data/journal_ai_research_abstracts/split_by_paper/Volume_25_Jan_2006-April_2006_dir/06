w  pullan and h  h hoos 2006 dynamic local search for the maximum clique problem volume 25 pages 159185

in this paper we introduce dlsmc a new stochastic local search algorithm for the maximum clique problem dlsmc alternates between phases of iterative improvement during which suitable vertices are added to the current clique and plateau search during which vertices of the current clique are swapped with vertices not contained in the current clique the selection of vertices is solely based on vertex penalties that are dynamically adjusted during the search and a perturbation mechanism is used to overcome search stagnation the behaviour of dlsmc is controlled by a single parameter penalty delay which controls the frequency at which vertex penalties are reduced we show empirically that dlsmc achieves substantial performance improvements over stateoftheart algorithms for the maximum clique problem over a large range of the commonly used dimacs benchmark instances
