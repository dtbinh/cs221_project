v  bulitko and g  lee 2006 learning in realtime search a unifying framework volume 25 pages 119157

realtime search methods are suited for tasks in which the agent is interacting with an initially unknown environment in real time in such simultaneous planning and learning problems the agent has to select its actions in a limited amount of time while sensing only a local part of the environment centered at the agents current location realtime heuristic search agents select actions using a limited lookahead search and evaluating the frontier states with a heuristic function over repeated experiences they refine heuristic values of states to avoid infinite loops and to converge to better solutions the wide spread of such settings in autonomous software and hardware agents has led to an explosion of realtime search algorithms over the last two decades not only is a potential user confronted with a hodgepodge of algorithms but he also faces the choice of control parameters they use in this paper we address both problems the first contribution is an introduction of a simple threeparameter framework named lrts which extracts the core ideas behind many existing algorithms we then prove that lrta epsilonlrta sla and gammatrap algorithms are special cases of our framework thus they are unified and extended with additional features second we prove completeness and convergence of any algorithm covered by the lrts framework third we prove several upperbounds relating the control parameters and solution quality finally we analyze the influence of the three control parameters empirically in the realistic scalable domains of realtime navigation on initially unknown maps from a commercial roleplaying game as well as routing in ad hoc sensor networks
