we present a partialorder conformant probabilistic planner probapop which competed in the blind track of the probabilistic planning competition in ipc4 we explain how we adapt distance based heuristics for use with probabilistic domains probapop also incorporates heuristics based on probability of success we explain the successes and difficulties encountered during the design and implementation of probapop
