g  gutnik and g  a kaminka 2006 representing conversations for scalable overhearing volume 25 pages 349387

open distributed multiagent systems are gaining interest in the academic community and in industry in such open settings agents are often coordinated using standardized agent conversation protocols the representation of such protocols for analysis validation monitoring etc is an important aspect of multiagent applications recently petri nets have been shown to be an interesting approach to such representation and radically different approaches using petri nets have been proposed however their relative strengths and weaknesses have not been examined moreover their scalability and suitability for different tasks have not been addressed this paper addresses both these challenges first we analyze existing petri net representations in terms of their scalability and appropriateness for overhearing an important task in monitoring open multiagent systems then building on the insights gained we introduce a novel representation using colored petri nets that explicitly represent legal joint conversation states and messages this representation approach offers significant improvements in scalability and is particularly suitable for overhearing furthermore we show that this new representation offers a comprehensive coverage of all conversation features of fipa conversation standards we also present a procedure for transforming auml conversation protocol diagrams a standard humanreadable representation to our colored petri net representation
