the ihsupmsupi admissible heuristics for sequential and temporal regression planning are defined by a parameterized relaxation of the optimal cost function in the regression search space where the parameter imi offers a tradeoff between the accuracy and computational cost of theheuristic existing methods for computing the ihsupmsupi heuristic require time exponential in imi limiting them to small values im  2i the ihsupmsupi heuristic can also be viewed as the optimal cost function in a relaxation of the search space this paper presents emrelaxed searchem a method for computing this function partially by searching in the relaxed space the relaxed search method because it computes ihsupmsupi only partially is computationally cheaper and therefore usable for higher values of imi the complete ihsupmsupi heuristic is combined with partial ihsupmsupi heuristics for im  3i computed by relaxed search resulting in a more accurate heuristic
