in recent years cpnets have emerged as a useful tool for supporting preference elicitation reasoning and representation cpnets capture and support reasoning with qualitative conditional preference statements statements that are relatively natural for users to express in this paper we extend the cpnets formalism to handle another class of very natural qualitative statements one often uses in expressing preferences in daily life  statements of relative importance of attributes the resulting formalism tcpnets maintains the spirit of cpnets in that it remains focused on using only simple and natural preference statements uses the ceteris paribus semantics and utilizes a graphical representation of this information to reason about its consistency and to perform possibly constrained optimization using it the extra expressiveness it provides allows us to better model tradeoffs users would like to make more faithfully representing their preferences
