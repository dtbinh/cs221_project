r  mailler and v  r lesser 2006 asynchronous partial overlay  a new algorithm for solving distributed constraint satisfaction problems volume 25 pages 529576

distributed constraint satisfaction dcsp has long been considered an important problem in multiagent systems research  this is because many realworld problems can be represented as constraint satisfaction and these problems often present themselves in a distributed form  in this article we present a new complete distributed algorithm called asynchronous partial overlay apo for solving dcsps that is based on a cooperative mediation process  the primary ideas behind this algorithm are that agents when acting as a mediator centralize small relevant portions of the dcsp that these centralized subproblems overlap and that agents increase the size of their subproblems along critical paths within the dcsp as the problem solving unfolds  we present empirical evidence that shows that apo outperforms other known complete dcsp techniques
