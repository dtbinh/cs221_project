a  roy 2006 fault tolerant boolean satisfiability volume 25 pages 503527

a deltamodel is a satisfying assignment of a boolean formula for which any small alteration such as a single bit flip can be repaired by flips to some small number of other bits yielding a new satisfying assignment  these satisfying assignments represent robust solutions to optimization problems eg scheduling where it is possible to recover from unforeseen events eg a resource becoming unavailable  the concept of deltamodels was introduced by ginsberg parkes and roy aaai 1998  where it was proved that finding deltamodels for general boolean formulas is npcomplete  in this paper we extend that result by studying the complexity of finding deltamodels for classes of boolean formulas which are known to have polynomial time satisfiability solvers  in particular we examine 2sat hornsat affinesat dualhornsat 0valid and 1valid sat  we see a wide variation in the complexity of finding deltamodels eg while 2sat and affinesat have polynomial time tests for deltamodels testing whether a hornsat formula has one is npcomplete
