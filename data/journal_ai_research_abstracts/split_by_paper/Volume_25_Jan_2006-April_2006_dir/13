logical hidden markov models lohmms upgrade traditional hidden markov models to deal with sequences of structured symbols in the form of logical atoms rather than flat characters

this note formally introduces lohmms and presents solutions to the three central inference problems for lohmms evaluation most likely hidden state sequence and parameter estimation the resulting representation and algorithms are experimentally evaluated on problems from the domain of bioinformatics
