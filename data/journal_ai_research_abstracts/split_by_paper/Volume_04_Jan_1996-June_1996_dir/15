g  i webb 1996 further experimental evidence against the utility of occams razor volume 4 pages 397417

this paper presents new experimental evidence against the    utility of occams razor  asystematic procedure is presented for    postprocessing decision trees produced by c45  this procedure was    derived by rejecting occams razor and instead attending to the    assumption that similar objects are likely to belong to the same    class  it increases a decision trees complexity without altering the    performance of that tree on the training data from which it is    inferred  the resulting more complex decision trees are demonstrated    to have on average for a variety of common learning tasks higher    predictive accuracy than the less complex original decision trees    this result raises considerable doubt about the utility of occams    razor as it is commonly applied in modern machine learning
