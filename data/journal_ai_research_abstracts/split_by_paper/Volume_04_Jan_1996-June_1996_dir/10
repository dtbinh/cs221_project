t  walsh 1996 a divergence critic for inductive proof volume 4 pages 209235

inductive theorem provers often diverge this paper    describes a simple critic a computer program which monitors the    construction of inductive proofs attempting to identify diverging    proof attempts divergence is recognized by means of a difference    matching procedure the critic then proposes lemmas and    generalizations which ripple these differences away so that the    proof can go through without divergence the critic enables the    theorem prover spike to prove many theorems completely automatically    from the definitions alone
