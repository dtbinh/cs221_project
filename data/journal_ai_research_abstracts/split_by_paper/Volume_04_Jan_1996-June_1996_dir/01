p  van beek and  d  w manchak 1996 the design and experimental analysis of algorithms for temporal reasoning volume 4 pages 118

many applications  from planning and scheduling to    problems in molecular biology  rely heavily on a temporal reasoning    component  in this paper we discuss the design and empirical    analysis of algorithms for a temporal reasoning system based on    allens influential intervalbased framework for representing temporal    information  at the core of the system are algorithms for determining    whether the temporal information is consistent and if so finding    one or more scenarios that are consistent with the temporal    information  two important algorithms for these tasks are a path    consistency algorithm and a backtracking algorithm  for the path    consistency algorithm we develop techniques that can result in up to    a tenfold speedup over an already highly optimized implementation    for the backtracking algorithm we develop variable and value ordering    heuristics that are shown empirically to dramatically improve the    performance of the algorithm  as well we show that a previously    suggested reformulation of the backtracking search problem can reduce    the time and space requirements of the backtracking search  taken    together the techniques we develop allow a temporal reasoning    component to solve problems that are of practical size
