an important problem in geometric reasoning is to find the    configuration of a collection of geometric bodies so as to satisfy a    set of given constraints recently it has been suggested that this    problem can be solved efficiently by symbolically reasoning about    geometry this approach called degrees of freedom analysis employs a    set of specialized routines called plan fragments that specify how to    change the configuration of a set of bodies to satisfy a new    constraint while preserving existing constraints a potential    drawback which limits the scalability of this approach is concerned    with the difficulty of writing plan fragments  in this paper we    address this limitation by showing how these plan fragments can be    automatically synthesized using first principles about geometric    bodies actions and topology
