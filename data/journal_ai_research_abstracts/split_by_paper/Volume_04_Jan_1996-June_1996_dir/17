p  tadepalli and  b  k natarajan 1996 a formal framework for speedup learning from problems and solutions volume 4 pages 445475

speedup learning seeks to improve the computational    efficiency of problem solving with experience in this paper we    develop a formal framework for learning efficient problem solving from    random problems and their solutions we apply this framework to two    different representations of learned knowledge namely control rules    and macrooperators and prove theorems that identify sufficient    conditions for learning in each representation our proofs are    constructive in that they are accompanied with learning algorithms     our framework captures both empirical and explanationbased     speedup learning in a unified fashion  we illustrate our framework    with implementations in two domains symbolic integration and eight    puzzle this work integrates many strands of experimental and    theoretical work in machine learning including empirical learning of    control rules macrooperator learning explanationbased learning    ebl and probably approximately correct pac learning
