d  fisher 1996 iterative optimization and simplification of hierarchical clusterings volume 4 pages 147178

clustering is often used for discovering structure in data    clustering systems differ in the objective function used to evaluate    clustering quality and the control strategy used to search the space    of clusterings ideally the search strategy should consistently    construct clusterings of high quality but be computationally    inexpensive as well in general we cannot have it both ways but we    can partition the search so that a system inexpensively constructs a    tentative clustering for initial examination followed by iterative    optimization which continues to search in background for improved    clusterings given this motivation we evaluate an inexpensive    strategy for creating initial clusterings coupled with several    control strategies for iterative optimization each of which    repeatedly modifies an initial clustering in search of a better    one one of these methods appears novel as an iterative optimization    strategy in clustering contexts once a clustering has been    constructed it is judged by analysts  often according to    taskspecific criteria several authors have abstracted these criteria    and posited a generic performance task akin to pattern completion    where the error rate over completed patterns is used to externally    judge clustering utility given this performance task we adapt    resamplingbased pruning strategies used by supervised learning    systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical clusterings thus    promising to ease postclustering analysis finally we propose a    number of objective functions based on attributeselection measures    for decisiontree induction that might perform well on the error rate    and simplicity dimensions
