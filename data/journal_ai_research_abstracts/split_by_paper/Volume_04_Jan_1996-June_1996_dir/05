j  r quinlan 1996 improved use of continuous attributes in c45 volume 4 pages 7790

a reported weakness of c45 in domains with continuous    attributes is addressed by modifying the formation and evaluation of    tests on continuous attributes  an mdlinspired penalty is applied to    such tests eliminating some of them from consideration and altering    the relative desirability of all tests  empirical trials show that    the modifications lead to smaller decision trees with higher    predictive accuracies  results also confirm that a new version of    c45 incorporating these changes is superior to recent approaches that    use global discretization and that construct small trees with    multiinterval splits
