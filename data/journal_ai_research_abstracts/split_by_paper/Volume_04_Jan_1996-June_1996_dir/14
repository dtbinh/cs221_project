j  gratch and  s  chien 1996 adaptive problemsolving for largescale scheduling problems a case study volume 4 pages 365396

although most scheduling problems are nphard domain    specific techniques perform well in practice but are quite expensive    to construct  in adaptive problemsolving solving domain specific    knowledge is acquired automatically for a general problem solver with    a flexible control architecture  in this approach a learning system    explores a space of possible heuristic methods for one wellsuited to    the eccentricities of the given domain and problem distribution  in    this article we discuss an application of the approach to scheduling    satellite communications  using problem distributions based on actual    mission requirements our approach identifies strategies that not only    decrease the amount of cpu time required to produce schedules but    also increase the percentage of problems that are solvable within    computational resource limitations
