g  brewka 1996 wellfounded semantics for extended logic programs with dynamic preferences volume 4 pages 1936

the paper describes an extension of wellfounded    semantics for logic programs with two types of negation in this    extension information about preferences between rules can be expressed    in the logical language and derived dynamically this is achieved by    using a reserved predicate symbol and a naming technique conflicts    among rules are resolved whenever possible on the basis of derived    preference information the wellfounded conclusions of prioritized    logic programs can be computed in polynomial time a legal reasoning    example illustrates the usefulness of the approach
