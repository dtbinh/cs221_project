traditional databases commonly support efficient query and    update procedures that operate in time which is sublinear in the size    of the database  our goal in this paper is to take a first step    toward dynamic reasoning in probabilistic databases with comparable    efficiency  we propose a dynamic data structure that supports    efficient algorithms for updating and querying singly connected    bayesian networks  in the conventional algorithm new evidence is    absorbed in o1 time and queries are processed in time on where n    is the size of the network  we propose an algorithm which after a    preprocessing phase allows us to answer queries in time olog n at    the expense of olog n time per evidence absorption  the usefulness    of sublinear processing time manifests itself in applications    requiring near realtime response over large probabilistic    databases we briefly discuss a potential application of dynamic    probabilistic reasoning in computational biology
