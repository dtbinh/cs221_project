l  pryor and  g  collins 1996 planning for contingencies a decisionbased approach volume 4 pages 287339

a fundamental assumption made by classical ai planners is    that there is no uncertainty in the world the planner has full    knowledge of the conditions under which the plan will be executed and    the outcome of every action is fully predictable  these planners    cannot therefore construct contingency plans ie plans in which    different actions are performed in different circumstances  in this    paper we discuss some issues that arise in the representation and    construction of contingency plans and describe cassandra a    partialorder contingency planner  cassandra uses explicit    decisionsteps that enable the agent executing the plan to decide    which plan branch to follow  the decisionsteps in a plan result in    subgoals to acquire knowledge which are planned for in the same way    as any other subgoals  cassandra thus distinguishes the process of    gathering information from the process of making decisions  the    explicit representation of decisions in cassandra allows a coherent    approach to the problems of contingent planning and provides a solid    base for extensions such as the use of different decisionmaking    procedures
