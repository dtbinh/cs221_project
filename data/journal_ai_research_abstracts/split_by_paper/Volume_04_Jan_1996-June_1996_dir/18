r  i brafman and  m  tennenholtz 1996 on partially controlled multiagent systems volume 4 pages 477507

motivated by the control theoretic distinction between    controllable and uncontrollable events we distinguish between two    types of agents within a multiagent system controllable agents    which are directly controlled by the systems designer and    uncontrollable agents which are not under the designers direct    control we refer to such systems as partially controlled multiagent    systems and we investigate how one might influence the behavior of    the uncontrolled agents through appropriate design of the controlled    agents in particular we wish to understand which problems are    naturally described in these terms what methods can be applied to    influence the uncontrollable agents the effectiveness of such    methods and whether similar methods work across different    domains using a gametheoretic framework this paper studies the    design of partially controlled multiagent systems in two contexts in    one context the uncontrollable agents are expected utility    maximizers while in the other they are reinforcement learners we    suggest different techniques for controlling agents behavior in each    domain assess their success and examine their relationship
