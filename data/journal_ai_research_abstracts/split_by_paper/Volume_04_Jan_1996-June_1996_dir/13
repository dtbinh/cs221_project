s  h nienhuyscheng 1996 least generalizations and greatest specializations of sets of clauses volume 4 pages 341363

the main operations in inductive logic programming ilp are    generalization and specialization which only make sense in a    generality order  in ilp the three most important generality orders    are subsumption implication and implication relative to background    knowledge  the two languages used most often are languages of clauses    and languages of only horn clauses this gives a total of six    different ordered languages  in this paper we give a systematic    treatment of the existence or nonexistence of least generalizations    and greatest specializations of finite sets of clauses in each of    these six ordered sets  we survey results already obtained by others    and also contribute some answers of our own        our main new results are firstly the existence of a computable least    generalization under implication of every finite set of clauses    containing at least one nontautologous functionfree clause among    other not necessarily functionfree clauses  secondly we show that    such a least generalization need not exist under relative implication    not even if both the set that is to be generalized and the background    knowledge are functionfree  thirdly we give a complete discussion    of existence and nonexistence of greatest specializations in each of    the six ordered languages
