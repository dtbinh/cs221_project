e  marchiori 1996 practical methods for proving termination of general logic programs volume 4 pages 179208

termination of logic programs with negated body atoms here    called general logic programs is an important topic one reason is    that many computational mechanisms used to process negated atoms like    clarks negation as failure and chans constructive negation are    based on termination conditions  this paper introduces a methodology    for proving termination of general logic programs wrt the prolog    selection rule  the idea is to distinguish parts of the program    depending on whether or not their termination depends on the selection    rule to this end the notions of low weakly up and upacceptable    program are introduced  we use these notions to develop a methodology    for proving termination of general logic programs and show how    interesting problems in nonmonotonic reasoning can be formalized and    implemented by means of terminating general logic programs
