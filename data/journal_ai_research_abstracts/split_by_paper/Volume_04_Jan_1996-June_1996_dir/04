l  k saul  t  jaakkola and  m  i jordan 1996 mean field theory for sigmoid belief networks volume 4 pages 6176

we develop a mean field theory for sigmoid belief networks    based on ideas from statistical mechanics  our mean field theory    provides a tractable approximation to the true probability    distribution in these networks it also yields a lower bound on the    likelihood of evidence  we demonstrate the utility of this framework    on a benchmark problem in statistical pattern recognitionthe    classification of handwritten digits
