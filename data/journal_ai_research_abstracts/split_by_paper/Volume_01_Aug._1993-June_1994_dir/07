n  nilsson 1994 teleoreactive programs for agent control volume 1 pages 139158

a formalism is presented for computing and organizing actions for autonomous agents in dynamic environments we introduce the notion of iteleoreactive tr programsi whose execution entails the construction of circuitry for the continuous computation of the parameters and conditions on which agent action is based  in addition to continuous feedback tr programs support parameter binding and recursion  a primary difference between tr programs and many other circuitbased systems is that the circuitry of tr programs is more compact it is constructed at run time and thus does not have to anticipate all the contingencies that might arise over all possible runs  in addition tr programs are intuitive and easy to write and are written in a form that is compatible with automatic planning and learning methods  we briefly describe some experimental applications of tr programs in the control of simulated and actual mobile robots
