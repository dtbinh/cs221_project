the theory revision problem is the problem of how best to go about revising a deficient domain theory using information contained in examples that expose inaccuracies  in this paper we present our approach to the theory revision problem for propositional domain theories  the approach described here called ptr uses probabilities associated with domain theory elements to numerically track the flow of proof through the theory  this allows us to measure the precise role of a clause or literal in allowing or preventing a desired or undesired derivation for a given example  this information is used to efficiently locate and repair flawed elements of the theory  ptr is proved to converge to a theory which correctly classifies all examples and shown experimentally to be fast and accurate even for deep theories
