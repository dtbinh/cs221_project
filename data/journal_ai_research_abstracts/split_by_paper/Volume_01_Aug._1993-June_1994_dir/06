terminological knowledge representation systems tkrss are tools for designing and using knowledge bases that make use of terminological languages or concept languages  we analyze from a theoretical point of view a tkrs whose capabilities go beyond the ones of presently available tkrss the new features studied often required in practical applications can be summarized in three main points  first we consider a highly expressive terminological language called alcnr including general complements of concepts number restrictions and role conjunction second we allow to express inclusion statements between general concepts and terminological cycles as a particular case  third we prove the decidability of a number of desirable tkrsdeduction services like satisfiability subsumption and instance checking through a sound complete and terminating calculus for reasoning in alcnrknowledge bases our calculus extends the general technique of constraint systems  as a byproduct of the proof we get also the result that inclusion statements in alcnr can be simulated by terminological cycles if descriptive semantics is adopted
