2012 ifaamas award for influential papers in autonomous agents and multiagent systems

market price systems constitute a wellunderstood class of mechanisms that under certain conditions provide effective decentralization of decision making with minimal communication overhead  in a imarketoriented programmingi approach to distributed problem solving we derive the activities and resource allocations for a set of computational agents by computing the competitive equilibrium of an artificial economy  walras provides basic constructs for defining computational market structures and protocols for deriving their corresponding price equilibria  in a particular realization of this approach for a form of multicommodity flow problem we see that careful construction of the decision process according to economic principles can lead to efficient distributed resource allocation and that the behavior of the system can be meaningfully analyzed in economic terms
