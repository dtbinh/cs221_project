a  borgida and  p  f patelschneider 1994 a semantics and complete algorithm for subsumption in the classic description logic volume 1 pages 277308

this paper analyzes the correctness of the subsumption algorithm used in classic a description logicbased knowledge representation system that is being used in practical applications  in order to deal efficiently with individuals in classic descriptions the developers have had to use an algorithm that is incomplete with respect to the standard modeltheoretic semantics for description logics we provide a variant semantics for descriptions with respect to which the current implementation is complete and which can be independently motivated  the soundness and completeness of the polynomialtime subsumption algorithm is established using description graphs which are an abstracted version of the implementation structures used in classic and are of independent interest
