m  l ginsberg 1993 dynamic backtracking volume 1 pages 2546

because of their occasional need to return to shallow points in a search tree existing backtracking methods can sometimes erase meaningful progress toward solving a search problem in this paper we present a method by which backtrack points can be moved deeper in the search space thereby avoiding this difficulty the technique developed is a variant of dependencydirected backtracking that uses only polynomial space while still providing useful control information and retaining the completeness guarantees provided by earlier approaches
