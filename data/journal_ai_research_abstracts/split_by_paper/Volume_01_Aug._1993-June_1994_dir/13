r  sebastiani 1994 applying gsatto nonclausal formulas volume 1 pages 309314

in this paper we describe how to modify gsat so that it can be applied to nonclausal formulas the idea is to use a particular score function which gives the number of clauses of the cnf conversion of a formula which are false under a given truth assignment  its value is computed in linear time without constructing the cnf conversion itself  the proposed methodology applies to most of the variants of gsat proposed so far
