i  p gent and  t  walsh 1993 an empirical analysis of search in gsat volume 1 pages 4759

we describe an extensive study of search in gsat an approximation procedure for propositional satisfiability gsat performs greedy hillclimbing on the number of satisfied clauses in a truth assignment  our experiments provide a more complete picture of gsats search than previous accounts we describe in detail the two phases of search rapid hillclimbing followed by a long plateau search  we demonstrate that when applied to randomly generated 3sat problems there is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the mean number of satisfied clauses and the mean branching rate  our results allow us to make detailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hillclimbing phase the average gradient of this phase and to conjecture that both the average score and average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search we end by showing how these results can be used to direct future theoretical analysis  this work provides a case study of how computer experiments can be used to improve understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms
