c  x ling 1994 learning the past tense of english verbs the symbolic pattern associator vs connectionist models volume 1 pages 209229

learning the past tense of english verbs  a seemingly minor aspect of language acquisition  has generated heated debates since 1986 and has become a landmark task for testing the adequacy of cognitive modeling several artificial neural networks anns have been implemented and a challenge for better symbolic models has been posed  in this paper we present a generalpurpose symbolic pattern associator spa based upon the decisiontree learning algorithm id3  we conduct extensive headtohead comparisons on the generalization ability between ann models and the spa under different representations we conclude that the spa generalizes the past tense of unseen verbs better than ann models by a wide margin and we offer insights as to why this should be the case  we also discuss a new default strategy for decisiontree learning algorithms
