n  l zhang and  w  liu 1997 a model approximation scheme for planning in partially observable stochastic domains volume 7 pages 199230

partially observable markov decision processes pomdps are    a natural model for planning problems where effects of actions are    nondeterministic and the state of the world is not completely    observable  it is difficult to solve pomdps exactly  this paper    proposes a new approximation scheme  the basic idea is to transform a    pomdp into another one where additional information is provided by an    oracle the oracle informs the planning agent that the current state    of the world is in a certain region  the transformed pomdp is    consequently said to be region observable it is easier to solve than    the original pomdp  we propose to solve the transformed pomdp and use    its optimal policy to construct an approximate policy for the original    pomdp  by controlling the amount of additional information that the    oracle provides it is possible to find a proper tradeoff between    computational time and approximation quality  in terms of algorithmic    contributions we study in details how to exploit region observability    in solving the transformed pomdp to facilitate the study we also    propose a new exact algorithm for general pomdps  the algorithm is    conceptually simple and yet is significantly more efficient than all    previous exact algorithms
