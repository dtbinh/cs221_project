local search algorithms for combinatorial search problems    frequently encounter a sequence of states in which it is impossible to    improve the value of the objective function moves through these    regions called plateau moves dominate the time spent in local    search  we analyze and characterize plateaus for three different    classes of randomly generated boolean satisfiability problems  we    identify several interesting features of plateaus that impact the    performance of local search algorithms  we show that local minima    tend to be small but occasionally may be very large  we also show    that local minima can be escaped without unsatisfying a large number    of clauses but that systematically searching for an escape route may    be computationally expensive if the local minimum is large  we show    that plateaus with exits called benches tend to be much larger than    minima and that some benches have very few exit states which local    search can use to escape  we show that the solutions ie global    minima of randomly generated problem instances form clusters which    behave similarly to local minima  we revisit several enhancements of    local search algorithms and explain their performance in light of our    results  finally we discuss strategies for creating the next    generation of local search algorithms
