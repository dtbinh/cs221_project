a fundamental goal of research in molecular biology is to    understand protein structure protein crystallography is currently the    most successful method for determining the threedimensional 3d    conformation of a protein yet it remains labor intensive and relies    on an experts ability to derive and evaluate a protein scene model    in this paper the problem of protein structure determination is    formulated as an exercise in scene analysis  a computational    methodology is presented in which a 3d image of a protein is segmented    into a graph of critical points  bayesian and certainty factor    approaches are described and used to analyze critical point graphs and    identify meaningful substructures such as alphahelices and    betasheets  results of applying the methodologies to protein images    at low and medium resolution are reported  the research is related to    approaches to representation segmentation and classification in    vision as well as to topdown approaches to protein structure    prediction
