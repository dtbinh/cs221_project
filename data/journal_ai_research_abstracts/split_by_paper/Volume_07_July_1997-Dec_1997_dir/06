many ai researchers are today striving to build agent teams    for complex dynamic multiagent domains with intended applications    in arenas such as education training entertainment information    integration and collective robotics  unfortunately uncertainties in    these complex dynamic domains obstruct coherent teamwork  in    particular team members often encounter differing incomplete and    possibly inconsistent views of their environment  furthermore team    members can unexpectedly fail in fulfilling responsibilities or    discover unexpected opportunities  highly flexible coordination and    communication is key in addressing such uncertainties  simply fitting    individual agents with precomputed coordination plans will not do for    their inflexibility can cause severe failures in teamwork and their    domainspecificity hinders reusability           our central hypothesis is that the key to such flexibility and    reusability is providing agents with general models of teamwork    agents exploit such models to autonomously reason about coordination    and communication providing requisite flexibility  furthermore the    models enable reuse across domains both saving implementation effort    and enforcing consistency  this article presents one general    implemented model of teamwork called steam  the basic building block    of teamwork in steam is joint intentions cohen  levesque 1991b    teamwork in steam is based on agents building up a partial    hierarchy of joint intentions this hierarchy is seen to parallel    grosz  krauss partial sharedplans 1996  furthermore in steam    team members monitor the teams and individual members performance    reorganizing the team as necessary  finally decisiontheoretic    communication selectivity in steam ensures reduction in communication    overheads of teamwork with appropriate sensitivity to the    environmental conditions  this article describes steams application    in three different complex domains and presents detailed empirical    results
