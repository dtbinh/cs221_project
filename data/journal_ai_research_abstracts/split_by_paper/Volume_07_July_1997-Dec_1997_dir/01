j  y halpern 1997 defining relative likelihood in partiallyordered preferential structures volume 7 pages 124

starting with a likelihood or preference order on worlds we    extend it to a likelihood ordering on sets of worlds in a natural way    and examine the resulting logic  lewis earlier considered such a    notion of relative likelihood in the context of studying    counterfactuals but he assumed a total preference order on worlds    complications arise when examining partial orders that are not present    for total orders  there are subtleties involving the exact approach    to lifting the order on worlds to an order on sets of worlds  in    addition the axiomatization of the logic of relative likelihood in    the case of partial orders gives insight into the connection between    relative likelihood and default reasoning
