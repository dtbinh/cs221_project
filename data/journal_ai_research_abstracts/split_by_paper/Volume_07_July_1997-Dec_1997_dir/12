h  kaindl and  g  kainz 1997 bidirectional heuristic search reconsidered volume 7 pages 283317

the assessment of bidirectional heuristic search has been    incorrect since it was first published more than a quarter of a    century ago  for quite a long time this search strategy did not    achieve the expected results and there was a major misunderstanding    about the reasons behind it  although there is still widespread    belief that bidirectional heuristic search is afflicted by the problem    of search frontiers passing each other we demonstrate that this    conjecture is wrong  based on this finding we present both a new    generic approach to bidirectional heuristic search and a new approach    to dynamically improving heuristic values that is feasible in    bidirectional search only  these approaches are put into perspective    with both the traditional and more recently proposed approaches in    order to facilitate a better overall understanding  empirical results    of experiments with our new approaches show that bidirectional    heuristic search can be performed very efficiently and also with    limited memory  these results suggest that bidirectional heuristic    search appears to be better for solving certain difficult problems    than corresponding unidirectional search  this provides some evidence    for the usefulness of a search strategy that was long neglected  in    summary we show that bidirectional heuristic search is viable and    consequently propose that it be reconsidered
