d  l mammen and  t  hogg 1997 a new look at the easyhardeasy pattern of combinatorial search difficulty volume 7 pages 4766

the easyhardeasy pattern in the difficulty of combinatorial search problems as constraints are added has been explained as due to a competition between the decrease in number of solutions and increased pruning we test the generality of this explanation by examining one of its predictions if the number of solutions is held fixed by the choice of problems then increased pruning should lead to a monotonic decrease in search cost instead we find the easyhardeasy pattern in median search cost even when the number of solutions is held constant for some search methods this generalizes previous observations of this pattern and shows that the existing theory does not explain the full range of the peak in search cost in these cases the pattern appears to be due to changes in the size of the minimal unsolvable subproblems rather than changing numbers of solutions
