t  drakengren and p  jonsson 1997 eight maximal tractable subclasses of allens algebra with metric time volume 7 pages 2545

this paper combines two important directions of research in temporal resoning that of finding maximal tractable subclasses of allens interval algebra and that of reasoning with metric temporal information eight new maximal tractable subclasses of allens interval algebra are presented some of them subsuming previously reported tractable algebras the algebras allow for metric temporal constraints on interval starting or ending points using the recent framework of horn dlrs two of the algebras can express the notion of sequentiality between intervals being the first such algebras admitting both qualitative and metric time
