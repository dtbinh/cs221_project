casebased planning cbp provides a way of scaling up    domainindependent planning to solve large problems in complex    domains  it replaces the detailed and lengthy search for a solution    with the retrieval and adaptation of previous planning experiences    in general cbp has been demonstrated to improve performance over    generative fromscratch planning  however the performance    improvements it provides are dependent on adequate judgements as to    problem similarity  in particular although cbp may substantially    reduce planning effort overall it is subject to a misretrieval    problem the success of cbp depends on these retrieval errors being    relatively rare this paper describes the design and implementation of    a replay framework for the casebased planner dersnlpebl dersnlpebl    extends current cbp methodology by incorporating explanationbased    learning techniques that allow it to explain and learn from the    retrieval failures it encounters  these techniques are used to refine    judgements about case similarity in response to feedback when a wrong    decision has been made  the same failure analysis is used in building    the case library through the addition of repairing cases large    problems are split and stored as single goal subproblems  multigoal    problems are stored only when these smaller cases fail to be merged    into a full solution  an empirical evaluation of this approach    demonstrates the advantage of learning from experienced retrieval    failure
