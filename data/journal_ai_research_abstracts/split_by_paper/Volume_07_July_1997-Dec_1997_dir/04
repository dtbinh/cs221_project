sequitur is an algorithm that infers a hierarchical    structure from a sequence of discrete symbols by replacing repeated    phrases with a grammatical rule that generates the phrase and    continuing this process recursively the result is a hierarchical    representation of the original sequence which offers insights into    its lexical structure the algorithm is driven by two constraints that    reduce the size of the grammar and produce structure as a byproduct     sequitur breaks new ground by operating incrementally moreover the    methods simple structure permits a proof that it operates in space    and time that is linear in the size of the input our implementation    can process 50000 symbols per second and has been applied to an    extensive range of real world sequences
