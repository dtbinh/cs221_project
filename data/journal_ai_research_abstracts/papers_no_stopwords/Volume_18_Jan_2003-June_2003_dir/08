bayesian belief networks grown prominence provide compact representations many problems probabilistic inference appropriate exploit compactness next step allow compact representations conditional probabilities variable given parents present representation exploits contextual independence terms parent contexts variables act parents may depend value variables internal representation terms contextual factors confactors simply pair context table contextual variable elimination standard variable elimination eliminates nonquery variables turn eliminating variable tables need multiplied depend context reduces standard variable elimination contextual independence structure exploit much efficient variable elimination structure exploit explain new method exploit structure previous methods structured belief network inference analogous uses trees
