recent emergence heavilyoptimized modal decision procedures highlighted key role empirical testing domain unfortunately introduction extensive empirical tests modal logics recent far none proposed test generators satisfactory cope fact present new random generation method provides benefits previous methods generating empirical tests fixes much generalizes one bestknown methods random cnfm test allowing generating much wider variety problems covering principle whole input space new method produces much suitable test sets current generation modal decision procedures analyze features new method means extensive collection empirical tests

independence study relevant given reasoning received increasing attention ai community consider two basic forms independence namely syntactic one semantic one features drawbacks particular syntactic form independence computationally easy check cases things intuitively relevant recognized consider forgetting ie distilling knowledge base part relevant set queries constructed subset alphabet process computationally hard allows simplification subsequent reasoning thus viewed form compilation relevant part knowledge base extracted reasoning tasks performed simplified
