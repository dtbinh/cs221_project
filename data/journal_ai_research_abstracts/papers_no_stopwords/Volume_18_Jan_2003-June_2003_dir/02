present probabilistic generative model timing deviations expressive music performance structure proposed model equivalent switching state space model switch variables correspond discrete note locations musical score continuous hidden variables denote tempo formulate two well known music recognition problems namely tempo tracking automatic transcription rhythm quantization filtering maximum posteriori map state estimation tasks exact computation posterior features map state intractable model class introduce monte carlo methods integration optimization compare markov chain monte carlo mcmc methods gibbs sampling simulated annealing iterative improvement sequential monte carlo methods particle filters simulation suggest better sequential methods methods applied online batch scenarios tempo tracking transcription thus potentially useful number music applications adaptive automatic accompaniment score typesetting music information retrieval
