easyhardeasy pattern difficulty combinatorial search problems constraints added explained due competition decrease number solutions increased pruning test generality explanation examining one predictions number solutions held fixed choice problems increased pruning lead monotonic decrease search cost instead easyhardeasy pattern median search cost even number solutions held constant search methods generalizes previous observations pattern shows existing theory explain full range peak search cost cases pattern appears due changes size minimal unsolvable subproblems rather changing numbers solutions
