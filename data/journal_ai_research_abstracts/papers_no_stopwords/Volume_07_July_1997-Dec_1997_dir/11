local search combinatorial search problems frequently encounter sequence states impossible improve value objective function moves regions called plateau moves dominate time spent local search analyze characterize plateaus three different classes randomly generated boolean satisfiability problems identify several interesting features plateaus impact performance local search local minima tend small occasionally may large local minima escaped without unsatisfying large number clauses systematically searching escape route may computationally expensive local minimum large plateaus exits called benches tend much larger minima benches exit states local search use escape solutions ie global minima randomly generated instances form clusters behave similarly local minima revisit several enhancements local search explain performance light finally discuss strategies creating next generation local search
