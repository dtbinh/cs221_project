present new modeling finite set domain constraint problems using reduced ordered binary decision diagrams robdds possible construct efficient set domain propagator compactly represents many set domains set constraints using robdds demonstrate robddbased provides unprecedented flexibility modeling constraint satisfaction problems leading performance improvements robddbased modeling extended modeling integer multiset constraint problems straightforward manner since domain propagation always practical incorporate less strict consistency notions robdd framework set bounds cardinality bounds lexicographic bounds consistency finally present experimental demonstrate robddbased solver performs better various conventional constraint solvers several standard set constraint problems
