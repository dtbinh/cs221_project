nonbinary constraint satisfaction csp solved directly using extended versions binary techniques alternatively nonbinary translated equivalent binary one case generally accepted translated solved applying wellestablished techniques binary csps evaluate applicability latter demonstrate use standard techniques binary csps encodings nonbinary problems problematic rarely competitive nonbinary representation overcome propose specialized arc consistency search binary encodings evaluate theoretically empirically consider three binary representations hidden variable encoding dual encoding double encoding theoretical empirical certain classes nonbinary constraints binary encodings competitive option many cases better one nonbinary representation
