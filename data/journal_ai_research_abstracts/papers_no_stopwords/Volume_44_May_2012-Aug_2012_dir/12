today mobile robots expected carry increasingly complex tasks multifarious realworld environments often tasks require certain semantic understanding workspace consider example spoken instructions human collaborator referring objects interest robot must able accurately detect objects correctly understand instructions however existing object detection competent perfect particular performance detection commonly sensitive position sensor relative objects scene

presents online learns explicit model spatial dependence object detection generates plans maximize expected performance detection extension overall plan performance crucially learned sensor model incorporates spatial correlations measurements capturing fact successive measurements taken nearby locations independent sensor model incorporated efficient forward search information space detected objects allowing robot generate motion plans efficiently investigate performance addressing tasks door text detection indoor environments demonstrate significant improvement detection performance task execution alternative methods simulated real robot experiments
