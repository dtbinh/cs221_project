distributions rankings used model data multitude real world settings preference analysis political elections modeling distributions presents several computational challenges however due factorial size set rankings item set challenges quite familiar artificial intelligence community compactly represent distribution combinatorially large space efficiently perform probabilistic inference representations respect ranking however additional challenge refer human task complexity users rarely willing provide full ranking long list candidates instead often preferring provide partial ranking information

simultaneously addressing challenges ie designing compactly representable model amenable efficient inference learned using partial ranking data difficult task necessary would scale problems nontrivial size recently proposed riffled independence assumptions cleanly efficiently address challenges particular establish tight mathematical connection concepts riffled independence partial rankings correspondence allows us develop efficient exact performing inference tasks using riffled independence represen tations partial rankings somewhat surprisingly shows efficient inference possible riffle independent certain sense observations take form partial rankings finally using inference introduce first method learning riffled independence partially ranked data
