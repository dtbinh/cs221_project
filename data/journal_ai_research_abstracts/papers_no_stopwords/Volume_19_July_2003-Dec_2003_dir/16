supply chain formation process determining structure terms exchange relationships enable multilevel multiagent production activity present simple model supply chains highlighting two characteristic features hierarchical subtask decomposition resource contention decentralize formation process introduce market price system resources produced along chain competitive equilibrium system agents choose locally optimal allocations respect prices outcomes optimal overall determine prices define market protocol distributed progressive auctions myopic nonstrategic agent bidding policies presence resource contention protocol produces better solutions greedy protocols common artificial intelligence multiagent systems literature protocol often converges highvalue supply chains competitive equilibria exist typically approximate competitive equilibria however complementarities agent production technologies cause protocol wastefully allocate inputs agents produce outputs subsequent decommitment phase recovers significant fraction lost surplus
