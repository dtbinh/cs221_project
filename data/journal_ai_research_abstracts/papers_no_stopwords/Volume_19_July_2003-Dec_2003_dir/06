consider twofold representing collective beliefs aggregating beliefs propose novel representation collective beliefs uses modular transitive relations possible worlds allow us represent conflicting opinions clear semantics thus improving upon quasitransitive relations often used social choice describe way construct belief state agent informed set sources varying degrees reliability construction circumvents arrows impossibility theorem satisfactory manner accounting explicitly encoded conflicts give simple settheorybased operator combining information multiple agents operator satisfies desirable invariants idempotence commutativity associativity thus wellbehaved iterated describe computationally effective way computing resulting belief state finally extend framework incorporate voting
