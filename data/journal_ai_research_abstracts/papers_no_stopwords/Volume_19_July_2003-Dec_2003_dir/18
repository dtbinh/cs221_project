despite near dominance heuristic state search planners still lag behind disjunctive planners generation parallel plans classical reason directly searching parallel solutions state space planners would require planners branch possible subsets parallel actions thus increasing branching factor exponentially present variant heuristic state search planner altalt called altaltp generates parallel plans using greedy online parallelization partial plans greedy significantly informed use novel distance heuristics altaltp derives graphplanstyle graph guaranteed provide optimal parallel plans empirical altaltp capable generating good quality parallel plans fraction cost incurred disjunctive planners
