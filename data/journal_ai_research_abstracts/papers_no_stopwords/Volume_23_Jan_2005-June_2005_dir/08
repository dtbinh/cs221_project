increased interest devising learning techniques combine unlabeled data labeled data ie semisupervised learning however best knowledge study performed across various techniques different types amounts labeled unlabeled data moreover published work semisupervised learning techniques assumes labeled unlabeled data come distribution possible labeling process associated selection bias distributions data points labeled unlabeled sets different correcting bias biased function approximation potentially poor performance present empirical study various semisupervised learning techniques variety datasets attempt answer various questions effect independence relevance amongst features effect size labeled unlabeled sets effect noise investigate impact sampleselection bias semisupervised learning techniques study implement bivariate probit technique particularly designed correct bias
