weighted constraint satisfaction wcsp framework allows representing solving problems involving hard constraints cost functions applied various problems including resource allocation bioinformatics scheduling etc solve problems solvers usually rely branchandbound equipped local consistency filtering mostly soft arc consistency however techniques well suited solve problems large domains motivated resolution rna gene localization inside large genomic sequences spirit bounds consistency large domains crisp csps introduce soft bounds arc consistency new weighted local consistency specifically designed wcsp large domains compared soft arc consistency bac provides significantly improved time space asymptotic complexity semantics cost functions exploited improve time complexity bac compare theory practice efficiency bac wcsp bounds consistency enforced crisp csp using cost variables two different real problems modeled wcsp including rna gene localization observe maintaining bounds arc consistency outperforms arc consistency improves bounds consistency enforced constraint model cost variables
