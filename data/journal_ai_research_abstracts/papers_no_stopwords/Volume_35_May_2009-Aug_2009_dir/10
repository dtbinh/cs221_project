present two learning structure markov network data gsmn gsimn use statistical independence tests infer structure successively constraining set structures consistent tests recently structure learning maximum likelihood estimation proved nphard markov networks due difficulty estimating parameters network needed computation data likelihood independencebased require computation likelihood thus gsmn gsimn compute structure efficiently shown experiments gsmn adaptation growshrink margaritis thrun learning structure bayesian networks gsimn extends gsmn additionally exploiting pearls wellknown properties conditional independence relation infer novel independences known ones thus avoiding performance statistical tests estimate accomplish efficiently gsimn uses triangle theorem introduced work simplified version set markov axioms experimental comparisons artificial realworld data sets gsimn yield significant savings respect gsmn generating markov network comparable cases improved quality compare gsimn forwardchaining implementation called gsimnfch produces possible conditional independences resulting repeatedly applying pearls theorems known conditional independence tests comparison gsimn sole use triangle theorem nearly optimal terms set independences tests infers
