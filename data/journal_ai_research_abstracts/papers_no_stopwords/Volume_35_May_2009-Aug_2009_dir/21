practically programming languages allow programmer split program several modules brings along several advantages software development interested area answerset programming fully declarative nonmonotonic languages applied context obtaining modular structure programs means straightforward since output entire program cannot general composed output components better understand effects disjunctive information modularity restrict scope analysis case disjunctive logic programs dlps subject stablemodel semantics define notion dlpfunction welldefined inputoutput interface provided establish novel module theorem indicates compositionality stablemodel semantics dlpfunctions module theorem extends wellknown splittingset theorem enables decomposition dlpfunctions given strongly connected components positive dependencies induced rules setting possible split shared disjunctive rules among components using generalized shifting technique concept modular equivalence introduced mutual comparison dlpfunctions using generalization translationbased verification method
