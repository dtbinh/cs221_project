last two decades modal description logics applied numerous areas computer science including knowledge representation formal verification database theory distributed computing recently semantic web ontologies reason automated reasoning modal description logics thoroughly investigated particular many approaches proposed efficiently handling satisfiability core normal modal logic km notational variant description logic alc although simple structure kmalc computationally hard reason satisfiability pspacecomplete

start exploring idea performing automated reasoning tasks modal description logics encoding sat handled stateoftheart sat tools previous approaches begin investigation satisfiability km propose efficient encoding test extensive set benchmarks comparing main stateoftheart tools available although encoding necessarily worstcase exponential experiments notice practice handle problems reach approaches performances comparable even better current stateoftheart tools
