investigate knowledge reasoning within simple framework called knowledge structure use variable forgetting basic operation one agent reason agents knowledge framework two notions namely agents observable variables weakest sufficient condition play important roles knowledge reasoning given background knowledge base set observable variables agent notion agent knowing formula defined weakest sufficient condition formula background knowledge base moreover capture notion common knowledge using generalized notion weakest sufficient condition public announcement operator conveniently dealt via notion knowledge structure explore computational complexity whether epistemic formula realized knowledge structure general case pspacehard however interesting subcases reduced conp finally discuss possible applications framework interesting domains automated analysis wellknown muddy children puzzle verification revised needhamschroeder protocol believe many scenarios natural presentation available information knowledge form knowledge structure makes valuable compared corresponding multiagent s5 kripke structure much succinct
