honorable mention 2012 ijcaijair best prize

many realworld decision making tasks require us choose among several expensive observations sensor network example important select subset sensors expected provide strongest reduction uncertainty medical decision making tasks one needs select tests administer deciding effective treatment general practice use heuristicguided procedures selecting observations present first efficient optimal selecting observations class probabilistic graphical example allow optimally label hidden variables hidden markov hmms provide selecting optimal subset observations obtaining optimal conditional observation plan

addition consider several extensions using scheduling observation selection multiple sensors demonstrate effectiveness several realworld datasets including prototype sensor network deployment energy conservation buildings
