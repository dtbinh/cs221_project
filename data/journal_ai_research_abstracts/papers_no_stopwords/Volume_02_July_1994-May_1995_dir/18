since inception artificial intelligence relied upon theoretical foundation centered around perfect rationality desired property intelligent systems argue others done foundation inadequate imposes fundamentally unsatisfiable requirements arisen wide gap theory practice ai hindering progress field propose instead property called bounded optimalityi roughly speaking agent boundedoptimal program solution constrained optimization presented architecture task environment construct agents property simple class machine architectures broad class realtime environments illustrate using simple model automated mail sorting facility define weaker property asymptotic bounded optimalityi abo generalizes notion optimality classical complexity theory construct universal abo programs ie programs abo matter realtime constraints applied universal abo programs used building blocks complex systems conclude discussion prospects bounded optimality theoretical basis ai relate similar trends philosophy economics game theory
