present propagationbased sat encoding combinatorial problems boolean equipropagation constraints modeled boolean functions propagate information equalities boolean literals information applied simplify cnf encoding constraints key factor considering small fragment constraint model one time enables us apply stronger even complete reasoning detect equivalent literals fragment detected equivalences apply simplify entire constraint model facilitate reasoning fragments equipropagation combination partial evaluation constraint simplification provide foundation powerful satbased finite domain constraint solving introduce tool called bee bengurion equipropagation encoder ideas demonstrate variety benchmarks leads considerable reduction size cnf encodings subsequent speedups sat solving times
