although use metric fluents fundamental many practical problems study heuristics support fully automated planners working fluents remains relatively unexplored widely used heuristic relaxation metric fluents intervalvalued variables idea first proposed decade ago heuristics depend domain encodings supply additional information fluents capacity constraints resourcerelated annotations

present heuristic numeric problems building propositional relaxed graph using mathematical program numeric reasoning define class producerconsumer problems demonstrate numeric constraints modelled mixed integer program mip mip combined metric relaxed graph rpg heuristic produce integrated hybrid heuristic mip tracks resource use accurately usual relaxation relaxes ordering actions rpg captures causal propositional aspects discuss two components interact produce single unified heuristic go explore numeric features problems integrated mip encoding limited subset propositional augment mip yield accurate guidance partly exploiting structure propositional landmarks propositional resources use heuristic enhances scalability problems numeric resource interaction key finding solution
