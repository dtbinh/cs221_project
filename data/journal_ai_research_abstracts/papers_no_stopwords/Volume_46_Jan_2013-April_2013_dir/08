bayesian network structure learning notoriously difficult discovering bayesian network optimally represents given set training data study computational worstcase complexity exact bayesian network structure learning graph theoretic restrictions directed superstructure superstructure undirected graph contains subgraphs skeletons solution networks introduce directed superstructure natural generalization undirected counterpart apply several variants scorebased bayesian network structure learning score network decomposes local scores nodes
