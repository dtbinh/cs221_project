anomaly detection regarded unsupervised learning task anomalies stem adversarial unlikely events unknown distributions however predictive performance purely unsupervised anomaly detection often fails match required detection rates many tasks exists need labeled data guide model generation first contribution shows classical semisupervised approaches originating supervised classifier inappropriate hardly detect new unknown anomalies argue semisupervised anomaly detection needs ground unsupervised learning paradigm devise novel meets requirement although intrinsically nonconvex optimization convex equivalent relatively mild assumptions additionally propose active learning strategy automatically filter candidates labeling empirical study network intrusion detection data observe proposed learning methodology requires much less labeled data stateoftheart achieving higher detection accuracies
