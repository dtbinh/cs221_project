minimum vertex cover mvc prominent nphard combinatorial optimization great importance theory application local search proved successful however two main drawbacks stateoftheart mvc local search first select pair vertices exchange simultaneously timeconsuming secondly although using edge weighting techniques diversify search lack mechanisms decreasing weights address issues propose two new strategies twostage exchange edge weighting forgetting twostage exchange strategy selects two vertices exchange separately performs exchange two stages strategy edge weighting forgetting increases weights uncovered edges decreases weights edge periodically two strategies used designing new mvc local search referred numvc
