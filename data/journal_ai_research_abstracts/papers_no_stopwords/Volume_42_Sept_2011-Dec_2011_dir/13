many problems artificial intelligence require adaptively making sequence decisions uncertain outcomes partial observability solving stochastic optimization problems fundamental notoriously difficult challenge introduce concept adaptive submodularity generalizing submodular set functions adaptive policies prove satisfies property simple adaptive greedy guaranteed competitive optimal policy addition providing performance guarantees stochastic maximization coverage adaptive submodularity exploited drastically speed greedy using lazy evaluations illustrate usefulness concept giving several examples adaptive submodular objectives arising diverse ai applications including management sensing resources viral marketing active learning proving adaptive submodularity problems allows us recover existing applications special cases improve approximation guarantees handle natural generalizations
