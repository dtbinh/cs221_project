value iteration powerful yet inefficient markov decision processes mdps puts majority effort backing entire state space turns unnecessary many cases order overcome many approaches proposed among ilao variants rtdp stateoftheart ones methods use reachability analysis heuristic search avoid unnecessary backups however none approaches build graphical structure state transitions preprocessing step use structural information systematically decompose whereby generating intelligent backup sequence state space present two optimal mdp first topological value iteration tvi detects structure mdps backs states topological sequences 1 divides mdp stronglyconnected components sccs 2 solves components sequentially tvi outperforms vi stateoftheart vastly mdp multiple closetoequalsized sccs second focused topological value iteration ftvi extension tvi ftvi restricts attention connected components relevant solving mdp specifically uses small amount heuristic search eliminate provably suboptimal actions pruning allows ftvi smaller connected components thus running faster demonstrate ftvi outperforms tvi order magnitude averaged across several domains surprisingly ftvi significantly outperforms popular heuristicallyinformed mdp ilao lrtdp brtdp bayesianrtdp many domains sometimes much two orders magnitude finally characterize type domains ftvi excels suggesting way informed choice solver
