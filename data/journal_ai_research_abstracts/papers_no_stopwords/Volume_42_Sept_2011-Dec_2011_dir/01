voting simple mechanism combine together preferences multiple agents unfortunately agents may try manipulate misreporting preferences one barrier might exist manipulation computational complexity particular shown nphard compute manipulate number different voting rules ever nphardness bounds worstcase complexity recent theoretical suggest manipulation may often easy practice empirical studies useful improving understanding issue consider two settings represent two types complexity identified area manipulation unweighted votes single agent manipulation weighted votes coalition agents first case consider single transferable voting stv second case consider veto voting stv one voting rules used practice nphard compute single agent manipulate votes unweighted appears one harder voting rules manipulate since involves multiple rounds hand veto voting one simplest representatives voting rules nphard compute coalition weighted agents manipulate experiments sample number distributions votes including uniform correlated real world elections many elections experiments easy compute manipulate prove manipulation impossible even able identify situation manipulation hard compute eg votes highly correlated election hung found computational difficulty computing manipulations somewhat precarious eg hung elections even single uncorrelated voter enough make manipulation easy compute
