major inference task bayesian networks explaining variables observed particular states using set target variables existing methods solving often generate explanations either simple underspecified complex overspecified introduce method called relevant explanation mre finds partial instantiation target variables maximizes generalized bayes factor gbf best explanation given evidence study shows gbf several theoretical properties enable mre automatically identify relevant target variables forming explanation particular conditional bayes factor cbf defined gbf new explanation conditioned existing explanation provides soft measure degree relevance variables new explanation explaining evidence given existing explanation mre able automatically prune less relevant variables explanation cbf able capture well explainingaway phenomenon often represented bayesian networks moreover define two dominance relations candidate solutions use relations generalize mre set top explanations diverse representative case studies several benchmark diagnostic bayesian networks mre often able explanatory hypotheses precise concise
