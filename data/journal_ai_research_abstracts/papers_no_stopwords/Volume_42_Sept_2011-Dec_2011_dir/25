adversarial multirobot patrol gained interest recent years mainly due immediate relevance various security applications robots required repeatedly visit target area way maximizes chances detecting adversary trying penetrate patrol path facing strong adversary knows patrol strategy robots robots use deterministic patrol many cases easy adversary penetrate undetected fact cases adversary guarantee penetration therefore presents nondeterministic patrol framework robots assuming strong adversary take advantage knowledge try penetrate patrols weakest spot hence optimal one maximizes chances detection point therefore present polynomialtime determining optimal patrol markovian strategy assumption robots probability detecting adversary patrols weakest spot maximized build upon framework describe optimal patrol strategy several robotic movement abilities directed undirected sensing abilities perfect imperfect different environment either patrol around perimeter closed polygon open fence open polyline
