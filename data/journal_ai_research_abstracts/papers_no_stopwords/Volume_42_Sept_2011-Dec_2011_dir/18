j pe241a 2011 finding consensus bayesian network structures 42 661687

suppose multiple experts learning provide us alternative bayesian network bn structures domain interested combining single consensus bn structure specifically interested consensus bn structure represents independences given bn structures agree upon parameters associated possible prove may exist several nonequivalent consensus bn structures finding one nphard thus decide resort heuristics approximated consensus bn structure consider heuristic proposed matzkevich abramson builds upon two called methods b efficiently deriving minimal directed independence map bn structure relative given node ordering methods b claimed correct although proof provided proof sketched methods b correct propose correction
