multiagent path challenging numerous reallife applications running centralized search combined state space units complete costoptimal scales poorly state space size exponential number mobile units traditional decentralized approaches far whca faster scalable decomposition however methods incomplete provide guarantees respect running time solution quality necessarily able tell reasonable time whether would succeed finding solution given instance

experiments run realistic game grid maps mapp solved 9986 mobile units 1822 better percentage far whca mapp marked 9882 units provably solvable first stage plan computation parts mapps computation reused across instances map speedwise mapp competitive significantly faster whca depending whether mapp performs computations scratch data mapp reuse preprocessed offline readily available mapp slower fast far factor 218 average mapps solutions average 20 longer fars solutions 731 longer whcas solutions
