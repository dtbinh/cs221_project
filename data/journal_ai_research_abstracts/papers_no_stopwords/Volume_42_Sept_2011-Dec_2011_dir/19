many artificial intelligence tasks cannot evaluated single quality criterion sort weighted combination needed provide system rankings weighted combination measures slight changes relative weights may produce substantial changes system rankings introduces unanimous improvement ratio uir measure complements standard metric combination criteria van rijsbergens fmeasure indicates robust measured differences changes relative weights individual metrics uir meant elucidate whether perceived difference two systems artifact individual metrics weighted

besides discussing theoretical foundations uir presents empirical confirm validity usefulness metric text clustering tradeoff precision recall metrics particularly sensitive weighting scheme used combine remarkably experiments uir used predictor well differences systems measured given test bed hold different test bed
