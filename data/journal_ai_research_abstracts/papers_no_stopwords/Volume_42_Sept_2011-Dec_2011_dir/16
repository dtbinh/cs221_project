article discusses two contributions decisionmaking complex partially observable stochastic games first apply two stateoftheart search techniques use montecarlo sampling task approximating nashequilibrium ne games namely montecarlo tree search mcts montecarlo counterfactual regret minimization mccfr mcts proven approximate ne perfectinformation games quickly finds reasonably strong strategy ne complex imperfect information game ie poker mccfr hand theoretical ne convergence guarantees game apply mccfr first time poker experiments may conclude mcts valid one wants learn reasonably strong strategies fast whereas mccfr better choice quality strategy important
