e talvitie singh 2011 learning make predictions partially observable environments without generative model 42 353392

faced learning model highdimensional environment common limit model make restricted set predictions thereby simplifying learning partial may directly useful making decisions may combined together form complete structured model however partially observable nonmarkov environments standard modellearning methods learn generative ie provide probability distribution possible futures pomdps straightforward restrict make certain predictions always simplify learning present prediction profile nongenerative partial partially observable systems make given set predictions therefore far simpler generative cases formalize learning prediction profile model transformation original modellearning empirically one learn prediction profile make small set important predictions even systems complex standard generative
