note considers modify bnbadopt wellknown optimally solving distributed constraint optimization problems double aim avoid sending redundant messages ii handle cost functions arity messages exchanged bnbadopt turned redundant removing redundant messages increases substantially communication efficiency number exchanged messages cases least three times fewer keeping measures almost unchanged termination optimality maintained hand handling nary cost functions addressed original work presence thresholds makes practical usage complex issues removing redundant messages efficiently handling nary cost functions combined producing new version bnbadopt experimentally benefits version original one
