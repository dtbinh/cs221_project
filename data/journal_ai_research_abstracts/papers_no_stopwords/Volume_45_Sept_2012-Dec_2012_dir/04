automatic extraction temporal relations event pairs important task several natural language processing applications question answering information extraction summarization since existing methods supervised require large corpora many languages exist concentrated efforts reduce need annotated data much possible presents two different towards goal first weakly supervised machine learning classification temporal relations events first stage learns general classifier annotated corpus inspired hypothesis one type temporal relation per discourse extracts useful information cluster topically related documents combining global information cluster local decisions general classifier bootstrapping crossdocument classifier built extract temporal relations events experiments without additional annotated data accuracy proposed higher several previous successful systems second proposed method temporal relation extraction expectation maximization em within em used different techniques greedy bestfirst search integer linear programming temporal inconsistency removal think experimental em first step toward fully unsupervised temporal relation extraction method encouraging
