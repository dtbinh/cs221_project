domestic professional sports leagues home stadiums located cities connected common train line running one direction instances incorporate geographical information determine optimal nearlyoptimal solutions nteam traveling tournament ttp nphard sports scheduling whose solution double roundrobin tournament schedule minimizes sum total distances traveled n teams

conclude applying linear distance relaxation general nonlinear nteam ttp instances develop fast approximate solutions simply assuming n teams lie straight line solving modified technique surprisingly generates distanceoptimal tournament benchmark sets 6 teams well closetooptimal schedules larger n even teams located around circle positioned threedimensional space
