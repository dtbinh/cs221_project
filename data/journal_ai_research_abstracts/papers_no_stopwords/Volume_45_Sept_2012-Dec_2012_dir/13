consider important safe exploration reinforcement learning reinforcement learning wellsuited domains complex transition dynamics highdimensional stateaction spaces additional challenge posed need safe efficient exploration traditional exploration techniques particularly useful solving dangerous tasks trial error process may lead selection actions whose execution states may damage learning system system consequently agent begins interaction dangerous highdimensional stateaction space important question arises namely avoid least minimize damage caused exploration stateaction space introduce pisrl safely improves suboptimal albeit robust behaviors continuous state action control tasks efficiently learns experience gained environment evaluate proposed method four complex tasks automatic car parking polebalancing helicopter hovering business management
