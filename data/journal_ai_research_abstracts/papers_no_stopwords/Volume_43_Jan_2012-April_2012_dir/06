zeng p doshi 2012 exploiting model equivalences solving interactive dynamic influence diagrams 43 211255

focus sequential decision making partially observable environments shared agents uncertain types similar conflicting objectives previously formalized multiple frameworks one interactive dynamic influence diagram idid generalizes wellknown influence diagram multiagent setting idids graphical may used compute policy agent given belief physical state others changes agent acts observes multiagent setting

may expect solving idids computationally hard predominantly due large space candidate ascribed agents exponential growth time present two methods reducing size model space stemming exponential growth methods involve aggregating individual equivalence classes first method groups together behaviorally equivalent selects updating predictive behaviors distinct others updated model space second method compacts model space focusing portions behavioral predictions specifically cluster actionally equivalent prescribe identical actions single time step exactly identifying equivalences would require us solve initial set avoid selectively solving thereby introducing approximation discuss error introduced approximation empirically demonstrate improved efficiency solving idids due equivalences
