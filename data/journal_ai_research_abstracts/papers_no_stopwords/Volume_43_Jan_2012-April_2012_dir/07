many combinatorial problems deal preferences violations goal solutions minimum cost weighted constraint satisfaction framework modeling problems consists set cost functions measure degree violation preferences different combinations variable assignments typical solution methods weighted constraint satisfaction problems wcsps branchandbound search made practical use powerful consistency techniques ac fdac edac deduce hidden cost information value pruning search techniques however designed efficient binary ternary cost functions represented table form tackling many reallife problems high arity global cost functions required investigate efficient representation scheme bring benefits consistency techniques high arity cost functions often derived hard global constraints classical constraint satisfaction

literature suggests global cost functions represented flow networks minimum cost flow used compute minimum costs networks polynomial time naive adoption flowbased algorithmic method global cost functions stronger form nullinverse consistency method modified handle cost projections extensions maintain generalized versions ac fdac cost functions two variables similar generalization stronger edac less straightforward reveal oscillation enforcing edac cost functions sharing one variable avoid oscillation propose weak version edac generalize weak edgac nonbinary cost functions using various benchmarks involving soft variants hard global constraints alldifferent gcc regular empirical demonstrate proposal gives improvements order magnitude compared traditional constraint optimization terms time pruning
