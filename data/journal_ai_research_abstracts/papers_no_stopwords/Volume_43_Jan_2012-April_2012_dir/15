achieve scalability query answering developers semantic web applications often forced use incomplete owl 2 reasoners fail derive answers least one query ontology data set lack completeness guarantees however may unacceptable applications areas health care defence missing answers adversely affect applications functionality furthermore even application tolerate level incompleteness often advantageous estimate many kind answers lost

thus provide theoretical practical foundation design future ontologybased information systems maximise scalability minimising even eliminating incompleteness query answers
