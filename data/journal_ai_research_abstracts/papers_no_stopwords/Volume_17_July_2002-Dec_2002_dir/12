alani deriche 2002 new technique combining multiple classifiers using dempstershafer theory evidence 17 333361

presents new classifier combination technique dempstershafer theory evidence dempstershafer theory evidence powerful method combining measures evidence different classifiers however since available methods estimates evidence classifiers limitations propose new implementation adapts training data overall mean square error minimized proposed technique shown outperform available classifier combination methods tested three different classification problems
