usual cooperative game theory outcome coalition formation process either grand coalition coalition structure consists disjoint coalitions however many domains coalitions associated tasks agent may involved executing one task thus may distribute resources among several coalitions tackle scenarios introduce model cooperative games overlapping coalitionsor overlapping coalition formation ocf games explore issue stability setting particular introduce notion core generalizes corresponding notion traditional nonoverlapping scenario quite general conditions characterize elements core element core maximizes social welfare introduce concept balancedness overlapping coalitional games use characterize coalition structures extended elements core finally generalize notion convexity setting natural assumptions convex games nonempty core moreover introduce two alternative notions stability ocf allow wider range deviations explore relationships among corresponding definitions core well classic nonoverlapping core aubin core illustrate general properties three cores study computational perspective thus obtaining additional insights fundamental structure
