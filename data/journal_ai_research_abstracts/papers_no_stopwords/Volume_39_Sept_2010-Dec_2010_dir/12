grids blocked unblocked cells often used represent terrain robotics video games however paths formed grid edges longer true shortest paths terrain since headings artificially constrained present two new correct complete anyangle pathplanning avoid shortcoming basic theta anglepropagation theta variants propagate information along grid edges without constraining paths grid edges basic theta simple understand implement fast finds short paths however guaranteed true shortest paths anglepropagation theta achieves better worstcase complexity per vertex expansion basic theta propagating angle ranges expands vertices complex fast finds slightly longer paths refer basic theta anglepropagation theta collectively theta theta unique properties analyze detail experimentally finds shorter paths postsmoothed paths field version know propagates information along grid edges without constraining paths grid edges runtime comparable grids finally extend theta grids contain unblocked cells nonuniform traversal costs introduce variants theta provide different tradeoffs path length runtime
