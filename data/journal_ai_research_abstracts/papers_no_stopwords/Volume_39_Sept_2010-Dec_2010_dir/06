realtime heuristic search satisfy constant bound amount per action independent size scale well problems become larger property would make well suited video games artificial intelligence controlled agents must react quickly user commands agents actions downside realtime search employ learning methods frequently lead poor solution quality cause agent appear irrational revisiting states repeatedly situation changed recently new lrta attempted eliminate learning automatically selecting subgoals lrta well poised video games except complex memorydemanding precomputation phase builds database subgoals propose simpler memoryefficient way precomputing subgoals thereby eliminating main obstacle applying stateoftheart realtime search methods video games new solves number randomly chosen problems offline compresses solutions series subgoals stores database presented novel online queries database similar previously solved case uses subgoals solve domain pathfinding four large video game maps new delivers solutions eight times better using 57 times less memory requiring 14 less precomputation time
