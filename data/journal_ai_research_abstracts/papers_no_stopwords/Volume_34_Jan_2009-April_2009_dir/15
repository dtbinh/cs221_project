coalition formation fundamental type interaction involves creation coherent groupings distinct autonomous agents order efficiently achieve individual collective goals forming effective coalitions major challenge field multiagent systems central endeavour determining many possible coalitions form order achieve goal usually requires calculating value every possible coalition known coalition value indicates beneficial coalition would formed values calculated agents usually need combination coalitions every agent belongs exactly one coalition overall outcome system maximized however coalition structure generation extremely challenging due number possible solutions need examined grows exponentially number agents involved date therefore many proposed solve using different techniques ranging dynamic programming integer programming stochastic search suffer major limitations relating execution time solution quality memory requirements

mind develop anytime solve coalition structure generation specifically uses novel representation search space partitions space possible solutions subspaces possible compute upper lower bounds values best coalition structures bounds used identify subspaces potential containing optimal solution pruned searches remaining subspaces efficiently using branchandbound technique avoid examining solutions within searched subspaces setting prove enumerates coalition structures efficiently avoiding redundant invalid solutions automatically moreover order effectively test develop new type input distribution allows us generate reliable benchmarks compared input distributions previously used field given new distribution 27 agents able solutions optimal 0175 time required fastest available literature anytime interrupted would normally terminated still provide solution guaranteed within bound optimal one moreover guarantees provide quality solution significantly better provided previous state art designed purpose example worst case distribution given 25 agents able 90 efficient solution around 10 time takes optimal solution
