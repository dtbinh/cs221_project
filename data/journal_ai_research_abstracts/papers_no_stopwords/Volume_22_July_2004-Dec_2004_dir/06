decentralized control cooperative systems captures operation group decision makers share single global objective difficulty solving optimally problems arises agents lack full observability global state system operate general shown nexpcomplete identify classes decentralized control problems whose complexity ranges nexp p particular study problems characterized independent transitions independent observations goaloriented objective functions two shown solve optimally useful classes goaloriented decentralized processes polynomial time studies information sharing among decisionmakers improve performance distinguish three ways agents exchange information indirect communication direct communication sharing state features controlled agents analysis shows every class problems consider introducing direct indirect communication change worstcase complexity provide better understanding complexity decentralized control problems arise practice facilitate development problems
