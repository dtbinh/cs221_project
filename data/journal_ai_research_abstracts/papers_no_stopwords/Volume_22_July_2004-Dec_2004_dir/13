multiagent learning necessary yet challenging multiagent systems become prevalent environments become dynamic much groundbreaking work area draws notable game theory particular concept nash equilibria learners directly learn equilibrium obviously rely existence learners instead seek play optimally respect players depend upon equilibria since equilibria fixed points learning another perspective agents limitations real common may undesired physical limitations well selfimposed rational limitations abstraction approximation techniques used make learning tractable article explores interactions two important concepts equilibria limitations learning introduce question whether equilibria continue exist agents limitations look general effects limitations agent behavior define natural extension equilibria accounts limitations using formalization make three major contributions counterexample general existence equilibria limitations ii sufficient conditions limitations preserve existence iii three general classes games limitations satisfy conditions present empirical specific multiagent learning applied specific instance limited agents demonstrate learning limitations feasible conditions outlined theoretical analysis hold
