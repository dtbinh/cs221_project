many researchers artificial intelligence beginning explore use soft constraints express set possibly conflicting requirements soft constraint function defined collection variables associates measure desirability possible combination values variables however crucial question computational complexity finding optimal solution collection soft constraints far received little attention identify class soft binary constraints finding optimal solution tractable words given set constraints exists polynomial time determine assignment best overall combined measure desirability tractable class includes many commonlyoccurring soft constraints near possible soon possible well crisp constraints greater finally tractable class maximal sense adding form soft binary constraint class gives rise class problems nphard
