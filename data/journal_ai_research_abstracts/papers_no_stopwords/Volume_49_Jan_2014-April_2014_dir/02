many real life problems solved constraint programming come uncertain dynamic environments dynamism original may change time thus solution found original may become invalid reason dealing problems become important issue fields constraint programming cases exist extant knowledge uncertain dynamic environment cases information fragmentary unknown extend concept robustness stability constraint satisfaction problems csps ordered domains limited assumptions need made possible changes present search searches robust stable solutions csps nature wellknown meeting criteria simultaneously desirable objective constraint solving uncertain dynamic environments present compelling evidence search outperforms generalpurpose dynamic csps using random instances benchmarks derived real life problems
