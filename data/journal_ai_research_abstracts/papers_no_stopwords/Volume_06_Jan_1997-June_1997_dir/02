previous approaches analyzing spontaneously spoken language often encoding syntactic semantic knowledge manually symbolically progress using statistical connectionist language many current spoken language systems still use relatively brittle handcoded symbolic grammar symbolic semantic component contrast describe socalled screening learning robust processing spontaneously spoken language screening flat analysis uses shallow sequences category representations analyzing utterance various syntactic semantic dialog levels rather using deeply structured symbolic analysis use flat connectionist analysis screening aims supporting speech language processing using 1 datadriven learning 2 robustness connectionist networks order test developed screen system new robust learned flat analysis focus detailed description screens architecture flat syntactic semantic analysis interaction speech recognizer detailed evaluation analysis robustness influence noisy incomplete input main flat representations allow robust processing spontaneous spoken language deeply structured representations particular faulttolerance learning capability connectionist networks support flat analysis providing robust spokenlanguage processing within overall hybrid symbolicconnectionist framework
