motivated realworld study novel budgeted optimization goal optimize unknown function f given budget requesting sequence samples function setting however evaluating function precisely specified points practically possible due prohibitive costs instead request constrained experiments constrained experiment denoted q specifies subset input space experimenter sample function outcome q includes sampled experiment x function output fx importantly constraints q become looser cost fulfilling request decreases uncertainty location x increases goal manage tradeoff selecting set constrained experiments best optimize f within budget study two different settings nonsequential batch setting set constrained experiments selected sequential setting experiments selected one time evaluate proposed methods settings using synthetic real functions experimental demonstrate efficacy proposed methods
