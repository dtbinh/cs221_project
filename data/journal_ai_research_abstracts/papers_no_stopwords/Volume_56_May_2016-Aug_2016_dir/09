two essential tasks managing description logic knowledge bases eliminating problematic axioms incorporating newly formed ones elimination incorporation formalised operations contraction revision belief change deal contraction revision dllite family modeltheoretic standard description logic semantics yields infinite number dllite knowledge bases thus difficult develop contraction revision involve dl key introduction alternative semantics called type semantics replace standard semantics characterising standard inference tasks dllite type semantics several advantages standard one succinct importantly finite signature semantics always yields finite number define modelbased contraction revision functions dllite knowledge bases type semantics provide representation theorems finally finiteness succinctness type semantics allow us develop tractable instantiating functions
