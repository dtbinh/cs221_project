describes series new qualitative spatial logics checking consistency sameas partof matches spatial objects different geospatial datasets especially crowdsourced datasets since geometries crowdsourced data usually accurate precise buffer geometries margin error level tolerance define spatial relations buffered geometries spatial logics formalize notions buffered equal intuitively corresponding possibly sameas buffered part possibly partof near possibly connected far definitely disconnected sound complete axiomatisation logic provided respect metric spaces logics satisfiability shown npcomplete finally briefly describe logics used system generating debugging matches spatial objects report positive experimental evaluation system
