addresses computing goal orderings one longstanding issues ai makes two new contributions first formally defines discusses two different goal orderings called reasonable forced ordering orderings defined simple strips operators well complex adl operators supporting negation conditional effects complexity orderings investigated practical relevance discussed secondly two different methods compute reasonable goal orderings developed one graphs investigates set actions directly finally shown ordering relations derived given set goals g used compute socalled goal agenda divides g ordered set subgoals planner principle use goal agenda plan increasing sets subgoals lead exponential complexity reduction solution complex found solving easier subproblems since polynomial overhead caused goal agenda computation potential exists dramatically speed demonstrate empirical evaluation use method ipp planner
