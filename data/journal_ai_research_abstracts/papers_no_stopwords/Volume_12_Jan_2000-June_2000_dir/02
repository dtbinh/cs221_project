introduce temporal model reasoning disjunctive metric constraints intervals time points temporal contexts temporal model composed labeled temporal algebra reasoning labeled temporal algebra defines labeled disjunctive metric pointbased constraints disjunct input disjunctive constraint univocally associated label reasoning manage labeled constraints associated label lists sets mutually inconsistent disjuncts guarantee consistency obtain minimal network additionally constraints organized hierarchy alternative temporal contexts therefore reason contextdependent disjunctive metric constraints intervals points moreover model able represent nonbinary constraints logical dependencies disjuncts constraints handled computational cost reasoning exponential accordance underlying complexity although improvements proposed
