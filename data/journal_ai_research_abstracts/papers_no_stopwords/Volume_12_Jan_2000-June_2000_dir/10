recent approaches extending graphplan handle expressive formalisms raise question formal meaning expressive power formalize intuition expressive power measure concisely domains plans expressed particular formalism introducing notion compilation schemes formalisms using notion analyze expressiveness large family propositional formalisms ranging basic strips formalism conditional effects partial state specifications propositional formulae preconditions one conditional effects cannot compiled away plan size grow linearly compiled away allow polynomial growth resulting plans confirms recently proposed extensions graphplan concerning conditional effects optimal respect compilability framework another general propositional formulae cannot compiled conditional effects plan size preserved linearly implies allowing general propositional formulae preconditions effect conditions adds another level difficulty generating plan
