major machine learning inductive bias choose learners hypothesis space large enough contain solution learnt yet small enough ensure reliable generalization reasonablysized training sets typically bias supplied hand skill insights experts model automatically learning bias investigated central assumption model learner embedded within environment related learning tasks within environment learner sample multiple tasks hence search hypothesis space contains good solutions many problems environment certain restrictions set hypothesis spaces available learner hypothesis space performs well sufficiently large number training tasks perform well learning novel tasks environment explicit bounds derived demonstrating learning multiple tasks within environment related tasks potentially give much better generalization learning single task
