solving instances domains feature large branching factor may generate large number nodes whose cost greater cost optimal solution designate nodes surplus generating surplus nodes adding open list may dominate time memory search recently introduced variant called partial expansion pea deals memory aspect expanding node n pea generates children puts open children f f n n reinserted open list f cost best discarded child guarantees surplus nodes inserted open

present novel variant called enhanced partial expansion epea advances idea pea address time aspect given priori domain heuristic specific knowledge epea generates nodes f fn although epea always applicable practical study several variants epea make applicable large number domains heuristics particular ideas epea applicable ida domains pattern databases traditionally used experimental studies significant improvements runtime memory performance several standard benchmark applications provide several theoretical studies facilitate understanding new
