transition probability matrix represented product two stochastic matrices one swap factors multiplication obtain another transition matrix retains fundamental characteristics original since derived matrix much smaller precursor property exploited create compact version markov decision process mdp hence reduce computational cost dynamic programming building idea presents approximate policy iteration called policy iteration stochastic factorization pisf short terms computational complexity pisf replaces standard policy iterations cubic dependence size mdp function grows linearly number states model proposed enjoys nice theoretical properties always terminates finite number iterations returns decision policy whose performance depends quality stochastic factorization particular approximation error factorization sufficiently small pisf computes optimal value function mdp discusses practical ways factoring mdp illustrates usefulness proposed application involving largescale decision real economical interest
