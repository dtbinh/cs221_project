attackerdefender stackelberg security games ssgs emerged important area multiagent systems however existing ssgs yield fixed static schedules fail dynamic domains defenders face execution uncertainty ie domains defenders may face unanticipated disruptions schedules concrete example application involving checking fares trains defenders schedule frequently interrupted fare evaders making static schedules useless

address shortcoming provides four main contributions first present novel general bayesian stackelberg game model security resource allocation dynamic uncertain domains new model execution uncertainty handled using markov decision process mdp generating defender policies second study computing stackelberg equilibrium game exploit structure reduce polynomialsized optimization shifting evaluation third contribution shows simulation mdpbased policies overcome failures previous ssg build complete system enables handling schedule interruptions consequently conduct first controlled experiments ssgs field hence final contribution present realworld experiment metro trains los angeles validating mdpbased model importantly concretely measuring benefits ssgs security resource allocation
