many circumstances multiple agents need make joint decision voting used aggregate agents preferences agents vote carries weight sum weights agents favor outcome larger equal given quota outcome decided upon distribution weights leads certain distribution power several power indices proposed measure power socalled inverse given target distribution power asked come game form quota plus assignment weights players whose power distribution close possible target distribution according speci ed distance measure

first present doubly exponential enumerating set simple games improve class weighted voting games obtain quadratic exponential ie 2on2 enumerating improved runs outputpolynomial time making fastest possible enumeration polynomial factor finally propose exact anytimealgorithm runs exponential time power index weighted voting game design inverse implement nd weighted voting game normalized banzhaf power distribution closest target power index perform experiments obtain insights set weighted voting games remark applicable optimizing exponentialtime computable function distance normalized banzhaf index target power index merely taken example
