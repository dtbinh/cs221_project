bhansali g kramer j hoar 1996 principled towards symbolic geometric constraint satisfaction 4 419443

important geometric reasoning configuration collection geometric bodies satisfy set given constraints recently suggested solved efficiently symbolically reasoning geometry called degrees freedom analysis employs set specialized routines called plan fragments specify change configuration set bodies satisfy new constraint preserving existing constraints potential drawback limits scalability concerned difficulty writing plan fragments address limitation showing plan fragments automatically synthesized using first principles geometric bodies actions topology
