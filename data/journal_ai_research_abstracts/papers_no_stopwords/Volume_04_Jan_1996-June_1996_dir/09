termination logic programs negated body atoms called general logic programs important topic one reason many computational mechanisms used process negated atoms clarks negation failure chans constructive negation termination conditions introduces methodology proving termination general logic programs wrt prolog selection rule idea distinguish parts program depending whether termination depends selection rule end notions low weakly upacceptable program introduced use notions develop methodology proving termination general logic programs interesting problems nonmonotonic reasoning formalized implemented means terminating general logic programs
