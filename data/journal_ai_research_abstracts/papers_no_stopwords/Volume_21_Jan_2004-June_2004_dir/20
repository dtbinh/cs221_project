address finding shortest path two points unknown real physical environment traveling agent must move around environment explore unknown territory introduce physicala pha solving pha expands mandatory nodes would expand returns shortest path two points however due physical nature complexity measured traveling effort moving agent number generated nodes standard pha presented twolevel high level chooses next node expanded low level directs agent node order explore present number variations highlevel lowlevel procedures evaluate performance theoretically experimentally travel cost best variation fairly close optimal travel cost assuming mandatory nodes known advance generalize multiagent case number cooperative agents designed solve specifically provide experimental implementation system noted addressed navigation rather finding shortest path two points future usage
