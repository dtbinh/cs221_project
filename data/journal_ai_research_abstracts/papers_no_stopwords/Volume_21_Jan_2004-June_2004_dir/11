nondeductive reasoning systems often representation dependent representing situation two different ways may cause system return two different answers viewed significant example principle maximum entropyhas subjected much criticism due representation dependence however almost work investigating representation dependence formalize notion specific maximum entropy fact representationindependent probabilistic inference procedure ignores irrelevant information essentially entailment precise sense moreover representation independence incompatible even weak default assumption independence invariance restricted class representation changes form reasonable compromise representation independence desiderata provide construction family inference procedures provides restricted representation independence using relative entropy
