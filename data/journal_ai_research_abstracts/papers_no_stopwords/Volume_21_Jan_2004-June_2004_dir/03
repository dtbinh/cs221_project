discusses interested party wishes influence behavior agents game multiagent interaction control interested party cannot design new game cannot enforce agents behavior cannot enforce payments agents cannot prohibit strategies available agents however influence outcome game committing nonnegative monetary transfers different strategy profiles may selected agents interested party assumes agents rational commonly agreed sense use dominated strategies hence certain subset outcomes implemented given game adding nonnegative payments rational players necessarily produce outcome subset obviously making sufficiently big payments one implement desirable outcome question cost implementation introduce notion kimplementation desired set strategy profiles k stands amount payment need actually made order implement desirable outcomes major point kimplementation monetary offers need necessarily materialize following desired behaviors define study kimplementation contexts games complete incomplete information latter case mainly focus vcg games setting later extended deal mixed strategies using correlation devices together introduces studies implementation desirable outcomes reliable party cannot modify game rules ie provide protocols complementing previous work mechanism design making applicable many realistic cs settings
