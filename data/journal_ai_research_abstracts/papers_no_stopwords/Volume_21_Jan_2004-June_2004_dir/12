writing constraint program choose variables decision variables represent constraints variables many cases considerable choice decision variables consider example permutation problems many values variables variable takes unique value problems choose primal dual viewpoint dual viewpoint dual variable represents one primal values whilst dual value represents one primal variables alternatively means channelling constraints link primal dual variables combined model sets variables perform extensive theoretical empirical study primal dual combined two classes problems permutation problems injection problems often advantageous use multiple viewpoints constraints channel maintain consistency illustrate general methodology comparing different constraint
