map finding probable instantiation set variables given evidence map always perceived significantly harder related problems computing probability variable instantiation pr computing probable explanation mpe investigates complexity map bayesian networks specifically map complete nppp provide negative complexity variable elimination map remains hard even mpe pr become easy example map npcomplete networks restricted polytrees even effectively approximated given difficulty computing map exactly difficulty approximating map providing useful guarantees resulting approximation investigate best effort approximations introduce generic map approximation framework provide two instantiations framework one networks amenable exact inference pr one networks even exact inference hard allows map approximation networks complex even exactly solve easier problems pr mpe experimental indicate using approximation provides much better solutions standard techniques provide accurate map estimates many cases
