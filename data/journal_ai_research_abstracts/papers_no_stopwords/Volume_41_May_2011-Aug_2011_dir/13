local search applied optimization problems often suffer getting trapped local optimum common solution deficiency restart progress observed alternatively one start multiple instances local search allocate computational resources particular processing time instances depending behavior hence multistart strategy decide dynamically allocate additional resources particular instance start new instances propose multistart strategies motivated works multiarmed bandit problems lipschitz optimization unknown constant strategies continuously estimate potential performance instance supposing convergence rate local search unknown constant every phase allocate resources instances could converge optimum particular range constant asymptotic bounds given performance strategies particular prove quadratic increase number times target function evaluated needed achieve performance local search started attraction region optimum experiments provided using spsa simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation kmeans local search indicate proposed strategies work well practice cases studied need logarithmically evaluations target function opposed theoretically suggested quadratic increase
