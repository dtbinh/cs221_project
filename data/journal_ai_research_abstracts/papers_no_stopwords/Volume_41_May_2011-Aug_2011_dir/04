many combinatorial problems one may need model diversity similarity assignments solution example one may wish maximise minimise number distinct values solution formulate problems type use soft variants well known alldifferent allequal constraints present taxonomy six soft global constraints generated combining two latter ones two standard cost functions either maximised minimised characterise complexity achieving arc bounds consistency constraints resolving cases nphardness neither proven disproven particular explore depth constraint ensuring least k pairs variables common value achieving arc consistency nphard however achieving bounds consistency done polynomial time dynamic programming moreover maximum number pairs equal variables approximated factor 12 linear time greedy finally provide fixed parameter tractable respect number values appearing two distinct domains interestingly taxonomy shows enforcing equality harder enforcing difference
