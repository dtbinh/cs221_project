system behaves abnormally sequential diagnosis takes sequence measurements system faults causing abnormality identified goal reduce diagnostic cost defined number measurements propose measurement points previous work employs heuristic reducing entropy computed set diagnoses generally good performance terms diagnostic cost fail diagnose large systems set diagnoses large focusing smaller set probable diagnoses scales generally leads increased average diagnostic costs propose new diagnostic framework employing four new techniques scales much larger systems good performance terms diagnostic cost

first propose new heuristic measurement point selection computed efficiently without requiring set diagnoses system modeled bayesian network compiled logical form known ddnnf second extend hierarchical diagnosis technique system abstraction previous work handle probabilities applied sequential diagnosis allow larger systems diagnosed third largest systems even hierarchical diagnosis fails propose novel method converts system one smaller abstraction whose diagnoses form superset original system new system diagnosed mapped back original system finally propose novel cost estimation function used choose abstraction system likely provide optimal average cost experiments iscas85 benchmark circuits indicate scales circuits suite except one flat structure susceptible useful abstraction
