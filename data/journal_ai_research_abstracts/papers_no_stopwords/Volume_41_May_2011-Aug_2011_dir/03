address costsensitive feature acquisition misclassifying instance costly expected misclassification cost reduced acquiring values missing features acquiring features costly well objective acquire right set features sum feature acquisition cost misclassification cost minimized describe value information lattice voila optimal efficient feature subset acquisition framework unlike common practice acquire features greedily voila reason subsets features voila efficiently searches space possible feature subsets discovering exploiting conditional independence properties features reuses probabilistic inference computations speed process empirical evaluation five medical datasets greedy strategy often reluctant acquire features cannot forecast benefit acquiring multiple features combination
