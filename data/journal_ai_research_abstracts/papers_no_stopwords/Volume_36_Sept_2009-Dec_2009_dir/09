nash equilibrium ne strategy profile resilient unilateral deviations predominantly used analysis multiagent systems downside ne necessarily stable deviations coalitions yet cases ne exhibit stability coalitional deviations benefits joint deviation bounded sense ne approximates strong equilibrium

indicate lpt performs better general ne however lpt best possible approximation particular present polynomial time approximation scheme ptas makespan minimization provides schedule irmin 1epsilon given epsilon respect computational complexity given ne 3 identical machines 2 unrelated machines nphard determine whether given coalition deviate every member decreases cost
