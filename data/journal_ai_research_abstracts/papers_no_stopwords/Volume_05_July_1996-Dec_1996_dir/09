new method proposed exploiting causal independencies exact bayesian network inference bayesian network viewed representing factorization joint probability multiplication set conditional probabilities present notion causal independence enables one factorize conditional probabilities combination even smaller factors consequently obtain finergrain factorization joint probability new formulation causal independence lets us specify conditional probability variable given parents terms associative commutative operator sum max contribution parent start simple bayesian network inference given evidence query variable uses factorization posterior distribution query extended exploit causal independence empirical studies cpcs networks medical diagnosis method efficient previous methods allows inference larger networks previous
