describes extension constraint satisfaction csp called muse csp multiply segmented constraint satisfaction extension especially useful problems segment multiple sets partially shared variables problems arise naturally signal processing applications including computer vision speech processing handwriting recognition applications often difficult segment data one way given lowlevel information utilized segmentation muse csp used compactly represent several similar instances constraint satisfaction multiple instances csp common variables domains constraints combined single instance muse csp reducing work required apply constraints introduce concepts muse node consistency muse arc consistency muse path consistency demonstrate muse csp used compactly represent lexically ambiguous sentences multiple sentence hypotheses often generated speech recognition grammar constraints used provide parses syntactically correct sentences muse arc path consistency provided finally discuss create muse csp set csps labeled indicate variable shared single csp
