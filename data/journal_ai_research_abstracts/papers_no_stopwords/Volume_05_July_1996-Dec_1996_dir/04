gerevini l schubert 1996 accelerating partialorder planners techniques effective search control pruning 5 95137

propose domainindependent techniques bringing wellfounded partialorder planners closer practicality first two techniques aimed improving search control keeping overhead costs low one simple adjustment default heuristic used ucpop select plans refinement preferring zero commitment forced plan refinements whenever possible using lifo prioritization otherwise radical technique use operator parameter domains prune search domains initially computed definitions operators initial goal conditions using polynomialtime propagates sets constants operator graph starting initial conditions parameter domains used prune nonviable operator instances remove spurious clobbering threats experiments modifications ucpop improved plan goal selection strategies gave speedups factors ranging 5 1000 variety problems nontrivial unmodified version crucially hardest problems gave greatest improvements pruning technique parameter domains often gave speedups order magnitude difficult problems default ucpop search strategy improved strategy lisp code techniques test problems provided online appendices
