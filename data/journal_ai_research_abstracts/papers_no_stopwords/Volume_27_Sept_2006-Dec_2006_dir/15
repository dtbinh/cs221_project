allocating scarce resources among agents maximize global utility general computationally challenging focus problems resources enable agents execute actions stochastic environments modeled markov decision processes mdps value resource bundle defined expected value optimal mdp policy realizable given resources present simultaneously solves resourceallocation policyoptimization problems allows us avoid explicitly representing utilities exponentially many resource bundles leading drastic often exponential reductions computational complexity use context selfinterested agents design combinatorial auction allocating resources empirically demonstrate effectiveness showing minutes optimally solve problems straightforward combinatorial resourceallocation technique would require agents enumerate 2100 resource bundles auctioneer solve npcomplete input size
