sequential decisionmaking problems multiple objectives arise naturally practice pose unique challenges decisiontheoretic learning largely focused singleobjective settings article surveys designed sequential decisionmaking problems multiple objectives though growing body literature subject little makes explicit circumstances special methods needed solve multiobjective problems therefore identify three distinct scenarios converting singleobjective one impossible infeasible undesirable furthermore propose taxonomy classifies multiobjective methods according applicable scenario nature scalarization function projects multiobjective values scalar ones type policies considered factors determine nature optimal solution single policy convex hull pareto front using taxonomy survey literature multiobjective methods learning finally discuss key applications methods outline opportunities future work
