learning bayesian network structure optimizes scoring function given dataset viewed shortest path implicit statespace search graph perspective highlights importance two issues development search strategies solving shortest path design heuristic functions guiding search introduces several techniques addressing issues one search learns optimal bayesian network structure searching promising part solution space others mainly two heuristic functions first heuristic function represents simple relaxation acyclicity constraint bayesian network although admissible consistent heuristic may introduce much relaxation loose bound second heuristic function reduces amount relaxation avoiding directed cycles within groups variables empirical methods constitute promising learning optimal bayesian network structures
