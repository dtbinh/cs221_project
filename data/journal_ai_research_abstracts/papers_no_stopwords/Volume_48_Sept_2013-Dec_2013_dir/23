proposes formalization implementation novel class constraints aimed modeling problems related placement multibody systems 3dimensional space multibody system composed body elements connected joint relationships constrained geometric properties emphasis investigation use multibody systems model native conformations protein structureswhere body represents entity protein eg amino acid small peptide geometric constraints related spatial properties composing atoms explores use proposed class constraints support variety different structural analysis proteins loop modeling structure prediction

declarative nature constraintbased encoding provides elaboration tolerance ability make use additional knowledge analysis studies filtering capabilities proposed constraints allow control number representative solutions withdrawn conformational space protein means criteria driven uniform distribution sampling principles scenario possible select desired degree precision andor number solutions filtering component automatically excludes configurations violate spatial geometric properties composing multibody system illustrates implementation constraint solver multibody perspective empirical evaluation protein structure analysis problems
