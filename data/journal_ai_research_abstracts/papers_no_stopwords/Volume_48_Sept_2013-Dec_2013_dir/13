recent years stackelberg security games successfully applied solve resource allocation scheduling problems several security domains however previous work mostly assumed targets stationary relative defender attacker leading discrete game finite numbers pure strategies contrast focuses protecting mobile targets leads continuous set strategies players motivated several realworld domains including protecting ferries escort boats protecting refugee supply lines contributions include new game model multiple mobile defender resources moving targets discretized strategy space defender continuous strategy space attacker ii efficient linearprogrammingbased solution uses compact representation defenders mixed strategy accurately modeling attackers continuous strategy using novel subinterval analysis method iii discussion analysis multiple heuristic methods equilibrium refinement improve robustness defenders mixed strategy iv discussion approaches sample actual defender schedules defenders mixed strategy iv detailed experimental analysis ferry protection domain
