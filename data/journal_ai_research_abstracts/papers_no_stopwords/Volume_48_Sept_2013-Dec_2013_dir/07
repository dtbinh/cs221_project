sparql query language currently extended world wide web consortium w3c socalled entailment regimes entailment regime defines queries evaluated expressive semantics sparqls standard simple entailment subgraph matching queries expressive since variables occur within complex concepts bind concept role names

provide prototypical implementation evaluate efficiency proposed optimizations experimental study shows static ordering usually outperforms dynamic one accurate statistics available changes however statistics less accurate eg due nondeterministic reasoning decisions queries go beyond conjunctive instance queries observe improvement three orders magnitude due proposed optimizations
