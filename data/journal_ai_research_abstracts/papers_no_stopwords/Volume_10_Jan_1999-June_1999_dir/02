previously developed quantum search solving 1sat problems single step generalized apply range highly constrained ksat problems identify bound number clauses satisfiability problems generalized solution constant number steps number variables increases performance contrasts linear growth number steps required best classical exponential number required classical quantum methods ignore structure cases guarantee insoluble problems fact solutions unlike previously proposed quantum search
