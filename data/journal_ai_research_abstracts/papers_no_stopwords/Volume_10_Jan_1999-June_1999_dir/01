order magnitude reasoning reasoning rough comparisons sizes quantities often called back envelope calculation implication calculations quick though approximate exhibits interesting class constraint sets order magnitude reasoning demonstrably fast specifically present polynomialtime solve set constraints form points b much closer together points c prove applied much closer together interpreted either referring infinite difference scale referring finite difference scale long difference scale greater number variables constraint set prove firstorder theory constraints decidable
