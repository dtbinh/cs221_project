decentralized partially observable markov decision processes decpomdps provide general model decisionmaking uncertainty decentralized settings difficult solve optimally nexpcomplete new way solving problems introduce idea transforming decpomdp continuousstate deterministic mdp piecewiselinear convex value function makes use fact accomplished centralized offline manner execution still decentralized new decpomdp formulation call occupancy mdp allows powerful pomdp continuousstate mdp methods used first time provide scalability refine combining heuristic search compact representations exploit structure present multiagent domains without losing ability converge optimal solution particular introduce featurebased heuristic search value iteration fbhsvi relies featurebased compact representations pointbased updates efficient action selection theoretical analysis demonstrates fbhsvi terminates finite time optimal solution include extensive empirical analysis using wellknown benchmarks thereby demonstrating provides significant scalability improvements compared state art
