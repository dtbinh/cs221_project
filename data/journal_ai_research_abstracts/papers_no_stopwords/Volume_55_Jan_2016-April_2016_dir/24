modelbased diagnosis mbd principled domainindependent way analyzing system examination behaving expected given abstract description model systems components behavior functioning normally mbd techniques rely observations actual system behavior reason possible causes discrepancies expected observed behavior due generality mbd successfully applied variety application domains last decades

many application domains mbd testing different hypotheses reasons failure computationally costly eg complex simulations system behavior performed work therefore propose different schemes parallelizing diagnostic reasoning process order better exploit capabilities modern multicore computers propose systematically evaluate parallelization schemes reiters hitting set finding leading minimal diagnoses using two different conflict detection techniques furthermore perform initial experiments basic depthfirst search strategy assess potential parallelization searching one single diagnosis finally test effects parallelizing direct encodings diagnosis constraint solver
