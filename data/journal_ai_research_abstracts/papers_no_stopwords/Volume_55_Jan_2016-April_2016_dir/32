dynamic bayesian networks dbns general model stochastic processes partially observed states belief filtering dbns task inferring belief state ie probability distribution process states incomplete noisy observations hard complex processes large state spaces article explore idea accelerating filtering task automatically exploiting causality process consider specific type causal relation called passivity pertains state variables cause changes variables present passivitybased selective belief filtering psbf method maintains factored belief representation exploits passivity perform selective updates belief factors psbf produces exact belief states certain assumptions approximate belief states otherwise approximation error bounded degree uncertainty process empirically synthetic processes varying sizes degrees passivity psbf faster several alternative methods achieving competitive accuracy furthermore demonstrate passivity occurs naturally complex system multirobot warehouse psbf exploit accelerate filtering task
