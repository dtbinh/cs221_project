investigates crosslingual transfer parsing aiming inducing dependency parsers lowresource languages using training data resourcerich language eg english existing model transfer approaches typically dont include lexical features transferable across languages bridge lexical feature gap using distributed feature representations composition provide two inducing crosslingual distributed representations words map vocabularies two different languages common vector space consequently lexical features nonlexical features used model crosslingual transfer furthermore framework flexible enough incorporate additional useful features crosslingual word clusters combined contributions achieve average relative error reduction 109 labeled attachment score compared delexicalized parser trained english universal treebank transferred three languages significantly outperforms stateoftheart delexicalized augmented projected cluster features identical data finally demonstrate boosted minimal supervision eg 100 annotated sentences target languages great significance practical usage
