recently maxsat reasoning shown effective computing tight upper bound maximum clique mc unweighted graph apply maxsat reasoning compute tight upper bound maximum weight clique mwc wighted graph first study three usual encodings mwc weighted partial maxsat dealing hard clauses must satisfied solutions soft clauses weighted falsified drawbacks encodings motivate us propose encoding mwc special weighted partial maxsat formalism called lw literalweighted encoding dedicated upper bounding mwc soft clauses literals soft clauses weighted optimal solution lw maxsat instance gives upper bound mwc instead optimal solution mwc introduce two notions called topk literal failed clause topk empty clause extend classical maxsat reasoning techniques well two sound transformation rules transform lw maxsat instance successive transformations lw maxsat instance driven maxsat reasoning give tight upper bound encoded mwc implemented branchandbound called mwclq experimental evaluations broadly used dimacs benchmark bhoslib benchmark random graphs benchmark winner determination allows mwclq reduce search space significantly solve mwc instances effectively consequently mwclq outperforms stateoftheart exact vast majority instances moreover surprisingly effective solving hard dense instances
