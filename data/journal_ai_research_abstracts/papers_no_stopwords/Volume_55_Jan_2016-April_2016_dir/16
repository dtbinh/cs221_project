module extraction task computing preferably small fragment ontology preserves class entailments signature interest extracting modules minimal size wellknown computationally hard often algorithmically infeasible especially highly expressive ontology languages thus practical techniques typically rely approximations provably captures relevant entailments guaranteed minimal existing approximations ensure preserves secondorder entailments wrt stronger condition required many applications may lead unnecessarily large modules practice propose novel module extraction reduced reasoning datalog generalises existing approximations elegant way importantly allows extraction modules tailored preserve specific kinds entailments thus often significantly smaller evaluation wide range ontologies confirms feasibility benefits practice
