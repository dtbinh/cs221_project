distributed constraint optimization dcop powerful framework representing solving distributed combinatorial problems variables owned different agents many multiagent problems include constraints produce different gains costs participating agents asymmetric gains constrained agents cannot naturally represented standard dcop model

innovative apply special properties proposed adcop model presented detail include complete substantial advantage terms runtime network load existing standard dcops use alternative representations moreover standard incomplete ie local search inapplicable existing dcop representations asymmetric constraints applied new adcop framework often fail converge local optimum yield poor local search proposed present converge high quality solutions experimental evidence presented reveals proposed local search adcops achieve high quality solutions preserving high level privacy
