lifted probabilistic inference exploit regularities structure graphical perform inference efficiently specifically identify groups interchangeable variables perform inference per group opposed per variable groups defined means constraints flexibility grouping determined expressivity constraint language existing approaches exact lifted inference use specific languages inequality constraints often limited expressivity article decouple lifted inference constraint language define operators lifted inference terms relational algebra operators operate semantic level constraints extension rather syntactic level making languageindependent lifted inference performed using powerful constraint languages provide opportunities lifting empirically demonstrate improve inference efficiency orders magnitude allowing exact inference approximate inference feasible
