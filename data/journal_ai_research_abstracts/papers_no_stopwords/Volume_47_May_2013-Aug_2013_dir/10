introduce framework qualitative optimization problems simply optimization problems represent preference theories formalism uses separate modules describe space outcomes compared generator preferences outcomes selector consider two types optimization problems differ way generator model propositional theory interpreted standard propositional logic semantics equilibriummodel answerset semantics latter interpretation generators optimization problems directly generalize answerset optimization programs proposed previously study strong equivalence optimization problems guarantees interchangeability within larger context characterize several versions strong equivalence obtained restricting class optimization problems used extensions establish complexity associated reasoning tasks understanding strong equivalence essential modular representation optimization problems rewriting techniques simplify without changing inherent properties
