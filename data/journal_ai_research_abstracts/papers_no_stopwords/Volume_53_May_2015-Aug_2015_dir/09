temporally extended actions proven useful reinforcement learning duration makes valuable efficient options framework provides concrete way implement reason temporally extended actions existing literature demonstrated value options empirically lack theoretical analysis formalizing options efficient primitive actions provide general analysis convergence rate popular approximate value iteration avi called fitted value iteration fvi options analysis reveals longer duration options pessimistic estimate value function lead faster convergence furthermore options improve convergence even suboptimal sparsely distributed throughout statespace next consider generating useful options subset landmark states suggests new landmarkbased avi lavi represents value function landmark states analyze fvi lavi using proposed landmarkbased options compare two experimental three different domains demonstrate key properties analysis theoretical experimental demonstrate options play important role avi decreasing approximation error inducing fast convergence
