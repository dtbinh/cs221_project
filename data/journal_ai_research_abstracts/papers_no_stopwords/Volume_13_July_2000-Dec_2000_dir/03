goal develop agents adaptive predictable timely first blush three requirements seem contradictory example adaptation risks introducing undesirable side effects thereby making agents behavior less predictable furthermore although formal verification assist ensuring behavioral predictability known timeconsuming solution challenge satisfying three requirements following agents finitestate automaton plans adapted online via evolutionary learning perturbation operators ensure critical behavioral constraints always satisfied agents plans first formally verified reverified every adaptation reverification concludes constraints violated plans repaired main objective improve efficiency reverification learning agents sufficiently rapid response time present two solutions positive certain learning operators priori guaranteed preserve useful classes behavioral assurance constraints implies reverification needed operators efficient incremental reverification learning operators negative priori
