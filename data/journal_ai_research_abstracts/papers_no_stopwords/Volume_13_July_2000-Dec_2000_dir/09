tackle nondeterministic domains presenting new conformant conformant finding sequence actions guaranteed achieve goal despite nondeterminism domain representation domain finite state automaton use symbolic model checking techniques particular binary decision diagrams compactly represent efficiently search automaton make following contributions first present general conformant applies fully nondeterministic domains uncertainty initial condition action effects breadthfirst backward search returns conformant plans minimal length solution exists otherwise terminates concluding admits conformant solution second provide symbolic representation search space binary decision diagrams bdds basis search techniques derived symbolic model checking symbolic representation makes possible analyze potentially large sets states transitions single computation step thus providing efficient implementation third present cmbp conformant model planner efficient implementation data structures described directly bdd manipulations allows compact representation search layers efficient implementation search steps finally present experimental comparison stateoftheart conformant planners cgp qbfplan gpt analysis includes problems distribution packages systems plus problems defined stress number specific factors appears effective cmbp strictly expressive qbfplan cgp problems comparison possible cmbp outperforms competitors sometimes orders magnitude
