enforcing local consistencies one main features constraint reasoning level local consistency used searching solutions constraint network basic question arc consistency partial forms arc consistency widely studied known sometime forward checking mac search recently stronger forms local consistency remained limited change structure constraint graph thus could used practice especially large networks focuses local consistencies stronger arc consistency without changing structure network ie removing inconsistent values domains last five years several local consistencies proposed us others make overview highlight relations compare theoretically experimentally considering pruning efficiency time required enforce
