recent years many improvements backtracking solving constraint satisfaction problems proposed techniques improving backtracking conveniently classified lookahead schemes lookback schemes unfortunately lookahead lookback schemes entirely orthogonal observed empirically enhancement lookahead techniques sometimes counterproductive effects lookback techniques focus relationship two important lookahead techniquesusing variable ordering heuristic maintaining level local consistency backtracking searchand lookback technique conflictdirected backjumping cbj exists perfect dynamic variable ordering cbj becomes redundant theoretically level local consistency maintained backtracking search increased less backjumping improvement theoretical partially explain backtracking lookahead phase cannot benefit backjumping lookback scheme finally empirically adding cbj backtracking maintains generalized arc consistency gac refer gaccbj still provide orders magnitude speedups empirical contrast bessiere regins conclusion 1996 cbj useless maintains arc consistency
