topdown induction decision trees observed suffer inadequate functioning pruning phase particular known size resulting tree grows linearly sample size even though accuracy tree improve reduced error pruning used representative technique attempts explain problems decision tree learning present analyses reduced error pruning three different settings first study basic algorithmic properties method properties hold independent input decision tree pruning examples examine situation intuitively lead subtree consideration replaced leaf node one class label attribute values pruning examples independent analysis conducted two different assumptions general analysis shows pruning probability node fitting pure noise bounded function decreases exponentially size tree grows specific analysis assume examples distributed uniformly tree assumption lets us approximate number subtrees pruned receive pruning examples clarifies different variants reduced error pruning brings new insight algorithmic properties analyses less imposed assumptions includes previously overlooked empty subtrees analysis
