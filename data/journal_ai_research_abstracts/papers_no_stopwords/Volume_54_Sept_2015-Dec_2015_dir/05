article present threestep methodology dynamically improving statistical machine translation smt system incorporating human feedback form free edits system translations target feedback provided casual users typically errorprone thus first propose filtering step automatically identify better useredited translations discard useless ones second step produces pivotbased alignment source useredited sentences focusing errors made system finally third step produces new translation model combines linearly one original system perform thorough evaluation realworld dataset collected reversonet translation service every step methodology contributes significantly improve general purpose smt system interestingly quality improvement due increase lexical coverage better lexical selection reordering morphology finally robustness methodology applying different scenario new examples come automatically webcrawled parallel corpus using exactly architecture provides significant improvement translation quality general purpose baseline smt system
