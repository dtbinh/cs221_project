realtime domains video games happens concurrently execution strictly bounded amount time must return next action agent execute explore use realtime heuristic search two benchmark domains inspired video games unlike classic benchmarks grid pathfinding sliding tile puzzle new domains feature exogenous change directed state space graphs consider setting acting concurrent use natural objective minimizing goal achievement time using classic benchmarks new domains investigate several enhancements leading realtime search lsslrta experimentally 1 better plan action use dynamically sized lookahead 2 abased lookahead cause undesirable actions selected 3 online debiasing heuristic lead improved performance hope work encourages future applying realtime search dynamic domains
