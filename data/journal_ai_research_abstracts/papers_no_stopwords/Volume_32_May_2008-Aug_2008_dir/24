phylogenetic tree shows evolutionary relationships among species internal nodes tree represent speciation events leaf nodes correspond species goal phylogenetics combine trees larger trees called supertrees whilst respecting relationships original trees rooted tree exhibits ultrametric property three leaves tree must one pair deeper recent common ancestor pairs three recent common ancestor inspires constraint programming encoding rooted trees present efficient constraint enforces ultrametric property symmetric array constrained integer variables inevitable property lower bounds three variables mutually supportive allows efficient constraintbased solution supertree construction demonstrate versatility constraint programming exploited allow solutions variants supertree construction
