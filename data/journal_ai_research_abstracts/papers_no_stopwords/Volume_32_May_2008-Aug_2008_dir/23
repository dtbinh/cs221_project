propose novel method approximate inference bayesian networks bns idea sample data bn learn latent tree model ltm data offline online make inference ltm instead original bn ltms treestructured inference takes linear time meantime represent complex relationship among leaf nodes hence approximation accuracy often good empirical evidence shows method achieve good approximation accuracy low online computational cost
