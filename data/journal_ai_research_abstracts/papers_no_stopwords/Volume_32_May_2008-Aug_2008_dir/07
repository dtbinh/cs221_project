decisiontheoretic popular sequential decision making problems treats uncertainty sensing acting principled way singleagent frameworks mdps pomdps carried resorting qvalue functions optimal qvalue function q computed recursive manner dynamic programming optimal policy extracted q study whether similar qvalue functions defined decentralized pomdp decpomdps policies extracted value functions define two forms optimal qvalue function decpomdps one gives normative description qvalue function optimal pure joint policy another one sequentially rational thus gives recipe computation computation however infeasible smallest problems therefore analyze various approximate qvalue functions allow efficient computation describe relate prove provide upper bound optimal qvalue function q finally unifying previous approaches solving decpomdps describe family extracting policies qvalue functions perform experimental evaluation existing test problems including new firefighting benchmark
