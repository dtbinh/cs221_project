construction classifiers imbalanced datasets described dataset imbalanced classification categories approximately equally represented often realworld data sets predominately composed normal examples small percentage abnormal interesting examples case cost misclassifying abnormal interesting example normal example often much higher cost reverse error undersampling majority normal class proposed good means increasing sensitivity classifier minority class shows combination method oversampling minority abnormal class undersampling majority normal class achieve better classifier performance roc space undersampling majority class shows combination method oversampling minority class undersampling majority class achieve better classifier performance roc space varying loss ratios ripper class priors naive bayes method oversampling minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples experiments performed using c45 ripper naive bayes classifier method evaluated using area receiver operating characteristic curve auc roc convex hull strategy
