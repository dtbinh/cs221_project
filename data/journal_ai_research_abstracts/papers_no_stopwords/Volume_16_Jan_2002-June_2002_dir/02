discusses system accelerates reinforcement learning using transfer related tasks without transfer even two tasks similar abstract level extensive relearning effort required system achieves much power transferring parts previously learned solutions rather single complete solution system exploits strong features multidimensional function produced reinforcement learning solving particular task features stable easy recognize early learning process generate partitioning state space thus function partition represented graph used index compose functions stored case base form close approximation solution new task experiments demonstrate function composition often produces order magnitude increase learning rate compared basic reinforcement learning
