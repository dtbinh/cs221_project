deciding act partially observable environments remains active area identifying good sequences decisions particularly challenging good control performance requires multiple steps future domains many states towards addressing challenge present online forwardsearch called posterior belief distribution pbd pbd leverages novel method calculating posterior distribution beliefs sequence actions taken given set observation sequences could received process method allows us efficiently evaluate expected reward sequence primitive actions refer macroactions present formal analysis examine performance two large simulation experiments scientific exploration target monitoring domain demonstrate used control real robotic helicopter target monitoring experiment suggests practical potential realworld large partially observable domains multistep lookahead required achieve good performance
