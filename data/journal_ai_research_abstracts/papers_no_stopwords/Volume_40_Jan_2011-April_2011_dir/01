markovian processes long used model stochastic environments reinforcement learning emerged framework solve sequential decisionmaking problems environments recent years attempts made apply methods reinforcement learning construct decision support systems action selection markovian environments although conventional methods reinforcement learning proved useful problems concerning sequential decisionmaking cannot applied current form decision support systems medical domains suggest policies often highly prescriptive leave little room users input without ability provide flexible guidelines unlikely methods gain ground users systems

introduces new concept nondeterministic policies allow flexibility users decisionmaking process constraining decisions remain near optimal solutions provide two compute nondeterministic policies discrete domains study output running time method set synthetic realworld problems experiment human subjects humans assisted hints nondeterministic policies outperform humanonly computeronly agents web navigation task
