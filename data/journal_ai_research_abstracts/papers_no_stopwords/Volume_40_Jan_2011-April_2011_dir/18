bound propagation important artificial intelligence technique used constraint programming tools deal numerical constraints typically embedded within search procedure branch prune used every node search tree narrow search space critical fast procedure invokes constraint propagators common fixpoint reached known pseudopolynomial worstcase time complexity fast indeed variables small numerical range wellknown prohibitively slow ranges large important question therefore whether stronglypolynomial exist compute common bound consistent fixpoint set constraints answers question particular fixpoint computation fact npcomplete even restricted binary linear constraints
