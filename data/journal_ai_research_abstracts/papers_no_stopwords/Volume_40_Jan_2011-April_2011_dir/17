define logic propositional formula schemata adding syntax propositional logic indexed propositions iterated connectives ranging intervals parameterized arithmetic variables satisfiability shown undecidable new logic introduce general class schemata called boundlinear becomes decidable obtained reduction particular class schemata called regular provide sound complete terminating proof procedure schemata calculus allows one capture proof patterns corresponding large class problems specified propositional logic satisfiability becomes undecidable slight extensions class thus demonstrating boundlinear schemata represent good compromise expressivity decidability
