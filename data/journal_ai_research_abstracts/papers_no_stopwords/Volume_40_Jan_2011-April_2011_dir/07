propose comprehensive study secondorder consistencies ie consistencies identifying inconsistent pairs values constraint satisfaction build full picture relationships existing four basic secondorder consistencies namely path consistency pc 3consistency 3c dual consistency dc 2singleton arc consistency 2sac well conservative strong variants interestingly dual consistency original property established using outcome enforcement generalized arc consistency gac makes rather easy obtain since constraint solvers typically maintain gac search binary constraint networks dc equivalent pc restriction existing constraints called conservative dual consistency cdc strictly stronger traditional conservative consistencies derived path consistency namely partial path consistency ppc conservative path consistency cpc introducing general enforce strong cdc present experimentation wide range benchmarks demonstrate interest conservative dual consistency particular enforcing cdc search clearly improves performance mac maintains gac search several binary nonbinary structured problems
