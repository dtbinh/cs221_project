cimatti griggio r sebastiani 2011 computing small unsatisfiable cores satisfiability modulo theories 40 701728

finding small unsatisfiable cores sat formulas recently received lot interest mostly applications formal verification however propositional logic often expressive enough representing many interesting verification problems naturally addressed framework satisfiability modulo theories smt surprisingly finding unsatisfiable cores smt received little attention literature

evaluated extensive empirical test smtlib benchmarks confirms validity potential
