partialorder plans pops attractive leastcommitment nature provides enhanced plan flexibility execution time relative sequential plans current automated plan generation focuses producing sequential plans despite appeal pops examine pop generation relaxing modifying action orderings sequential plan optimize plan criteria promote flexibility relies novel partial weighted maxsat encoding sequential plan supports minimization deordering reordering actions using similar technique demonstrate remove redundant actions plan combine criterion objective maximizing pops flexibility partial weighted maxsat encoding allows us compute pop sequential plan effectively compare efficiency previous methods pop generation via sequentialplan relaxation existing heuristic consistently produces optimal deordering sequential plan greater flexibility consider reordering actions plan providing guarantee optimality investigate confirm accuracy standard flex metric typically used predict true flexibility pop measured number linearizations represents
