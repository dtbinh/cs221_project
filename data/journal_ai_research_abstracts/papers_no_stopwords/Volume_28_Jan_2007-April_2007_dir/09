c bettini mascetti x wang 2007 supporting temporal reasoning mapping calendar expressions minimal periodic sets 28 299348

recent years several efforts focused concept time granularity applications first stream investigated mathematical behind notion granularity manage temporal data second stream investigated symbolic formalisms providing set algebraic operators define granularities compact compositional way however limited manipulation proposed operate directly algebraic representation making unsuitable use symbolic formalisms applications need manipulation granularities

technical point view propose hybrid interleaves conversion calendar subexpressions periodical sets minimization period length returns setbased granularity representations minimal period length relevant parameter performance considered reasoning services extensive experimental work supports techniques used shows efficiency effectiveness
