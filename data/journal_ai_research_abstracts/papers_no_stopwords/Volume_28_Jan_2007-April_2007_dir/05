encouraging voters truthfully reveal preferences election long important issue recently computational complexity suggested means precluding strategic behavior previous studies shown voting protocols hard manipulate used nphardness complexity measure worstcase analysis may insufficient guarantee resistance manipulation

indeed demonstrate nphard manipulations may tractable average case purpose augment existing theory averagecase complexity new concepts particular consider elections distributed respect junta distributions concentrate hard instances use techniques prove scoring protocols susceptible manipulation coalitions number candidates constant
