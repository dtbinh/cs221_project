judicious use abstraction help agents identify key interactions actions resolve without getting bogged details however ignoring wrong details lead agents building plans work costly backtracking replanning overlooked interdependencies come light claim associating systematicallygenerated summary information plans abstract operators ensure plan correctness even asynchronouslyexecuted plans must coordinated across multiple agents still achieving valuable efficiency gains formally characterize hierarchical plans whose actions temporal extent describe principled method deriving summarized state metric resource information actions provide sound complete along heuristics exploit summary information hierarchical refinement plan coordination analyses experiments clearcut reasonable conditions using summary information speed much doubly exponentially even plans involving interacting subproblems
