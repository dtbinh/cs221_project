h jia c moore strain 2007 generating hard satisfiable formulas hiding solutions deceptively 28 107118

test incomplete search constraint satisfaction problems 3sat need source hard satisfiable benchmark instances simple way choose random truth assignment choose clauses randomly among satisfied however method tends produce easy problems since majority literals point toward hidden assignment last year achlioptas jia moore proposed generator cancels effect hiding complement resulting formulas appear hard dpll random 3sat formulas hidden assignment solved walksat polynomial time

propose new method cancel attraction choosing clause 0 literals satisfied probability proportional qt q 1 varying q generate formulas whose variables bias ie equally likely true false even cause formula deceptively point away present theoretical experimental suggesting formulas exponentially hard dpll incomplete walksat
