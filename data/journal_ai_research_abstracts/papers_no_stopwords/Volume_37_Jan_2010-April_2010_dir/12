engel p wellman 2010 multiattribute auctions generalized additive independence 37 479525

develop multiattribute auctions accommodate generalized additive independent gai preferences propose iterative auction mechanism maintains prices potentially overlapping gai clusters attributes thus decreases elicitation computational burden creates open competition among suppliers multidimensional domain significantly auction guaranteed achieve surplus approximates optimal welfare small additive factor reasonable equilibrium strategies traders main departure gai auctions previous literature accommodate nonadditive trader preferences hence allowing traders condition evaluation specific attributes value attributes time gai structure supports compact representation prices enabling tractable auction process perform simulation study demonstrating quantifying significant efficiency advantage expressive preference modeling draw random gaistructured utility functions various internal structures generate additive functions approximate gai utility compare performance auctions using two representations allowing traders express existing dependencies among attributes improves economic efficiency multiattribute auctions
