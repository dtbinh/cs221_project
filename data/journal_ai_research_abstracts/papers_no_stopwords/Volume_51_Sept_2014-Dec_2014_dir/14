increasing expressiveness qualitative spatial calculi essential step towards meeting requirements applications achieved combining existing calculi way express spatial information using relations multiple calculi great challenge develop reasoning correct complete reasoning combined information previous work mainly studied cases interaction combined calculi small one two calculi simple tackle important combination topological directional information extended spatial objects combine best known calculi qualitative spatial reasoning rcc8 algebra representing topological information rectangle algebra ra cardinal direction calculus cdc directional information consider two different interpretations rcc8 algebra one uses weak connectedness relation uses strong connectedness relation interpretations reasoning topological directional information decidable remains np computational complexity unveil significant differences ra cdc weak strong rcc8 take combination basic rcc8 basic cdc constraints example consistency p use strong rcc8 algebra explicitly know corresponding basic ra constraints
