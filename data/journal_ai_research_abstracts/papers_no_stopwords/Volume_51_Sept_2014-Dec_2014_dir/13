multiagent pathfinding relevant wide range domains example robotics video games formally considers graph consisting vertices edges set agents occupying vertices agent move unoccupied neighbouring vertex finding minimal sequence moves transfer agent start location destination nphard

experiments compare push swap mapp bibox latter restricted smaller class instances requires biconnected graphs nevertheless considered state art due strong performance experiments push swap suffers incompleteness mapp generally competitive push rotate bibox better push rotate randomly generated biconnected instances push rotate performs better grids
