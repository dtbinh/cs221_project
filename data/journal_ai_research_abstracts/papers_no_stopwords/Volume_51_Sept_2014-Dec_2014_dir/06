simple diffusion processes networks used model analyze predict diverse phenomena spread diseases information memes often underlying network data noisy sampled prompts following natural question sensitive diffusion dynamics subsequent conclusions uncertainty network structure

consider two popular diffusion independent cascade ic model linear threshold lt model study expected number vertices influencedinfected particular initial conditions affected network perturbations rigorous analysis assumption reasonable perturbation model establish following main 1 ic model characterize sensitivity network perturbation terms critical probability phase transition network expected number infections quite stable unless transmission probability close critical probability 2 standard lt model uniform edge weights relatively stable network perturbations 3 study sensitivity questions using extensive simulations diverse real world networks theoretical predictions match observations quite closely 4 experimentally transient behavior ie time series number infections appears sensitive network perturbations
