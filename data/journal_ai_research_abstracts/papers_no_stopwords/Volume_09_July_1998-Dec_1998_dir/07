using improved backtrack sophisticated pruning techniques revise previous observations correlating high frequency hard solve hamiltonian cycle instances gnm phase transition hamiltonicity nonhamiltonicity instead tested graphs 100 1500 vertices easily solved artificially restrict degree sequence bounded maximum degree although increase difficulty frequency hard graphs still low consider regular graphs generalization knights tours observe frequent instances really hard graphs average degree bounded constant design set graphs feature unable detect hard vary average degree o1 far found class graphs correlated gnm phase transition asymptotically produces high frequency hard instances
