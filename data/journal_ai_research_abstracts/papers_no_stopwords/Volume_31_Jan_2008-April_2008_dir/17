artificial intelligence ushering new era sophisticated massmarket transportation technology computers already fly passenger jet better trained human pilot people still faced dangerous yet tedious task driving automobiles intelligent transportation systems field focuses integrating information technology vehicles transportation infrastructure make transportation safer cheaper efficient recent advances point future vehicles handle vast majority driving task autonomous vehicles become popular autonomous interactions amongst multiple vehicles possible current methods vehicle coordination designed work human drivers outdated bottleneck roadway efficiency longer drivers rather mechanism drivers actions coordinated openroad driving wellstudied moreorlesssolved urban traffic scenarios especially intersections much challenging

believe current methods controlling traffic specifically intersections able take advantage increased sensitivity precision autonomous vehicles compared human drivers article suggest alternative mechanism coordinating movement autonomous vehicles intersections drivers intersections mechanism treated autonomous agents multiagent system multiagent system intersections use new reservationbased built around detailed communication protocol present demonstrate simulation new mechanism potential significantly outperform current intersection control technology traffic lights stop signs mechanism emulate traffic light stop sign subsumes popular current methods intersection control article presents two extensions mechanism first extension allows system control humandriven vehicles addition autonomous vehicles second gives priority emergency vehicles without significant cost civilian vehicles mechanism including extensions implemented tested simulation present experimental strongly attest efficacy
