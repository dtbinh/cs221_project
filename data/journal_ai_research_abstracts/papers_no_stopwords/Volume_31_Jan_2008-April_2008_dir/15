rk ryan 2008 exploiting subgraph structure multirobot path 31 497542

multirobot path difficult due combinatorial explosion search space every new robot added complete search combined statespace soon becomes intractable present novel form abstraction allows us plan much efficiently key abstraction partitioning map subgraphs known structure entry exit restrictions represent compactly becomes search much smaller space subgraph configurations abstract plan found quickly resolved correct possibly suboptimal concrete plan without need search prove technique sound complete demonstrate practical effectiveness real map
