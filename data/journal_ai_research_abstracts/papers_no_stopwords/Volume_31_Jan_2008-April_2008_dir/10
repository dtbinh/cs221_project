present three new complexity classes problems simple causal graphs first describe polynomialtime uses macros generate plans class 3s problems binary state variables acyclic causal graphs implies plan generation may tractable even exponentially long minimal solution prove plan existence problems multivalued variables chain causal graphs nphard finally plan existence problems binary state variables polytree causal graphs npcomplete
