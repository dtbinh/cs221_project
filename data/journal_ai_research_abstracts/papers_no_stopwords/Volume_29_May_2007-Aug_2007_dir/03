major achievement mechanism design theory general method construction truthful mechanisms called vcg vickrey clarke groves applying method complex problems combinatorial auctions difficulty arises vcg mechanisms required compute optimal outcomes therefore computationally infeasible however optimal outcome replaced suboptimal resulting mechanism termed vcgbased longer necessarily truthful first part studies phenomenon depth shows near universal specifically prove essentially reasonable approximations heuristics combinatorial auctions well wide class cost minimization problems yield nontruthful vcgbased mechanisms generalize affine maximizers

second part proposes general method circumventing introduce modification vcgbased mechanisms agents given chance improve output underlying agents behave truthfully welfare obtained mechanism least good one obtained output provide strong rationale truthtelling behavior method satisfies individual rationality well
