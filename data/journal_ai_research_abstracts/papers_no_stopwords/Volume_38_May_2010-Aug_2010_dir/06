grounding task reducing firstorder theory finite domain equivalent propositional theory used preprocessing phase many logicbased reasoning systems systems provide rich firstorder input language user rely efficient propositional solvers perform actual reasoning

first present method classical firstorder logic fo theories extend foid extension fo inductive definitions allows concise comprehensive input theories discuss implementation issues experimentally validate practical applicability method
