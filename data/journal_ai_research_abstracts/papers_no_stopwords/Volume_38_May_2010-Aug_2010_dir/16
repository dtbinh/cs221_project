coalitional games serve purpose modeling payoff distribution problems scenarios agents collaborate forming coalitions order obtain higher worths acting isolation classical transferable utility tu setting coalition worths freely distributed amongst agents however several application scenarios case nontransferable utility setting ntu must considered additional applicationoriented constraints imposed possible worth distributions

define ntu games proposed describing allowed distributions via set mixedinteger linear constraints applied underlying tu game shown games allow nontransferable conditions worth distributions specified natural succinct way properties relationships among prominent solution concepts ntu games hold applied mixedinteger constrained games investigated finally thorough analysis carried assess impact issuing constraints computational complexity solution concepts
