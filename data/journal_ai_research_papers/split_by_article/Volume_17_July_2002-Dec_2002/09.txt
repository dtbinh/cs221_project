Abstract
In this paper, we analyze the decision version of the NK landscape model from the
perspective of threshold phenomena and phase transitions under two random distributions,
the uniform probability model and the fixed ratio model. For the uniform probability
model, we prove that the phase transition is easy in the sense that there is a polynomial
algorithm that can solve a random instance of the problem with the probability asymptotic
to 1 as the problem size tends to infinity. For the fixed ratio model, we establish several
upper bounds for the solubility threshold, and prove that random instances with parameters
above these upper bounds can be solved polynomially. This, together with our empirical
study for random instances generated below and in the phase transition region, suggests
that the phase transition of the fixed ratio model is also easy.

1. Introduction
The NK landscape is a fitness landscape model devised by Kauffman (1989). An appealing
property of the NK landscape is that the ruggedness of the landscape can be tuned
by changing some parameters. Over the years, the NK landscape model itself has been
studied from the perspectives of statistics and computational complexity (Weinberger, 1996;
Wright, Thompson, & Zhang, 2000). In the study of genetic algorithms, NK landscape
models have been used as a prototype and benchmark in the analysis of the performance of
different genetic operators and the effects of different encoding methods on the algorithms
performance (Altenberg, 1997; Hordijk, 1997; Jones, 1995).
In the field of combinatorial search and optimization, one of the interesting discoveries
is the threshold phenomena and phase transitions. Roughly speaking, a phase transition in
combinatorial search refers to the phenomenon that the probability that a random instance
of the problem has a solution drops abruptly from 1 to 0 as the order parameter of the
random model crosses a critical value called the threshold. Closely related to this phase
transition in solubility is the hardness of solving the problems. There has been strong empirical evidence and theoretical arguments showing that the hardest instances of the problems
usually occur around the threshold and instances generated with parameters far away from
the threshold are relatively easy. Since the seminal work of Cheeseman et al. (Cheeseman, Kanefsky, & Taylor, 1991), many NP-complete combinatorial search problems have
been shown to have the phase transition and the associated easy-hard-easy pattern (Cook
& Mitchell, 1997; Culberson & Gent, 2001; Freeman, 1996; Gent, MacIntyre, Prosser, &

& Culberson, 1998).
In this paper, we analyze the NK landscape model from the perspective of threshold
phenomena and phase transitions. We establish two random models for the decision problem
of NK landscapes and study the threshold phenomena and the associated hardness of the
phase transitions in these two models.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the NK fitness
landscape and our probabilistic models, the uniform probability model and the fixed ratio
model. In Section 3 and Section 4, the threshold phenomena and phase transitions in
NK landscapes are analyzed. For the uniform probability model, we prove that the phase
transition of the uniform probability model is easy in the sense that there is a polynomial
algorithm that can solve a random instance of the problem with the probability asymptotic
to 1 as the problem size tends to infinity. For the fixed ratio model, we establish two upper
bounds for the solubility threshold, and prove that random instances with parameters above
these upper bounds can be solved polynomially. This, together with our empirical study
for random instances generated below and in the phase transition region, suggests that
the phase transition of the fixed ratio model is also easy. In Section 5, we report our
experimental results on typical hardness of the fixed ratio model. In Section 6, we conclude
our investigation and discuss implications of our results.

2. NK Landscapes and their Probabilistic Models
An NK landscape f (x) =

n
P

fi (xi , (xi )), is a real-valued function defined on binary strings

i=1

of fixed length, where n > 0 is a positive integer and x = (x1 ,    , xn )  {0, 1}n . It is the sum
of n local fitness functions fi , 1  i  n. Each local fitness function fi (xi , (xi )) depends
on the main variable xi and its neighborhood (xi )  Pk ({x1 ,    , xn }\{xi }) where Pk (X)
denotes the set of all subsets of size k from X. The most important parameters of an NK
landscape are the number of variables n, and the size of the neighborhood k = |(xi )|.
In an NK landscape, the neighborhood (xi ) can be chosen in two ways: the random
neighborhood, where the k variables are randomly chosen from the set {x1 ,    , xn }\{xi },
and the adjacent neighborhood, where k variables with indices nearest to i (modulo n) are
chosen. For example, for any even integer k, the k variables in (xi ) can be defined as
x((n+i k ) mod n) ,    , x((n+i+ k ) mod n) . Once the variables in the neighborhood are deter2
2
mined, the local fitness function fi is determined by a fitness lookup table which specifies
the function value fi for each of the 2k+1 possible assignments to the variables xi and (xi ).
Throughout this paper, we consider NK landscapes with random neighborhoods. To
simplify the discussion, we further assume that the local fitness functions take on binary
values. Given an NK landscape f , the corresponding decision problem is stated as follows:
Is the maximum of f (x) equal to n? An NK landscape decision problem is insoluble if there
is no solution for it.
It has been proved that the NK landscape model is NP complete for k  2 (e.g.,
Weinberger, 1996; Wright et al., 2000). The proofs were based on a reduction from SAT to
the decision problem of NK landscapes. To study the typical hardness of the NK landscape
decision problems in the framework of thresholds and phase transitions, we introduce two

310

fiPhase Transition in NK Landscapes

random models. In both of the models defined below, the neighborhood set (xi ) of a
variable xi is selected by randomly choosing without replacement k = |(xi )| variables
from x\{xi }.
Definition 2.1. The Uniform Probability Model N (n, k, p): In this model, the fitness value
of the local fitness function fi (xi , (xi )) is determined as follows: For each assignment
y  Dom(fi ) = {0, 1}k+1 , let fi (y) = 0 with the probability p and fi (y) = 1 with the
probability 1  p, where this is done for each possible assignment and each local fitness
function independently.
Definition 2.2. The Fixed Ratio Model N (n, k, z): In this model, the parameter z takes
on values from [0, 2k+1 ]. If z is an integer, we specify the local fitness function fi (xi , (xi ))
by randomly choosing without replacement z tuples of possible assignments Y = (y1 ,    , yz )
from Dom(fi ) = {0, 1}k+1 , and defining the local fitness function as follows:

0, if y  Y ;
fi (y) =
1, else.
For a non-integer z = (1  )[z] + [z + 1] where [z] is the integer part of z, we choose
randomly without replacement [(1  )n] local fitness functions and determine their fitness
values according to N (n, k, [z]). The rest of the local fitness functions are determined according to N (n, k, [z] + 1).
In the theory of random graphs, there are two related random models G(n, p) where
each of the n(n1)
possible edges is included in the graph independently with probability
2
p, and G(n, m) where exactly m edges are chosen randomly and without replacement from
the set of n(n1)
possible edges. It is well known that for most of the monotone graph
2
properties, results proved in G(n, p) (or G(n, m)) also hold asymptotically for G(n, N p)
m
(correspondingly, G(n, N
)) where N = n(n1)
. However, we cannot expect that similar
2
relations exist between the two random models of NK landscapes defined above unless the
parameter k tends to infinity. As a result, the asymptotic behaviors of the two NK landscape
models are significantly different for fixed k.
We conclude this section by establishing a relation between the decision problem of NK
landscapes and the SAT problem. A decision problem of the NK landscape
f (x) =

where z is the number of zero values that fi takes and Cij is such that for any assignment
yj  {0, 1}k+1 that falsifies Cij , we have fi (yj ) = 0.

Table 1 shows an example of the fitness assignment of a local fitness function fi = fi (x, y, z)

the variables x, y, z, fi (s) = 1 if and only if the assignment satisfies the formula
x  y  z, x  y  z, x  y  z, x  y  z.

3. Analysis of The Uniform Probability Model
In the uniform probability model N (n, k, p), the parameter p determines how many zero
values a local fitness function can take. We are interested in how the solubility and hardness
of the NK landscape decision problem change as the parameter p increases from 0 to 1. It
turns out that for fixed p > 0, the decision problem is asymptotically trivially insoluble.
This is quite similar to the phenomena in the random models of the constraint satisfaction
problem observed by Achlioptas et al. (1997).
To gain some more insight into the problem, we consider the case where p = p(n) is a
function of the problem size n with lim p(n) = 0. Our analysis shows that the solubility of
n

the problem depends on how fast p(n) decreases:
(1) If
1

lim p(n)n 2k+1 = +,

(3.1)

n

the problem is still asymptotically trivially insoluble because with the probability asymptotic to 1, there is at least one local fitness function that always has a fitness value 0;
(2) On the other hand if p(n) decreases fast enough, i.e.,
1

lim p(n)n 2k+1 < +,

(3.2)

n

the problem can be decomposed into a set of independent sub-problems. In either case the
problem can be solved in polynomial time. The case of (3.1) is not difficult to prove, but
to prove the case of (3.2), we need to make use of the following concepts and results.
Definition 3.1. The connection graph of an NK landscape instance f (x) =

n

i=1

is a graph G = G(V, E) satisfying
312

fi (xi , (xi ))

fiPhase Transition in NK Landscapes

(1) Each vertex v  V corresponds to a local fitness function; and
(2)There is an edge between vi , vj if and only if the corresponding local fitness functions
fi , fj share variables, i.e., the neighborhoods (xi ) and (xj ) of xi and xj have a non-empty
intersection, and both of them have at least one zero value.
Definition 3.2. Let f (x) =

n
P

fi (xi , (xi )) be an NK landscape instance with the con-

i=1

nection graph G = G(V, E). Let G1 ,    , Gl be the connected components of G. Since the
vertices of G correspond to local fitness functions, we can regard Gi as a set of local fitness
functions. For each 1  i  l, let Ui  x = (x1 ,    , xn ) be the set of variables that appear
in the definition of the local fitness functions in Gi .
It is easy to see that (U1 ,    Ul ) excluding independent vertices forms a disjoint partition
of (a subset of) the variables x = (x1 ,    , xn ), and that the local fitness functions in Gi
only depend on the variables in Ui . Furthermore, the NK decision problem is soluble if and
only if for each 1  i  l, there is an assignment si  {0, 1}|Ui | to the variables in Ui such
that for each local fitness function g  Gi , g(s) = 1.
Theorem 3.1 summarizes the result on the uniform probability model.

that with probability asymptotic to one, there is at least one local fitness function which
takes on values 0 for any possible assignments. We can therefore show that in this case, the
NK decision problem is insoluble by checking the local fitness functions one by one. And
this only takes linear time.

Consider an algorithm that first finds the connected components Gi , 1  i  l of the
connection graph G of the NK model, and then uses brute force to find an assignment
si  {0, 1}|Ui | to the variables in Ui such that for each local fitness function g  Gi ,
g(s) = 1. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n2 + n  2M(n,k,p) ) where M(n, k, p) =
max(|Ui |, 1  i  l) is the maximum size of the subsets (Ui , 1  i  l) associated with the
313

fiGao & Culberson

connected components of the connection graph. To prove the theorem, we only need to show
1
that M(n, k, p)  O(log n). In the following, we will show that for lim p(n)n 2k+1 < +,
n
we have
lim P r{M(n, k, p)  2k + 2} = 1
n

Consider the connection graph G = G(V, E) of the NK model. It is a random graph and
there is an edge between two nodes if and only if the two corresponding local fitness functions
share variables and both of the local fitness functions take at least one zero as their fitness
value. However, under this definition the edge probabilities are not independent. If vx  E
then we know that fx has at least one zero and so the probability that xw is in E is greater
than if there were no other edge on x.
To deal with this we resort to the following proof construction. Let Cm = {v1 , . . . , vm }
be a subset of V of size m. Let  be an ordering (permutation) of v1 . . . vm . We say that
Cm is variable connected with respect to the ordering , denoted as C(Cm , ), if for each
i, 2  i  m there is either
1. a j < i such that f(j) and f(i) share a variable; or
2. a j, 1  j  i such that the variable xj is one of the k random variables in fi .
Lemma If the induced subgraph G[Cm ] is connected then there exists at least one ordering
 of v1 . . . vm such that C(Cm , ).
As proof, consider the ordering of vertices of any depth first search of a connected
subgraph. In this case, the connections are all by case 1.
The expected number of permutations  for which C(Cm , ) is
Ec = E[|{ : C(Cm , )}|] = m!Pr{C(Cm , )}
We then observe
 that the expected number of connected induced graphs on m vertices is
n
less than pm
0 m Ec , where p0 is the probability that fi takes at least one value zero. We
show this value goes to zero in the limit if m  2k + 2. Finally, since if there is a connected
subgraph on m vertices then there must be one for each i < m, it follows that the largest
connected component has size at most 2k + 1.
For a randomly generated permutation  of Cm , let Ci be the set of the first i vertices
of the permutation. For i  2 define Pi to be the probability that f(i) shares at least one
variable with f(j) for some j < i given that C(Ci1 , /1,    , i  1). Let P1 = 1. (A one
vertex subgraph is always connected.)
For i > 1 we have Pi = Pr{j < i, f(i) and f(j) share variables, given C(Ci1 , ) or
one of the k random variables in f(i) is in {x1 . . . xm }  {xi }}.

4. Analysis of The Fixed Ratio Model
As has been discussed in the previous section, the uniform probability model N (n, k, p) of
NK landscapes is asymptotically trivial. Part of the cause of this asymptotic triviality lies in
the fact that if the parameter p does not decrease very quickly with n, then asymptotically
there will be at least one local fitness function that takes the value 0 for all the possible
assignments, making the whole decision problem insoluble. In this section, we study the
fixed ratio model N (n, k, z). In this model, we require that each local fitness function has
fixed number of zero values so that the trivially insoluble situation in the uniform probability
model is avoided. We note that the same idea has been used in the study of the flawless
CSP (Gent et al., 1998).
Recall that in the fixed ratio model, we choose the neighborhood structure for each local
fitness in the same way as in the uniform probability model N (n, k, p). To determine the
fitness value for a local fitness function fi , we randomly without replacement select exactly
z tuples {s1 ,    , sz } from {0, 1}k+1 , and let fi (sj ) = 0 for each 1  j  z and fi (s) = 1 for
every other s  {0, 1}k+1 .
For the fixed ratio model, we are interested in how the probability of an instance of
N (n, k, z) being soluble changes as the parameter z increases from 0 to 2k+1 . It is easy to

P
see that the property There exists an assignment x such that f (x) =

is monotone in the parameter z  the number of tuples at which a local fitness function takes
zero. Actually, we have the following Lemma on the property of the solubility probability
of the fixed ratio model:
Lemma 4.1. For the fixed ratio model, if z1 > z2 , then
P r{N (n, k, z1 )is soluble}  P r{N (n, k, z2 )is soluble}.
Furthermore, we have

P r{N (n, k, z)is soluble} =

1, if z  1;
0, if z = 2k+1 .

Based on the above Lemma and in parallel to the study of the threshold phenomena in
other random combinatorial structures such as 3-Coloring of random graphs and random
3-SAT, we suggest the following conjecture:
Conjecture 4.1. There exists a threshold zc such that

1, if z < zc ;
lim P r{N (n, k, z)is soluble} =
n
0, if z > zc .
Conjectures like this are the starting point of the study of phase transition in many
random combinatorial structures such as 3-coloring of random graphs and random SAT,
but the existence of the thresholds is still an open question (Achlioptas, 1999; Cook &
Mitchell, 1997). However, bounding the thresholds has been an important topic in the
study of phase transition (Achlioptas, 1999, 2001; Dubois, 2001; Franco & Gelder, 1998;
Franco & Paul, 1983; Frieze & Suen, 1996; Kirousis, P.Kranakis, D.Krizanc, & Y.Stamation,
1994). In this section, we will establish two upper bounds on the threshold of the parameter
zc , and theoretically prove that random instances generated with the parameter z above
these upper bounds can be solved with probability asymptotic to 1 by polynomial (even
linear) algorithms.
Characterizing the sharpness of the thresholds is also of great interest in the study of
the phase transition. After proving that every monotone graph property has a threshold
behavior (Friedgut & Kalai, 1996), Friedgut (1999) established a necessary and sufficient
condition for a monotone graph property to have sharp threshold, which has been used to
prove the sharpness of the thresholds of 3-colorability and 3-SAT problems (Friedgut, 1999;
Achlioptas, 1999). For the fixed ratio model discussed in this paper, we suspect that it will
exhibit a coarse threshold behavior, and would like to leave a detailed investigation into
this problem as a future research direction.
4.1 The Upper Bound of z = 3.0
The derivation of this upper bound is based on the concept of a conflicting pair of local
fitness functions. We say that two local fitness functions fi and fj conflict with each other
if
1. fi and fj share at least one variable x; and
316

fiPhase Transition in NK Landscapes

2. For any assignment s  {0, 1}n , we have fi (s)fj (s) = 0.
It is obvious that an instance of the NK decision problem is insoluble if there exists a pair
of conflicting local fitness functions.
Based on the second moment method in the theory of probability (Alon & Spencer,
1992), we can prove the following upper bound result. As it takes linear time to check if
there is a pair of conflicting local fitness functions, we can see that the fixed ratio model
N (n, 2, z) is linearly solvable when z > 3.0.
Theorem 4.1. Define A to be the event that there is a conflicting pair of local fitness
functions in N (n, 2, z). For the fixed ratio model N (n, 2, z) with z = 3.0 + , we have
lim P r{A} = 1
n

and thus the problem is insoluble with probability asymptotic to 1.
Proof: Without loss of generality, we may write f as where fi has 4 zeroes in its fitness
value assignment for 1  i  n, and 3 zeroes for n + 1  i  n. Let Iij be the indicator
function of the event that fi and fj conflicts with each other, i.e.,

1, if fi and fj conflicts with each other;
Iij =
0, else.

(4.3)

Since for each 1  i  n, fi has exactly 4 zeros in its fitness value assignment, we know
that two local fitness function fi , fj , 1  i, j  n, conflict with each other if and only if
they have exactly one common variable x such that one of the following is true: (1)fi (s) =
0(or 1), fj (s) = 1(or 0) for all the assignments s such that x = 1(respectively x = 0); and
(2)fi (s) = 1(or 0), fj (s) = 0(or 1) for all the assignments s such that x = 1(respectively x =
0);
Since the probability that two local fitness functions share at least one variable is equal

4.2 2-SAT Sub-problems in N (n, 2, z) and a Tighter Upper Bound
In this subsection, we establish a tighter upper bound z > 2.837 for the threshold of the fixed
ratio model N (n, 2, z) by showing that asymptotically N (n, 2, z) contains an unsatisfiable
2-SAT sub-problem with probability 1 for any value of z greater than 2.873. This also
gives us a polynomial time algorithm which determines that N (n, 2, z) is insoluble with
probability asymptotic to 1 for z > 2.837.

Recall from Section 2 that each instance of N (n, 2, z) has an equivalent 3-SAT instance.
The idea is to show that with probability asymptotic to 1, an instance of N (n, 2, z) will
contain a set of specially structured 3-clauses, called a t-3-module (Definition 10.3, Franco
& Gelder, 1998):
M = {M1 , . . . , M3p+2 }, t = 3p + 2,
where
M1 = (u1  u2  z1 , u1  u2  z1 );

Mp1 = (up1  up  zp1 , up1  up  zp1 );
Mp = (up  u0  zp , up  u0  zp );
Mp+1 = (up+1  up+2  zp+1 , up+1  up+2  zp+1 );

M3p1 = (u3p1  u3p  z3p1 , u3p1  u3p  z3p1 );
M3p = (u3p  u0  z3p , u3p  u0  z3p )
M3p+1 = (u0  u1  z3p+1 , u0  u1  z3p+1 );
M3p+2 = (u0  up+1  z3p+2 , u0  up+1  z3p+2 );
and u1 ,    , u3p+1 , z1 ,    , z3p+1 are binary variables. Notice that a t-3-module can be reduced to a 2-SAT problem containing two contradictory cycles and hence is unsatisfiable.
The result is proved in two steps. In the first step, it is shown that for z > 2.837 the
average number of t-3-modules contained in N (n, 2, z) tends to infinity as n increases. In
the second step, we use a result established by Alon and Spencer (1992) on the second
moment method to prove that for z > 2.837 the probability that N (n, 2, z) contains at least
one t-3-module tends to 1.
Let us start with the first step to show that the average number of t-3-modules contained
in N (n, 2, z) tends to infinity as n increases.
Definition 4.1. Given a t-3-module M and an NK landscape instance f =

n
P

fi , k = 2, a

i=1

sequence of local fitness functions
g = (g1 ,    , gt )  (f1 ,    , fn )
is said to be a possible match(PM) if for each 1  m  t, the main variable of gm is one of
the three variables that occur in the 3-module Mm . A subsequence (h1 ,    , hl ) of a possible
match g is legal if for any 1  m < j  l, hm 6= hj .
Lemma 4.2. Let f (x) =

n
P

fi (xi , (xi )) be an instance of N (n, 2, z) and M be a t-3-

i=1

t
module. Then the number of possible matches
 for the t-3-module M is 3 . Further, the

number of legal possible matches is  ( 3+2 5 )t .

319

fiGao & Culberson

Proof: For each 1  m  t, there are exactly 3 possible choices for gm :
fi1 (xi1 , (xi1 )), fi2 (xi2 , (xi2 )), fi3 (xi3 , (xi3 )),
where xi1 , xi2 , and xi3 correspond to the three variables that occur in the 3-module Mm .
Therefore, there are 3t possible matches for the t-3-module.
To prove the second conclusion, we divide the t-3-module into 3 parts M = (M1 , M2 , M3 ),
where M1 = (Mm , 1  m  p), M2 = (Mm , p + 1  m  3p  1), and M3 =
(M3p , M3p+1 , M3p+2 ). Letting L1 , L2 , and L3 be the number of legal possible matches for
M1 , M2 , M3 respectively. Since the literals in M1 are variable-distinct from the literals in
M2 , we have that the number of legal possible matches, L, for the t-3-module M satisfies
L1 L2  L  27L1 L2 .
We now estimate the order of L1 . To this end, we consider the probability space (, P ),
where  is the set of sequences (g1 ,    , gp ) of local fitness functions that possibly match M1
and P is the uniform probability distribution. Then, the number of legal possible matches
is
L1 = ||  P r{a random sample from  is legal}
(4.5)
Let g = (g1 ,    , gp ) be a random sample from  and xgm denote the main variable of the
local fitness function gm , then we have
1
P r{xgm = |um |} = P r{xgm = |um+1 |} = P r{xgm = |zm |} = ,
3
where |u| denotes the variable corresponding to the literal u.
Let Bm , 0 < m  p be the event that the first m local fitness functions g1 ,    , gm in
the possible match g = (g1 ,    , gp ) are mutually distinct. Since in M1 only consecutive
3-modules share variables, we have
Bm = {(g1 ,    , gm ) : gi 6= gi+1 , 1  i  m  1}.
Let bm = P r{gm 6= gm1 | Bm1 }, m  2, and b1 = 1. Notice that B1 = . Then, we have
P r{g = (g1 ,    , gp )is legal} = P r{Bp }
= P r{g1 6= g2 , g2 6= g3 ,    , gp1 6= gp }
= P r{B1 }P r{g2 6= g1 | B1 }  P r{g3 6= g2 | B2 }    P r{gp 6= gp1 | Bp1 }

Recalling that xgm denotes the main variable of the local fitness function gm , we have
bp = P r{gp1 6= gp , xgp1 = |up | | Bp1 } + P r{gp1 6= gp , xgp1 6= |up | | Bp1 }
= P r{gp1 6= gp | Bp1 , xgp1 = |up |}  P r{xgp1 = |up | | Bp1 } +

The last equation in the above formula is because that given Bp1 and xgp2 = |up1 |
(or xgp2 6= |up1 |), we have two (three, respectively) choices in selecting the local fitness
function gp1 . Consider the two terms P r{Bp1 , xgp2 = |up1 |} and P r{Bp1 , xgp2 6=
|up1 |} in (4.8), we have
P r{Bp1 , xgp2 = |up1 |}

The following Lemma calculates the probability that a matching local fitness function
implies the matched 3-module.

that the main variable xg of g is one of the three Boolean variables |x|, |y|, |w|, let z =

Proof: Since xg is already one of the variables in the 3-module, the probability that
1
the other two variables are also in the 3-module is n1
.
( 2 )
Now, assume that the variables of the local fitness function g are the same as the
variables in the 3-module. From the definition of the fixed ratio model, g has two zeros
in its fitness value assignment with probability (1  ), and has three zeros in its fitness
assignment with probability . Note that the local fitness function g implies the 3-module
x  y  w, x  y  w if and only if
g(x, y, w) = 0 and

g(x, y, w) = 0.

From the definition of the fixed ratio model, this happens with the probability

The Lemma follows.
With the above preparation, we can now prove that the average number of t-3-modules
contained in N (n, 2, z) tends to infinity.

(4.19)

Solving the inequality (4.19) gives us  > 0.837, that is, z = 2 +  > 2.837. This proves
Theorem 4.2.
Based on the Chebychevs inequality, to prove that N (n, 2, z) contains t-3-modules with
probability 1, we need to show that the variance of At , the number of contained t-3-modules,
is o(E{At }). For this purpose, we follow Franco and Gelders approach (Lemma 4.1, Franco
& Gelder, 1998) to apply the second moment method (Alon & Spencer, 1992):
Lemma 4.4. (Alon & Spencer, 1992, Ch. 4.3 Cor 3.5) Given a random structure(e.g., a
random CNF formula), let W be the set of substructures under consideration, A(w) be the
set of substructures sharing some clauses with w  W . Let Iw = 1 when w is in the random
structure and 0 otherwise. If
(1) elementsP
of W are symmetric;
(2)  = E{
Iw }  ; and
wW
P
(3)
P r(w | w) = o(), for each w  W ,
wA(w)

then as n  , the probability that the random structure contains a substructure tends to
1.
To use the above Lemma to study the 2-SAT sub-problem in NK landscapes, we view
the random structure to be a random instance of N (n, 2, z), and W to be the set of all
t-3-modules which are symmetric by their definitions(Sections 5 and 10, Franco & Gelder,
1998).
Theorem 4.3. If z = 2 +  > 2.837, then N (n, 2, z) is asymptotically insoluble with
probability 1.
Proof:
Let At be the number of t-3-modules implied by N (n, 2, z) and t = O(ln2 n).
Theorem 4.2 shows that lim E{At } = . By Lemma 4.4, it is enough to show that for
n
each w  W ,
X
P r(w | w) = o(E{At }),
(4.20)
wA(w)

where P r(w | w) is the conditional probability that N (n, 2, z) implies the t-3-module w
given that it implies w, and A(w) is the set of all t-3-modules sharing some clauses with w.
Suppose that w shares Q, 1  Q  2t clauses with w, and that these Q clauses are
distributed among q 3-modules. Further, let q1 be the number of 3-modules whose two
clauses are both shared and q2 = q  q1 the number of 3-modules that only has one clause
shared.
Let T1 be a 3-module in w that shares exactly one clause with a 3-module T2 in w.
We claim that the conditional probability that T1 is implied by N (n, 2, z) given that w is
implied by N (n, 2, z), is
1

 + O( ).
(4.21)

n
324

fiPhase Transition in NK Landscapes

Without loss of generality, assume that T2 = {xyu, xy u} and T1 = {xyu, xy u}.
Since w is implied by N (n, 2, z), there is a local fitness function g = g(|x|, |y|, |u|) that implies
T2 . The conditional probability that T1 is implied, is less than or equal to P1 + P2 where
P1 is the conditional probability that g also implies the clause x  y  u given that g implies
T2 , and P2 is the conditional probability that the clause x  y  u is implied by other local
fitness functions. By the definition of N (n, 2, z), we have that P1 = 61 . Since a local fitness
function implies x  y  u only if it has the same variables with g = g(|x|, |y|, |u|), we have
that P2 = O( n1 ). The claim is proved. It follows that, for sufficiently large n,

Let AQ,q,q2 (w) be the set of t-3-modules that share Q clauses with w such that these Q
clauses are distributed over q different 3-modules. As before, q1 is the number of 3-modules
whose two clauses are both shared and q2 = q  q1 the number of 3-modules that only has
one clause shared. We claim that
|AQ,q,q2 (w)| = |A2q,q,0 (w)|6q2 .

(4.23)

where A2q,q,0 (w) is the set of t-3-modules that share all the 2q clauses in the q 3-modules
with w. Let M = {M1 ,    , Mt } be a t-3-module in which all the clauses Mi , 1  i  q
are shared with w. Let M = {M1 ,    , Mt } be a t-3-module in which all the clauses in
Mi , 1  i  q1 are shared and each of the 3-modules Mi , q1 + 1  q1 + q2 has only one
clause shared. Since for each of the q2 3-modules, we have 6 ways to choose the non-shared
clauses, there are 6q2 such t-3-modules M in AQ,q,q2 (w) that correspond to one t-3-module
M in A2q,q,0 . The claims follow. From formula (55) and (56) in (Franco & Gelder, 1998)

5. Experiments
Our study of the threshold phenomena in NK landscapes started with an experimental
investigation. Many of the theoretical results in the previous section are motivated by
the observations made in our experiments. In this section, we describe the approach and
methods we used in the experimental study, and report the results and observations we
have made.
In our experiments, an instance of the NK landscape decision problem is converted to an
equivalent 3-SAT problem, and then the 3-SAT problem is solved using Robertos relsatan
enhanced version of the famous Davis-Putnam algorithm for SAT problems implemented in
C ++ . The source code of relsat can be found at http://www.cs.ubc.ca/ hoos/SATLIB/.
In the experiments, we generated random instances of the NK landscape decision problem from the random model N (n, 2, z). As a result, the equivalent SAT problem for each
random NK landscape instance is a 3-SAT problem with n variables and (on average) zn
clauses. By definition, the parameter z is between 0 and 8. For z  1, the 3-SAT instance
can be solved easily by setting the literals that correspond to the main variables of the
local fitness function to true. As z increases, we get more and more clauses and the 3-SAT
problem becomes more and more constrained. The aims of the experiments are threefold:(1)Investigating if there exists a threshold phenomenon in the random NK landscape
model; (2) Locating the threshold of the parameter z; and (3)Determining if there are any
hard instances around the threshold.
5.1 Experiments on the Fixed Ratio Model
In this part of the experiments, we generate 100 random instances of N (n, 2, z) for each
of the parameters n = 29    216 and z = 2.71, 2.72,    , 3.00. These instances are then
converted to 3-SAT instances and solved by relsat. Figure 1 shows the fraction of insoluble
instances as a function of the parameter z. It can be seen that there exists a threshold
phenomenon and the threshold is around 2.83. This shows that our upper bound z = 2.837
is very tight.

In Figure 2, we plot the square root of the average search cost as a function of the
parameter n. The figure indicates that the average search is in O(n2 ) for any parameter
z. We have also observed that more than 99 percent of the insoluble instances are solved
quickly in the preprocessing stage of relsat. This indicates that there must be some small
structures that make the instances insoluble. More detailed experimental results can be
found in Gaos thesis (Gao, 2001).
5.2 Experiments on the 2-SAT sub-Problem
This is the part of the experiments that motivated our theoretical analyses in Section 4.2.
The idea can be explained as follows. Let

the equivalent 3-SAT problem where Ci is the set of 3-clauses equivalent to the local fitness
function fi . For each i, there is a set of 2-clauses Di (possibly empty) implied by Ci . For
example, if Ci has three 3-clauses ((x, y, z), (x, y, z), (x, y, z)), then the set of 2-clauses Di
would be ((x, z), (x, y)). The conjunction of Di , denoted by , is a 2-SAT problem. It is
obvious that the original 3-SAT problem  is satisfiable only if the 2-SAT sub-problem  is
satisfiable. In the experiment, we generate instances of the NK landscape N (n, 2, z), convert

problems are then solved by the relsat solver. If the 2-SAT problem is unsatisfiable, then
the original NK landscape instance is also insoluble.
The experimental settings are the same as those in the experiment on the original
problem. The results are shown in Figures 3-4, in parallel to the Figures 1-2 of the results
on the original 3-SAT problems in Section 5.1. We see that the patterns of insoluble fractions
and search cost are similar to those we found in the original 3-SAT problems. There is a
soluble-insoluble phase transition occurring around 2.83, but the fraction of unsatisfiable
instances is lower than the fraction in the original 3-SAT problems.
We also observed that the average search cost for the 2-SAT sub-problems remains the
same as that for the original 3-SAT problems. This tells us that the difficulty of solving a
soluble instance of NK landscape is almost the same as that of solving a 2-SAT problem, and
hence is easy. Therefore, on average the NK landscape N (n, 2, z) is also easy at parameters
below the threshold where almost all of the instances are soluble.

6. Implications and Conclusions
One of the questions that arises about this work is its implications to the design and analysis of genetic algorithms. NK landscapes were initially conceived as simplified models
of evolutionary landscapes which could be tuned with respect to ruggedness and epistatic
interactions (Kauffman, 1989). In the study of genetic algorithms, NK landscape models
have been used as a prototype and benchmark in the analysis of the performance of different genetic operators and the effects of different encoding methods on the algorithms

performance (Altenberg, 1997; Hordijk, 1997; Jones, 1995). Kauffman (1993) points out
that the parameters that primarily affect a number of ruggedness measures are n and k.
Nevertheless, the fact that for k  2 the discrete NK landscape is NP-complete (Wright
et al., 2000) when the neighbors are arbitrarily chosen could be construed as implying that
random landscapes with fixed k are in practice hard.
The results in this paper should serve as a cautionary note that this may not be the
case. Our analyses show that for fixed k the uniform probability model is trivially solvable
as the problem size tends to infinity. For the fixed ratio model, we have derived two upper
bounds for the threshold of the solubility phase transition, and proved that the problem
with the control parameter above the upper bounds can be solved in polynomial time with
probability asymptotic to 1 due to the existence of easy sub-problems such as 2-SAT. A
series of experiments has also been conducted to investigate the hardness of the problem
with the control parameters around and below the threshold. From the experiments, we
have observed that the problem is also easy around and below the threshold.
Our proofs hold only for the decision version of the problem where the component functions are discrete on {0, 1}. The proofs are obtained by noticing that the clustering of
functions, or clauses, on selected subsets of variables implies that the overall problem is
decomposable into independent subproblems, or that the problem contains small substructures that identify the solution. The subproblems are the components of the connection
graph defined in Section 3 and the 2-SAT sub-problems studied in Section 4.2. It is currently unclear to us to what extent our analysis can be extended to the optimization version
of the NK model, and we would like to study this problem further in the future.
In response to the question what are the implications for GAs? we suggest the following
speculative line of enquiry. For the discrete model we use, the soluble instances are readily
solved by a standard algorithmic approach based on recognizing the components of the
connection graph. (This should not be a surprise for us as it has been pointed out by
Heckendorn, Rana, and Whitley (1999) that Even relatively old algorithms such as DavisPutnam which are deterministic and exact are orders of magnitude faster than GAs.) 1 A
similar connectivity can be developed for real valued distributions, for example by capping
the minimum value which we allow a sub-function to take. We can speculate that the
clustering imposed by fixed values of k would also generate localized structures when real
values are applied and when considering optimization instead of decision, but perhaps with
fuzzy boundaries. In fact, this observation is just the flip side of limited epistasis. Genetic
algorithms, or their variants such as the probabilistic model-building algorithms (Larranaga
& Lozano, 2001), designed to mimic natural evolution, are supposed to take advantage of
this situation. So, to the extent that NK landscapes are an accurate reflection of the
features exploited by evolutionary algorithms, we pose the following question. Is it possible
to identify these fuzzy components if they exist, and in doing so design an algorithm that
exploits the same landscape features that the evolutionary algorithms do, but far more
efficiently, as we have done for the uniform discrete decision problem?
These landscapes were designed with the intent of studying limited interactions, and our
results can also be seen as a confirmation that indeed limited epistasis leads to easier problems. In another domain, that of the more traditional research into search and optimization,

there is a need for test bed problems with real world connections which are tunable with
respect to difficulty. NK landscapes might have been such a domain for generating 3-SAT
instances. It is disappointing that for restricted k the instances generated are easy with
high probability.
