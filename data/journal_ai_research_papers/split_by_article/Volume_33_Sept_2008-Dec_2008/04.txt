Abstract
Correlated equilibrium generalizes Nash equilibrium to allow correlation devices. Correlated equilibrium captures the idea that in many systems there exists a trusted administrator who can recommend behavior to a set of agents, but can not enforce such behavior.
This makes this solution concept most appropriate to the study of multi-agent systems in
AI. Aumann showed an example of a game, and of a correlated equilibrium in this game in
which the agents welfare (expected sum of players utilities) is greater than their welfare in
all mixed-strategy equilibria. Following the idea initiated by the price of anarchy literature
this suggests the study of two major measures for the value of correlation in a game with
nonnegative payoffs:
1. The ratio between the maximal welfare obtained in a correlated equilibrium to the maximal
welfare obtained in a mixed-strategy equilibrium. We refer to this ratio as the mediation
value.
2. The ratio between the maximal welfare to the maximal welfare obtained in a correlated equilibrium. We refer to this ratio as the enforcement value.
In this work we initiate the study of the mediation and enforcement values, providing
several general results on the value of correlation as captured by these concepts. We also
present a set of results for the more specialized case of congestion games , a class of games
that received a lot of attention in the recent literature.

1. Introduction
Much work in the area of multi-agent systems adopts game-theoretic reasoning. This is
due to the fact that many existing systems consist of self-motivated participants, each of
which attempts to optimize his own performance. As a result the Nash equilibrium, the
central solution concept in game theory, has become a major tool in the study and analysis of
multi-agent systems. Nash equilibrium captures multi-agent behavior which is stable against

unilateral deviations. Naturally, a system that is fully controlled by a designer can enforce
behaviors which lead to a higher welfare than the one obtained in a fully decentralized system
in which agents behave selfishly and follow some Nash equilibrium. The comparison between
these quantities is studied under the title of work on the price of anarchy (Koutsoupias &
Papadimitriou, 1999; Roughgarden & Tardos, 2002; Christodoulou & Koutsoupias, 2005),
and is a subject of much interest in computer science. However, fully controlled systems
versus fully uncontrolled systems are two extreme points. As was acknowledged in various
works in AI (Shoham & Tennenholtz, 1995a, 1995b) one of the main practical approaches to
dealing with realistic systems is to consider systems with some limited centralized control.
Indeed, in most realistic systems there is a designer who can recommend behavior; this
should be distinguished from the strong requirement that the designer can dictate behavior.
Correlated equilibrium, introduced by Aumann (1974), is the most famous game-theoretic
solution concept referring to a designer who can recommend but not enforce behavior. In
a game in strategic form, a correlated strategy is a probability distribution over the set
of strategy profiles, where a strategy profile is a vector of strategies, one for each player.
A correlated strategy is utilized as follows: A strategy profile is selected according to the
distribution, and every player is informed about her strategy in the profile. This selected
strategy for the player is interpreted as a recommendation of play. Correlated strategies are
most natural, since they capture the idea of a system administrator/reliable party who can
recommend behavior but can not enforce it. Hence, correlated strategies make perfect sense
in the context of congestion control, load balancing, trading, etc. A correlated strategy is
called a correlated equilibrium if it is better off for every player to obey her recommended
strategy if she believes that all other players obey their recommended strategies1 . Correlated
equilibrium makes perfect sense in the context of work on multi-agent systems in AI in which
there exists a mediator who can recommend behavior to the agents.2 A major potential
benefit of a mediator who is using a correlated equilibrium is to attempt to improve the
welfare of selfish players. In this paper, the welfare obtained in a correlated strategy is
defined to be the expected sum of the utilities of the players, and it is referred to as the
welfare obtained in this correlated strategy.
A striking example introduced in Aumanns seminal paper (1974) is of a two-player
two-strategy game, where the welfare obtained in a correlated equilibrium is higher than
the welfare obtained in every mixed-strategy equilibrium of the game. A modification of
Aumanns example serves us as a motivating example.
Aumanns Example:

1. Every correlated strategy defines a Bayesian game in which the private signal of every player is her
recommended strategy. It is a correlated equilibrium if obeying the recommended strategy by every
player is a pure-strategy equilibrium in this Bayesian game.
2. The use of mediators in obtaining desired behaviors, in addition to improving social welfare, has been
further studied, (e.g., Monderer & Tennenholtz, 2004, 2006; Rozenfeld & Tennenholtz, 2007; Ashlagi,
Monderer, & Tennenholtz, 2008). However, the mediators discussed in that work makes use of more
powerful capabilities than just making recommendation based on probabilistic coin flips.

As a result, Aumanns example suggests that correlation may be a way to improve
welfare while still assuming that players are rational in the classical game-theoretic sense.3
In this game, there are three mixed-strategy equilibrium profiles. Two of them are
obtained with pure strategies, (a1 , b1 ), and (a2 , b2 ). The welfare in each of these purestrategy equilibrium profiles equals six. There is an additional mixed-strategy equilibrium
in which every player chooses each of her strategies with equal probabilities. The welfare
obtained in this profile equals 5 (= 14 (6 + 0 + 8 + 6)) because every entry in the matrix
is played with probability 41 . Hence, the maximal welfare in a mixed-strategy equilibrium
equals 6. Consider the following correlated strategy: a probability of 1/3 is assigned to
every pure strategy profile but (a1 , b2 ). This correlated strategy is a correlated equilibrium.
Indeed, when the row player is recommended to play a1 she knows that the other player
is recommended to play b1 , and therefore she strictly prefers to play a1 . When the row
player is recommended to play a2 the conditional probability of each of the columns is half,
and therefore she weakly prefers to play a2 . Similar argument applied to the column player
shows that the correlated strategy is indeed a correlated equilibrium. The welfare associated
1
with this correlated equilibrium equals 20
3 (= 3 (6 + 8 + 6)).
The above discussion suggests one may wish to consider the value of correlation in
games. In order to address the challenge of studying the value of correlation, we tackle two
fundamental issues:
 How much can the society/system gain by adding a correlation device, where we
assume that without such a device the agents play a mixed-strategy equilibrium.
 How much does the society/system loose from the fact that the correlation device can
only recommend (and can not enforce) a course of action?
Accordingly we introduce two measures, the mediation value and the enforcement value.
These measures make sense mainly for games with nonnegative utilities, which are the focus
of this paper.
The mediation value measures the ratio between the maximal welfare in a correlated
equilibrium to the maximal welfare in a mixed-strategy equilibrium. Notice that the higher
the mediation value is, the more correlation helps. Hence, the mediation value measures
the value of a reliable mediator who can just recommend a play in a model in which there
is an anarchy without the mediator, where anarchy is defined to be the situation in which
the players use the welfare-best mixed-strategy equilibrium, that is, anarchy is the best
outcome reached by rational and selfish agents.4
3. Other advantages are purely computational ones. As has been recently shown, correlated equilibrium
can be computed in polynomial time even for structured representations of games (Kakade, Kearns,
Langford, & Ortiz, 2003; Papadimitriou, 2005).
4. The phenomenon of multiple equilibria forces a modeling choice of the concept of anarchy, which could
have been defined also as the welfare-worst mixed-strategy equilibrium, or as a convex combination of

577

fiAshlagi, Monderer, & Tennenholtz

In Aummans example it can be shown that the correlated equilibrium introduced above
is the best correlated equilibrium, i.e., it attains the maximal welfare among all correlated
equilibria in the game. Hence, the mediation value of Aumanns example is 10
9 .
The enforcement value measures the ratio between the maximal welfare to the maximal
welfare in a correlated equilibrium. That is, it is the value of a center who can dictate a
course of play with respect to a mediator who can just use correlation devices in equilibrium.
As the maximal welfare in Aumanns example is 8, the enforcement value in this game equals
6
5.
In this paper we establish general and basic results concerning the measures defined
above. We consider the mediation (enforcement) value of classes of games, which is defined
to be the least upper bound of the mediation (enforcement) values of the games in the class.
We first study general games. Then we consider the important class of congestion games
(Rosenthal, 1973; Monderer & Shapley, 1996). Indeed, this class of games is perhaps the
most applicable to the game theory and CS synergy. In particular, results regarding the
price of anarchy have been obtained for congestion games. We restrict our study to simple
congestion games.
Next we summarize our main results and discuss some related literature.
1.1 Main Results for General Games
Aumanns example implies that the mediation value of the class of two-player two-strategy
(22) games is at least 10/9. In this paper it is proved that the mediation value of this class
equals 4/3. Next, more complex games are studied. In particular we consider two possible
minimal extensions of 2  2 games: Two-player games with three strategies for one of the
players and two strategies for the other, and three-player games with two strategies for each
player. It is shown that the mediation value of each of these classes is unbounded, i.e., it
equals . Consequently, the mediation value is unbounded for classes of larger games.5
This should be interpreted as a positive result, showing the extreme power of correlation.
Considering the enforcement value, it is proved that it equals  for the classes of 2  2
or larger games. The proof of this result uses games with weakly dominant strategies. We
show, however, that the enforcement value of the class of three-player two-strategy games
without weakly dominated strategies also equals .
1.2 Main Results for Simple Congestion Games
In a simple congestion game there is a set of facilities. Every facility j is associated with a
nonnegative payoff function wj . Every player chooses a facility, say facility j, and receives
wj (k), where k is the number of players that chose facility j.
For completeness we first deal with the simple case, in which there exist only two players,
and show that the mediation value of the class of simple congestion games with two facilities
equals 4/3. In the more general case, in which there are m  2 facilities, it is proved that
the mediation value is bounded from above by 2. However, it is proved that the mediation
the best-welfare and worst-welfare mixed strategy equilibrium .This choice is a matter of taste, and we
chose the best option.
5. A game  is larger than the game  if it is obtained from  by adding players, and/or by adding strategies
to the players in .

fiOn The Value of Correlation

value equals 1 for the class of simple congestion games with non-increasing facility payoff
functions.
For the case of more than two players, we show that the mediation value is unbounded
for the class of games with three players and two facilities with non-increasing payoffs. In
contrast,
in the linear case, it is proved that the mediation value is bounded from above

by 5+1

1.618 for the class of games with any number of players and two facilities with
2
non-increasing linear payoff functions. We give an example for a game in this class whose
mediation value equals 9/8, leaving open a significant gap.
Additional special theorems are proved for simple congestion games with symmetric
(identical) facilities; It is proved that, for every n  4, the mediation value is higher than 1
for the class of two symmetric (identical) facilities with non-increasing payoffs and n players.
This further illustrates the power of correlation. Nevertheless, we show that every simple
congestion game with any number of players and any number of symmetric facilities, in
which the facility payoff functions satisfy a certain concavity requirement, the best mixedstrategy equilibrium obtains the maximal welfare, and therefore both the mediation value
and the enforcement value of such a game equal 1.
Finally, we study the enforcement value in the case, in which there exist n players and m
symmetric facilities with arbitrary facility payoff functions. We characterize the set of such
games for which the enforcement value equals 1, and as a result, determine the situations
where correlation allows obtaining maximal welfare.
1.3 Related Literature
We end this introduction with a discussion of some relevant issues in the price of anarchy
literature, and their potential relationships to the concepts of mediation value and enforcement value.6 In many situations it is natural to deal with nonnegative costs rather than
utilities; indeed, the literature on the price of anarchy focused on such models. When
translating the definition of price of anarchy7 to games with utilities and not with costs,
the price of anarchy with utilities is the ratio between the maximal welfare to the minimal
welfare obtained in a mixed-strategy equilibrium. The higher this number is, the value of
a center is higher, where a center can enforce a course of play. Hence, the price of anarchy
with utilities measures the value of a center with respect to anarchy, where a center can
dictate a play, and when anarchy is measured by the worst social outcome reached by rational and selfish agents. Recently, Anshelevich, Dasgupta, Kleinberg, Tardos, Wexler, and
Roughgarden (2004) defined price of stability in models with costs.8 Accordingly, the price
of stability with utilities, is the ratio between the maximal welfare and the maximal welfare
in a mixed-strategy equilibrium. A relevant concept using correlated equilibrium in models
with costs has been defined independently by Christodoulou and Koutsoupias (2005), and
is referred to as the price of stability of correlated equilibria.9 When translated to a model
6. The concept of the price of anarchy has received much attention in the recent computer science literature,
(e.g., Marvonicolas & Spirakis, 2001; Czumaj & Vocking, 2002; Roughgarden, 2002; Roughgarden &
Tardos, 2002).
7. The price of anarchy is defined for games with costs as the ratio between the maximal cost in a mixedstrategy equilibrium to the minimal cost.
8. It is the ratio between the minimal cost in a a mixed strategy equilibrium to the minimal cost.

with utilities, the price of stability of correlated equilibria with utilities is the ratio between
the maximal welfare and the maximal welfare in a mixed-strategy equilibrium, that is it is
the enforcement value.10 However, results proved for one of the ratios in one of the models
cannot be translated to results on the analogous ratio in the other model. This is due the
fact that when moving from one model to the other does not only require multiplication by
a negative constant, e.g. -1, but the numbers also need to be shifted to remain nonnegative;
needless to say, the corresponding ratios can be significantly changed by such shifting.11
We return to this discussion in Section 4.1.

2. Basic Definitions
A finite game in strategic form is a tuple  = (N, (S i )iN , (ui )iN ); N is a nonempty finite
set of players. Unless otherwise specified we assume that N = {1, 2, ...., n}, n  1. For
each i  N , S i is a finite set of strategies of player i. Let S = S 1  S 2      S n be the
set of strategy profiles (n-tuples). An element of S is s = (si )iN . For each i  N and
s  S let si = (s1 , ..., si1 , si+1 , ...sn ) denote the strategies played by everyone but i. Thus
s = (si , si ). For each player i  N , let ui : S  R be the utility function of player i. ui (s)
is the utility of player i when the profile of strategies s is played.  is called a nonnegative
game if all utilities to all players are nonnegative, i.e., ui : S  R+ for every player i.
A player can also randomize among her strategies by using a mixed strategy - a distribution over her set of strategies. For any finite set C, (C) denotes the set of probability
distributions over C. Thus P i = (S i ) is the set of mixed strategies of player i. Let pi  P i
be a mixed strategy of i. For every si  S i , pi (si ) is the probability that player i plays
strategy si in pi . Every pure strategy si  S i is, with the natural identification, a mixed
strategy psi  P i in which

1 ti = s i
i
psi (t ) =
0 ti 6= si .
psi is called a pure strategy, and si is interchangeably called a strategy and a pure strategy
(when it is identified with psi ). Let P = P 1  P 2      P n be the set of mixed strategy
profiles.
Let si , ti  S i be pure strategies of player i. We say that si weakly dominates ti , and ti
is weakly dominated by si if for all si  Si
ui (si , si )  ui (ti , si ),
where at least one inequality is strict. We say that si strictly dominates ti , and ti is strictly
dominated by si if all of the above inequalities are strict. If ui (si , si ) = u(ti , si ) for all
si  Si , we will say that si and ti are equivalent strategies for player i.
Any   (S) is called a correlated strategy. Every mixed strategy profile p  P
can be interpreted as the correlated strategy p , where for every strategy profile s  S,
10. For completeness, one can define the mediation value with costs as the ratio between the minimal cost
at a mixed-strategy equilibrium to the minimal cost at a correlated equilibrium.
11. Interestingly, it can be shown that there exist classes of cost games in which the price of anarchy is
bounded, while the price of anarchy with utilities in the analogous classes of utility games is unbounded.
The class of cost games analogous to the class of utility games given in Example 2 in Section 4.1.2,
constitutes one such example.

Naturally, for every p  P we denote ui (p) = ui (p ). Hence ui (p) is the expected utility

We say that p  P is a mixed-strategy equilibrium if ui (pi , pi )  ui (pi , q i ) for every
player i  N and for every q i  P i . Let p  P be a mixed-strategy equilibrium. If for every
i, pi is a pure strategy, we will also call p a pure-strategy equilibrium.

given that all other players follow their own recommendations. Hence, if this difference is
nonnegative, player i is better off playing si .

Note that vN () and vC () are well defined due to the compactness of N () and C()
respectively, and the continuity of u. Define opt() (the maximal welfare) as follows:

One of the tools we need in this paper is linear programming. For any game  in

We will also make use of the following notation and definitions. Let G be the class of all
nonnegative games in strategic form. For m1 , m2 , ..., mn  1 denote by Gm1 m2 mn  G
the class of all games with n players in which |S i | = mi for every player i.

3. Results for General Games
The following two basic lemmas are used in some of the proofs in this paper. The proof
of Lemma 1 follows directly from Definition 1, and the proof of Lemma 2 is standard.
Therefore, these proofs are omitted.
12. An elementary proof of existence of correlated equilibrium, which does not use the existence of a mixedstrategy equilibrium is given by Hart and Schmeidler (1989).

fiOn The Value of Correlation

Lemma 1 Let  be a game in strategic form. Let si  S i be weakly dominated by some
ti  S i , and let si  Si . Then (s) = 0 for every correlated equilibrium  for which
ui (ti , si ) > ui (si , si ).
Consequently, if si is a strictly dominated strategy, (s) = 0 for every correlated equilibrium
.
Next we define extensions of a game by adding a dummy strategy to one of the players, or by
adding a dummy player. Let   Gm1 m2 mn . The game   Gm1 mi1 (mi +1)mi+1 mn
is an extension of  by adding a dummy strategy to player i if it is obtained from  by adding
a strategy to player i such that the utility of all n players equal zero, when player i uses
this new strategy.
The game   Gm1 m2 mn 1 is an extension of  by adding a dummy player, player
n + 1, if it is obtained from  by adding player n + 1 with a single strategy such that the
utilities of this player are all zeros, and the utility of all n players remain as in . That is,
ui (s, d) = ui (s) for every s  S, where d denotes the unique added strategy of player n + 1.
A game  is a trivial extension of  if there is a sequence of games,
 = 0 , 1 ,    , t = 
such that k is obtained from k1 by adding a dummy player or a dummy strategy.

EV ().
3.1 The Mediation Value
In this section we show the power of correlation in general games. We start with extending
Aumanns result on the power of correlation in 2  2 games.

can be obtained in a 2  2 game.

Theorem 1 M V (G22 ) = 43 .
The following lemma is needed for the proof of Theorem 1:
Lemma 3 (Peeters & Potters, 1999) Let   G22 . If there exist a correlated equilibrium
in , which is not induced by a mixed-strategy equilibrium,  has at least two pure-strategy
equilibria.
Before we give the proof of Theorem 1 we need the following technical remarks, which holds
for the rest of the paper:
Remark: In all the games introduced by figures, we denote by player 1,2,3 the row,
column, and matrix (if exist) players respectively. In each strategy profile the players
utilities are given from left to right where player is utility is the ith left payoff.
Proof of Theorem 1: We begin by showing that M V (G22 )  34 . Figure 1 below describes
an arbitrary game   G22 .

Figure 1
By Lemma 3, If  has less than two pure-strategy equilibrium profiles, M V () = 1.
Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that  has two or more pure-strategy
equilibrium profiles. However, if there are four pure-strategy equilibrium profiles, the mediation value equals 1. Therefore we should discuss the cases in which  has either two or
three pure-strategy equilibrium profiles.
Suppose  possesses exactly three pure-strategy equilibrium profiles, and without loss of
generality let (a2 , b2 ) be the only strategy profile not in equilibrium. Since (a1 , b1 ), (a2 , b1 )
and (a1 , b2 ) are all pure-strategy equilibria, m = a and b = k. Because (a2 , b2 ) is not an
equilibrium, c < j or d < n. If c < j, by Lemma 1, every correlated equilibrium   C()
satisfies (a2 , b2 ) = 0, and therefore M V () = 1. Similarly, if d < n, (a2 , b2 ) = 0 implies
M V () = 1.
Suppose there are exactly two pure-strategy equilibrium profiles in . These two equilibrium profiles may be in the same row, in the same column, or on a diagonal. Obviously,
the proof for the case that the two pure-strategy equilibrium profiles are in the same row
or in the same column is covered by the following proof, which assumes that the two purestrategy equilibrium profiles are in the first row. That is, (a1 , b1 ) and (a1 , b2 ) are both
pure-strategy equilibria. This assumption implies that b = k. Observe that any strategy
profile in which player 1 plays strategy a1 with probability one, and player 2 plays any
mixed strategy p2  P 2 , is a mixed-strategy equilibrium. Since there are exactly two purestrategy equilibria, it must be that m < a or c < j. If m < a and c < j, by Lemma 1 every
correlated equilibrium   C() satisfies both (a2 , b1 ) = 0 and (a2 , b2 ) = 0. Therefore
M V () = 1. Suppose m = a. Therefore c < j. Hence, by Lemma 1 every correlated
equilibrium   C() satisfies (a2 , b2 ) = 0. Since (a2 , b1 ) is not a pure-strategy equilibrium, n < d. Since b = k and n < d, then again by Lemma 1, every correlated equilibrium
  C() satisfies (a2 , b1 ) = 0. Therefore M V () = 1. We showed that M V () = 1 if
there are two pure-strategy equilibrium profiles, and they are on the same row or the same
column.
We proceed to the last case in which the two pure-strategy equilibrium profiles are on
a diagonal. Without loss of generality let (a1 , b1 ) and (a2 , b2 ) be pure-strategy equilibrium
profiles. It was shown by Peeters and Potters (1999) that if c = j or a = m or b = k or
d = n, C() is exactly the convex hull of N (). Hence, in this case there is no extreme
point of C() that is not a mixed-strategy equilibrium, and therefore the mediation value
equals 1. Therefore we can assume:
c > j, a > m, b > k

and d > n.

(3)

If both, u(a1 , b2 ) and u(a2 , b1 ) are smaller than max{u(a1 , b1 ), u(a2 , b2 )}, M V () = 1 and
the proof is completed. Therefore, without loss of generality we make the following two
assumptions:
(A1) u(a1 , b1 )  u(a2 , b2 ). That is, a + b  c + d.

Before continuing with the proof we will need the following geometric characterization of

points i , i = 1, ..., 5:

where i (j, k) denotes the probability given to the strategy profile (aj , bk ) in the correlated equilibrium i . That is, the (j, k)th entry of i is i (aj , bk ). By our agreement
to identify mixed-strategy profiles with correlated strategies we observe that the set of
mixed-strategy equilibrium is precisely
N () = {1 , 2 , 3 }.

We have to prove that u()  43 vN () for every correlated equilibrium   C(). It is
sufficient to prove that the inequality holds for the extreme points of C(). Since 1 , 2
and 3 are mixed-strategy equilibria, u(i )  vN () for i = 1, 2, 3. Therefore it suffices to
prove the inequality for 4 and 5 .
We first derive a couple of inequalities which will be useful for us. By (A1) and since
all utilities are nonnegative, a  c + d and d  c + d. Therefore, since m < a and n < d, we
obtain the inequality
m + n  2(c + d).

Since (a1 , b1 ) and (a2 , b2 ) are the only pure-strategy equilibrium profiles, m + n  a + d and
j + k  c + b. By (A2) and since m + n  a + d, c  a. Hence j + k  a + b. Therefore, by
(A1) we obtain

(6)
Note that inequality (6) implies that u(4 )  vN () since (a2 , b2 ) is a pure-strategy
equilibrium.
It remains to show that u(5 )  vN (). By (A1), u(1 )  u(2 ). We distinguish
between the following two cases:
Case 1: u(3 )  u(2 ).

We showed that the mediation value is bounded from above by 43 . It remains to show that
this bound is tight. We show a family of games for which the mediation value approaches the
above 43 bound. Consider the family of games x shown in Figure 2 (a variant of Aumanns

3.1.2 General Games
Theorem 1 shows that the mediation value of the class of nonnegative 2  2 games is finite.
In the next theorem we show that the mediation value is unbounded as we move slightly
beyond 2  2 games. In particular, if one of the players in a 2-player game has at least
three strategies, while the other remains with two strategies, the mediation value is already
unbounded. Similarly, if there are three players each with two strategies, the mediation
value is again unbounded. 13

It is standard to check that each profile in N (x, ) is indeed a mixed-strategy equilibrium,
and that if player 1 plays a pure-strategy in equilibrium, the only mixed-strategy equilibrium
are ((1, 0)(0, 1, 0)) and ((0, 1), (0, 0, 1)). We have to show that if player 1 plays fully mixed

1 is never indifferent between a1 and a2 and therefore player 1 is always better off deviating
to some pure strategy. If player 2 assigns positive probability only to b1 and b2 , player 1
is better off playing a1 . If player 2 assigns positive probability only to b2 and b3 , the only

mixed-strategy player 1 can play in order that player 2 will be indifferent between b2 and b3

does not exist an equilibrium in which player 1 fully mixes and player 2 assigns positive
probabilities to all of her pure strategies. Suppose player 2 assigns positive probabilities

We will show that vN () = 0, that is, the welfare in every mixed-strategy equilibrium
is zero. In addition we will construct a correlated equilibrium, which yields a strictly
positive welfare. We begin with proving that vN () = 0. Note that the only pure-strategy
equilibrium profiles in the game are (a1 , b1 , c1 ) and (a2 , b1 , c1 ). Obviously, every strategy
profile in which players 2 and 3 play b1 and c1 respectively, and player 1 plays any mixed
strategy, is a mixed-strategy equilibrium. We next show that there are no other mixedstrategy equilibria in the game. First we show that there are no other mixed-strategy
equilibria in which at least one of the players plays a pure strategy. We verify this for each
player:
1. Assume player 3 plays c2 with probability one. If 1 > p2 (b1 ) > 0, p1 (a2 ) = 1, but then
player 3 is better off playing c1 . If p2 (b1 ) = 1, p1 (a2 ) = 1, but then player 2 is better
off playing b2 . If p2 (b2 ) = 1, player 1 is indifferent. If p1 (a1 )  0.5, player 2 is better
off playing b1 . If p1 (a1 ) < 0.5, player 3 is better off playing c1 .
2. Assume player 3 plays c1 with probability one. If p2 (b2 ) > 0, p1 (a1 ) = 1, but then
player 3 is better off playing c2 .
3. Assume player 2 plays b1 with probability one. Player 3 is indifferent between her
strategies. If p3 (c2 ) > 0, p1 (a2 ) = 1, but then player 2 is better off playing b2 . p3 (c1 ) =
1 has been dealt in the previous case. Assume player 2 plays b2 with probability one.
If p3 (c1 ) > 0, p1 (a1 ) = 1, but then player 3 is better off playing c2 .
4. Assume player 1 plays a1 with probability one. If p2 (b2 ) > 0, p3 (c2 ) = 1, but then
player 2 is better off playing b1 with probability one. Assume player 1 plays a2 with
probability one. If p3 (c2 ) > 0, p2 (b2 ) = 1, but then player 3 is better off playing c1
with probability one.
Next we prove that there does not exist a completely mixed-strategy equilibrium, (an equilibrium in which every player assigns a positive probability to all of her strategies). Suppose
in negation that this is not the case. Let ((p, 1  p), (q, 1  q), (h, 1  h)) be a completely
mixed-strategy equilibrium, that is 1 > p, q, h > 0. By the equilibrium properties, player
2 is indifferent between b1 and b2 given that players 1 and 3 play (p, 1  p) and (h, 1  h)
respectively. Hence 4p(1  h) = 3(1  p)(1  h), which implies that p = 37 . Similarly, player
3 is indifferent between c1 and c2 given that players 1 and 2 play (p, 1  p) and (q, 1  q)
respectively. Therefore (1  p)(1  q) = p(1  q) yielding p = 0.5, which is a contradiction.
Therefore, there does not exist a completely mixed-strategy equilibrium.
We proved that vN () = 0. It remains to prove that there exists a correlated equilibrium
with a a strictly positive welfare; this will imply that the mediation value is infinity. Let

  (S) be the following correlated strategy. (a1 , b2 , c1 ) = (a2 , b2 , c1 ) = (a1 , b1 , c2 ) =
(a2 , b1 , c2 ) = 0.25 and for all other s  S, (s) = 0. We proceed to prove that  is
a correlated equilibrium. Indeed, observe that the following inequalities, which define a
correlated equilibrium are satisfied (as usual, in brackets we relate the inequality here to
the corresponding inequality in (2)):
1. (a1 , b2 , c1 )(2  1) + (a1 , b1 , c2 )(4  5)  0.

(i = 1, si = a1 , ti = a2 )

2. (a2 , b2 , c1 )(1  2) + (a2 , b1 , c2 )(5  4)  0.

The proof of Theorem 3 was based on showing that there exists a three-player nonnegative game, in which not all utilities are zero, yet the welfare in every mixed-strategy
equilibrium is zero. The next lemma shows that this phenomenon can not happen in a two
player game.
Lemma 4 Let   Gnm , n, m  1. vN () = 0 implies that all the utilities in  are zero.
That is, for i = 1, 2,
ui (t1 , t2 ) = 0 t1  S 1 , t2  S 2 .

Proof: The proof is by induction on the total number of pure strategies n + m in the game.
First note that the assertion holds for all games,   Gnm for which n + m = 2 because in
this case each player has exactly one strategy. Let k  2, and assume the assertion holds
for every game,   Gnm for which n + m  k.
Let   Gnm be a game in which n + m = k + 1 and for which vN () = 0. We should
prove that  is the zero game. As k + 1  3, there exists at least one player that has more
than one strategy; without loss of generality, player 1 is such a player.
Let p = (p1 , p2 ) be a mixed-strategy equilibrium in , that is, p  N (). Because
vN () = 0, the welfare at p equals 0. That is, u(p) = u1 (p) + u2 (p) = 0. Because utilities
are nonnegative,
u1 (p) = 0 = u2 (p).
(17)
Let s1 be an arbitrary fixed strategy for player 1 for which p1 (s1 ) > 0, and let s2 be an
arbitrary fixed strategy for player 2 for which p2 (s2 ) > 0.
Claim 1: (i) u1 (t1 , s2 ) = 0 t1  S 1 . (ii) u2 (s1 , t2 ) = 0 t2  S 2 .
Proof of Claim 1. Let t1  S 1 . Since (p1 , p2 ) is a mixed-strategy equilibrium
, u1 (t1 , p2 )

u (p , p ) = 0. Since u is nonnegative, u (t , p ) = 0. Since u (t , p ) = t2 S 2 p2 (t2 )u1 (t1 , t2 ),
u1 is nonnegative, and p2 (s2 ) > 0, u1 (t1 , s2 ) = 0. This proves (i). (ii) is similarly proved. 2
Consider the game   G(n1)m obtained by removing s1 from S 1 ; In this game the
strategy set of player 1 is T 1 = S 1 \{s1 } and the strategy set of player 2 remains S 2 . With a
591

fiAshlagi, Monderer, & Tennenholtz

slight abuse of notations The utility functions in  are also denoted by u1 and u2 . Claim
2: All utilities in  are zero.
Proof of Claim 2 :
Assume in negation that not all utilities in  are zero. By the induction hypothesis
there exists a mixed-strategy equilibrium (q 1 , q 2 )  N ( ) such that
u(q 1 , q 2 ) > 0.

(18)

Extend q 1 to the mixed strategy r1 of player 1 in  by defining r1 (s1 ) = 0. Obviously,
ui (r1 , q 2 ) = ui (q 1 , q 2 ) for i = 1, 2 and therefore (18) implies
u(r1 , q 2 ) > 0.

(19)

Since vN () = 0, (19) implies that (r1 , q 2 ) is not a mixed-strategy equilibrium in . However, since r1 coincide with q 1 on T 1 , r1 (s1 ) = 0, and (q 1 , q 2 ) is a mixed-strategy equilibrium
in  , player 2 does not have a profitable deviation from q 2 in  when player 1 uses r1 .
Therefore, player 1 must have a profitable deviation from r1 in  when player 2 uses q 2 .
In particular, player 1 must have a pure-strategy profitable deviation. Since (q 1 , q 2 ) is a
mixed-strategy equilibrium in  , the only potential pure-strategy profitable deviation of
player 1 in  is s1 . Therefore,
u1 (s1 , q 2 ) > u1 (r1 , q 2 ),

(20)

u1 (s1 , q 2 ) > 0.

(21)

which implies in particular that
Next we show that (s1 , q 2 )  N (). Since (q 1 , q 2 ) is a mixed strategy equilibrium in  ,
u1 (q 1 , q 2 )  u1 (t1 , q 2 ) for every t1  S 1 , t1 6= s1 . Since r1 (s1 ) = 0, u1 (r1 , q 2 )  u1 (t1 , q 2 ) for
every t1  S 1 , t1 6= s1 . Therefore, by (20), s1 is a best-response to q 2 in . By (ii) in Claim
1, every pure-strategy of player 2 is a best-response to s1 in  and hence, every mixedstrategy of player 2 is a best response to s1 , and in particular so is q 2 . Therefore, (s1 , q 2 )
is indeed a mixed-strategy equilibrium in . Since vN () = 0, u1 (s1 , r2 ) = 0, contradicting
(21). This complete the proof of Claim 2.2
By Claim 2 and by (ii) in Claim 1, (s1 , t2 ) is in N () for every t2  S 2 . Since vN () = 0,
1
u(s , t2 ) = 0 for every t2  S 2 . Hence, for i = 1, 2, ui (s1 , t2 ) = 0 for every t2  S 2 . As each
ui is identically zero in  , it follows that for i = 1, 2, ui (t1 , t2 ) = 0 for every t1  S 1 and
for every t2  S 2 .2
3.2 The Enforcement Value
The next theorem shows that the enforcement value is unbounded even in classes of small
games.
Theorem 4 EV (Gm1 mn ) =  for every n  2 and for every m1 , m2  2.
Proof: By Lemma 2 it suffices to prove the theorem for the case n = 2, m1 = 2, and m2 = 2.

The proof of Theorem 4 is based on constructing Prisoners Dilemma games with a
parameter x. In particular every player has a weakly dominant strategy in each one of these
games. The next theorem shows that even when ruling out weakly dominant strategies, the
enforcement value is unbounded.

4. Simple Congestion Games
In this section we explore the mediation and enforcement values in simple congestion games.
We first need a few notations and definitions.
A simple congestion form F = (N, M, (wj )jM ) is defined as follows. N is a nonempty
set of players; we keep our assumption that, whenever is convenient, N = {1, 2, . . . , n},
where n = |N | is the number of players. M is a nonempty set of facilities; Unless otherwise
specified we assume M = {1, 2, ..., m}. For j  M , let wj  Rn be the facility payoff
function, where for every 1  k  n, wj (k) denotes the payoff of each user of facility j,
if there are exactly k users. A congestion form is nonnegative if for every j  M , wj is
nonnegative. Let Q be the class of all nonnegative simple congestion forms and denote
by Qnm  Q the class of all nonnegative simple congestion forms with n players and m
facilities. Every simple congestion form F = (N, M, (wj )jM ) defines a simple congestion
game F = (N, (S i )iN , (ui )iN ), where N is the set of players, S i = M for every player
i  N , and the utility functions (ui )iN are defined as follows.
Let S = iN S i . For every A = (A1 , A2 , ..., An )  S and every j  M , let j (A) =
|{i  N : Ai = j}| be the number of users of facility j. Define ui : S  R by
ui (A) = wAi (Ai (A)).

(22)

We say that a facility j is non-increasing if wj (k) is a non-increasing function of k.
Define QN nm  Qnm as follows:
QN nm , {F  Qnm | all facilities in F are non-increasing}
We will call a facility j linear if there exist a constant dj such that wj (k + 1)  wj (k) = dj
for every k  1, that is wj (k) = dj k + j for every k  1, where j is a constant.
Let F be a simple congestion form with n players and m facilities. A congestion vector
 = (n, m) isPan m-tuple  = (j )jM , where 1 , 2 , ..., m  Z  (the set of nonnegative
integers) and m
j=1 j = n.  represents the situation in which j players choose facility
j. Every strategy profile A P S uniquely determines a congestion vector  A . Note that
 



m2
1
j=1 j
there are n1 n
   n m1
strategy profiles in the game F that correspond to
2
a congestion vector , and denote by B the set of all such strategy profiles. Thus B =
{A  S|  A = }. Given a congestion vector , all
P strategy profiles in B have the same
welfare which we denote by u(). That is u() = {jM | j >0} j wj (j ).
We say that a congestion vector  is in equilibrium if every strategy profile in B is a purestrategy equilibrium. A congestion form is called facility symmetric if wj = wk j, k  M .
Obviously, a facility symmetric congestion form induces a symmetric game in strategic form.
Let Inm  Qnm be defined by
Inm = {F  Qnm | F is facility symmetric }.
Define IN nm  Inm as follows
IN nm = {F  Inm | all facilities in F are non-increasing}.

fiOn The Value of Correlation

4.1 The Mediation Value
Although congestion games are especially interesting when the number of players is large,
we begin with presenting results for the case in which we have only two players, extending
upon the results in the previous section. Following that, we consider the more general
n-player case.
4.1.1 The two-player case (n = 2)
Theorem 1 provides a 43 a tight upper bound for the mediation value in the class of games
G22 . Hence, 43 is obviously an upper bound for the mediation value of nonnegative simple
congestion games with two players and two facilities, i.e., games generated by congestion
forms in Q22 . It turns out that this bound is tight:
Theorem 6 M V ({F |F  Q22 }) = 43 .
Proof: Let Fx , x > 1, be the following simple congestion form: M = {a1 , a2 }, wa1 = (x, 0),
and wa2 = (1, x  1) . The games Fx , x > 1 are obtained from the games, x defined in
the proof of Theorem 1 (See Figure 2) by renaming the strategies of player 2. Hence, by
what is proved in Theorem 1, M V (Fx )  34 as x  . 2
Next we consider the more general case in which two players can choose among m
facilities:
Theorem 7 M V ({F |F  Q2m })  2 for every m  2.
Proof: Let F  Q2m . By Rosenthal (1973) there exists a pure-strategy equilibrium in F .
Let A be a fixed pure-strategy equilibrium with the largest welfare, that is
u(A)  u(D) for every pure-strategy equilibrium D.

(23)

Let j and k be the facilities that players 1 and 2 choose in A respectively. We prove by
separation to two cases, j = k and j 6= k.
Case 1: j = k. We prove the theorem in this case by separation to cases wj (1) > wj (2)
and wj (1)  wj (2).
Case 1.1: wj (1) > wj (2). In this case we show that j is a strictly dominant strategy,
which implies by Lemma 1 that M V (F ) = 1. Indeed, let h 6= j be a facility. In order
to prove that j strictly dominates h we have to show that the following three inequalities
hold: wh (1) < wj (2), wh (2) < wj (1), and wh (1) < wj (1). However, since wj (1) > wj (2),
only the first two inequalities should be proved. We first prove that wh (1) < wj (2): Since
A is a pure strategy equilibrium in which both players choose j, wh (1)  wj (2). Suppose
in negation that wh (1) = wj (2). Since A is a pure-strategy equilibrium, wj (2)  wl (1) for
every l 6= j, and therefore, wh (1)  wl (1) for every l 6= j. If, in addition, wj (1)  wh (2),
the strategy profile in which one player chooses h, and the other player chooses j is a purestrategy equilibrium and obtains a larger welfare than A contradicting (23). Therefore,
wh (2) > wj (1). This implies that the strategy profile in which both players choose h is
a pure-strategy equilibrium and obtains a larger welfare than A, again a contradiction to
(23). Therefore wh (1) < wj (2).
595

fiAshlagi, Monderer, & Tennenholtz

We next show that wh (2) < wj (1). If wh (2)  wj (1) the strategy profile in which both
players choose h is a pure-strategy equilibrium and 2wh (2)  2wj (1) > 2wj (2) contradicting
(23). This completes the proof in Case 1.1.
Case 1.2: wj (1)  wj (2). Let B be a pure strategy profile in which the maximum
welfare is obtained. That is, u(B) = opt(F ). In order to prove the theorem it suffices to
prove that
u(B)  2u(A).
(24)
Suppose in B the players choose distinct facilities (one of these facilities can be j).
Since A is a pure-strategy equilibrium, wl (1)  wj (2) for every l 6= j. Therefore, since
also wj (1)  wj (2), u(B)  u(A) and in particular (24) holds. Suppose the two players
choose the same facility in B, and denote this facility by s. If s = j B = A and (24) holds.
Therefore we assume s 6= j. If ws (2)  wj (2), u(B)  u(A), which implies (24). Therefore
we can assume ws (2) > wj (2) and in particular ws (2) > wj (1). Since wj (2)  wl (1) for
every facility l, l 6= j, B is a pure-strategy equilibrium and u(B) > u(A), contradicting
(23). Hence the proof of Case 1.2 is complete.
Case 2: j 6= k. Let B be an arbitrary pure strategy profile in which the maximum
welfare is obtained. That is, u(B) = opt(F ). It suffices to prove that (24) holds.
Recall that A is a pure-strategy equilibrium. If in B each player chooses a different
facility, u(B)  u(A) and in particular (24) holds. Therefore we assume that in B both
players choose the same facility l (l can be j or k). We claim that
wl (2)  max{wj (1), wk (1)}.

(25)

Indeed, if (25) does not hold, B is a pure strategy equilibrium, because a player in B does
not want to deviate to either j or k, and she does not want to deviate to any other facility
because A is a pure strategy equilibrium. Since u(B) > u(A) this contradicts (23). Since
u(B) = 2wl (2) and max{wj (1), wk (1)}  u(A), (25) implies (24). 2
Notice that Theorems 6 and 7 imply that correlation can help in congestion games with
only two players. the next theorem shows that correlation cannot help increasing social
welfare when the facilities are non-increasing:
Theorem 8 M V (QN 2m ) = 1 for every m  2.
Proof: Let F  QN 2m . Let j  M be such that wj (1)  wl (1) for all l  M . If
wj (2) > wl (1) for all l 6= j, j is a strictly dominant strategy, which implies by Lemma 1
that M V (F ) = 1. Suppose there exist some facility k,k 6= j such that wj (2)  wk (1).
Choose such k for which wk (1) is maximal, that is wl (1)  wk (1) for every l, l 6= j.
Therefore, the strategy profile in which one player chooses j and the other player chooses
k is a pure strategy equilibrium which obtains the maximal welfare. The existence of such
a strategy profile implies that M V (F ) = 1. 2.
4.1.2 Simple congestion games with n players
Theorems 2 and 3 in Section 3.1.2 imply that correlation has an unbounded value when
considering arbitrary games. The next theorem shows that correlation has similar effects
in the context of simple congestion games. In particular, we show that the mediation value
is unbounded with the presence of an additional player:
596

fiOn The Value of Correlation

Theorem 9 M V ({F |F  QN 32 }) = .
Proof: Consider the following family of forms F , 0 <   0.5: M = {a1 , a2 }, wa1 =
(z, 4, 4  ), wa2 = (4 + , 0, 0), where z = 12 . Observe that the games, F are the games
given in the proof of Theorem 5 (Figure 6), and that the monotonicity condition is satisfied
for every 0 <   0.5.
We first show that for every sufficiently small , the welfare in every mixed-strategy
equilibrium is lower than 13. After that we will construct, for every sufficiently small , a
correlated equilibria in F such that the welfare in these correlated equilibria approaches
infinity as   0.
Note that the only pure-strategy equilibria are the strategy profiles in which two players
play a1 and one player plays a2 . The welfare in each of these strategy profiles is 12 + ,
which is less than 13.
We proceed to deal with mixed-strategy equilibria in which at least one player does not
play a pure strategy. In such an equilibrium, no player plays the strategy a2 with probability
one because if one of the players does it, the only mixed-strategy equilibria are those in
which each of the other two players plays a1 with probability one, i.e., the equilibrium is
pure.
Suppose some player plays a1 with probability one. Note that the utility matrix of the
other two players is as given in Figure 7.

Therefore it is standard to check that there exists a unique mixed-strategy equilibrium
in which one of the players play a1 with probability 1, and that this equilibrium, when this
player is player 1 is:

Since the game is symmetric, the only mixed-strategy equilibria are the three permutations

Consider a completely mixed-strategy equilibrium. That is, every player assigns positive
probabilities to both facilities. Denote this equilibrium by ((p, 1  p), (q, 1  q), (h, 1 
h)) 0 < p, q, h < 1. Because player 1 is indifferent between a1 and a2 given that players 2
and 3 play (q, 1  q) (h, 1  h) respectively,
(4  )qh + 4(1  q)h + 4(1  h)q + z(1  h)(1  q) = (4 + )qh.
597

(26)

fiAshlagi, Monderer, & Tennenholtz

Note that similar equalities hold for players 2 and 3, when q and h are exchanged with p
respectively. For every fixed h there exists a unique q that solves equation (26). Therefore,
by permuting the names of the players, p = q = h. This enables us to reduce Equation (26)
to
(z  8  2)p2 + (8  2z)p + z = 0,
(27)
which yields


2z  8  64 + 8z
p=

(28)

because the other solution of (28) does not satisfy 0 < p < 1. Therefore, the welfare in this
completely mixed-strategy equilibrium is
3p(1  p)2 z + 3p2 (1  p)(12 + ) + p3 (12  3) =
(3z  24  5)p3  (6z  36 + 3)p2 + 3zp.

(29)

Let A = (36  3)p2  (24 + 5)p3 and B = 3zp3  6zp2 + 3zp. Hence (29) = A + B. We
show that A  12 and B  0 as   0. Observe that p  1 as   0. This implies that

A  12 as   0. Observe that z = z. Thus, from (28) and for small enough  we have
that p  p =

This completes the proof that vN (F )  13 for every sufficiently small enough .
To complete the proof of the theorem we construct, for every sufficiently small , a
correlated equilibria in F such that the welfare in these correlated equilibria approaches
infinity as   0.
In order that a correlated strategy  will be a correlated equilibrium in F , the following
inequalities should be satisfied (in brackets we relate the inequality to the corresponding
inequality in (2)):14
1. 2(1, 1, 1) + 4(1, 2, 1) + 4(1, 1, 2) + z(1, 2, 2)  0.

Note that z(2, 2, 1) = 1   as   0, and that u()  z(2, 2, 1). Therefore
u()   as   0. 2
We conjecture that Theorem 9 holds for more players and/or more facilities. That is,
M V ({F |F  QN nm }) =  for every n  3 and for every m  2. One way to prove this
conjecture is to modify Lemma 2, which is used to prove analogous extensions for general
games (see e.g., Theorems 2 and 3).
The next theorem deals with linear facilities:
Theorem 10
M V ({F |F  QN n2 , all facilities of F are linear})  
for every n  2, where


 = ( 5 + 1)/2.

(30)

The following lemma (Schrijver, 1986, page 61) is used in the proof of Theorem 10.
Lemma 5 (Farkas Lemma) Let s, t be positive integers. Given a matrix A of dimensions
s  t and a vector b  Rs , one and only one of the following systems has a solution:
(i)

Ax  b,

x  Rt ;

(ii)

yT A = 0,

yT b > 0,

y  Rs+ ,

where Rs+ denotes the set of all nonnegative vectors in Rs .
Proof of Theorem 10: Consider the nonnegative, non-increasing and linear congestion
form in which M = {f, g}, and wf and wg are the facility payoff functions of f and g
respectively, where wf (k) = df k + f and wg (k) = dg k + g . Obviously, df , dg  0. Denote
by  the induced congestion game. Assume w.l.o.g. that
wf (1)  wg (1).

(31)

Denote by k = (nk, k) the congestion vector in which nk players choose f and k players
choose g. Let  , 0    n, be the largest integer such that  is in equilibrium. Since 
is in equilibrium, wg ( )  wg (n   + 1), and because of the monotonicity condition,
wg (j)  wg (n  j + 1) j  .
Recall that the welfare in  is denoted by u( ).
Claim 1: M V ()) = 1, whenever   {n, 0}.
599

(32)

fiAshlagi, Monderer, & Tennenholtz

Proof: Suppose  = n. Since (0, n) is in equilibrium, wg (n)  wf (1). Therefore, by (31),
wg (n)  wg (1). By the monotonicity condition, for every k, u(k ) = (n  k)wf (n  k) +
kwg (k)  (n  k)wf (1) + kwg (1). Therefore, u(k )  nwg (n) = u(n ). Hence, the maximal
welfare, opt() is attained at the equilibrium n , which implies that the mediation value
equals 1.
Suppose  = 0. Since (n, 0) is an equilibrium, wf (n)  wg (1). We claim that
wf (n) > wg (1).

(33)

Indeed, assume in negation that wf (n) = wg (1). Since (n  1, 1) is not in equilibrium, either
wf (n  1) < wg (2) or wg (1) < wf (n). Therefore, wf (n  1) < wg (2), and because of the
monotonicity condition, wf (n) < wg (1), which yields a contradiction. Therefore (33) holds,
which implies that choosing f strictly dominates choosing g in . Therefore, by Lemma 1,
every correlated equilibrium in  is a pure strategy profile, which generates the congestion
vector 0 . Hence, the mediation value equals 1.2
By Claim 1, at the rest of this proof we assume w.l.og. that
1    n  1.

(34)

Note that if wg (1) < wf (n), choosing f strictly dominates choosing g, which implies that
the mediation value equals 1. Therefore we assume w.l.o.g. at the rest of the proof that
wg (1)  wf (n).

(35)

The following is a key claim for our proof.
Claim 2: u(j )  u( ) for every j   .
Proof: Let j <  . Since the facilities are linear, wg (j) = wg ( ) + (  j)dg and wf (n  j) =
wf (n   )  (  j)df . Hence,
u( )  u(j ) =
swg ( ) + (n   )wf (n   )  j(wg ( ) + (  j)dg )  (n  j)(wf (n   )  (  j)df ) =
wf (n   )(j   ) + wg ( )(  j)  j(  j)dg + (n  j)(  j)df =
(  j)(wg ( )  wf (n   ) + (n  j)df  jdg ) 
(  j)(wf (n   + 1)  wf (n   ) + (n  j)df  jdg ),

(36)

where the last inequality follows since  is in equilibrium. Since the facilities are linear,
RHS(36) = (  j)((n  j  1)df  jdg ) =
(  j)(wf (1)  wf (n  j)  wg (1) + wg (j + 1)).

(37)

Since j <  it suffices to show that (wf (1)  wf (n  j)  wg (1) + wg (j + 1))  0. This
inequality follows from (31) and (32). 2
Next we define an auxiliary strategy profile. Denote by q the mixed-strategy profile
in which players 1, 2, . . . , n    1 choose f with probability 1, and each of the other
w (1)w (n)
 + 1 players choose g with probability p = g (df +dfg ) , i.e., each of them plays the mixed

fiOn The Value of Correlation

strategy (1 p, p). By (35), p  0. To see that p  1, note that because  is in equilibrium,
wg (1)  wf (n)  wg (1)  wg ( + 1) + wf (n   )  wf (n) = sdg + sdf .
Claim 3: (i) q is a mixed strategy equilibrium; (ii) u(q) = nwf (n) + pdf ((n    1)( +
1) + ( + 1) ).
Proof: (i) We first show that ui (qi , f )  ui (qi , g) for every player i that chooses f with
probability 1. Let k =  + 1. We have, ui (qi , f )  ui (qi , g) =

Since wf (n) = wf (1)  (n  1)df and k > k  1,
RHS(38) = wf (n)  wg (1) + (k  1)pdf + (k  1)pdg  0,

(ii) Similar calculations as in part (i) yield that the expected payoff for each of the
n    1 players that choose f with probability one equals wf (n) + ( + 1)pdf , and that
the expected payoff for each of the other  + 1 players equals wf (n) +  pdf . Therefore
u(q) = nwf (n) + pdf ((n    1)( + 1) + ( + 1) ). 2
We proceed with the main proof. Define
Z = max{u( ), u(q)}.

(39)

If u(k )  Z for every 0  k  n, opt()  Z, and therefore, vc ()  opt() 
max{u( ), u(q)} implying that M V ()  . Therefore we can assume for the rest of the
proof that there exist an integer k, 0  k  n such that

In Theorem 10 we derived, for every n  2, the upper bound  for the mediation value
of the class of games, ({F |F  QN n2 , all facilities of F are linear}). When n = 2, by
Theorem 8, we know that the mediation value equals 1. Unfortunately, we do not know
what is the mediation value for these classes of games when n  3. However, the example
below shows that, when n = 3, the mediation value for this class is at least 89 ; Hence, the
mediation value is between 1.125 and   1.618.
Example 1 Let n = 3, M = {f, g}, wf = (24, 12, 0), and wg = (8, 8, 8). It can be easily
verified that vN () = 32, which is obtained, e.g., at the pure-strategy equilibrium in which
two players choose f and the other player chooses g. Consider the correlated strategy ,
which assigns the probability 61 to every strategy profile in which not all players choose the
same facility. It is easily verified that  is a correlated equilibrium and that the welfare at
 is 36. Hence, the mediation value is at least 36
32 .

For the next discussion it is useful to recall that the price of stability of a cost game is the
ratio between the minimal cost at a mixed-strategy equilibrium and the minimal cost, and
that the price of stability with utilities of a utility game is the ratio between the maximal
welfare and the maximal welfare at a mixed-strategy equilibrium.
Let n, m  2. Another open question for us is estimating the mediation value, of simple
congestion games with n players, m facilities, and with nonnegative, non-increasing, and
linear facilities. One can think that an upper bound for this class can be derived from
the results about the price of stability for the analogous class of congestion games with
costs. Indeed, Christodoulou and Koutsoupias (2005) proved that the price of stability of
the class of congestion games with cost with n players, m facilities, and with nonnegative,
linear, and non-decreasing cost functions is bounded above by 1.6. Had this result proven
for the price of stability with utilities for our class of games it would have implied, in
particular, that the mediation value of this class is bounded above by 1.6, because the
mediation value cannot exceed the price of stability with utilities.15 However, as discussed
in the introduction, results about the price of stability in cost models cannot be transformed
to results about the price of stability with utilities in utility models. To illustrate this, we
show in the next example that the price of stability with utilities of the class {F |F 
QN 22 , all facilities of F are linear} equals .16
Example 2 Let x,  > 0 be fixed. Let N = {1, 2}, M = {f, g} and for every d > ,
let wfd = (x + d + , x + ), let wgd = (x, x), and d be the associated congestion game.
Since f strictly dominates g, the strategy profile in which both players choose f is the only
mixed-equilibrium in the game d . The welfare obtained in this equilibrium is 2x + 2. the
strategy profile attaining the maximal welfare is the one in which each player chooses a
different facility yielding a welfare of 2x +  + d. Since 2x++d
2x+2   when d  , the price
of stability of {F |F  QN 22 , all facilities of F are linear} equals .
Theorems 9, and Example 1 show that correlation can be helpful in the context of (even
non-increasing) congestion games. The next theorem shows that correlation can be helpful
even in the narrow class of facility symmetric forms with nonnegative and non-increasing
facilities:
Theorem 11 M V ({F |F  IN n2 }) > 1 for every n  4.
Proof: Let n  4. It suffices to prove that there exists F  IN n2 such that M V (F ) > 1.
Let 0 <  < 1 be fixed and sufficiently small, and consider the following form, F : w1 =
w2 = (10n, 1, . . . , 1, 1  , 0). Note that the maximal welfare is obtained by any strategy
profile in which exactly n  1 players choose the same facility, i.e., when the congestion
vector is 1 = (1, n  1) or 2 = (n  1, 1). Let L be the set of all strategy profiles with a
congestion vector 1 or 2 . Note that there exist exactly 2n strategy profiles in L. Let  be
1
the correlated strategy in which every strategy profile in L is played with probability 2n
.
Since  is a convex combination of welfare maximizers, the maximal welfare is attained at
15. Moreover, since 1.6  , such a result would have saved us the tedious proof of Theorem 10.
16. The proof of Christodoulou and Koutsoupias (2005) elegantly uses the fact that every congestion game
has an exact potential. It is not known to us wether the potential approach could simplify our proof
of Theorem 10. However, it turns out that their technique can not be applied directly to our setting
because essentially they bound the total cost of the players on every facility separately in a given profile.

fiOn The Value of Correlation

. We claim that  is a correlated equilibrium. Indeed, by (2), it is easily verified that in
F there exists a unique constraint that should be satisfied in order to guarantee that  is a
correlated equilibrium. This constraint is: 10n+((1)1)(n1)
 0, which is indeed satisfied
2n
because we chose  to be sufficiently small. Hence  is a correlated equilibrium.
In order to prove that M V (F ) > 1, it suffices to prove that no mixed-strategy equilibrium obtains the maximal welfare. First, note that only strategy profiles in L obtain
the maximal welfare. Hence, if a pure-strategy equilibrium obtains the maximal welfare, it
must belong to L. However, we claim that every strategy profile in L is not in equilibrium;
Indeed any player that chooses the facility chosen by n  1 players is better off deviating to
the other facility since her utility will increase by .
Therefore, it remains to show that in every mixed-strategy equilibrium, p = (p1 , . . . , pn ),
in which at least one player assigns a positive probability to each facility, there exists at
least one pure strategy profile, s, not in L, which is played with positive probability, that
is p (s) > 0, where p is the correlated strategy associated with p. Indeed, let p be a
mixed-strategy equilibrium, and assume w.l.o.g. that player i assigns a positive probability
to both facilities, that is, pi (1), pi (2) > 0. Assume in negation that p (t) > 0 implies t  L,
and let s be a strategy profile for which p (s) > 0. Since pi (1), pi (2) > 0, p (1, si ) > 0 and
p (2, si ) > 0. Therefore, (1, si )  L and (2, si )  L, which is impossible since n  4. 2
If we further restrict the assumptions in Theorem 11 by requiring some concavity condition correlation cannot help anymore. We first define concavity:
Let n  2. A function v : {1, 2, ..., n}  R+ is concave if for every integer k, 2  k < n,
v(k + 1)  v(k)  v(k)  v(k  1).
Theorem 12 Let n  m  2, and let F  IN nm . Define v(k) = kw(k) for every
1  k  n, where w is the common facility payoff function, that is, w = wj for every
j  M . If v is concave, there exists a pure-strategy equilibrium in F which obtains the
maximal welfare. Consequently, M V (F ) = 1.
Proof: For convenient we also define v(0) = 0. We first define an operator on congestion
vectors. Let  = (1 , 2 , ..., m ) be a congestion vector and let j, l  M be any pair of
distinct facilities. Let   [j, l] be the congestion vector obtained from  by replacing j and
 +
 +
l with j = d j 2 l e and l = b j 2 l c, respectively, where bxc (dxe) denotes
Pm the largest
(least) integer that is not higher (lower) than x. Observe that u() =
i=1 v(i ), and
therefore, by the concavity of v,
u(  [j, l])  u().

(51)

Next we describe a finite sequence of congestion vectors, such that each one of them
obtains the maximal welfare and the last one is also in equilibrium. Before that, set k1 =
n
n
bm
c, k2 = d m
e, and note that every congestion vector in which each coordinate is either k1
or k2 is in equilibrium.
Pick any congestion vector  that obtains the maximal welfare. If  is in equilibrium,
we are done. Otherwise, not all of its coordinates are k1 or k2 . In particular, there exist
two distinct coordinates j and l such that j  k1 , l  k2 , and at least one inequality
is strict. Construct   =   [j, l]. By (51), u(  )  u(), and therefore,   obtains the
maximal welfare. If   is in equilibrium we are done. Otherwise let  =   and repeat the
607

fiAshlagi, Monderer, & Tennenholtz

process. If the sequence of   s does not terminate, it eventually reaches a   in which every
coordinates equals k1 or k2 , i.e., it reaches an equilibrium a contradiction. Therefore, the
sequence terminates after finite number of stages, and hence the last congestion vector in
the sequence is in equilibrium and attains the maximal welfare. 2
4.2 The Enforcement Value
We already know from the construction in the proof of Theorem 4 that the enforcement
value of the class D = {x | x > 1} of Prisoners Dilemma games described in Figre 5
is unbounded. It is easily verified that every game in this class is a potential game, and
therefore, by (Monderer & Shapley, 1996), it is a congestion game. Moreover, it can be easily
verified that each such game can be derived from a simple and nonnegative congestion form
in Q22 . Therefore, EV ({F |F  Q22 ) = . However, as noticed by Monderer (2007),
not every congestion game with nonnegative utilities can be represented by a congestion
form with nonnegative and non-increasing facilities. In particular, it can be shown that
the Prisoners Dilemma games in D cannot be represented by simple congestion forms
with nonnegative and non-increasing facilities. The next theorem shows that even if the
facility payoff functions are restricted to be non-increasing, the enforcement value remains
unbounded for two player games.
Theorem 13 EV ({F |F  QN 2m }) =  for every m  2.
Proof: Consider the games d ,d > 0, given in Example 2. Since using facility f strictly
dominates using g, by Lemma 1, the strategy profile in which both players choose f is the
d)
unique correlated equilibrium in d . As is proved in Example 2, opt(
 , when d  .
vC (d )
This proves the theorem for m = 2. For m > 2 the proof is obtained, as above, by naturally
modifying the games in Example 2. 2
Since Theorem 13 deals with two players, we deduce that the enforcement value is
unbounded also for the class of games generated by linear facilities in QN 2m because for
two players, every non-increasing facility is linear.
Note that the proof of Theorem 13 utilizes games, which posses strictly, and in particular,
weakly dominant strategies. The next theorem deals with games without weakly dominant
strategies.
Theorem 14
(i) EV ({F |F  QN 22 , there are no weakly dominant strategies}) = 1.
(ii) EV ({F |F  QN 32 , there are no weakly dominant strategies}) = .
Proof: Assertion (i) follows from Theorem 8. As for Assertion (ii), the proof follows by
observing that the game in the proof of Theorem 5 is a simple congestion game with nonincreasing facilities. 2
The next theorem shows that the enforcement value tends to  when the number of
players tends to  even when restricting the facilities to be symmetric and non-increasing.

which has the feasible solution, (x, ) = (1, 3). Therefore (52) holds. 2
Although the enforcement value may be unbounded when we have facility symmetric
congestion forms, it is interesting to characterize those congestion games for which correlation enables to get the maximal welfare. This is done in the next theorem, but first we need
the following notations. Let F be a congestion form, and Let  be a congestion vector in
F . Let  : M  M be a one to one function, i.e.,  is a permutation of the set of facilities.
We define the congestion vector   = ( )jM as follows: ( )j =  (j) for every facility j.
Recall that B is theSset of all strategy profiles that induce the congestion vector . We
further define, L =  B  to be the set of all strategy profiles that induce a permutation
of the congestion vector .
Let F  Inm , that is, all facilities in F are symmetric. Therefore, u() = u( )
for every permutation  , and, in addition, for every pair of strategy profiles A, B  L ,
u(A) = u(B).
Theorem 16 Let n, m  2, and let F  Inm . Then, vC (F ) = opt(F ) if and only if
there exist a congestion vector  = (1 , ..., m ) and a correlated equilibrium   C(F ) such
that the following two conditions hold:
1. u() = opt(F ).
2.  is distributed uniformly over all strategy profiles in L ; that is, (d) = (d) for
every d, d  L , and (d) = 0 for every d 6 L .

Proof of Theorem 16:17
Clearly, if there exist a congestion vector  and a correlated equilibrium   C(F ),
which satisfy both conditions, vC (F ) = opt(F ). Before we prove the other direction we
need Claim 1 below.
Let w be the common facility payoff function, that is, w = wj for every j  M . For

u() = opt(F ). Recall that for every strategy profile d  S,  d is the congestion vector
induced
by d and that kd is the number of players that choose facility k in d. Let D =

Theorem 16 shows that for symmetric congestion games, under the conditions of the
theorem, correlation helps in obtaining the maximal welfare. The next example shows that
there exist such games in which mixed-strategy equilibrium is not as useful as correlated
equilibrium:
Example 3 Let F  I62 . Let wj = (1.5, 1, 4, 4.5, 4.5, 3) for every j = 1, 2. It is easy
to verify that the maximal welfare is obtained in a strategy profile A if and only if A 
L1  L2 , where 1 = (3, 3) and 2 = (1, 5). Let  be the correlated strategy, which is
distributed uniformly over L2 . It can be checked that  is a correlated equilibrium. Hence,
by Theorem 16, vC (F ) = opt(F ). On the other hand, note that both 1 and 2 are not
in equilibrium. Hence, in every mixed-strategy profile, a profile which does not obtain the
maximal welfare will be played with positive probability. Therefore the mediation value is
greater than 1, i.e. the best mixed-strategy equilibrium is less useful than the best correlated
equilibrium.

5. Conclusion
In this work we have introduced and studied two measures for the value of correlation in
strategic interactions: the mediation value and the enforcement value. These measures
complement existing measures appearing in the price of anarchy literature, which are comparing the maximal welfare (when agent behavior can be dictated) to the welfare obtained
in Nash equilibrium (when agents are selfish). Indeed, correlation captures many interesting situations, which are common to computing systems and e-commerce applications. In

many systems a reliable party can advise the agents on how to behave but can not enforce
such behavior. The gain that may be obtained by this capability is the major subject of
the study presented in this work. We studied and showed the power of this approach, both
for general games and in the context of congestion games.
