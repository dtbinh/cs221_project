Abstract
It is well known that utterances convey a great deal of information about the speaker
in addition to their semantic content. One such type of information consists of cues to the
speakers personality traits, the most fundamental dimension of variation between humans.
Recent work explores the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic variation in
text and conversation, such as emotion, deception, speaker charisma, dominance, point
of view, subjectivity, opinion and sentiment. Personality affects these other aspects of
linguistic production, and thus personality recognition may be useful for these tasks, in
addition to many other potential applications. However, to date, there is little work on the
automatic recognition of personality traits. This article reports experimental results for
recognition of all Big Five personality traits, in both conversation and text, utilising both
self and observer ratings of personality. While other work reports classification results, we
experiment with classification, regression and ranking models. For each model, we analyse
the effect of different feature sets on accuracy. Results show that for some traits, any type
of statistical model performs significantly better than the baseline, but ranking models
perform best overall. We also present an experiment suggesting that ranking models are
more accurate than multi-class classifiers for modelling personality. In addition, recognition
models trained on observed personality perform better than models trained using selfreports, and the optimal feature set depends on the personality trait. A qualitative analysis
of the learned models confirms previous findings linking language and personality, while
revealing many new linguistic markers.

speakers personality traits, the most fundamental dimension of variation between humans.
Personality is typically assessed along five dimensions known as the Big Five:
 Extraversion vs. Introversion (sociable, assertive, playful vs. aloof, reserved, shy)
 Emotional stability vs. Neuroticism (calm, unemotional vs. insecure, anxious)
 Agreeableness vs. Disagreeable (friendly, cooperative vs. antagonistic, faultfinding)
 Conscientiousness vs. Unconscientious (self-disciplined, organised vs. inefficient, careless)
 Openness to experience (intellectual, insightful vs. shallow, unimaginative)
These five personality traits have been repeatedly obtained by applying factor analyses
to various lists of trait adjectives used in personality description questionnaires (sample
adjectives above) (Norman, 1963; Peabody & Goldberg, 1989; Goldberg, 1990). The basis
for such factor analyses is the Lexical Hypothesis (Allport & Odbert, 1936), i.e. that the
most relevant individual differences are encoded into the language, and the more important
the difference, the more likely it is to be expressed as a single word. Despite some known
limits (Eysenck, 1991; Paunonen & Jackson, 2000), over the last 50 years the Big Five model
has become a standard in psychology and experiments using the Big Five have shown that
personality traits influence many aspects of task-related individual behaviour. For example,
the success of most interpersonal tasks depends on the personalities of the participants, and
personality traits influence leadership ability (Hogan, Curphy, & Hogan, 1994), general job
performance (Furnham, Jackson, & Miller, 1999), attitude toward machines (Sigurdsson,
1991), sales ability (Furnham et al., 1999), teacher effectiveness (Rushton, Murray, & Erdle,
1987), and academic ability and motivation (Furnham & Mitchell, 1991; Komarraju &
Karau, 2005). However, to date there has been little work on the automatic recognition
of personality traits (Argamon, Dhawle, Koppel, & Pennebaker, 2005; Mairesse & Walker,
2006a, 2006b; Oberlander & Nowson, 2006).
Recent work in AI explores methods for the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic variation in text and conversation, such as emotion (Oudeyer, 2002; Liscombe, Venditti, & Hirschberg, 2003), deception (Newman, Pennebaker, Berry, & Richards, 2003;
Enos, Benus, Cautin, Graciarena, Hirschberg, & Shriberg, 2006; Graciarena, Shriberg,
Stolcke, Enos, Hirschberg, & Kajarekar, 2006; Hirschberg, Benus, Brenier, Enos, Friedman, Gilman, Girand, Graciarena, Kathol, Michaelis, Pellom, Shriberg, & Stolcke, 2005),
speaker charisma (Rosenberg & Hirschberg, 2005), mood (Mishne, 2005), dominance in
meetings (Rienks & Heylen, 2006), point of view or subjectivity (Wilson, Wiebe, & Hwa,
2004; Wiebe, Wilson, Bruce, Bell, & Martin, 2004; Wiebe & Riloff, 2005; Stoyanov, Cardie,
& Wiebe, 2005; Somasundaran, Ruppenhofer, & Wiebe, 2007), and sentiment or opinion
(Turney, 2002; Pang & Lee, 2005; Popescu & Etzioni, 2005; Breck, Choi, & Cardie, 2007).
In contrast with these pragmatic phenomena, which may be relatively contextualised or
short-lived, personality is usually considered to be a longer term, more stable, aspect of
individuals (Scherer, 2003). However, there is evidence that personality interacts with, and
affects, these other aspects of linguistic production. For example, there are strong relations
between the extraversion and conscientiousness traits and the positive affects, and between
458

neuroticism and disagreeableness and various negative affects (Watson & Clark, 1992). Lying leads to inconsistencies in impressions of the agreeableness personality trait across modes
(visual vs. acoustic), and these inconsistencies are used as cues for deception detection by
human judges (Heinrich & Borkenau, 1998). Outgoing and energetic people (i.e. extravert)
are more successful at deception, while apprehensive (i.e. neurotic) individuals are not as
successful (Riggio, Salinas, & Tucker, 1988), and individuals who score highly on the agreeableness and openness to experience traits are also better at detecting deception (Enos
et al., 2006). Features used to automatically recognise introversion and extraversion in our
studies are also important for automatically identifying deception (Newman et al., 2003).
Speaker charisma has been shown to correlate strongly with extraversion (Bono & Judge,
2004), and individuals who dominate meetings have similar characteristics to extraverts,
such as verbosity (Rienks & Heylen, 2006). Oberlander and Nowson (2006) suggest that
opinion mining could benefit from personality information. Thus this evidence suggests
that incorporating personality models into these other tasks may improve accuracy.
We also hypothesise that computational recognition of user personality could be useful in many other computational applications. Identification of leaders using personality
dimensions could be useful in analysing meetings and the conversations of suspected terrorists (Hogan et al., 1994; Tucker & Whittaker, 2004; Nunn, 2005). Dating websites could
analyse text messages to try to match personalities and increase the chances of a successful
relationship (Donnellan, Conger, & Bryant, 2004). Tutoring systems might be more effective
if they could adapt to the learners personality (Komarraju & Karau, 2005). Automatically
identifying the authors personality in a corpus could also improve language generation,
as individual differences in language affect the way that concepts are expressed (Reiter &
Sripada, 2004). Studies have also shown that users evaluation of conversational agents
depends on their own personality (Reeves & Nass, 1996; Cassell & Bickmore, 2003), which
suggests a requirement for such systems to adapt to the users personality, like humans do
(Funder & Sneed, 1993; McLarney-Vesotski, Bernieri, & Rempala, 2006).
While in some applications it would be possible to acquire personality information by
asking the user or author directly (John, Donahue, & Kentle, 1991; Costa & McCrae,
1992), here we explore whether it is possible to acquire personality models for the Big Five
personality traits by observation of individual linguistic outputs in text and conversation.
To date, we know of only two studies besides our own on automatic recognition of user
personality (Argamon et al., 2005; Mairesse & Walker, 2006a, 2006b; Oberlander & Nowson,
2006). Other work has applied classification models to the recognition of personality in
texts and blog postings. To our knowledge, the results presented here are the first to
examine the recognition of personality in dialogue (Mairesse & Walker, 2006a, 2006b), and
to apply regression and ranking models that allow us to model personality recognition
using the continuous scales traditional in psychology. We also systematically examine the
use of different feature sets, suggested by psycholinguistic research, and report statistically
significant results.
We start in Section 2 by reviewing the psychology findings linking personality and
language; these findings motivate the features used in the learning experiments described
in Section 3. Section 3 overviews the methods we use to automatically train personality
models, using both conversation and written language samples, and both self-ratings and
observer ratings of personality traits. We explore the use of classification models (Section 4),
459

fiMairesse, Walker, Mehl & Moore

regression models (Section 5), and ranking models (Section 6), and the effect of different
feature sets on model accuracy. The results show that for some traits, any type of statistical
model performs significantly better than the baseline, but ranking models perform best
overall. In addition, models trained on observed personality scores perform better than
models trained using self-reports, and the optimal feature set is dependent on the personality
trait. The rules derived and features used in the learned models confirm previous findings
linking language and personality, while revealing many new linguistic markers. We delay
the review of Argamon et al. (2005) and Oberlander and Nowson (2006) to Section 7, when
we can better compare their results with our own, and sum up and discuss future work in
Section 8.

2. Personality Markers in Language
Why do we believe it might be possible to automatically recognise personality from linguistic
cues? Psychologists have documented the existence of such cues by discovering correlations
between a range of linguistic variables and personality traits, across a wide range of linguistic
levels, including acoustic parameters (Smith, Brown, Strong, & Rencher, 1975; Scherer,
1979), lexical categories (Pennebaker & King, 1999; Pennebaker, Mehl, & Niederhoffer,
2003; Mehl, Gosling, & Pennebaker, 2006; Fast & Funder, 2007), n-grams (Oberlander &
Gill, 2006), and speech-act type (Vogel & Vogel, 1986). As the correlations reported in
the literature are generally weak (see Section 3.3), it is not clear whether these features
will improve accuracies of statistical models on unseen subjects. Of all Big Five traits,
extraversion has received the most attention from researchers. However, studies focusing
systematically on all Big Five traits are becoming more common.
2.1 Markers of Extraversion
We summarise various findings linking extraversion and language cues in Table 1, for
different levels of language production such as speech, syntax and content selection. A review by Furnham (1990) describes linguistic features linked to extraversion and other traits,
and Dewaele and Furnham (1999) review studies focusing on the link between extraversion
and both language learning and speech production.
Findings include that there is a higher correlation between extraversion and oral language, especially when the study involves a complex task. Extraverts talk more, louder
and more repetitively, with fewer pauses and hesitations, they have higher speech rates,
shorter silences, a higher verbal output, a lower type/token ratio and a less formal language, while introverts use a broader vocabulary (Scherer, 1979; Furnham, 1990; Gill &
Oberlander, 2002). Extraverts also use more positive emotion words, and show more agreements and compliments than introverts (Pennebaker & King, 1999). Extravert students
learning French as a second language produce more back-channels, and have a more implicit style and a lower lexical richness in formal situations. It seems that the more complex
the task and the higher the level of anxiety, the easier it is to differentiate between introverts
and extraverts (Dewaele & Furnham, 1999).
Heylighen and Dewaele (2002) also note that extraversion is significantly correlated
with contextuality, as opposed to formality. Contextuality can be seen a high reliance
on shared knowledge between conversational partners, leading to the use of many deictic

expressions such as pronouns, verbs, adverbs and interjections, whereas formal language is
less ambiguous and assumes less common knowledge. In order to measure this variation,
Heylighen and Dewaele suggest the use of a metric called formality, defined as:
F = (noun freq + adjective freq + preposition freq + article freq - pronoun freq - verb
freq - adverb freq - interjection freq + 100)/2
They argue that this measure is the most important dimension of variation between
linguistic expressions, as shown in Bibers factor analysis of various genres (Biber, 1988).
In addition to introversion, the authors also find that formality correlates positively with
the level of education and the femininity of the speaker. Situational variables related to
the use of formal language are the audience size, the time span between dialogues, the
unavailability of feedback, difference of backgrounds and spatial location between speakers,
as well as the preceding amount of conversation.

fiMairesse, Walker, Mehl & Moore

Scherer (1979) shows that extraverts are perceived as talking louder and with a more
nasal voice, and that American extraverts tend to make fewer pauses, while German extraverts produce more pauses than introverts. Thus personality markers are culture-dependent,
even among western societies.
Oberlander and Gill (2006) use content analysis tools and n-gram language models to
identify markers in extravert and introvert emails. They replicate previous findings and
identify new personality markers such as first person singular pronouns (e.g., I dont) and
formal greetings (e.g., Hello) for introversion, while less formal phrases such as Take care
and Hi characterise extraverts.

2.2 Markers of Other Big Five Traits
Pennebaker and King (1999) identify many linguistic features associated with each of the
Big Five personality traits. They use their Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)
tool to count word categories of essays written by students whose personality has been
assessed using a questionnaire. The authors find small but significant correlations between
their linguistic dimensions and personality traits. Neurotics use more 1st person singular
pronouns, more negative emotion words and less positive emotion words. On the other hand,
agreeable people express more positive and fewer negative emotions. They also use fewer
articles. Conscientious people avoid negations, negative emotion words and words reflecting
discrepancies (e.g., should and would). Finally, openness to experience is characterised by a
preference for longer words and words expressing tentativity (e.g., perhaps and maybe), as
well as the avoidance of 1st person singular pronouns and present tense forms.
Additionally, Mehl et al. (2006) study markers of personality as perceived by observers.
They find that the use of words related to insight and the avoidance of past tense indicates
openness to experience, and swearing marks disagreeableness. The same authors also show
that some linguistic cues vary greatly across gender. For example, males perceived as
conscientious produce more filler words, while females dont. Gender differences are also
found in markers of self-assessed personality: the use of 2nd person pronouns indicates a
conscientious male, but an unconscientious female.
Gill and Oberlander (2003) study correlates of emotional stability: they find that neurotics use more concrete and frequent words. However, they also show that observers dont
use those cues correctly, as observer reports of neuroticism correlate negatively with selfreports.
Concerning prosody, Smith et al. (1975) also show that speech rate is positively correlated with perceived competence (conscientiousness), and that speech rate has an inverted-U
relationship with benevolence (agreeableness), suggesting a need for non-linear models.
Some traits have produced more findings than others. A reason for this might be that
some are more reflected through language, like extraversion. However, it is possible that
this focus is a consequence of extraversion being correlated with linguistic cues that can be
analysed more easily (e.g., verbosity).

3. Experimental Method
We conduct a set of experiments to examine whether automatically trained models can be
used to recognise the personality of unseen subjects. Our approach can be summarised in
five steps:
1. Collect individual corpora;
2. Collect associated personality ratings for each participant;
3. Extract relevant features from the texts;
4. Build statistical models of the personality ratings based on the features;
5. Test the learned models on the linguistic outputs of unseen individuals.
The following sections describe each of these steps in more detail.
3.1 Sources of Language and Personality
Introvert
Ive been waking up on time so far. What
has it been, 5 days? Dear me, Ill never
keep it up, being such not a morning
person and all. But maybe Ill adjust,
or not. I want internet access in my
room, I dont have it yet, but I will
on Wed??? I think. But that aint soon
enough, cause I got calculus homework [...]

Extravert
I have some really random thoughts. I
want the best things out of life.
But I fear that I want too much!
What if I fall flat on my face and
dont amount to anything. But I
feel like I was born to do BIG things
on this earth. But who knows... There
is this Persian party today.

Neurotic
One of my friends just barged in, and I
jumped in my seat. This is crazy. I
should tell him not to do that again.
Im not that fastidious actually. But
certain things annoy me. The things
that would annoy me would actually
annoy any normal human being, so I
know Im not a freak.

Emotionally stable
I should excel in this sport because I
know how to push my body harder than
anyone I know, no matter what the test I
always push my body harder than everyone
else. I want to be the best no matter
what the sport or event. I should also
be good at this because I love to ride
my bike.

extravert, neurotic, and emotionally stable.

We use the data from Pennebaker and King (1999) and Mehl et al. (2006) in our experiments. The first corpus contains 2,479 essays from psychology students (1.9 million
words), who were told to write whatever comes into their mind for 20 minutes. The data
was collected and analysed by Pennebaker and King (1999); a sample is shown in Table 2.

Table 3: Extracts from the EAR corpus, for participants rated as extremely introvert, extravert, unconscientious, and conscientious. Only the participants utterances are
shown.

Personality was assessed by asking each student to fill in the Big Five Inventory questionnaire (John et al., 1991), which asks participants to evaluate on a 5 point scale how well
their personality matches a series of descriptions.
The second source of data consists of conversation extracts recorded using an Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR) (Mehl, Pennebaker, Crow, Dabbs, & Price, 2001), collected
by Mehl et al. (2006). To preserve the participants privacy, only random snippets of conversation were recorded. This corpus is much smaller than the essays corpus (96 participants
for a total of 97,468 words and 15,269 utterances). While the essays corpus consists only of
texts, the EAR corpus contains both sound extracts and transcripts. This corpus therefore
allows us to build models of personality recognition from speech. Only the participants utterances were transcribed (not those of their conversational partners), making it impossible
to reconstruct whole conversations. Nevertheless, the conversation extracts are less formal
than the essays, and personality may be best observed in the absence of behavioural constraints. Table 4 shows that while the essays corpus is much larger than the EAR corpus,
the amount of data per subject is comparable, i.e. 766 words per subject for the essays and
1,015 for the EAR corpus. Table 3 shows examples of conversations from the EAR corpus
for different personality traits.
For personality ratings, the EAR corpus contains both self-reports and ratings from 18
independent observers. Psychologists use self-reports to facilitate evaluating the personality of a large number of participants, and there are a large number of standard self-report
tests. Observers were asked to make their judgments by rating descriptions of the Big Five
Inventory (John & Srivastava, 1999) on a 7 point scale (from strongly disagree to strongly

agree), without knowing the participants. Observers were divided into three groups, each
rating one third of the participants, after listening to each participants entire set of sound
files (130 files on average). The personality assessment was based on the audio recordings,
which contain more information than the transcripts (e.g., ambient sounds, including captured conversations). Mehl et al. (2006) report strong inter-observer reliabilities across all
Big Five dimensions (intraclass correlations based on one-way random effect models: mean
r = 0.84, p < .01). The observers ratings were averaged for each participant, to produce
the final scores used in our experiments.
Interestingly, the average correlations between frequency counts from psycholinguistic
word categories and the Big Five personality dimensions were considerably larger in the
EAR corpus than with the student essays studied by Pennebaker and King. Moreover,
the correlations reported by Mehl et al. seem to be higher for observer reports than for
self-reports. Based on this observation, we hypothesise that models of observed personality
will outperform models of self-assessed personality.
3.2 Features
The features used in the experiments are motivated by previous psychological findings
about correlations between measurable linguistic factors and personality traits. Features
are divided into subsets depending on their source and described in the subsections below.
The total feature set is summarised in Table 6. The experimental results given in Sections 4,
5, and 6 examine the effect of each feature subset on model accuracy.
3.2.1 Content and Syntax
We extracted a set of linguistic features from each essay and conversation transcript,
starting with frequency counts of 88 word categories from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word
Count (LIWC) utility (Pennebaker et al., 2001). These features include both syntactic (e.g.,
ratio of pronouns) and semantic information (e.g., positive emotion words), which were
validated by expert judges. Some LIWC features are illustrated in Table 5. Pennebaker
and King (1999) previously found significant correlations between these features and each
of the Big Five personality traits. Relevant word categories for extraversion include social
words, emotion words, first person pronouns, and present tense verbs. Mehl et al. (2006)
showed that LIWC features extracted from the EAR corpus were significantly correlated
with both self and observer reports of personality.
We also added 14 additional features from the MRC Psycholinguistic database (Coltheart, 1981), which contains statistics for over 150,000 words, such as estimates of the age

of acquisition, frequency of use, and familiarity. As introverts take longer to reflect on their
utterances, Heylighen and Dewaele (2002) suggest that their vocabulary is richer and more
precise, implying a lower frequency of use. The MRC feature set was previously used by
Gill and Oberlander (2002), who showed that extraversion is negatively correlated with
concreteness. Concreteness also indicates neuroticism, as well as the use of more frequent
words (Gill & Oberlander, 2003). Table 5 shows examples of MRC scales. Each MRC
feature is computed by averaging the feature value of all the words in the essay or conversational extract. Part-of-Speech tags are computed to identify the correct entry in the
database among a set of homonyms.
3.2.2 Utterance Type
Various facets of personality traits seem to depend on the level of initiative of the speaker
and the type of utterance used (e.g., assertiveness, argumentativeness, inquisitiveness, etc.).
For example, extraverts are more assertive in their emails (Gill & Oberlander, 2002), while
extravert second language learners were shown to produce more back-channel behaviour
(Vogel & Vogel, 1986). We therefore introduced features characterising the types of utterance produced. We automatically tagged each utterance of the EAR corpus with speech
act categories from Walker and Whittaker (1990), using heuristic rules based on each utterances parse tree:
 Command: utterance using the imperative form, a command verb (e.g., must and have to) or
a yes/no second person question with a modal auxiliary like can;
 Prompt: single word utterance used for back-channelling (e.g., Yeah, OK, Huh, etc.);
 Question: interrogative utterance which isnt a command;
 Assertion: any other utterance.

PROSODIC FEATURES:
Average, minimum, maximum and standard deviation of the voices pitch in Hz (Pitch-mean, Pitch-min,
Pitch-max, Pitch-stddev) and intensity in dB (Int-mean, Int-min, Int-max, Int-stddev), voiced time (Voiced)
and speech rate (Word-per-sec)

Table 6: Description of all features, with feature labels in brackets.
We evaluated the automatic tagger by applying it to a set of 100 hand-labelled utterances
randomly selected in the EAR corpus. We obtain 88% of correct labels, which are mostly
assertions. Table 7 summarises the partition and the evaluation results for each speech act
type. For each speech act, the corresponding feature value is the ratio of the number of
occurrences of that speech act to the total number of utterances in each text.

3.2.3 Prosody
Personality was also shown to influence speech production. Extraversion is associated with
more variation of the fundamental frequency (Scherer, 1979), with a higher voice quality
and intensity (Mallory & Miller, 1958), and with fewer and shorter silent pauses (Siegman
& Pope, 1965). Smith et al. (1975) showed that speech rate is positively correlated with
perceived competence (conscientiousness). Interestingly, the same authors found that speech
rate has an inverted-U relationship with benevolence (agreeableness), suggesting a need for
non-linear models. See Section 3.4.
We added prosodic features based on the audio data of the EAR conversation extracts.
As the EAR recorded the participants at anytime of the day, it was necessary to automatically remove any non-voiced signal. We used Praat (Boersma, 2001) to compute features
characterising the voices pitch and intensity (mean, extremas and standard deviation), and
we added an estimate of the speech rate by dividing the number of words by the voiced time.
As an important aspect of this work is that all features are extracted without any manual
annotation beyond transcription, we didnt filter out utterances from other speakers that
may have been captured by the EAR even though it utilised a microphone pointing towards
the participants head. Although advances in speaker recognition techniques might improve
the accuracy of prosodic features, we make the assumption that the noise introduced by the
surrounding speakers has little effect on our prosodic features, and that it therefore does not
affect the performance of the statistical models. This assumption still remains to be tested,
as the personality similarity-attraction effect (Byrne & Nelson, 1965) might influence the
personality distribution of a participants conversational partners.
We included all the features mentioned in this section (117) in the models based on
the EAR corpus. Models computed using the essays corpus contain only LIWC and MRC
features (102), as speech acts are only meaningful in dialogues.
3.3 Correlational Analysis
In order to assess what individual features are important for modelling personality regardless
of the model used, we report previous correlational studies for the LIWC features on the
same data as well as analyses of the new MRC, utterance type and prosodic features. The
LIWC features were already analysed by Mehl et al. (2006) for the EAR dataset, and by
468

fiRecognising Personality in Conversation and Text

Pennebaker and King (1999) for the essays.1 Tables 8 to 11 show the features correlating
significantly with personality ratings (p < .05, correlations above .05 only), combining
together results from previous studies and new findings that provide insight into the features
likely to influence the personality recognition models in Sections 4.3, 5.3 and 6.3.
The correlation magnitudes in Tables 8 and 9 between LIWC and MRC features and
the essays data set show that although extraversion is very well perceived in conversations,
it isnt strongly reflected through written language, as the correlation magnitudes for the
essays dataset are noticeably low. Table 10 shows that word count (WC) is a very important feature for modelling extraversion in conversation, both for observer reports and
self-reports. Interestingly, this marker doesnt hold for written language (see Table 9).
Other markers common to observed and self-reported extraversion include the variation
of intensity (Int-stddev), the mean intensity (Int-mean), word repetitions (Unique), words
with a high concreteness (Conc) and imageability (Imag). See Table 11. On the other
hand, words related to anger, affect, swearing, and positive and negative emotions (Posemo
and Negemo) are perceived as extravert, but they dont mark self-assessed extraversion in
conversations.
Tables 10 and 11 show that for emotional stability, only a few markers hold for both
self-reports and observer reports: a high word count and a low mean pitch (Pitch-mean).
Surprisingly, observed emotional stability is associated with swearing and anger words, but
not the self-assessed ratings. As reported by Mehl et al. (2006), neurotics are expected to
produce more self-references (Self and I). Pennebaker and King (1999) show that neurotics
use of self-references is also observed in the essays, as well as the use of words related to
negative emotions and anxiety. Table 11 shows that in conversations, self-assessed neurotics
tend to have a low and constant voice intensity (Int-mean and Int-stddev), while these
markers arent used by observers at all.
While emotional stability is expressed differently in various datasets, some markers of
agreeableness are consistent: words related to swearing (Swear) and anger (Anger) indicate both self-assessed and observed disagreeableness, regardless of the source of language.
See Tables 8, 9 and 10. Interestingly, Table 11 shows that agreeable people do more
back-channelling (Prompt), suggesting that they tend to listen more to their conversational
partners. While observers dont seem to take prosody into account for evaluating agreeableness, Table 11 shows that prosodic cues such as the pitch variation (Pitch-stddev) and
the maximum voice intensity (Max-int) indicate self-assessed disagreeableness.
As far as markers of conscientiousness are concerned, Tables 8 to 10 show that they
are similar to those of agreeableness, as unconscientious participants also use words related
to swearing (Swear), anger (Anger) and negative emotions (Negemo), regardless of the
dataset and assessment method. On the other hand, observed conscientiousness is associated
with words expressing insight, back-channels (Prompt), longer words (Nphon, Nlet, Nsyl
and Sixltr) as well as words that are acquired late by children (AOA), while self-assessed
conscientiousness is mostly expressed through positive feelings (Posfeel) in conversations.
The avoidance of negative language seems to be the main marker of conscientiousness in
essays, as all other features in Table 8 correlate only weakly with the self-reports.
1. Our correlations differ from Pennebaker and Kings study because we use additional student essays
collected during the following years.

Table 9: Continuation of Table 8, i.e. Pearsons correlation coefficients between LIWC and
MRC features and personality ratings for the essays dataset (* = significant at
the p < .05 level, ** = p < .01). Only features that correlate significantly with at
least one trait are shown.
Tables 8 and 9 show that openness to experience is the trait yielding the highest correlations in the essays corpus: articles, second person pronouns (You) and long words (Sixltr)
indicate openness, while non-open participants tend to talk about their occupations (Occup,
Home and School) and themselves (Self). As far as conversations are concerned, observers
use similar cues for openness as with conscientiousness, such as insight words, longer words,
back-channels and a high age of acquisition (AOA).
This section shows that features are likely to vary depending on the source of language
and the method of assessment of personality. While such analyses can help evaluate the
usefulness of individual features, the question of how such features should be combined to
predict personality accurately is addressed by the statistical models.

3.4 Statistical Models
Various systems require different levels of granularity for modelling personality: it might
be more important to cluster users into large groups as correctly as possible, or the system
might need to discriminate between individual users. Depending on the application and the
adaptation capabilities of the target system, it is possible to use different types of personality
models, depending on whether personality modelling is treated as a classification problem, as

Table 11: Continuation of Table 10, i.e. Pearsons correlation coefficients between features
and personality ratings for the EAR dataset (* = significant at the p < .05 level,
** = p < .01). Only features that correlate significantly with at least one trait
are shown.
in previous work by Argamon et al. (2005) and Oberlander and Nowson (2006), or whether
we model personality traits via the scalar values actually generated by the self-reports and
observer methods used in the corpus collection described in Section 3.1.
To support applications in dialogue system adaptation, where the output generation is
limited to a few points at extremes of a personality scale, such as introvert vs. extravert
language or neurotic vs. emotionally stable, we develop classification models by splitting
our subjects into two equal size groups.
However, if we model personality traits as scalar values, we have two choices. We
can treat personality modelling as a regression problem or as a ranking problem. While
regression models can replicate the actual scalar values seen in the personality ratings
data, there is also a good argument for treating personality as a ranking problem because
by definition, personality evaluation assesses relative differences between individuals, e.g.
one person is described as an extravert because the average population is not. Moreover,
Freund, Iyer, Schapire, and Singer (1998) argue that ranking models are a better fit to
learning problems in which scales have arbitrary values (rather than reflecting real world
measures).

fiMairesse, Walker, Mehl & Moore

For classification and regression models, we use the Weka toolbox (Witten & Frank,
2005) for training and evaluation. In order to evaluate models of personality classification,
we compare six different learning algorithms against a baseline returning the majority class.
The classification algorithms analysed here are C4.5 decision tree learning (J48), Nearest
neighbour (k = 1), Naive Bayes (NB), Ripper (JRip), Adaboost (10 rounds of boosting)
and Support vector machines with linear kernels (SMO).
For regression, we compare five algorithms with a baseline model returning the mean
personality score. We focus on a linear regression model, an M5 regression tree, an M5
model tree returning a linear model, a REPTree decision tree, and a model based on Support
vector machines with linear kernels (SMOreg). Parameters of the algorithms are set to
Wekas default values.
Concerning the ranking problem, we train personality models for each Big Five trait
using RankBoost, a boosting algorithm for ranking (Freund et al., 1998; Schapire, 1999).
Given a personality trait to model, the linguistic features and personality scores are converted into a training set T of ordered pairs of examples x, y:
T = {(x, y)| x, y are language samples from two individuals,
x has a higher score than y for that personality trait}
Each example x is represented by a set of m indicator functions hs (x) for 1  s  m.
The indicator functions are calculated by thresholding the feature values (counts) described
in Section 3.2. For example, one indicator function is:
(

h100 (x) =

1 if Word-per-sec(x)  0.73
0 otherwise

So h100 (x) = 1 if xs average speech rate is above 0.73 words per second. A single parameter s is associated with each indicator function, and the ranking score for an example
x is calculated as
X
F (x) =
s hs (x)
s

This score is used to rank various language samples (written text or conversation extracts),
with the goal of duplicating the ranking found in the training data, and the training examples are used to set the parameter values s . Training is the process of setting the
parameters s to minimise the following loss function:
Loss =

1 X
eval(F (x)  F (y))
|T | (x,y)T

The eval function returns 1 if the ranking scores of the (x, y) pair are misordered, and 0
otherwise. In other words, the ranking loss is the percentage of misordered pairs, for which
the order of the predicted scores doesnt match the order dictated by the personality scores
from the questionnaire.
Most of the techniques used in this work express the learned models as rules or decision
trees, which support the analysis of differences in the personality models (see Sections 4.3,
5.3 and 6.3).

4. Classification Results
We evaluate binary classification models based on the essays corpus with self-reports of
personality, as well as models based on the EAR corpus with both self and observer reports.
All results are averaged over a 10-fold cross-validation, and all significance tests were done
using a two-tailed paired t-test at the p < .05 level.
4.1 Essays Corpus
Classification results for the essays corpus with self-reports are in Table 12. Interestingly,
openness to experience is the easiest trait to model as five classifiers out of six significantly
outperform the baseline and four of them produce their best performance for that trait,
with accuracies up to 62.1% using support vector machines (SMO). Emotional stability
produces the second best performance for four classifiers out of six, with 57.4% accuracy
for the SMO model. Conscientiousness is the hardest trait to model as only two classifiers
significantly outperform the baseline, however the SMO model performs as well as the best
model for extraversion and agreeableness, with around 55% correct classifications.
We find that support vector machines generally perform the best, with Naive Bayes and
AdaboostM1 in second position. SMO significantly outperforms the majority class baseline
for each trait. A J48 decision tree for recognising extraversion is shown in Figure 1, and the
rule-based JRip model classifying openness to experience with 58.8% accuracy is illustrated
in Table 16.

Feature set comparison: In order to evaluate how each feature set contributes to the
final result, we trained binary classifiers using the algorithms producing the best overall
results with each feature set. We only analyse LIWC and MRC features for the essays
corpus, as utterance type and prosodic features dont apply to written texts. We use the
Naive Bayes, AdaboostM1 and SMO classifiers as they give the best performances with the
full feature set. Results are shown in Table 13.

Remarkably, we can see that the LIWC features outperform the MRC features for every
trait, and the LIWC features on their own always perform slightly better than the full
feature set. This clearly suggests that MRC features arent as helpful as the LIWC features
for classifying personality from written text, however Table 13 shows that they can still
outperform the baseline for four traits out of five.
Concerning the algorithms, we find that AdaboostM1 performs the best for extraversion
(56.3% correct classifications), while SMO produces the best models for all other traits. It
suggests that support vector machines are promising for modelling personality in general.
The easiest trait to model is still openness to experience, with 62.5% accuracy using LIWC
features only.

outperforming the baseline with an accuracy of 73.0%. The J48 decision tree for extraversion with a 66.8% accuracy is shown in Figure 2. Emotional stability is modelled with
comparable success using a Naive Bayes classifier, however the improvement over the baseline is lower than with extraversion (22.8% vs. 25.2%) and other classifiers dont perform as
well. Models of observed conscientiousness also outperform the baseline, with 67.7% accuracy using a Naive Bayes classifier, while the best model for agreeableness produces 61.3%
correct classifications. None of the models for openness to experience significantly outperform the baseline, which suggests that openness to experience is expressed more clearly in
stream of consciousness essays and self-reports than in the EAR dataset. Support vector
machines dont perform as well as with the essays corpus, probably because of the sparseness of the dataset. Self-reports are much harder to model than observer reports given the
same dataset size, as none of the self-report classifiers significantly outperform the majority
class baseline.
Feature set comparison: For the EAR corpus we investigated the importance of all 4
feature sets: utterance type, LIWC, MRC, and prosodic features. We use the Naive Bayes
models with the observer ratings as they perform the best with all features. Interestingly,
Table 15 shows that the good classification accuracies for extraversion come from a combination of LIWC, MRC and prosodic features, as they all outperform the baseline on their own,
but dont do as well as the 73.0% accuracy with the full feature set. Moreover, extraversion
is the only trait for which prosody seems to make a difference. LIWC features are the main
indicators of emotional stability, although the model with all features still performs better. MRC features are the most important for classifying conscientiousness (66.8%), while
prosodic features produce the best model of openness to experience with 64.6% accuracy,
improving on the model with all features. Although utterance type features never outperform the baseline on their own, the lack of significance could be the result of the small
1. Although equal size bins were used, the baseline accuracies differ from 50% because of the random
sampling of the cross-validation.

with several personality traits.
4.3 Qualitative Analysis
Decision trees and rule-based models can be easily understood, and can therefore help to
uncover new linguistic markers of personality. Our models replicate previous findings, such
as the link between verbosity and extraversion (c.f. Word count node of Figure 2), but they
also provide many new markers.

Table 16: JRip rule set for binary classification of openness to experience, based on the
essays corpus.

The model of self-assessed openness to experience detailed in Table 16 shows that students referring a lot to school work tend to have low scores for that trait (Rules 1, 2
and 5). As expected, the avoidance of longer words is also indicative of a lack of cre479

fiMairesse, Walker, Mehl & Moore

ativity/conventionality (Rules 4 and 5), as well as the use of high-familiarity words and
references to friends (Rule 3).
The model of observed extraversion in Figure 2 shows that word count is the most important feature for classifying that trait as an observer. The model also suggests that given
low verbosity, extraversion can still manifest itself through the use of words related to metaphysical issues together with few articles, as well as through the use of many commas. The
association between extraversion and the avoidance of articles probably reflects the use of
more pronouns over common nouns and confirms previous findings associating extraversion
with implicit language (Heylighen & Dewaele, 2002).
Interestingly, the decision tree trained on the essays corpus in Figure 1 for self-reported
extraversion differs a lot from the observer model in Figure 2. While word count is the most
important feature for observers, it doesnt seem to be a marker of self-assessed extraversion
(see Section 3.3), although the number of words per sentence is used to discriminate on a
subset of the data. On the other hand, the self-report model associates introversion with
the use of articles, which was also the case in the observer model. While sexual content
doesnt affect the observer model, it is the second most important feature for modelling selfreported extraversion. For example, participants using many sex-related words are modelled
as introvert, unless they avoid parentheses and words related to sadness.

5. Regression Results
We also trained regression models using the same corpora. The baseline is a model returning
the mean of all personality scores in the training set. We use the relative absolute error for
evaluation, which is the ratio between the models prediction error and the error produced
by the baseline. A low relative error therefore indicates that the model performs better than
the constant mean baseline, while a 100% relative error implies a performance equivalent
to that baseline. All results are averaged over a 10-fold cross-validation, and all significance
tests were done using a two-tailed paired t-test at the p < .05 level.
5.1 Essays Corpus
Regression results with the essays corpus and self-reports are in Table 17. Paired t-tests
show that emotional stability and openness to experience produce models that significantly
improve over the baseline. As with the classification task, openness to experience is the
easiest trait to model using essays: four regression models out of five outperform the baseline. The M5 model tree produces the best result with a 93.3% relative error for openness
to experience (6.7% error decrease), and a 96.4% relative error for emotional stability.
In terms of correlation between the model predictions and the actual ratings, the model
for emotional stability and openness to experience produce Pearsons correlation coefficients
of 0.24 and 0.33, respectively. Although the magnitude of the improvement seems relatively
small, one needs to keep in mind the difficulty of the regression task over the binary classification task: it is the most fine-grained personality recognition problem, requiring the
association of an exact scalar value with each individual.
Feature set comparison: Table 18 provides results for a comparison of LIWC with the
MRC feature sets using the linear regression model, the M5 model tree and the support

5.2 EAR Corpus
Regression results for the EAR corpus are in Table 19. A paired t-test (two-tailed, p < .05)
over the cross-validation folds shows that the error reduction is significant for observed
extraversion (79.9% relative error, i.e. 20.1% error decrease), conscientiousness (14.3% improvement) and emotional stability (13.3% improvement). While extraversion is the easiest
trait to model from observer ratings, models of agreeableness and openness to experience
dont outperform the baseline.

fiMairesse, Walker, Mehl & Moore

In terms of correlation between the model predictions and the actual ratings, the models
for extraversion, emotional stability and conscientiousness respectively produce Pearsons
correlation coefficients of 0.54, 0.47 and 0.44, significantly outperforming the baseline. Such
correlations are relatively high, given that the average correlations between the ratings of
each pair of observers is 0.54 for extraversion, 0.29 for emotional stability and 0.51 for
conscientiousness (18 observers, between 31 and 33 data points for each pair).
Linear regression and support vector machines perform poorly, suggesting that they
require a bigger dataset as in the essays corpus. As in the classification task, self-reports
of the EAR corpus are clearly difficult to model: none of the models show significant
improvement over the baseline.

Feature set comparison: We trained regression models with each individual feature set
using only observer reports, since self-reports didnt produce any significant result using all
features. We only focus on the three regression tree algorithms as they perform the best
with all features. Table 20 shows that LIWC are good predictors of observed extraversion,
as the REPTree outperforms the same model with all features with a 76.4% relative error
(23.6% improvement over the baseline). LIWC features also produce the best regression
model for conscientiousness (82.1% relative error, 17.9% improvement). Surprisingly, the
best model of emotional stability contains only prosodic features, with a 85.3% relative
error (14.7% improvement). This finding suggests that speech cues are crucial for the
perception of neuroticism, which could explain why Gill and Oberlander (2003) reported a
low correlation between self-assessed and observed emotional stability using text only. As

5.3 Qualitative Analysis
Regression trees for extraversion and conscientiousness are in Figures 3 and 4. As suggested
by the correlations in Section 3.3, the model in Figure 3 shows that the voices pitch and
variation of intensity play an important role when modelling extraversion. A high verbal
output is perceived as a sign of extraversion (see Word Count nodes), confirming previous
findings (Scherer, 1979). On the other hand, a low mean pitch combined with a constant
voice intensity characterises high introverts.
Figure 4 suggests that conscientious people use fewer swear words and content related
to sexuality, while preferring longer words. The same figure also shows that conscientious
people use fewer pronouns, i.e. a more explicit style, as well as more words related to
communication (e.g., talk and share).

6. Ranking Results
Results with both corpora and different feature sets are in Tables 21 and 22. The models
are trained over 100 rounds of boosting. The baseline model ranks extracts randomly,
producing a ranking loss of 0.5 on average (lower is better). Results are averaged over a
10-fold cross-validation, and all significance tests were done using a two-tailed paired t-test
at the p < .05 level.
6.1 Essays Corpus
Table 21 shows that openness to experience produces the best ranking model with the
essays corpus, producing a ranking loss of 0.39 (lower is better). Remarkably, this trait
was the easiest to model for all three recognition tasks with that corpus. As it is not the
case with conversational data, it seems that streams of consciousness, or more generally
personal writings, are likely to exhibit cues relative to the authors openness to experience.
Emotional stability produces the second best model with a ranking loss of 0.42, followed by
conscientiousness and extraversion, while the model for agreeableness produces the highest

we trained a ranking model with each feature set. Table 21 clearly shows that the LIWC
features are the only contributors to model accuracy, as the inclusion of MRC features
doesnt reduce the ranking loss for any trait.

6.2 EAR Corpus
Concerning the EAR corpus, Table 22 reporting experiments using all the features, shows
that models of extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience
are better than the random ranking baseline. Emotional stability is the most difficult trait
to model, while agreeableness and conscientiousness produce the best results, with ranking
losses of 0.31 and 0.33 respectively.

Feature set comparison: When looking at individual feature sets, Table 22 shows that
LIWC features perform significantly better than the baseline for all dimensions but emotional stability, while emotional stability is best predicted by MRC features only (0.39
ranking loss). Interestingly, prosodic features are very good predictors of extraversion, with
a lower ranking error than the full feature set (0.26). This model produces the best overall
result, with a 74% chance that the model will detect the most extravert among any two
unseen conversation extracts. As in the previous recognition tasks, utterance type features
on their own never significantly outperform the baseline.
6.3 Qualitative Analysis
The RankBoost rules indicate the impact of each feature on the recognition of a personality
trait by the magnitude of the parameter  associated with that feature. Tables 23 to
25 show the rules with the most impact on each of the best models, with the associated 
values. The feature labels are in Table 6. For example, the model of extraversion in Table 23
confirms previous findings by associating this trait with longer conversations (Rule 5), a
high speech rate (Rules 1 and 4) and a high pitch (Rules 2, 6 and 7) (Nass & Lee, 2001).
But new markers emerge, such as a high pitch variation for introverts (Rules 15, 18 and
20), contradicting previous findings reported by Scherer (1979).

producing the highest score increase, while rows 11-20 indicate evidence for the
other end of the scale, i.e. introversion.

Concerning agreeableness, Rules 1 and 20 in Table 24 suggest that agreeable people
use longer words but shorter sentences, and Rules 2 and 4 show that they express more
tentativity (with words like maybe or perhaps) and positive emotions (e.g., happy and good).
Anger and swear words greatly reduce the agreeableness score (Rules 12, 13, 18 and 19), as
well as the use of negations (Rule 15).

outperforms the baseline.

1-10 represent the rules producing the highest score increase, while rows 11-20
indicate evidence for the other end of the scale, i.e. disagreeableness.

Table 25 shows that conscientious people talk a lot about their work (Rule 1), while
unconscientious people swear a lot (Rules 19). Insight words (e.g., think and know) are
also good indicator of conscientiousness, as well as words expressing positive feelings like
happy and love (Rule 2 and 3). Interestingly, conscientious people are modelled as having
a high variation of their voice intensity (Rule 4). On the other hand, Rule 20 shows that
speaking very loud produces the opposite effect, as well as having a high pitch (Rule 13).
Long utterances are also indicative of a low conscientiousness (Rule 12).
The rule sets presented here contain only the most extreme rules of our ranking models,
which contain many additional personality cues that arent identified through a typical
correlational analysis. For example, a high speech rate and a high mean pitch tend to
contribute to a high extraversion ranking in Table 23s model, but they dont correlate
significantly with observer ratings, as detailed in Table 11. Similarly, positive emotion
words (Posemo) and the avoidance of long utterances (WPS) indicate agreeableness in the
model in Table 24, while these features dont correlate significantly with agreeableness
ratings.

7. Related Work
To our knowledge, there are only two other studies on the automatic recognition of personality. Both of these studies have focused on the classification of written texts based on
self-reports, rather than using continuous modelling techniques as we do here.
Argamon et al. (2005) use the essays corpus of Pennebaker and King (1999), so their
results are directly comparable to ours. As in our work, they use a top-down approach to
feature definition: their feature set consists of relative frequencies of 675 function words and
word categories based on networks of the theory of Systemic Functional Grammar. However,
they simplify the task by removing the middle third of the dataset, thereby potentially
increasing precision at the cost of reducing recall to a maximum of 67%. They train SMO
models on the top third and lower third of the essays corpus for the two personality traits

of extraversion and emotional stability, achieving accuracies on this subset of the data of
58% for both traits.
We believe it is likely that personality recognition models need to be based on the full
range of values to be useful in any practical application. Nevertheless, in order to do a
direct comparison, we also removed the middle third of the essays dataset and trained an
SMO classifier with the LIWC features. We obtain 57% classification accuracy for extraversion and 60% for emotional stability, whereas when the same algorithm is applied to the
whole corpus, we obtain accuracies of 55% for extraversion and 57% for emotional stability,
significantly outperforming the baseline (see Table 12). Using the EAR conversational data
and observer reports, accuracies of our SMO models remain at 65% for extraversion but
increase to 63% for emotional stability (see Table 14).
These results suggest that our feature set in combination with that of Argamon et al.
could possibly improve performance, as both feature sets perform comparably. Using their
features, Argamon et al. identify that relative frequencies of a set of function words are the
best predictor for extraversion, suggesting that those that refer to norms and certainty are
the most salient. Concerning emotional stability, the feature set characterising appraisal
produces by far the best results. Appraisal features are relative frequencies of positive and
negative words as well as frequencies of each category in the Attitude network (e.g., affect,
appreciation, judgement, etc.). They find that neurotics tend to use more words related to
negative appraisal and affect, but fewer appreciation appraisal words, suggesting that they
focus more on their personal feelings.
Oberlander and Nowson (2006) follow a bottom-up feature discovery method by training Naive Bayes and SMO models for four of the Big Five traits on a corpus of personal
weblogs, using n-gram features extracted from the dataset. In order to be able to compare
with Argamon et al., they report experiments where they remove texts with non-extreme
personality scores from their corpus, but they also report experiments applying classification
algorithms to seven different ways of partitioning the whole corpus into classes, motivated
as approximating a continuous modelling approach. Although, their results arent directly
488

fiRecognising Personality in Conversation and Text

comparable to ours because they are based on different corpora, we report the results that
use all instances of the dataset, as we believe that discarding some of the test data increases
precision at the cost of making recall unacceptably low.
When building Naive Bayes models using the most frequent bi-grams and tri-grams
computed over the full corpus, Oberlander and Nowson (2006) find that the model of agreeableness is the only one outperforming the baseline (54% accuracy, no level of significance
mentioned). When keeping only n-grams that are distinctive of two extreme sets of a given
trait, accuracies range from 65% for extraversion to 72% for emotional stability. Finally,
when applying an automatic feature selection algorithm to the filtered set, accuracies increase to range from 83% for emotional stability to 93% for agreeableness. When testing
whether these models generalise to a different corpus of weblogs, Nowson and Oberlander
(2007) report binary classification accuracies ranging from 55% for extraversion to 65%
for conscientiousness. Interestingly, models trained on the most extreme instances of the
original corpus seem to outperform models trained on the full corpus, although no level of
significance is mentioned. These studies show that careful feature selection greatly improves
classification accuracy, and that n-grams can be appropriate to model self-reports of personality, although, as Oberlander and Nowson point out, such features are likely to overfit.
It would therefore be interesting to test in future work whether the feature sets used here
generalise to another dataset.
Oberlander and Nowson (2006) also report results for 3-way and 5-way classification, in
order to approximate the finer-grained continuous personality ratings used in psychology
(as we do with the scalar models we present here). They obtain a maximum of 44.7%
for extraversion with 5 bins, using raw n-grams (baseline is 33.8%). These results are not
directly comparable to ours because they are on a different corpus, with different feature
sets. Moreover, we have not provided results on such multiple classification experiments,
because such models cannot take into account the fact that the different classes are part
of a total ordering, and thus the resulting models are forced to ignore the importance of
features that correlate with that ordering across all classes. We believe that regression and
ranking models are more appropriate for finer-grained personality recognition (see Sections
5 and 6).
To evaluate this claim, we first mapped the output of the best classifier to a ranking and
compared it with the RankBoost models. We trained a Naive Bayes classifier on the EAR
corpus with observer reports and all features, using 5 equal size bins.2 For each test fold
of a 10-fold cross-validation, we computed the ranking loss produced by the classifier based
on the ordering of the five classes. Results in Table 26 show that RankBoost significantly
outperforms the classifier for four traits out of five (p < .05), with an improvement close to
significance for emotional stability (p = 0.12).
Because RankBoosts goal is to minimise the ranking loss, this comparison is likely to
favour ranking models. Therefore, we also mapped the output of the RankBoost models
to 5 classification bins to see whether RankBoost could perform as well as a classifier for
the classification task. We divided the output ranking into 5 bins, each containing a 20%
slice of contiguously ranked instances. Results in Table 26 show that the Naive Bayes
classifier never outperforms RankBoost significantly, while the ranking model produces a
2. Oberlander and Nowson use unequal bins defined for each personality trait using standard deviation
from the mean, which may be an easier task than equal size bins.

better mean accuracy for agreeableness (38%) and openness to experience (27%), and the
same accuracy for emotional stability (22%). In sum, we find that ranking models perform
as well for classification and better for ranking compared with our best classifier, thus
modelling personality using continuous models is more accurate.

8. Discussion and Future Work
We show that personality can be recognised by computers through language cues.3 While
recent work in AI explores methods for the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic
variation in text and conversation, such as opinion, emotion, and deception, to date, we
know of only two studies besides our own on automatic recognition of user personality (Argamon et al., 2005; Mairesse & Walker, 2006a, 2006b; Oberlander & Nowson, 2006). To our
knowledge, the results presented here are the first to demonstrate statistically significant
results for texts and to recognise personality in conversation (Mairesse & Walker, 2006a,
2006b). We present the first results applying regression and ranking models in order to
model personality recognition using the continuous scales traditional in psychology. We
also systematically examine the use of different feature sets, suggested by previous psycholinguistic research. Although these features have been suggested by the psycholinguistic
literature, reported correlations with personality ratings are generally weak: it was not
obvious that they would improve accuracies of statistical models on unseen subjects.
Computational work on modelling personality has primarily focused on methods for
expressing personality in virtual agents and tutorial systems, and concepts related to personality such as politeness, emotion, or social intelligence (Walker, Cahn, & Whittaker,
1997; Andre, Klesen, Gebhard, Allen, & Rist, 1999; Lester, Towns, & FitzGerald, 1999;
Wang, Johnson, Mayer, Rizzo, Shaw, & Collins, 2005) inter alia. Studies have shown that
user evaluations of agent personality depend on the users own personality (Reeves & Nass,
1996; Cassell & Bickmore, 2003), suggesting that an ability to model the users personality

is required. Models such as we present here for the automatic recognition of user personality
is one way to acquire such a user model (Chu-Carroll & Carberry, 1994; Thompson, Goker,
& Langley, 2004; Zukerman & Litman, 2001). We plan to test these models as user models
in the context of an adaptive dialogue system.
Table 27 summarises results for all the personality traits and recognition tasks we
analysed. What clearly emerges is that extraversion is the easiest trait to model from
spoken language, followed by emotional stability and conscientiousness. Concerning written language, models of openness to experience produce the best results for all recognition
tasks. We can also see that feature selection is very important, as some of the best models
only contain a small subset of the full feature set. Prosodic features are important for modelling observed extraversion, emotional stability and openness to experience. MRC features
are useful for models of emotional stability, while LIWC features are beneficial for all traits.
We also analysed qualitatively which features had the most influence in specific models, for
all recognition tasks, as well as reporting correlations between each feature and personality
traits in Section 3.3.
Although the parameters of the algorithms have not been optimised, the bottom of
Table 27 seems to indicate that simple models like Naive Bayes or regression trees tend
to outperform more complex ones (e.g., support vector machines), confirming results from
Oberlander and Nowson (2006). However, our experiments on the larger essays corpus
(more than 2,400 texts) show that support vector machines and boosting algorithms produce higher classification accuracies. It is therefore likely that those algorithms would also
perform better on spoken data if they were trained on a much larger corpus than the EAR
dataset, and if their parameters were optimised.
We hypothesised that models of observed personality will outperform models of selfassessed personality. Our results do suggest that observed personality may be easier to
model than self-reports, at least in conversational data. For the EAR corpus, we find many
good results with models of observed personality, while models of self-assessed personality
never outperform the baseline. This may be due to objective observers using similar cues as
our models, while self-reports of personality may be more influenced by factors such as the
desirability of the trait (Edwards, 1953). Hogan (1982) introduced the distinction between
the agents and the observers perspective in personality assessment. While the agents
perspective conceptually taps into a persons identity (or personality from the inside), the
observers perspective in contrast taps into a persons reputation (or personality from the
outside). Both facets of personality have important psychological implications. A persons
identity shapes the way the person experiences the world. A persons reputation, however,
is psychologically not less important: it determines whether people get hired or fired (e.g.,
reputation of honesty), get married or divorced, get adored or stigmatised. Because it is
harder to assess, this observers perspective has received comparatively little attention in
psychology. Given that in everyday life people act as observers of other peoples behaviours
most of the time, the external perspective naturally has both high theoretical importance
and social relevance (Hogan, 1982).
Recent research exploring this issue in psychology is based on the Brunswikian Lens
model (Brunswik, 1956), which has been used extensively in recent years to explain the
kernel of truth in the social perception of strangers. Use of the lens model in personality
research reflects the widely shared assumptions that the expression of personality is commu491

Table 27: Comparison of the best models for each trait, for all three recognition tasks. Each
table entry contains the algorithm, the feature set, and the model performance.
See Sections 3.2 and 3.4 for details. Depending on the task, the evaluation metric is either the (1) classification accuracy; (2) percentage of improvement over
the regression baseline; (3) ranking loss. Asterisks indicate results that arent
significant at the p < .05 level.

nicatively functional, i.e. that (a) latent attributes of persons are expressed via observable
cues; (b) observers rely on observable cues to infer the latent attributes of others; (c) observers use appropriate cues  that is, their implicit assumptions on the relations between
observable cues and latent attributes are to some extent accurate. The model has also
been useful in identifying observable cues that mediate convergences between judgments of
latent attributes and more direct measures of those attributes (Scherer, 2003; Heinrich &
Borkenau, 1998).
As there are discrepancies between markers of self-assessed and observed personality,
another issue is the identification of the most appropriate model given a specific application.
Such a gold standard can be approximated by either observer or self-reports, however it is
likely that for a specific trait one type of report will be closer to the true personality. A
hypothesis that remains to be tested is that traits with a high visibility (e.g., extraversion)
are more accurately assessed using observer reports, as they tend to yield a higher interjudge agreement (Funder, 1995), while low visibility traits (e.g., emotional stability) are
better assessed by oneself. A personality recogniser aiming to estimate the true personality
would therefore have to switch from observer models to self-report models, depending on
the trait under assessment.
Beyond practical applications of personality recognition models, this work is also an
attempt to explore different ways of looking at the relation between personality and language. We looked at various personality recognition tasks, and applied different learning
492

fiRecognising Personality in Conversation and Text

methods in Section 3.4. The tasks vary in complexity: a ranking model can be directly
derived from a regression model, while a classification model can be derived from either a
ranking or a regression model. Is any type of model closer to the actual relation between
language, and more generally behaviour, and personality? Does personality vary continuously, or are there clusters of people with similar trait combinations? If the relation is
continuous, classification algorithms will never be able to produce accurate models for more
than two classes, because they dont take into account any ordering between the classes. As
ranking models outperform classifiers (see Section 7), and given the wide range of individual
differences reflected by the literature on the Big Five (Allport & Odbert, 1936; Norman,
1963; Goldberg, 1990), we believe that personality varies continuously among members of
the population, suggesting that regression or ranking models should be more accurate in
the long run. This hypothesis is supported by recent work in medical research showing that
antisocial personality disorder varies continuously (Marcus, Lilienfeld, Edens, & Poythress,
2006). Regression provides the most detailed model of the output variables, but depending on whether absolute differences between personality scores are meaningful, or if only
relative orderings between people matter, ranking may be more appropriate. Additional
models could also be tried on the ranking task, such as support vector algorithms for ordinal regression (Herbrich, Graepel, & Obermayer, 2000). Moreover, future work should
assess whether optimising the parameters of the learning algorithms improves performance.
In future work, we would like to improve these models and examine how well they
perform across dialogue domains. It is not clear whether the accuracies are high enough
to be useful. Applications involving speech recognition will introduce noise in all features
except for the prosodic features, probably reducing model accuracy, but since the EAR
corpus is relatively small, we expect that more training data would improve performance.
Additionally, we believe that the inclusion of gender as a feature would produce better
models, as the actual language correlates of perceived personality were shown to depend
on the gender of the speaker (Mehl et al., 2006). We also believe that future work should
investigate the combination of individual features in a trait-dependent way. Another issue is
the poor performance of the utterance type featuressince there were significant correlation
results for these features in Section 3.3, it is unclear why these features are not useful in
the statistical models. This could possibly arise from the small size of the datasets, or
from the relatively low accuracy of our hand-crafted automatic tagger, compared to other
work using supervised learning methods (Stolcke, Ries, Coccaro, Shriberg, Bates, Jurafsky,
Taylor, Martin, Ess-Dykema, & Meteer, 2000; Webb, Hepple, & Wilks, 2005).
We have begun to test these models on our spoken language generator (Mairesse &
Walker, 2007). In future work, we plan to compare the utility of models trained on out-ofdomain corpora, such as those here, with other methods for training such models, in terms
of their utility for the automatic adaptation of the output generation of dialogue systems.
