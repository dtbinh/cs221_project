Abstract
There has been significant recent interest in game-theoretic approaches to security, with much
of the recent research focused on utilizing the leader-follower Stackelberg game model. Among
the major applications are the ARMOR program deployed at LAX Airport and the IRIS program in
use by the US Federal Air Marshals (FAMS). The foundational assumption for using Stackelberg
games is that security forces (leaders), acting first, commit to a randomized strategy; while their
adversaries (followers) choose their best response after surveillance of this randomized strategy.
Yet, in many situations, a leader may face uncertainty about the followers surveillance capability.
Previous work fails to address how a leader should compute her strategy given such uncertainty.
We provide five contributions in the context of a general class of security games. First, we
show that the Nash equilibria in security games are interchangeable, thus alleviating the equilibrium
selection problem. Second, under a natural restriction on security games, any Stackelberg strategy
is also a Nash equilibrium strategy; and furthermore, the solution is unique in a class of security
games of which ARMOR is a key exemplar. Third, when faced with a follower that can attack
multiple targets, many of these properties no longer hold. Fourth, we show experimentally that in
most (but not all) games where the restriction does not hold, the Stackelberg strategy is still a Nash
equilibrium strategy, but this is no longer true when the attacker can attack multiple targets. Finally,
as a possible direction for future research, we propose an extensive-form game model that makes
the defenders uncertainty about the attackers ability to observe explicit.

1. Introduction
There has been significant recent research interest in game-theoretic approaches to security at airports, ports, transportation, shipping and other infrastructure (Pita et al., 2008; Pita, Jain, Ordonez,
Portway et al., 2009; Jain et al., 2010). Much of this work has used a Stackelberg game framec

work to model interactions between the security forces and attackers and to compute strategies for
the security forces (Conitzer & Sandholm, 2006; Paruchuri et al., 2008; Kiekintveld et al., 2009;
Basilico, Gatti, & Amigoni, 2009; Letchford, Conitzer, & Munagala, 2009; Korzhyk, Conitzer,
& Parr, 2010). In this framework, the defender (i.e., the security forces) acts first by committing
to a patrolling or inspection strategy, and the attacker chooses where to attack after observing the
defenders choice. The typical solution concept applied to these games is Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE), which assumes that the defender will choose an optimal mixed (randomized) strategy
based on the assumption that the attacker will observe this strategy and choose an optimal response.
This leader-follower paradigm appears to fit many real-world security situations.
Indeed, Stackelberg games are at the heart of two major deployed decision-support applications. The first is the ARMOR security system, deployed at the Los Angeles International Airport
(LAX) (Pita et al., 2008; Jain et al., 2010). In this domain police are able to set up checkpoints
on roads leading to particular terminals, and assign canine units (bomb-sniffing dogs) to patrol
terminals. Police resources in this domain are homogeneous, and do not have significant scheduling constraints. The second is IRIS, a similar application deployed by the Federal Air Marshals
Service (FAMS) (Tsai, Rathi, Kiekintveld, Ordonez, & Tambe, 2009; Jain et al., 2010). Armed
marshals are assigned to commercial flights to deter and defeat terrorist attacks. This domain has
more complex constraints. In particular, marshals are assigned to tours of flights that return to the
same destination, and the tours on which any given marshal is available to fly are limited by the
marshals current location and timing constraints. The types of scheduling and resource constraints
we consider in the work in this paper are motivated by those necessary to represent this domain.
Additionally, there are other security applications that are currently under evaluation and even more
in the pipeline. For example, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is testing and evaluating the GUARDS system for potential national deployment (at over 400 airports)  GUARDS
also uses Stackelberg games for TSA security resource allocation for conducting security activities
aimed at protection of the airport infrastructure (Pita, Bellamane et al., 2009). Another example is
an application under development for the United States Coast Guard for suggesting patrolling strategies to protect ports to ensure the safety and security of all passenger, cargo, and vessel operations.
Other potential examples include protecting electric power grids, oil pipelines, and subway systems
infrastructure (Brown, Carlyle, Salmeron, & Wood, 2005); as well as border security and computer
network security.
However, there are legitimate concerns about whether the Stackelberg model is appropriate in all
cases. In some situations attackers may choose to act without acquiring costly information about the
security strategy, especially if security measures are difficult to observe (e.g., undercover officers)
and insiders are unavailable. In such cases, a simultaneous-move game model may be a better
reflection of the real situation. The defender faces an unclear choice about which strategy to adopt:
the recommendation of the Stackelberg model, or of the simultaneous-move model, or something
else entirely? In general settings, the equilibrium strategy can in fact differ between these models.
Consider the normal-form game in Table 1. If the row player has the ability to commit, the SSE
strategy is to play a with .5 and b with .5, so that the best response for the column player is to play
d, which gives the row player an expected utility of 2.5.1 On the other hand, if the players move
simultaneously the only Nash Equilibrium (NE) of this game is for the row player to play a and
the column player c. This can be seen by noticing that b is strictly dominated for the row player.
1. In these games it is assumed that if the follower is indifferent, he breaks the tie in the leaders favor (otherwise, the
optimal solution is not well defined).

Table 1: Example game where the Stackelberg Equilibrium is not a Nash Equilibrium.
Previous work has failed to resolve the defenders dilemma of which strategy to select when the
attackers observation capability is unclear.
In this paper, we conduct theoretical and experimental analysis of the leaders dilemma, focusing
on security games (Kiekintveld et al., 2009). This is a formally defined class of not-necessarily-zerosum2 games motivated by the applications discussed earlier. We make four primary contributions.
First, we show that Nash equilibria are interchangeable in security games, avoiding equilibrium
selection problems. Second, if the game satisfies the SSAS (Subsets of Schedules Are Schedules)
property, the defenders set of SSE strategies is a subset of her NE strategies. In this case, the defender is always playing a best response by using an SSE regardless of whether the attacker observes
the defenders strategy or not. Third, we provide counter-examples to this (partial) equivalence in
two cases: (1) when the SSAS property does not hold for defender schedules, and (2) when the
attacker can attack multiple targets simultaneously. In these cases, the defenders SSE strategy may
not be part of any NE profile. Finally, our experimental tests show that the fraction of games where
the SSE strategy played is not part of any NE profile is vanishingly small. However, when the attacker can attack multiple targets, then the SSE strategy fails to be an NE strategy in a relatively
large number of games.
Section 2 contains the formal definition of the security games considered in this paper. Section 3
contains the theoretical results about Nash and Stackelberg equilibria in security games, which we
consider to be the main contributions of this paper. In Section 4, we show that our results do not
hold in an extension of security games that allows the attacker to attack multiple targets at once.
Section 5 contains the experimental results. To initiate future research on cases where the properties
from Section 3 do not hold, we present in Section 6 an extensive-form game model that makes the
defenders uncertainty about the attackers ability to observe explicit. We discuss additional related
work in Section 7, and conclude in Section 8.

2. Definitions and Notation
A security game (Kiekintveld et al., 2009) is a two-player game between a defender and an attacker.
The attacker may choose to attack any target from the set T = {t1 , t2 , . . . , tn }. The defender tries
to prevent attacks by covering targets using resources from the set R = {r1 , r2 , . . . , rK }. As shown
in Figure 1, Udc (ti ) is the defenders utility if ti is attacked while ti is covered by some defender
resource. If ti is not covered, the defender gets Udu (ti ). The attackers utility is denoted similarly by
2. The not-necessarily-zero-sumness of games used for counter-terrorism or security resource allocation analysis is
further emphasized by Bier (2007), Keeney (2007), Rosoff and John (2009). They focus on preference elicitation of
defenders and attackers and explicitly outline that the objectives of different terrorist groups or individuals are often
different from each other, and that defenders and attackers objectives are not exact opposites of each other. For
instance, Bier (2007) notes that the attackers utility can also depend on factors that may not have a significant effect
on the defenders utility, such as the cost of mounting the attack as well as the propaganda value of the target to the
attacker.

Uac (ti ) and Uau (ti ). We use Ud (ti ) = Udc (ti )  Udu (ti ) to denote the difference between defenders
covered and uncovered utilities. Similarly, Ua (ti ) = Uau (ti )  Uac (ti ). As a key property of
security games, we assume Ud (ti ) > 0 and Ua (ti ) > 0. In words, adding resources to cover a
target helps the defender and hurts the attacker.

Figure 1: Payoff structure of security games.
Motivated by FAMS and similar domains, we introduce resource and scheduling constraints for
the defender. Resources may be assigned to schedules covering multiple targets, s  T . For each
resource ri , there is a subset Si of the schedules S that resource ri can potentially cover. That is,
ri can cover any s  Si . In the FAMS domain, flights are targets and air marshals are resources.
Schedules capture the idea that air marshals fly tours, and must return to a particular starting point.
Heterogeneous resources can express additional timing and location constraints that limit the tours
on which any particular marshal can be assigned to fly. An important subset of the FAMS domain
can be modeled using fixed schedules of size 2 (i.e., a pair of departing and returning flights). The
LAX domain is also a subclass of security games as defined here, with schedules of size 1 and
homogeneous resources.
A security game described above can be represented as a normal form game, as follows. The
attackers pure strategy space A is the set of targets. The attackers mixed strategy a = hai i is a
vector where ai represents the probability of attacking
QK ti . The defenders pure strategy is a feasible
assignment of resources to schedules, i.e., hsi i  i=1 Si . Since covering a target with one resource
is essentially the same as covering it with any positive number of resources, the defenders pure
strategy can also be represented by a coverage vector d = hdi i  {0, 1}n where di represents
whether ti is covered or not. For example, h{t1 , t4 }, {t2 }i can be a possible assignment, and the
corresponding coverage vector is h1, 1, 0, 1i. However, not all the coverage vectors are feasible due
to resource and schedule constraints. We denote the set of feasible coverage vectors by D  {0, 1}n .
The defenders mixed strategy C specifies the probabilities of playing each d  D, where each
individual probability is denoted
P by Cd . Let c = hci i be the vector of coverage probabilities corresponding to C, where ci = dD di Cd is the marginal probability of covering ti . For example,
suppose the defender has two coverage vectors: d1 = h1, 1, 0i and d2 = h0, 1, 1i. For the mixed
strategy C = h.5, .5i, the corresponding vector of coverage probabilities is c = h.5, 1, .5i. Denote
the mapping from C to c by , so that c = (C).
If strategy profile hC, ai is played, the defenders utility is

Ud (C, a) =

while the attackers utility is

If the players move simultaneously, the standard solution concept is Nash equilibrium.
Definition 1. A pair of strategies hC, ai forms a Nash Equilibrium (NE) if they satisfy the following:
1. The defender plays a best-response:
Ud (C, a)  Ud (C0 , a) C0 .
2. The attacker plays a best-response:
Ua (C, a)  Ua (C, a0 )  a0 .
In our Stackelberg model, the defender chooses a mixed strategy first, and the attacker chooses
a strategy after observing the defenders choice. The attackers response function is g(C) : C  a.
In this case, the standard solution concept is Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (Leitmann, 1978; von
Stengel & Zamir, 2010).
Definition 2. A pair of strategies hC, gi forms a Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE) if they satisfy
the following:
1. The leader (defender) plays a best-response:
Ud (C, g(C))  Ud (C0 , g(C0 )), for all C0 .
2. The follower (attacker) plays a best-response:
Ua (C, g(C))  Ua (C, g 0 (C)), for all C, g 0 .
3. The follower breaks ties optimally for the leader:
Ud (C, g(C))  Ud (C,  (C)), for all C, where  (C) is the set of follower best-responses to
C.
We denote the set of mixed strategies for the defender that are played in some Nash Equilibrium
by N E , and the corresponding set for Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium by SSE . The defenders
SSE utility is always at least as high as the defenders utility in any NE profile. This holds for any
game, not just security games. This follows from the following: in the SSE model, the leader can
at the very least choose to commit to her NE strategy. If she does so, then the follower will choose
from among his best responses one that maximizes the utility of the leader (due to the tie-breaking
assumption), whereas in the NE the follower will also choose from his best responses to this defender strategy (but not necessarily the ones that maximize the leaders utility). In fact a stronger
claim holds: the leaders SSE utility is at least as high as in any correlated equilibrium. These observations are due to von Stengel and Zamir (2010) who give a much more detailed discussion of these
points (including, implicitly, to what extent this still holds without any tie-breaking assumption).
In the basic model, it is assumed that both players utility functions are common knowledge.
Because this is at best an approximation of the truth, it is useful to reflect on the importance of this
assumption. In the SSE model, the defender needs to know the attackers utility function in order to
compute her SSE strategy, but the attacker does not need to know the defenders utility function; all
301

fiKORZHYK , Y IN , K IEKINTVELD , C ONITZER , & TAMBE

he needs to best-respond is to know the mixed strategy to which the defender committed.3 On the
other hand, in the NE model, the attacker does not observe the defenders mixed strategy and needs
to know the defenders utility function. Arguably, this is much harder to justify in practice, and this
may be related to why it is the SSE model that is used in the applications discussed earlier. Our goal
in this paper is not to argue for the NE model, but rather to discuss the relationship between SSE and
NE strategies for the defender. We do show that the Nash equilibria are interchangeable in security
games, suggesting that NE strategies have better properties in these security games than they do in
general. We also show that in a large class of games, the defenders SSE strategy is guaranteed to
be an NE strategy as well, so that this is no longer an issue for the defender; while the attackers NE
strategy will indeed depend on the defenders utility function, as we will see this does not affect the
defenders NE strategy.
Of course, in practice, the defender generally does not know the attackers utility function exactly. One way to address this is to make this uncertainty explicit and model the game as a Bayesian
game (Harsanyi, 1968), but the known algorithms for solving for SSE strategies in Bayesian games
(e.g., Paruchuri et al., 2008) are practical only for small security games, because they depend on
writing out the complete action space for each player, which is of exponential size in security games.
In addition, even when the complete action space is written out, the problem is NP-hard (Conitzer &
Sandholm, 2006) and no good approximation guarantee is possible unless P=NP (Letchford et al.,
2009). A recent paper by Kiekintveld, Marecki, and Tambe (2011) discusses approximation methods for such models. Another issue is that the attacker is assumed to respond optimally, which
may not be true in practice; several models of Stackelberg games with an imperfect follower have
been proposed by Pita, Jain, Ordonez, Tambe et al. (2009). These solution concepts also make the
solution more robust to errors in estimation of the attackers utility function. We do not consider
Bayesian games or imperfect attackers in this paper.

3. Equilibria in Security Games
The challenge for us is to understand the fundamental relationships between the SSE and NE strategies in security games. A special case is zero-sum security games, where the defenders utility is
the exact opposite of the attackers utility. For finite two-person zero-sum games, it is known that
the different game theoretic solution concepts of NE, minimax, maximin and SSE all give the same
answer. In addition, Nash equilibrium strategies of zero-sum games have a very useful property in
that they are interchangeable: an equilibrium strategy for one player can be paired with the other
players strategy from any equilibrium profile, and the result is an equilibrium, where the payoffs
for both players remain the same.
Unfortunately, security games are not necessarily zero-sum (and are not zero-sum in deployed
applications). Many properties of zero-sum games do not hold in security games. For instance,
a minimax strategy in a security game may not be a maximin strategy. Consider the example in
Table 2, in which there are 3 targets and one defender resource. The defender has three actions; each
of defenders actions can only cover one target at a time, leaving the other targets uncovered. While
3. Technically, this is not exactly true because the attacker needs to break ties in the defenders favor. However, when
the attacker is indifferent among multiple actions, the defender can generally modify her strategy slightly to make the
attacker strictly prefer the action that is optimal for the defender; the point of the tiebreaking assumption is merely to
make the optimal solution well defined. See also the work of von Stengel and Zamir (2010) and their discussion of
generic games in particular.

all three targets are equally appealing to the attacker, the defender has varying utilities of capturing
the attacker at different targets. For the defender, the unique minimax strategy, h1/3, 1/3, 1/3i, is
different from the unique maximin strategy, h6/11, 3/11, 2/11i.

Table 2: Security game which is not strategically zero-sum.
Strategically zero-sum games (Moulin & Vial, 1978) are a natural and strict superset of zerosum games for which most of the desirable properties of zero-sum games still hold. This is exactly
the class of games for which no completely mixed Nash equilibrium can be improved upon. Moulin
and Vial proved a game (A, B) is strategically zero-sum if and only if there exist u > 0 and v > 0
such that uA + vB = U + V , where U is a matrix with identical columns and V is a matrix with
identical rows (Moulin & Vial, 1978). Unfortunately, security games are not even strategically zerosum. The game in Table 2 is a counterexample, because otherwise there must exist u, v > 0 such
that,

a a a

c c c
x y z
From these equations, a + y = a + z = b + x = b + z = c + x = c + y = v, which implies
x = y = z and a = b = c. We also know a + x = u, b + y = 2u, c + z = 3u. However since
a + x = b + y = c + z, u must be 0, which contradicts the assumption u > 0.
Another concept that is worth mentioning is that of unilaterally competitive games (Kats &
Thisse, 1992). If a game is unilaterally competitive (or weakly unilaterally competitive), this implies
that if a player unilaterally changes his action in a way that increases his own utility, then this must
result in a (weak) decrease in utility for every other players utility. This does not hold for security
games: for example, if the attacker switches from a heavily defended but very sensitive target to an
undefended target that is of little value to the defender, this change may make both players strictly
better off. An example is shown in Table 3. If the attacker switches from attacking t1 to attacking
t2 , each players utility increases.
Nevertheless, we show in the rest of this section that security games still have some important
properties. We start by establishing equivalence between the set of defenders minimax strategies
and the set of defenders NE strategies. Second, we show Nash equilibria in security games are
interchangeable, resolving the defenders equilibrium strategy selection problem in simultaneousmove games. Third, we show that under a natural restriction on schedules, any SSE strategy for the
defender is also a minimax strategy and hence an NE strategy. This resolves the defenders dilemma
about whether to play according to SSE or NE when there is uncertainty about the attackers ability

to observe the strategy: the defender can safely play the SSE strategy, because it is guaranteed to
be an NE strategy as well, and moreover the Nash equilibria are interchangeable so there is no risk
of choosing the wrong equilibrium strategy. Finally, for a restricted class of games (including
the games from the LAX domain), we find that there is a unique SSE/NE defender strategy and a
unique attacker NE strategy.
3.1 Equivalence of NE and Minimax
We first prove that any defenders NE strategy is also a minimax strategy. Then for every defenders
minimax strategy C we construct a strategy a for the attacker such that hC, ai is an NE profile.
Definition 3. For a defenders mixed strategy C, define the attackers best response utility by
E(C) = maxni=1 Ua (C, ti ). Denote the minimum of the attackers best response utilities over
all defenders strategies by E  = minC E(C). The set of defenders minimax strategies is defined
as:
M = {C|E(C) = E  }.
We define the function f as follows. If a is an attackers strategy in which target ti is attacked
with probability ai , then f (a) = a is an attackers strategy such that
Ud (ti )
Ua (ti )
Pn
where  > 0 is a normalizing constant such that i=1 ai = 1. The intuition behind the function f
is that the defender prefers playing a strategy C to playing another strategy C0 in a security game
G when the attacker plays a strategy a if and only if the defender also prefers playing C to playing
C0 when the attacker plays f (a) in the corresponding zero-sum security game G, which is defined
in Lemma 3.1 below. Also, the supports of attacker strategies a and f (a) are the same. As we will
show in Lemma 3.1, function f provides a one-to-one mapping of the attackers NE strategies in G
to the attackers NE strategies in G, with the inverse function f 1 (a) = a given by the following
equation.
1 Ua (ti )
ai = ai
(1)
 Ud (ti )
ai = ai

Lemma 3.1. Consider a security game G. Construct the corresponding zero-sum security game G
in which the defenders utilities are re-defined as follows.
Udc (t) = Uac (t)
Udu (t) = Uau (t)
Then hC, ai is an NE profile in G if and only if hC, f (a)i is an NE profile in G.
304

fiS TACKELBERG VS . NASH IN S ECURITY G AMES

Proof. Note that the supports of strategies a and a = f (a) are the same, and also that the attackers
utility function is the same in games G and G. Thus a is a best response to C in G if and only if a is
a best response to C in G.
Denote the utility that the defender gets if profile hC, ai is played in game G by UdG (C, a). To
show that C is a best response to a in game G if and only if C is a best response to a in G, it is
sufficient to show equivalence of the following two inequalities.
UdG (C, a)  UdG (C0 , a)  0
 UdG (C, a)  UdG (C0 , a)  0
We will prove the equivalence by starting from the first inequality and transforming it into the second
one. On the one hand, we have,
UdG (C, a)  UdG (C0 , a) =

ai (ci  c0i )Ud (ti ).

Lemma 3.2. Suppose C is a defender NE strategy in a security game. Then E(C) = E  , i.e.,
N E  M .
Proof. Suppose hC, ai is an NE profile in the security game G. According to Lemma 3.1, hC, f (a)i
must be an NE profile in the corresponding zero-sum security game G. Since C is an NE strategy
in the zero-sum game G, it must also be a minimax strategy in G (Fudenberg & Tirole, 1991). The
attackers utility function in G is the same as in G, thus C must also be a minimax strategy in G, and
E(C) = E  .
305

fiKORZHYK , Y IN , K IEKINTVELD , C ONITZER , & TAMBE

Lemma 3.3. In a security game G, any defenders strategy C such that E(C) = E  is an NE
strategy, i.e., M  N E .
Proof. C is a minimax strategy in both G and the corresponding zero-sum game G. Any minimax
strategy is also an NE strategy in a zero-sum game (Fudenberg & Tirole, 1991). Then there must
exist an NE profile hC, ai in G. By Lemma 3.1, hC, f 1 (a)i is an NE profile in G. Thus C is an
NE strategy in G.
Theorem 3.4. In a security game, the set of defenders minimax strategies is equal to the set of
defenders NE strategies, i.e., M = N E .
Proof. Lemma 3.2 shows that every defenders NE strategy is a minimax strategy, and Lemma 3.3
shows that every defenders minimax strategy is an NE strategy. Thus the sets of defenders NE and
minimax strategies must be equal.
It is important to emphasize again that while the defenders equilibrium strategies are the same
in G and G, this is not true for the attackers equilibrium strategies: attacker probabilities that leave
the defender indifferent across her support in G do not necessarily leave her indifferent in G. This is
the reason for the function f (a) above.
3.2 Interchangeability of Nash Equilibria
We now show that Nash equilibria in security games are interchangeable. This result indicates that,
for the case where the attacker cannot observe the defenders mixed strategy, there is effectively no
equilibrium selection problem: as long as each player plays a strategy from some equilibrium, the
result is guaranteed to be an equilibrium. Of course, this still does not resolve the issue of what to
do when it is not clear whether the attacker can observe the mixed strategy; we return to this issue
in Subsection 3.3.
Theorem 3.5. Suppose hC, ai and hC0 , a0 i are two NE profiles in a security game G. Then hC, a0 i
and hC0 , ai are also NE profiles in G.
Proof. Consider the corresponding zero-sum game G. From Lemma 3.1, both hC, f (a)i and hC0 , f (a0 )i
must be NE profiles in G. By the interchange property of NE in zero-sum games (Fudenberg & Tirole, 1991), hC, f (a0 )i and hC0 , f (a)i must also be NE profiles in G. Applying Lemma 3.1 again
in the other direction, we get that hC, a0 i and hC0 , ai must be NE profiles in G.
By Theorem 3.5, the defenders equilibrium selection problem in a simultaneous-move security
game is resolved. The reason is that given the attackers NE strategy a, the defender must get the
same utility by responding with any NE strategy. Next, we give some insights on expected utilities
in NE profiles. We first show the attackers expected utility is the same in all NE profiles, followed
by an example demonstrating that the defender may have varying expected utilities corresponding
to different attackers strategies.
Theorem 3.6. Suppose hC, ai is an NE profile in a security game. Then, Ua (C, a) = E  .
Proof. From Lemma 3.2, C is a minimax strategy and E(C) = E  . On the one hand,
Ua (C, a) =

i=1

On the other hand, because a is a best response to C, it should be at least as good as the strategy of
attacking t  arg maxt Ua (C, t) with probability 1, that is,
Ua (C, a)  Ua (C, t ) = E(C) = E  .
Therefore we know Ua (C, a) = E  .
Unlike the attacker who gets the same utility in all NE profiles, the defender may get varying
expected utilities depending on the attackers strategy selection. Consider the game shown in Table 4. The defender can choose to cover one of the two targets at a time. The only defender NE
strategy is to cover t1 with 100% probability, making the attacker indifferent between attacking t1
and t2 . One attacker NE strategy is to always attack t1 , which gives the defender an expected utility
of 1. Another attackers NE strategy is h2/3, 1/3i, given which the defender is indifferent between
defending t1 and t2 . In this case, the defenders utility decreases to 2/3 because she captures the
attacker with a lower probability.

3.3 SSE Strategies Are Also Minimax/NE Strategies
We have already shown that the set of defenders NE strategies coincides with her minimax strategies. If every defenders SSE strategy is also a minimax strategy, then SSE strategies must also be
NE strategies. The defender can then safely commit to an SSE strategy; there is no selection problem for the defender. Unfortunately, if a security game has arbitrary scheduling constraints, then an
SSE strategy may not be part of any NE profile. For example, consider the game in Table 5 with 4
targets {t1 , . . . , t4 }, 2 schedules s1 = {t1 , t2 }, s2 = {t3 , t4 }, and a single defender resource. The
defender always prefers that t1 is attacked, and t3 and t4 are never appealing to the attacker.

Table 5: A schedule-constrained security game where the defenders SSE strategy is not an NE
strategy.

There is a unique SSE strategy for the defender, which places as much coverage probability on
s1 as possible without making t2 more appealing to the attacker than t1 . The rest of the coverage
probability is placed on s2 . The result is that s1 and s2 are both covered with probability 0.5. In
307

fiKORZHYK , Y IN , K IEKINTVELD , C ONITZER , & TAMBE

contrast, in a simultaneous-move game, t3 and t4 are dominated for the attacker. Thus, there is no
reason for the defender to place resources on targets that are never attacked, so the defenders unique
NE strategy covers s1 with probability 1. That is, the defenders SSE strategy is different from the
NE strategy. The difference between the defenders payoffs in these cases can also be arbitrarily
large because t1 is always attacked in an SSE and t2 is always attacked in a NE.
The above example restricts the defender to protect t1 and t2 together, which makes it impossible
for the defender to put more coverage on t2 without making t1 less appealing. If the defender could
assign resources to any subset of a schedule, this difficulty is resolved. More formally, we assume
that for any resource ri , any subset of a schedule in Si is also a possible schedule in Si :
1  i  K : s0  s  Si  s0  Si .

(2)

If a security game satisfies Equation (2), we say it has the SSAS property. This is natural in many
security domains, since it is often possible to cover fewer targets than the maximum number that a
resource could possible cover in a schedule. We find that this property is sufficient to ensure that
the defenders SSE strategy must also be an NE strategy.
Lemma 3.7. Suppose C is a defender strategy in a security game which satisfies the SSAS property
and c = (C) is the corresponding vector of marginal probabilities. Then for any c0 such that
0  c0i  ci for all ti  T , there must exist a defender strategy C0 such that (C0 ) = c0 .
Proof. The proof is by induction on the number of ti where c0i 6= ci , as denoted by (c, c0 ). As
the base case, if there is no i such that c0i 6= ci , the existence trivially holds because (C) = c0 .
Suppose the existence holds for all c, c0 such that (c, c0 ) = k, where 0  k  n  1. We consider
any c, c0 where (c, c0 ) = k + 1. Then for some j, c0j 6= cj . Since c0j  0 and c0j < cj , we have
cj > 0. There must be a nonempty set of coverage vectors Dj that cover tj and receive positive
probability in C. Because the security game satisfies the SSAS property, for every d  Dj , there
is a valid d which covers all targets in d except for tj . From the defender strategy C, by shifting
Cd (cj c0j )
probability from every d  Dj to the corresponding d , we get a defender strategy C
cj
where ci = ci for i 6= j, and ci = c0i for i = j. Hence (c , c0 ) = k, implying there exists a C0 such
that (C0 ) = c0 by the induction assumption. By induction, the existence holds for any c, c0 .

Theorem 3.8. Suppose C is a defender SSE strategy in a security game which satisfies the SSAS
property. Then E(C) = E  , i.e., SSE  M = N E .
Proof. The proof is by contradiction. Suppose hC, gi is an SSE profile in a security game which
satisfies the SSAS property, and E(C) > E  . Let Ta = {ti |Ua (C, ti ) = E(C)} be the set of targets
that give the attacker the maximum utility given the defender strategy C. By the definition of SSE,
we have
Ud (C, g(C)) = max Ud (C, ti ).
ti Ta

Consider a defender mixed strategy C such that E(C ) = E  . Then for any ti  Ta , Ua (C , ti )

308

fiS TACKELBERG VS . NASH IN S ECURITY G AMES

where  is an infinitesimal positive number. Since E   Ua (C , ti ) +  > 0, we have c0i < ci for all
ti  Ta . On the other hand, since for all ti  Ta ,
Ua (c0 , ti ) = E  +  < E(C) = Ua (C, ti ),
we have c0i > ci  0. Then for any ti  T , we have 0  c0i  ci . From Lemma 3.7, there exists a
defender strategy C0 corresponding to c0 . The attackers utility of attacking each target is as follows:
 
E + ,
ti  Ta ,
(4a)
0
Ua (C , ti ) =


Ua (C , ti )  E ,
ti

(4b)
Thus, the attackers best responses to C0 are still Ta . For all ti  Ta , since c0i > ci , it must be the
case that Ud (C, ti ) < Ud (C0 , ti ). By definition of attackers SSE response g, we have,
Ud (C0 , g(C0 )) = max Ud (C0 , ti )
ti Ta

> max Ud (C, ti ) = Ud (C, g(C)).
ti Ta

It follows that the defender is better off using C0 , which contradicts the assumption C is an SSE
strategy of the defender.
Theorem 3.4 and 3.8 together imply the following corollary.
Corollary 3.9. In security games with the SSAS property, any defenders SSE strategy is also an
NE strategy.
We can now answer the original question posed in this paper: when there is uncertainty over
the type of game played, should the defender choose an SSE strategy or a mixed strategy Nash
equilibrium or some combination of the two?4 For domains that satisfy the SSAS property, we have
proven that the defender can safely play an SSE strategy, because it is guaranteed to be a Nash
equilibrium strategy as well, and moreover the Nash equilibria are interchangeable so there is no
risk of choosing the wrong equilibrium strategy.
Among our motivating domains, the LAX domain satisfies the SSAS property since all schedules
are of size 1. Other patrolling domains, such as patrolling a port, also satisfy the SSAS property. In
such domains, the defender could thus commit to an SSE strategy, which is also now known to be
an NE strategy. The defender retains the ability to commit, but is still playing a best-response to
an attacker in a simultaneous-move setting (assuming the attacker plays an equilibrium strategy 
it does not matter which one, due to the interchange property shown above). However, the FAMS
domain does not naturally satisfy the SSAS property because marshals must fly complete tours.5 The
question of selecting SSE vs. NE strategies in this case is addressed experimentally in Section 5.
4. Of course, one may not agree that, in cases where its common knowledge that the players move simultaneously,
playing an NE strategy is the right thing to do in practice. This is a question at the heart of game theory that
is far beyond the scope of this paper to resolve. In this paper, our goal is not to argue for using NE strategies
in simultaneous-move settings in general; rather, it is to assess the robustness of SSE strategies to changes in the
information structure of specific classes of security games. For this purpose, NE seems like the natural representative
solution concept for simultaneous-move security games, especially in light of the interchangeability properties that
we show.
5. In principle, the FAMs could fly as civilians on some legs of a tour. However, they would need to be able to commit
to acting as civilians (i.e., not intervening in an attempt to hijack the aircraft) and the attacker would need to believe
that a FAM would not intervene, which is difficult to achieve in practice.

3.4 Uniqueness in Restricted Games
The previous sections show that SSE strategies are NE strategies in many cases. However, there
may still be multiple equilibria to select from (though this difficulty is alleviated by the interchange
property). Here we prove an even stronger uniqueness result for an important restricted class of
security domains, which includes the LAX domain. In particular, we consider security games where
the defender has homogeneous resources that can cover any single target. The SSAS property is
trivially satisfied,
since all schedules are of size 1. Any vector of coverage probabilities c = hci i
P
such that ni=1 ci  K is a feasible strategy for the defender, so we can represent the defender
strategy by marginal coverage probabilities. With a minor restriction on the attackers payoff matrix,
the defender always has a unique minimax strategy which is also the unique SSE and NE strategy.
Furthermore, the attacker also has a unique NE response to this strategy.
Theorem 3.10. In a security game with homogeneous resources that can cover any single target,
if for every target ti  T , Uac (ti ) 6= E  , then the defender has a unique minimax, NE, and SSE
strategy.
Proof. We first show the defender has a unique minimax strategy. Let T  = {t|Uau (t)  E  }.
Define c = hci i as

u

 Ua (ti )  E ,
ti  T  ,
(5a)
ci =

ti

(5b)
Note that E  cannot be less than any Uac (ti )  otherwise, regardless of the defenders strategy,
the attacker could always get at least Uac (ti ) > E  by attacking ti , which contradicts the fact that
E  is the attackers best response utility to a defenders minimax strategy. Since E   Uac (ti ) and
we assume E  6= Uac (ti ),
1  ci =

E   Uac (ti )

Next, we will prove ni=1 ci  K. For the sake ofPcontradiction, suppose ni=1 ci < K. Let

 > 0 such that
c0 = hc0i i, where
Pn ci0 = ci + . Since ci < 1 and i=1 ci < K, we can find
0
ci < 1 and i=1 ci < K. Then every target has strictly higher coverage in c0 than in c , hence
E(c0 ) < E(c ) = E  , which contradicts the fact that E  is the minimum of all E(c).
Next, we show that if c is a minimax strategy, then c = c . By the P
definition of a minimax

i=1 ci  K and on the

other hand i=1 ci  i=1 ci  K. Therefore it must be the case that ci = ci for any i. Hence,
c is the unique minimax strategy of the defender.
Furthermore, by Theorem 3.4, we have that c is the unique defenders NE strategy. By Theorem 3.8 and the existence of SSE (Basar & Olsder, 1995), we have that c is the unique defenders
SSE strategy.
In the following example, we show that Theorem 3.10 does not work without the condition
Uac (ti ) 6= E  for every ti . Consider a security game with 4 targets in which the defender has two
homogeneous resources, each resource can cover any single target, and the players utility functions
are as defined in Table 5. The defender can guarantee the minimum attackers best-response utility
310

fiS TACKELBERG VS . NASH IN S ECURITY G AMES

of E  = 3 by covering t1 with probability 2/3 or more and covering t2 with probability 1. Since
E  = Uac (t2 ), Theorem 3.10 does not apply. The defender prefers an attack on t1 , so the defender
must cover t1 with probability exactly 2/3 in an SSE strategy. Thus the defenders SSE strategies
can have coverage vectors (2/3, 1, 1/3, 0), (2/3, 1, 0, 1/3), or any convex combination of those two
vectors. According to Theorem 3.8, each of those SSE strategies is also a minimax/NE strategy, so
the defenders SSE, minimax, and NE strategies are all not unique in this example.
Theorem 3.11. In a security game with homogeneous resources that can cover any one target, if
for every target ti  T , Uac (ti ) 6= E  and Uau (ti ) 6= E  , then the attacker has a unique NE strategy.
Proof. c and T  are the same as in the proof of Theorem 3.10. Given the defenders unique NE
strategy c , in any attackers best response, only ti  T  can be attacked with positive probability,
because,
 
E

Suppose hc , ai forms an NE profile. We have

For any ti  T  , we know from the proof of Theorem 3.10 that ci < 1. In addition, because
Uau (t) 6= E  , we have ci 6= 0. Thus we have 0 < ci < 1 for any ti  T  . For any ti , tj  T  ,
necessarily ai Ud (ti ) = aj Ud (tj ). Otherwise, assume ai Ud (ti ) > aj Ud (tj ). Consider
another defenders strategy c0 where c0i = ci +  < 1, c0j = cj   > 0, and c0k = ck for any k 6= i, j.
Ud (c0 , a)  Ud (c , a) = ai Ud (ti )  aj Ud (tj ) > 0
Hence, c is not a best response to a, which contradicts the assumption that hc , ai is an NE profile.
Therefore, there exists  > 0 such that, for any ti  T  , ai Ud (ti ) = . Substituting ai with
/Ud (ti ) in Equation (7), we have

(8b)

As we can see, a defined by (8a) and (8b) is the unique attacker NE strategy.
In the following example, we show that Theorem 3.11 does not work without the condition
Uau (ti ) 6= E  for every ti . Consider a game with three targets in which the defender has one resource that can cover any single target and the utilities are as defined in Table 6. The defender can
guarantee the minimum attackers best-response utility of E  = 2 by covering targets t1 and t2 with
311

fiKORZHYK , Y IN , K IEKINTVELD , C ONITZER , & TAMBE

probability 1/2 each. Since Uac (ti ) 6= E  for every ti , Theorem 3.10 applies, and the defenders
strategy with coverage vector (.5, .5, 0) is the unique minimax/NE/SSE strategy. However, Theorem 3.11 does not apply because Uau (t3 ) = E  . The attackers NE strategy is indeed not unique,
because both attacker strategies (.5, .5, 0) and (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) (as well as any convex combination
of these strategies) are valid NE best-responses.

Table 6: An example game in which the defender has a unique minimax/NE/SSE strategy with coverage vector (.5, .5, 0), but the attacker does not have a unique NE strategy. Two possible
attackers NE strategies are (.5, .5, 0) and (1/3, 1/3, 1/3).

The implication of Theorem 3.10 and Theorem 3.11 is that under certain conditions in the
simultaneous-move game, both the defender and the attacker have a unique NE strategy, which
gives each player a unique expected utility as a result.

4. Multiple Attacker Resources
To this point we have assumed that the attacker will attack exactly one target. We now extend our
security game definition to allow the attacker to use multiple resources to attack multiple targets
simultaneously.
4.1 Model Description
To keep the model simple, we assume homogeneous resources (for both players) and schedules of
size 1. The defender has K < n resources which can be assigned to protect any target, and the
attacker has L < n resources which can be used to attack any target. Attacking the same target with
multiple resources is equivalent to attacking with a single resource. The defenders pure strategy
is a coverage vector d = hdi i  D, where di  {0, 1} represents whether ti P
is covered or not.

q  Q. As defined in Section 2, we will describe the players mixed strategies by a pair of vectors
hc, ai, where ci is the probability of target ti being defended, and ai is the probability of ti being
attacked.
4.2 Overview of the Results
In some games with multiple attacker resources, the defenders SSE strategy is also an NE strategy,
just like in the single-attacker-resource case. For example, suppose all targets are interchangeable
for both the defender and the attacker. Then, the defenders SSE strategy is to defend all targets
with equal probabilities, so that the defenders utility from an attack on the least defended targets
is maximized. If the attacker best-responds by attacking all targets with equal probabilities, the
resulting strategy profile will be an NE. Thus the defenders SSE strategy is also an NE strategy
in this case. Example 1 below discusses this case in more detail. We observe that the defenders
SSE strategy in this example is the same no matter if the attacker has 1 or 2 resources. We use
this observation to construct a sufficient condition under which the defenders SSE strategy is also
an NE strategy in security games with multiple attacker resources (Proposition 4.2). This modest
positive result, however, is not exhaustive in the sense that it does not explain all cases in which the
defenders SSE strategy is also an NE strategy. Example 2 describes a game in which the defenders
SSE strategy is also an NE strategy, but the condition of Proposition 4.2 is not met.
In other games with multiple attacker resources, the defenders SSE strategy is not part of any
NE profile. The following gives some intuition about how this can happen. Suppose that there
is a target ti that the defender strongly hopes will not be attacked (even Udc (ti ) is very negative),
but given that ti is in fact attacked, defending it does not help the defender much (Ud (ti ) =
Udc (ti )  Udu (ti ) is very small). In the SSE model, the defender is likely to want to devote defensive
resources to ti , because the attacker will observe this and will not want to attack ti . However, in the
NE model, the defenders strategy cannot influence what the attacker does, so the marginal utility
for assigning defensive resources to ti is small; and, when the attacker has multiple resources, there
may well be another target that the attacker will also attack that is more valuable to defend, so the
defender will send her defensive resources there instead. We provide detailed descriptions of games
in which the defenders SSE strategy is not part of any NE profile in Examples 3, 4, and 5.
Since the condition in Proposition 4.2 implies that the defenders SSE and NE strategies do not
change if the number of attacker resources varies, we provide an exhaustive set of example games
in which such equality between the SSE and NE strategies is broken in a number of different ways
(Examples 2, 3, 4, and 5). This set of examples rules out a number of ways in which Proposition 4.2
might have been generalized to a larger set of games.
4.3 Detailed Proofs and Examples
Under certain assumptions, SSE defender strategies will still be NE defender strategies in the model
with multiple attacker resources. We will give a simple sufficient condition for this to hold. First,
we need the following lemma.
Lemma 4.1. Given a security game G L with L attacker resources, let G 1 be the same game except
with only one attacker resource. Let hc, ai be a Nash equilibrium of G 1 . Suppose that for any target
ti , Lai  1. Then, hc, Lai is a Nash equilibrium of G L .
313

fiKORZHYK , Y IN , K IEKINTVELD , C ONITZER , & TAMBE

Proof. If Lai  1 for any ti , then La is in fact a feasible attacker strategy in G L . All that is left to
prove is that hd, Lai is in fact an equilibrium. The attacker is best-responding because the utility of
attacking any given target is unchanged for him relative to the equilibrium of G 1 . The defender is
best-responding because the utility of defending any schedule has been multiplied by L relative to
G 1 , and so it is still optimal for the defender to defend the schedules in the support of c.
This lemma immediately gives us the following proposition:
Proposition 4.2. Given a game G L with L attacker resources for which SSAS holds, let G 1 be the
same game except with only one attacker resource. Suppose d is an SSE strategy in both G L and
G 1 . Let a be a strategy for the attacker such that hd, ai is a Nash equilibrium of G 1 (we know that
such an a exists by Corollary 3.9). If Lai  1 for any target ti , then hd, Lai is an NE profile in G L ,
which means d is both an SSE and an NE strategy in G L .
A simple example where Proposition 4.2 applies can be constructed as follows.
Example 1. Suppose there are 3 targets, which are completely interchangeable for both players.
Suppose the defender has 1 resource. If the attacker has 1 resource, the defenders SSE strategy is
d = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) and the attackers NE best-response to d is a = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3). If the attacker
has 2 resources, the defenders SSE strategy is still d. Since for all ti , 2ai  1, Proposition 4.2
applies, and profile hd, 2ai is an NE profile.
We denote the defenders SSE strategy in a game with L attacker resources by cS,L and denote
the defenders NE strategy in the same game by cN ,L . In Example 1, we have cN ,1 = cS,1 =
cS,2 = cN ,2 . Hence, under some conditions, the defenders strategy is always the sameregardless
of whether we use SSE or NE and regardless of whether the attacker has 1 or 2 resources. We will
show several examples of games where this is not true, even though SSAS holds. For each of the
following cases, we will show an example game for which SSAS holds and the relation between
the defenders equilibrium strategies is as specified in the case description. In the first case, the
SSE strategy is equal to the NE strategy for L = 2, but the condition of Proposition 4.2 is not met
because the SSE strategy for L = 1 is different from the SSE strategy for L = 2, and also because
multiplying the attackers NE strategy in the game with L = 1 attacker resource by 2 does not result
in a feasible attackers strategy (in the game that has L = 2 attacker resources but is otherwise the
same). In the last three cases, the SSE strategy is not equal to the NE strategy for L = 2.
 cS,2 = cN ,2 6= cN ,1 = cS,1 (SSE vs. NE makes no difference, but L makes a difference);
 cN ,2 6= cS,2 = cS,1 = cN ,1 (NE with L = 2 is different from the other cases);
 cS,2 6= cN ,2 = cN ,1 = cS,1 (SSE with L = 2 is different from the other cases);
 cS,2 6= cN ,2 ; cS,2 6= cS,1 = cN ,1 ; cN ,2 6= cN ,1 = cS,1 (all cases are different, except SSE
and NE are the same with L = 1 as implied by Corollary 3.9).
It is easy to see that these cases are exhaustive, because of the following. Corollary 3.9 necessitates that cS,1 = cN ,1 (because we want SSAS to hold and each cS,L or cN ,L strategy to be unique),
so there are effectively only three potentially different strategies, cN ,2 , cS,2 , and cS,1 = cN ,1 . They
can either all be the same (as in Example 1 after Proposition 4.2), all different (the last case), or we
can have exactly two that are the same (the first three cases).

We now give the examples. In all our examples, we only have schedules of size 1, and the
defender has a single resource.
Example 2 (cS,2 = cN ,2 6= cN ,1 = cS,1 ). Consider the game shown in Table 7. The defender
has 1 resource. If the attacker has 1 resource, target t1 is attacked with probability 1, and hence
it is defended with probability 1 as well (whether we are in the SSE or NE model). If the attacker
has 2 resources, both targets are attacked, and target t2 is defended because Ud (t2 ) > Ud (t1 )
(whether we are in the SSE or NE model).

the attacker will always attack t1 , and so the defender will defend t1 . With two attacker
resources, the attacker will attack both targets, and in this case the defender prefers to
defend t2 .

1 resource. If the attacker has 1 resource, it follows from Theorem 3.10 that the unique defender

Table 8: The example game for cN ,2 6= cS,2 = cS,1 = cN ,1 . This example corresponds to the
intuition given earlier. Target t1 is a sensitive target for the defender: the defender suffers
a large loss if t1 is attacked. However, if t1 is attacked, then allocating defensive resources
to it does not benefit the defender much, because of the low marginal utility Ud (t1 ) = 1.
As a result, target t1 is not defended in the NE profile h(0, .5, .5), (1, .5, .5)i, but it is
defended in the SSE profile h(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1)i.
Now suppose the attacker has 2 resources. In SSE, the defender wants primarily to avoid an
attack on t1 (so that t2 and t3 are attacked with probability 1 each). Under this constraint, the
defender wants to maximize the total probability on t2 and t3 (they are interchangeable and both
are attacked, so probability is equally valuable on either one). The defender strategy (2/3, 1/6, 1/6)
is the unique optimal solution to this optimization problem.
However, it is straightforward to verify that the following is an NE profile if the attacker has 2
resources: h(0, .5, .5), (1, .5, .5)i. We now prove that this is the unique NE. First, we show that t1
315

fiKORZHYK , Y IN , K IEKINTVELD , C ONITZER , & TAMBE

is defended with probability 0 in any NE. This is because one of the targets t2 , t3 must be attacked
with probability at least .5. Thus, the defender always has an incentive to move probability from
t1 to this target. It follows that t1 is not defended in any NE. Now, if t1 is not defended, then t1 is
attacked with probability 1. What remains is effectively a single-attacker-resource security game on
t2 and t3 with a clear unique equilibrium h(.5, .5), (.5, .5)i, thereby proving uniqueness.
Example 4 (cS,2 6= cN ,2 = cN ,1 = cS,1 ). Consider the game shown in Table 9. The defender has
1 resource. If the attacker has 1 resource, then the defenders unique minimax/NE/SSE strategy is
the minimax strategy (1, 0, 0).
Now suppose the attacker has 2 resources. t1 must be attacked with probability 1. Because
Ud (t1 ) = 2 > 1 = Ud (t2 ) = Ud (t3 ), in NE, this implies that the defender must put her full
probability 1 on t1 . Hence, the attacker will attack t2 with his other resource. So, the unique NE
profile is h(1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0)i.
In contrast, in SSE, the defenders primary goal is to avoid an attack on t2 , which requires
putting probability at least .5 on t2 (so that the attacker prefers t3 over t2 ). This will result in t1
and t3 being attacked; the defender prefers to defend t1 with her remaining probability because
Ud (t1 ) = 2 > 1 = Ud (t3 ). Hence, the unique SSE profile is h(.5, .5, 0), (1, 0, 1)i.

Table 9: The example game for cS,2 6= cN ,2 = cN ,1 = cS,1 . t1 will certainly be attacked by the
attacker, and will hence be more valuable to defend than any other target in NE because
Ud (t1 ) = 2 > 1 = Ud (t2 ) = Ud (t3 ). However, in SSE with two attacker resources,
it is more valuable for the defender to use her resource to prevent an attack on t2 by the
second attacker resource.

Example 5 (cS,2 6= cN ,2 ; cS,2 6= cS,1 = cN ,1 ; cN ,2 6= cN ,1 = cS,1 ). Consider the game in
Table 10. The defender has 1 resource. If the attacker has 1 resource, it follows from Theorem 3.10
that the unique defender minimax/NE/SSE strategy is cS,1 = cN ,1 = (1/6, 2/3, 1/6).
If the attacker has 2 resources, then in SSE, the defenders primary goal is to prevent t1 from
being attacked. This requires putting at least as much defender probability on t1 as on t3 , and will
result in t2 and t3 being attacked. Given that t2 and t3 are attacked, placing defender probability
on t3 is more than twice as valuable as placing it on t2 (Ud (t3 ) = 7, Ud (t2 ) = 3). Hence, even
though for every unit of probability placed on t3 , we also need to place a unit on t1 (to keep t1 from
being attacked), it is still uniquely optimal for the defender to allocate all her probability mass in
this way. So, the unique defender SSE strategy is (.5, 0, .5).
However, it is straightforward to verify that the following is an NE profile if the attacker has
2 resources: h(0, 3/4, 1/4), (1, 7/10, 3/10)i. We now prove that this is the unique NE. First, we
show that t1 is not defended in any NE. This is because at least one of t2 and t3 must be attacked
with probability at least .5, and hence the defender would be better off defending that target instead.

Table 10: The example game for cS,2 6= cN ,2 ; cS,2 6= cS,1 = cN ,1 ; cN ,2 6= cN ,1 = cS,1 . With one
attacker resource, t1 and t3 each get some small probability (regardless of the solution
concept). With two attacker resources, in the unique NE, it turns out not to be worthwhile
to defend t1 at all even though it is always attacked, because Ud (t1 ) is low; in contrast,
in the unique SSE, t1 is defended with relatively high probability to prevent an attack on
it.

Next, we show that t1 is attacked with probability 1 in any NE. If t3 has positive defender probability,
then (because t1 is not defended) t1 is definitely more attractive to attack than t3 , and hence will be
attacked with probability 1. On the other hand, if the defender only defends t2 , then t1 and t3 are
attacked with probability 1. What remains is effectively a single-attacker-resource security game on
t2 and t3 with a clear unique equilibrium h(3/4, 1/4), (7/10, 3/10)i, thereby proving uniqueness.

5. Experimental Results
While our theoretical results resolve the leaders dilemma for many interesting and important classes
of security games, as we have seen, there are still some cases where SSE strategies are distinct from
NE strategies for the defender. One case is when the schedules do not satisfy the SSAS property,
and another is when the attacker has multiple resources. In this section, we conduct experiments to
further investigate these two cases, offering evidence about the frequency with which SSE strategies
differ from all NE strategies across randomly generated games, for a variety of parameter settings.
Our methodology is as follows. For a particular game instance, we first compute an SSE strategy C using the DOBSS mixed-integer linear program (Pita et al., 2008). We then use the linear
feasibility program below to determine whether or not this SSE strategy is part of some NE profile
by attempting to find an appropriate attacker response strategy.

Here Q is the set of attacker pure strategies, which is just the set of targets when there is only one attacker resource. The probability that the attacker plays q is denoted by Aq , which must be between
0 and 1 (Constraint (9)). Constraint (10) forces these probabilities to sum to 1. Constraint (11)
317

fiKORZHYK , Y IN , K IEKINTVELD , C ONITZER , & TAMBE

prevents the attacker from placing positive probabilities on pure strategies that give the attacker a
utility less than the best response utility E(C). In constraints (12) and (13), Z is a variable which
represents the maximum expected utility the defender can get among all pure strategies given the
attackers strategy A, and Cd denotes the probability of playing d in C. These two constraints require the defenders strategy C to be a best response to the attackers mixed strategy. Therefore, any
feasible solution A to this linear feasibility program, taken together with the Stackelberg strategy
C, constitutes a Nash equilibrium. Conversely, if hC, Ai is a Nash equilibrium, A must satisfy all
of the LP constraints.
In our experiment, we varied:
 the number of attacker resources,
 the number of (homogeneous) defender resources,
 the size of the schedules that resources can cover,
 the number of schedules.
For each parameter setting, we generated 1000 games with 10 targets. For each target t, a
pair of defender payoffs (Udc (t), Udu (t)) and a pair of attacker payoffs (Uau (t), Uac (t)) were drawn
uniformly at random from the set {(x, y)  Z2 : x  [10, 10], y  [10, 10], x > y}. In each
game in the experiment, all of the schedules have the same size, except there is also always the
empty scheduleassigning a resource to the empty schedule corresponds to the resource not being
used. The schedules are randomly chosen from the set of all subsets of the targets that have the size
specified by the corresponding parameter.
The results of our experiments are shown in Figure 2. The plots show the percentage of games
in which the SSE strategy is not an NE strategy, for different numbers of defender and attacker
resources, different schedule sizes, and different numbers of schedules. For the case where there
is a single attacker resource and schedules have size 1, the SSAS property holds, and the experimental results confirm our theoretical result that the SSE strategy is always an NE strategy. If we
increase either the number of attacker resources or the schedule size, then we no longer have such a
theoretical result, and indeed we start to see cases where the SSE strategy is not an NE strategy.
Let us first consider the effect of increasing the number of attacker resources. We can see that the
number of games in which the defenders SSE strategy is not an NE strategy increases significantly
as the number of attacker resources increases, especially as it goes from 1 to 2 (note the different
scales on the y-axes). In fact, when there are 2 or 3 attacker resources, the phenomenon that in many
cases the SSE strategy is not an NE strategy is consistent across a wide range of values for the other
parameters.6
Now, let us consider the effect of increasing the schedule size. When we increase the schedule
size (with a single attacker resource), the SSAS property no longer holds because we do not include
the subschedules as schedules, and so we do find some games where the SSE strategy is not an
NE strategybut there are generally few cases (< 6%) of this. Also, as we generate more random
schedules, the number of games where the SSE strategy is not an NE strategy drops to zero. This
is particularly encouraging for domains like FAMS, where the schedule sizes are relatively small (2
6. Of course, if we increase the number of attacker resources while keeping the number of targets fixed, eventually,
every defender SSE strategy will be an NE strategy again, simply because when the number of attacker resources is
equal to the number of targets, the attacker has only one pure strategy available.

parameter settings. Each row corresponds to a different number of attacker resources,
and each column to a different schedule size. The number of defender resources is on the
x-axis, and each number of schedules is plotted separately. For each parameter setting,
1000 random games with 10 targets were generated. The SSAS property holds in the
games with schedule size 1 (shown in column 1); SSAS does not hold in the games with
schedule sizes 2 and 3 (columns 2 and 3).

in most cases), and the number of possible schedules is large relative to the number of targets. The
effect of increasing the number of defender resources is more ambiguous. When there are multiple
attacker resources, increasing the schedule size sometimes increases and sometimes decreases the
number of games where the SSE strategy is not an NE strategy.
The main message to take away from the experimental results appears to be that for the case of
a single attacker resource, SSE strategies are usually also NE strategies even when SSAS does not
hold, which appears to further justify the practice of playing an SSE strategy. On the other hand,
when there are multiple attacker resources, there are generally many cases where the SSE strategy is
not an NE strategy. This strongly poses the question of what should be done in the case of multiple
attacker resources (in settings where it is not clear whether the attacker can observe the defenders
mixed strategy).

6. Uncertainty About the Attackers Ability to Observe: A Model for Future
Research
So far, for security games in which the attacker has only a single resource, we have shown that if
the SSAS property is satisfied, then a Stackelberg strategy is necessarily a Nash equilibrium strategy (Section 3.3). This, combined with the fact that, as we have shown, the equilibria of these
games satisfy the interchangeability property (Section 3.2), provides strong justification for playing
a Stackelberg strategy when the SSAS property is satisfied. Also, our experiments (Section 5) suggest that even when the SSAS property is not satisfied, a Stackelberg strategy is usually a Nash
equilibrium strategy. However, this is not the case if we consider security games where the attacker
has multiple resources.
This leaves the question of how the defender should play in games where the Stackelberg strategy is not necessarily a Nash equilibrium strategy (which is the case in many games with multiple
attacker resources, and also a few games with a single attacker resource where SSAS is not satisfied), especially when it is not clear whether the attacker can observe the defenders mixed strategy.
This is a difficult question that cuts to the heart of the normative foundations of game theory, and
addressing it is beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, given the real-world implications of
this line of research, we believe that it is important for future research to tackle this problem. Rather
than leave the question of how to do so completely open-ended, in this section we propose a model
that may be useful as a starting point for future research. We also provide a result that this model at
least leads to sensible solutions in SSAS games, which, while it is not among the main results in this
paper, does provide a useful sanity check before adopting this model in future research.
In the model that we propose in this section, the defender is uncertain about whether the attacker
can observe the mixed strategy to which the defender commits. Specifically, the game is played as
follows. First, the defender commits to a mixed strategy. After that, with probability pobs , the attacker observes the defenders strategy; with probability 1  pobs , he does not observe the defenders
mixed strategy. Figure 3 represents this model as a larger extensive-form game.7 In this game, first
Nature decides whether the attacker will be able to observe the defenders choice of distribution.
Then, the defender chooses a distribution over defender resource allocations (hence, the defender
has a continuum of possible moves; in particular, it is important to emphasize here that committing to a distribution over allocations is not the same as randomizing over which pure allocation to
commit to, because in the latter case an observing attacker will know the realized allocation). The
defender does not observe the outcome of Natures movehence, it would make no difference if
Nature moved after the defender, but having Nature move first is more convenient for drawing and
discussing the game tree. Finally, the attacker moves (chooses one or more targets to attack): on the
left side of the tree, he does so knowing the distribution to which the defender has committed, and
on the right side of the tree, he does so without knowing the distribution.
Given this extensive-form representation of the situation, a natural approach is to solve for an
equilibrium of this larger game. It is not possible to apply standard algorithms for solving extensiveform games directly to this game, because the tree has infinite size due to the defender choice of
distributions; nevertheless, one straightforward way of addressing this is to discretize the space of
7. At this point, there is a risk of confusion between defender mixed strategies as we have used the phrase so far, and
defender strategies in the extensive-form game. In the rest of this section, to avoid confusion, we will usually refer to
the former as distributions over allocationsbecause, technically, a distribution over allocations is a pure strategy
in the extensive-form game, so that a defender mixed strategy in the extensive-form game would be a distribution
over such distributions.

distributions. An important question, of course, is whether it is the right thing to do to play an
equilibrium of this game. We now state some simple propositions that serve as sanity checks on this
model. First, we show that if pobs = 1, we just obtain the Stackelberg model.
Proposition 6.1. If pobs = 1, then any subgame-perfect equilibrium of the extensive-form game
corresponds to an SSE of the underlying security game.
Proof. We are guaranteed to end up on the left-hand side of the tree, where the attacker observes
the distribution to which the defender has committed; in subgame-perfect equilibrium, he must
best-respond to this distribution. The defender, in turn, must choose her distribution optimally with
respect to this. Hence, the result corresponds to an SSE.
Next, we show that if pobs = 0, we obtain a standard simultaneous-move model.
Proposition 6.2. If pobs = 0, then any Nash equilibrium of the extensive-form game corresponds to
a Nash equilibrium of the underlying security game.
Proof. We are guaranteed to end up on the right-hand side of the tree, where the attacker observes
nothing about the distribution to which the defender has committed. In a Nash equilibrium of the
extensive-form game, the defenders strategy leads to some probability distribution over allocations.
In the attackers information set on the right-hand side of the tree, the attacker can only place positive
probability on actions that are best responses to this distribution over allocations. Conversely, the
defender can only put positive probability on allocations that are best responses to the attackers
distribution over actions. Hence, the result is a Nash equilibrium of the underlying security game.

At intermediate values of pobs , in sufficiently general settings, an equilibrium of the extensiveform game may correspond to neither an SSE or an NE of the basic security game. However,
we would hope that in security games where the Stackelberg strategy is also a Nash equilibrium
strategysuch as the SSAS security games discussed earlier in this paperthis strategy also corresponds to an equilibrium of the extensive-form game. The next proposition shows that this is indeed
the case.
321

fiKORZHYK , Y IN , K IEKINTVELD , C ONITZER , & TAMBE

Proposition 6.3. If in the underlying security game, there is a Stackelberg strategy for the defender
which is also the defenders strategy in some Nash equilibrium, then this strategy is also the defenders strategy in a subgame-perfect equilibrium of the extensive-form game.8
Proof. Suppose that d is a distribution over allocations that is both a Stackelberg strategy and a
Nash equilibrium strategy of the underlying security game. Let aS be the best response that the
attacker plays in the corresponding SSE, and let aN be a distribution over attacker actions such that
hd , aN i is a Nash equilibrium of the security game.
We now show how to construct a subgame-perfect equilibrium of the extensive-form game. Let
the defender commit to the distribution d in her information set. The attackers strategy in the
extensive form is defined as follows. On the left-hand side of the tree, if the attacker observes that
the defender has committed to d , he responds with aS ; if the attacker observes that the defender
has committed to any other distribution over allocations, he responds with some best response to
that distribution. In the information set on the right-hand side of the tree, the attacker plays aN . It
is straightforward to check that the attacker is best-responding to the defenders strategy in every
one of his information sets. All that remains to show is that the defender is best-responding to the
attackers strategy in the extensive-form game. If the defender commits to any other distribution d0 ,
this cannot help her on the left side of the tree relative to d , because d is a Stackelberg strategy; it
also cannot help her on the right side of the tree, because d is a best response to aN . It follows that
the defender is best-responding, and hence we have identified a subgame-perfect equilibrium of the
game.
This proposition can immediately be applied to SSAS games:
Corollary 6.4. In security games that satisfy the SSAS property (and have a single attacker resource), if d is a Stackelberg strategy of the underlying security game, then it is also the defenders
strategy in a subgame-perfect equilibrium of the extensive-form game.
Proof. This follows immediately from Proposition 6.3 and Corollary 3.9.
Of course, Proposition 6.3 also applies to games in which SSAS does not hold but the Stackelberg
strategy is still a Nash equilibrium strategywhich was the case in many of the games in our
experiments in Section 5. In general, of course, if the SSAS property does not hold, the Stackelberg
strategy may not be a Nash equilibrium strategy in the underlying security game; if so, the defenders
strategies in equilibria of the extensive-form game may correspond to neither Stackelberg nor Nash
strategies in the underlying security game. If that is the case, then some other method can be used
to solve the extensive-form game directlyfor example, discretizing the space of distributions for
the attacker and then applying a standard algorithm for solving for an equilibrium of the resulting
game. The latter method will not scale very well, and we leave the design of better algorithms for
future research.

7. Additional Related Work
In the first few sections of this paper, we discussed recent uses of game theory in security domains,
the formal model of security games, and how this model differs from existing classes of games such

322

fiS TACKELBERG VS . NASH IN S ECURITY G AMES

as strategically zero-sum and unilaterally competitive games. We discuss additional related work in
this section.
There has been significant interest in understanding the interaction of observability and commitment in general Stackelberg games. Bagwells early work (1995) questions the value of commitment
to pure strategies given noisy observations by followers, but the ensuing and on-going debate illustrated that the leader retains her advantage in case of commitment to mixed strategies (van Damme
& Hurkens, 1997; Huck & Muller, 2000). Guth, Kirchsteiger, and Ritzberger (1998) extend these
observations to n-player games. Maggi (1998) shows that in games with private information, the
leader advantage appears even with pure strategies. There has also been work on the value of commitment for the leader when observations are costly (Morgan & Vardy, 2007).
Several examples of applications of Stackelberg games to model terrorist attacks on electric
power grids, subways, airports, and other critical infrastructure were described by Brown et al.
(2005) and Sandler and Arce M. (2003). Drake (1998) and Pluchinsky (2005) studied different
aspects of terrorist planning operations and target selection. These studies indicate that terrorist
attacks are planned with a certain level of sophistication. In addition, a terrorist manual shows that
a significant amount of information used to plan such attacks is collected from public sources (U.S.
Department of Justice, 2001). Zhuang and Bier (2010) studied reasons for secrecy and deception
on the defenders side. A broader interest in Stackelberg games is indicated by applications in other
areas, such as network routing and scheduling (Korilis, Lazar, & Orda, 1997; Roughgarden, 2004).
In contrast with all this existing research, our work focuses on real-world security games, illustrating subset, equivalence, interchangeability, and uniqueness properties that are non-existent in
general Stackelberg games studied previously. Of course, results of this general nature date back to
the beginning of game theory: von Neumanns minimax theorem (1928) implies that in two-player
zero-sum games, equilibria are interchangeable and an optimal SSE strategy is also a minimax /
NE strategy. However, as we have discussed earlier, the security games we studied are generally
not zero-sum games, nor are they captured by more general classes of games such as strategically
zero-sum (Moulin & Vial, 1978) or unilaterally competitive (Kats & Thisse, 1992) games.
Tennenholtz (2002) studies safety-level strategies. With two players, a safety-level (or maximin)
strategy for player 1 is a mixed strategy that maximizes the expected utility for player 1, under the
assumption that player 2 acts to minimize player 1s expected utility (rather than maximize his own
utility). Tennenholtz shows that under some conditions, the utility guaranteed by a safety-level
strategy is equal or close to the utility obtained by player 1 in Nash equilibrium. This may sound
reminiscent of our result that Nash strategies coincide with minimax strategies, but in fact the results
are quite different: in particular, for non-zero-sum games, maximin and minimax strategies are not
identical. The following example gives a simple game for which our result holds, but the safety-level
strategy does not result in a utility that is close to the equilibrium solution.
Example 6. Consider the game shown in Table 11. Each player has 1 resource. In this game,
the safety-level (maximin) strategy for the defender is to place her resource on target 2, thereby
guaranteeing herself a utility of at least 2. However, the attacker has a dominant strategy to
attack target 1 (so that if the defender actually plays the safety-level strategy, she can expect utility
1). On the other hand, in the minimax/Stackelberg/Nash solution, she will defend target 1 and
receive utility 0.
Kalai (2004) studies the idea that as the number of players of a game grows, the equilibria
become robust to certain changes in the extensive form, such as which players move before which

other ones, and what they learn about each others actions. At a high level this is reminiscent of our
results, in the sense that we also show that for a class of security games, a particular choice between
two structures of the game (one player committing to a mixed strategy first, or both players moving
at the same time) does not affect what the defender should play (though the attackers strategy is
affected). However, there does not seem to be any significant technical similarityour result relies
on the structure of this class of security games and not on the number of players becoming large
(after all, we only consider games with two players).
Pita, Jain, Ordonez, Tambe et al. (2009) provide experimental results on observability in Stackelberg games: they test a variety of defender strategies against human players (attackers) who choose
their optimal attack when provided with limited observations of the defender strategies. Results
show the superiority of a defenders strategy computed assuming human anchoring bias in attributing a probability distribution over the defenders actions. This research complements our
paper, which provides new mathematical foundations. Testing the insights of our research with
the experimental paradigm of Pita, Jain, Ordonez, Tambe et al. (2009) with expert players, is an
interesting topic for future research.

8. Summary
This paper is focused on a general class of defender-attacker Stackelberg games that are directly
inspired by real-world security applications. The paper confronts fundamental questions of how a
defender should compute her mixed strategy. In this context, this paper provides four key contributions. First, exploiting the structure of these security games, the paper shows that the Nash equilibria in security games are interchangeable, thus alleviating the defenders equilibrium selection
problem for simultaneous-move games. Second, resolving the defenders dilemma, it shows that
under the SSAS restriction on security games, any Stackelberg strategy is also a Nash equilibrium
strategy; and furthermore, this strategy is unique in a class of security games of which ARMOR is
a key exemplar. Third, when faced with a follower that can attack multiple targets, many of these
properties no longer hold, providing a key direction for future research. Fourth, our experimental
results emphasize positive properties of security games that do not fit the SSAS property. In practical
terms, these contributions imply that defenders in applications such as ARMOR (Pita et al., 2008)
and IRIS (Tsai et al., 2009) can simply commit to SSE strategies, thus helping to resolve a major
dilemma in real-world security applications.
