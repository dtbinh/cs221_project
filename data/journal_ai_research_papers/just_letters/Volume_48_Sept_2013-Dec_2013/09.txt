defeasible inheritance networks are a non monotonic framework that deals with hierarchical knowledge  on the other hand  rational closure is acknowledged as a landmark of the
preferential approach to non monotonic reasoning  we will combine these two approaches
and dene a new non monotonic closure operation for propositional knowledge bases that
combines the advantages of both  then we redene such a procedure for description logics

provide a simple reasoning method that is built on top of the classical entailment relation
and  thus  is amenable of an implementation based on existing reasoners  eventually  we
evaluate our approach on well known landmark test examples 

   introduction
the notion of rational closure  lehmann   magidor        is acknowledged as a landmark
for non monotonic reasoning due to its rm logical properties  but it has limited inference
capabilities  e g  an exceptional class will not inherit any of the typical properties from its
superclass  consider penguins  they are atypical birds  since they do not y  but they still
share a lot of typical properties of birds  e g  they have wings  however  under rational
closure we may not infer that penguins have wings  on the other hand  defeasible inheritance networks  ins   horty        are a non monotonic framework appropriate for the
formalisation of hierarchical knowledge that does not have such a limitation  but exhibit
questionable logical properties  see section      
we combine these two approaches and dene a new non monotonic closure operation
for propositional knowledge bases that combines the advantages of both  and then we apply
the method to description logics  dls   baader  calvanese  mcguinness  nardi    patelschneider         a family of logics that are known to be well suited to model structured

   in section   we propose a new method to reason about ins that relies on the procedure for rational closure  and we present a boolean extension of ins  called boolean
defeasible inheritance networks  bins  
   using bins  we develop in section   a defeasible inheritance based propositional closure
that combines the advantages of both inheritance nets and rational closure 
   eventually  in section   we apply the latter procedure to the case of defeasible inheritancebased description logics 
a major feature of the procedures we propose is that for propositional logic and dls
we still maintain all desired logical properties of rational closure  but with more inferential
power with respect to exceptional classes  moreover our method requires only the existence
of a decision procedure for classical entailment and  thus  can be implemented on top of
existing propositional sat solvers and dl reasoners 
please note that the present paper is a substantially revised and extended version of a
previous work  casini   straccia         specically 
   we provide an in depth description of our reasoning model 
   we extensively validate our approach w r t  to a series of landmark  test  examples
illustrated by horty        and sandewall         see appendix a  
   we provide computational complexity results related to our reasoning procedures  and
   we include the proofs supporting out major claims  see appendix b   due to the
complexity of the notation  we add also a table summarising the meaning of the
symbols we use more frequently  appendix c

we refer to two main approaches to non monotonic reasoning  inheritance networks on one
hand and the preferential approach on the other 
inheritance networks have been developed as a formalism for reasoning about taxonomic
information  from the original ideas of touretzky         the approach has richly developed

and sandewall        have more recently contributed to the eld  in particular  in order
to evaluate our proposal  we shall refer to the skeptical approach described by horty       
      as the landmark of the classical approach to inheritance networks 
on the other hand  lehmann and magidors rational closure falls into the preferential
approach to non monotonic reasoning  such an approach  since the rst formulation by
shoham         has become a main representative of non monotonic reasoning  kraus

and giordano et al             b   as they address the application of the preferential methods into the dl framework  but they do not refer to rational closure  in a previous publication  casini   straccia        we present a procedure to apply rational closure to dls  and
such a procedure is at the basis of our actual proposal  but here we modify the approach in
order to amplify its inferential power 

   preliminaries
for completeness  we start with the basic notions about ins and propositional rational
closure we shall rely on 
    defeasible inheritance networks
in ins  horty        sandewall        there are classes  nodes   a strict subsumption relation
and a defeasible subsumption relation among such classes  links   we shall indicate nodes
by letters p  q        and we shall describe an in by a pair n   hs  u i  where s is a set of
strict links  while u is a set of defeasible links  every link in n is a direct link  and it can
be strict or defeasible  positive or negative  specically 
   p  q  class p is subsumed by class q  positive strict link  
   p   q  class p and class q are disjoint  negative strict link  
   p  q  an element of the class p is usually an element of the class q  positive defeasible
link  
   p   q  an element of the class p is usually not an element of the class q  negative
defeasible link  
example      the typical penguin example could be represented as n   h p  b    p  
f  b  f  b  w i  reading b as bird  p as penguin  f as flying and w as has wings 
in the presence of strict links only  the subsumption relation between the classes would
correspond simply to a transitive closure of the links  if p is subsumed by q and q is
subsumed by r  then p is subsumed by r  instead  the presence of defeasible links implies
the possibility of potential inconsistencies in the hierarchy of classes  as in the penguin
example  a transitive closure of the subsumption relation would force us to conclude at
the same time that penguins are ying and non ying creatures  hence reasoning with
inheritance networks consists mainly in deciding which conclusions have to be considered
valid when faced with potential contradictions  in most of the classical approaches such
decisions are based on the notions of potential path and preemption  a procedure that 
given two conicting paths  allows to choose the one resting on more specic information 
invalidating the other   among the various proposals  we shall briey present hortys       
   

ficasini   straccia

classical approach  to which we shall refer as a landmark  first  we recall the notion of path
that is shared by all the classical approaches to ins  we refer to the paths by means of
greek letters                   or with tuples indicating the sequence of the nodes involved 
for example  the triple    hp    qi indicates a path  that starts from the node p  passes
through the path   and ends into the node q 
definition      potential paths  horty        p        given a net n   hs  u i  we can
define iteratively its paths  where   k      and    k           
 every direct link in n is a simple path 
 if p   k q  s  hp  qi is a positive path 
 if p    k q  s  hp  qi is a negative path 
 assume a path    ht    pi 
 if  is positive 
 if p   k q  s  h  qi is a positive path 
 if p    k q  s  h  qi is a negative path 
 if  is negative 
 if q  p  s  h  qi is a negative path 
if a path is composed only by strict links  it is a strict path  otherwise it is a defeasible
one 
a potential path represents a potential argumentation  and we have to decide if it is
valid or not  if the path is strict  it is automatically considered as valid  otherwise  in case
of potential conicts between the conclusions of distinct defeasible paths  we have to choose
which ones of them have to be considered as valid 
using the notions of path and preemption  horty denes an iterative construction of
an extension of a net  that is  of the set of the paths considered valid in the net  due to
the complexity of the formal denition  we describe just roughly the procedure  referring to
hortys work        sect      for a better insight 
the inductive construction of the paths is based on a notion of degree of paths  once
we have identied the potential paths  we can dene also a notion of generalised path  that
is  a generalisation of defeasible paths that  given                 is dened as 
   every direct link is a generalised path 
   if    h  pi is a generalised path  and p  q  n   then h  qi is a generalised path 
we associate to every defeasible path hp    qi a number that corresponds to the number
of links in the longest generalised path between p and q  denoted as degn  hp    qi  
in inheritance nets  the notion of contradiction corresponds to the notion of conflict 
we say that a path is conicted if there is another path with the same starting and end
points  but opposite polarity  i e   we have two potential paths moving from a node p to a
   we assume the link   to be symmetric  that is  if p   q  s  then q   p  s too

node q  but one is positive while the other is negative   if we are dealing with strict paths 
the presence of a conict points out an actual contradiction  while  dealing with defeasible
paths  the contradiction is just potential and could be resolved by the notion of preemption
 horty        def         that allows to prefer the path relying on more specic information 
in the procedure dened by horty we start with a net n   and  working iteratively on the
degree of the paths  we dene a sequence of pairs hn   pi i  where pi is the set of the paths
considered valid at the i th step  in brief  given a net n   hs  u i  hortys procedure results
into the construction of a sequence of sets of valid paths p    p    p          where 
   p    n   and
   pn   is pn united with all the paths of degree n     and that are the extension of a
valid path of degree n and that preempt all the eventual conicting paths 
s
the skeptical extension of a net n is dened by 
n   pn  horty        sect        and
        to indicate that a  positive or negative  strict or defeasible  connection between two
nodes p and q is considered valid in hortys skeptical extension we write n

extension of the net composed of the valid paths p  b  p   f  b  f  b  w  p  b  w

    propositional rational closure
non monotonic systems can be analysed from the point of view of the properties of the consequence relations they dene  makinson         from such a perspective ins do not satisfy
some desirable logical properties  presented below  such as  cm  and  ct   makinson       
pp         
even if the satisfaction of the structural properties we are going to present is not unanimously considered as a necessary condition for a formalization of defeasible reasoning 
since most of the interesting nonmonotonic logics do not satisfy some of them  we still consider their satisfaction as a desiderata  such properties are intuitive and give back a strong
logical characterization of the consequence relation  they have a solid semantic characterization based on preferential interpretation  kraus et al         lehmann   magidor        
and have strong connections to the classic agm approach to belief revision  alchourron 
gardenfors    makinson         moreover the decision problem can be often reduced to
a procedure based on the classical decision problem  as in the proposal we are going to
present  allowing to implement the procedure on top of existing reasoners  and the systems
based on the preferential approach rarely give back counter intuitive results  the main
problems are that the inferential power of such approaches is often too weak  we can often
point out conclusions that we would like to obtain  but that the system is not able to derive   and that the preferential approach has been developed for propositional logics  and
the attempts to extend it to rst order languages have turned out to be quite problematic 
   

ficasini   straccia

the proposal we are going to present tries to overcome such inferential weaknesses  characteristic of the classical preferential approaches  after presenting it for the propositional
languages  we readapt the procedure to the expressivity of dls since  even if the preferential approach cannot be easily reformulated for rst order logics  it turns out to be still
appropriate for fragments of rst order logic as dls 
in what follows  we shall present a procedure for building the rational closure of a
knowledge base using the default assumption approach  poole        makinson         such
an approach reduces the construction of the rational closure into a series of checks based on
the classical consequence relations  the procedure we are presenting heavily relies on the
one by freund        
specically  consider a classical propositional language built on a nite set of propositional letters p    p            pn    using the classical connectives           sentences will
be denoted by capital letters c  d  e        while sets of sentences by capital greek letters
           and  and  will have the usual meaning of true and false  in the knowledge
bases  we shall indicate consequential information by means of c  d and c d  respectively strict and defeasible conditionals  that have to be read respectively as if c  then
always d and if c  then typically d   denotes the classical entailment relation  and 
given a set of formulae  or a set of strict conditionals t   we indicate by  and t the
monotonic entailment relations obtained adding to   respectively  the set of propositional
formulae  or the set of conditionals  c    d   c  d  t   as extra information  we shall
use   also to indicate a generic non monotonic consequence relation 
the knowledge base  kb  of an agent can be represented by means of conditionals or
by means of formulae  we call conditional knowledge base a pair ht   di  where t is a nite
set of strict conditionals and d is a nite set of defeasible conditionals 
example      the penguin example can be encoded as  k   ht   di with t    p  b  and
d    p f  b f  b w  
another way to formalize defeasible information may be based simply on formulae  using
the default assumption approach  a default assumption knowledge base is a pair h  i 
where  and  are sets of formulae representing respectively what the agent considers as
necessarily true and as typically true 
example      the penguin example could be encoded as  k   h  i with     p  b 
and     b  f  p  f  b  w  
we shall use the greek letter  to distinguish default assumption formulae  i e   the
members of    we next show how to map a conditional knowledge base into a defaultassumption knowledge base  we will transform kbs of the kind of the one in example    
into kbs of the kind in example       and then we show a simple procedure to reason within
the latter  by relying only on a decision procedure for    
we proceed as follows   i  we dene the notions of rational consequence relation and
rational closure   ii  then  we describe a procedure to build a rational closure using a
default assumption knowledge base

the rst six properties   ref  or   characterise the class of the preferential consequence relations  that is  given a conditional base
d    c   e            cn  en    
we say that a conditional c d is in the preferential closure p d  i it is derivable from
d using the rules  ref  or   kraus et al          however  the preferential closure is
generally considered inferentially too weak to be satisfactory  and so it is natural to look
for stronger forms of closure 
the closure under the rule  rm  is considered  between the interesting rules  the
strongest one  however  given the form of such a rule  we have a negated conditional
between the premises   the rational extension of a conditional base d is not unique  indeed 
we have multiple possibilities to close d under such a condition  for example  if we have
d    c f    then neither c  d f nor c d are in d and we can choose to add to
d either of them in order to satisfy  rm   moreover  as this simple example shows  it is
possible that the consequence relation obtained from the intersection of dierent rational
extensions of a knowledge base does not satisfy  rm  anymore  in this particular case  the
intersection would not contain neither c  d f nor c d   hence  to dene a rational
closure for a conditional base d  we have to choose one between the possible rational extensions of d  lehmann and magidor have dened a rational closure operation r that satises
a set of desiderata  lehmann   magidor        sect           
   p d   r d   that is  the conditional base d and every conditional preferentially
derivable from it should be in the rational closure of d

every conditional of form  c   c  r d  i  c  p d   the conditionals of

form c  dene what situations are simply considered impossible  while the conditionals of form  c indicate what is considered typical in general  both such kinds
of information are properly managed by the preferential closure 
   if we have that c f  p d   c d  c d f 
  p d   we prefer a closure operation
adding c  d f instead of c d  the sense of a rule as  rm  is to employ a constrained form of monotonicity  given c f   we add c  d f    not to arbitrarily add
new defaults  the addition of c d   hence  whenever possible  given a conditional
c f we want to consider its strengthening c  d f instead of the unmotivated
addition of a conditional c d 
we shall not describe lehmann and magidors rational closure by referring to the original
formulation  lehmann   magidor         instead  we shall directly refer to a correspondent
construction  heavily relying on the procedure dened by freund         and based on the
translation of a conditional kb into a default assumption kb  which we illustrate next 
we start with a conditional kb k   ht   di  the rst steps  steps      are to dene
an exceptionality ranking for all the conditionals in the kb  following the analogous procedure by lehmann and magidor         such a ranking will permit to distinguish correctly
the strict and the defeasible knowledge contained in the kb  step     since part of the
strict knowledge could be implicitly contained in d  this will allow us to construct the
correspondent default assumption kb  steps       specically 
step    we translate the strict knowledge into defeasible conditionals  that is  we move
from a kb ht   di to h  d  i  where
d    d   c  d    c  d  t    
intuitively  in the preferential setting  saying that c  d is valid is equivalent to
saying that its negation is an absurdity   c  d     bochman        sect       
step    we dene d  as the set of the materialisations of the conditionals in d    i e   the
material implications corresponding to such conditionals 
d     c  d   c d  d     
also  we indicate by ad the set of the antecedents of the conditionals in d   
ad    c   c d  d     
step    we dene an exceptionality ranking of the conditionals in d   lehmann   magidor        sect        we build such a ranking on the following notion of exceptionality 
given a set of conditionals d  a formula c is exceptional for d i d preferentially
entails  c  i e    c  p d    recall that a conditional  c  r d  i  c 
p d  
a conditional c d is said to be exceptional for d i its antecedent c is exceptional for d  the exceptionality of a proposition can be decided based on    only
 lehmann   magidor        corol         as c is exceptional for a set of conditionals
   

fidefeasible inheritance based description logics

d  i e    c  p d   i d    c  where d is the set of the materialisations of the
conditionals in d 
let e ad   indicate the set of the antecedents that result exceptional w r t  d  that is
e ad      c  ad   d    c   
and with e d  the exceptional conditionals in d  i e  
e d     c d  d   c  e ad     
obviously  for every d  e d   d 
step      taking under consideration the knowledge base h  d  i  we can construct
iteratively a sequence e    e        of subsets of the conditional base d  in the following way 
e    d 
ei     e ei    
since d  is a nite set  the construction will terminate with an  empty or nonempty  xed point of e  i e   a set composed only of exceptional conditionals 
which materialisations negate all their own antecedents 
step      using such a sequence  we dene a ranking function r that associates to
every conditional in d  a number  representing its own level of exceptionality 
r c d   



i
if c d  ei and c d 
  ei  
 if c d  ei for every i  

step    in step   we have dened the materialisation of d  and the rank of every conditional in it  now 
step      we can determine if d  is inconsistent  a conditional base d is inconsistent if from it we can derive the conditional    we know from above that a
conditional of the form  c is in the rational closure of d i it is in its preferential closure  that is  given the result recalled in step      we can check the
consistency of d  using d       p d    i d      
step      if d  is consistent  we dene the background theory te of the agent as 
te      c   c d  d  and r c d       

moreover  one may verify that for every conditional in t there is a logically
equivalent conditional in te  

   one may easily verify the correctness of this definition referring to results in the work of bochman
       sect         definition        the definition of clash on p      corollary        definition        and
lemma         it suffices to show that the set of the conditionals with  as ranking value represents
the greatest clash of d  the proof is quite immediate by the definition of the exceptionality ranking

example      consider again the case of the penguin  with the knowledge base of example      first  step    we move the strict knowledge in t into the defeasible part  obtaining

then  step   we define the set of the materialisations
d     p  b    p  f  b  f  b  w   
and the correspondent set of antecedents
ad    p  b  b  p   

we use the set of materialisations d  to determine the ranking value of the formulae in

    r b    r b f     r b w 
    r p    r p f  
   r p  b    r p  b    
so  step    we define a conditional base

 since in this case the strict and the defeasible part of the conditional base were correctly

using such default information  we conclude  step   that penguins do not fly  birds fly
and birds have wings 
remark    considering example      it would be intuitive also to conclude that penguins
have wings  p w   but in the rational closure a category that is recognized as atypical  as the
category of penguins in the present case  they are birds  but they dont fly  and consequently
r p        cannot inherit any of the typical characteristics of their super classes  hence we
are not allowed to conclude that  presumably  penguins have wings  such a weak inferential
power is generally considered the main limit of the rational closure  on the other hand  as
we are going to see in the next section  ins manage successfully this kind of problems 
this procedure to determine the rational closure maintains the same computational
complexity as the classical decision procedure  since it is easily veried that all the transformations in    require at most o  k   entailment tests and  given also proposition    
and the fact that the strict part can encode any  monotone  propositional theory  we have
that
proposition      deciding propositional defeasible consequence under rational closure      
is conp complete 
lehmann and magidor        specify also a semantic characterization of the propositional rational closure  and an alternative correspondent construction has been recently
presented by giordano et al       a   if we move from propositional logic to dls  a version
of rational closure for the language alc has previously been proposed  casini   straccia 
       and such a procedure can be semantically characterized by means of preferential dl
interpretations  britz  casini  meyer  moodley    varzinczak        
as seen above  rational closure denes a non monotonic consequence relation with an intuitive behaviour and strong logical properties  however  as by remark    it is also somewhat
weak  as often there are conclusions about exceptional situations that  despite intuitive  we
cannot derive  such a behaviour is due to the fact that the procedure associates to a set of
premises only those conditionals that are at least as exceptional 
next  we are going to rene rational closure in order to avoid such a loss of inferential
power w r t  exceptional premises  our proposal is based on a modication of the initial
knowledge base  we add new conditionals that give information about exceptional cases that
   

fidefeasible inheritance based description logics

would be lost in the rational closure procedure  such a renement is obtained using again
the ranking procedure  but applying it locally  that is  in order to decide if a conditional
c d has to be added to our kb we apply the same procedure as in rational closure  but
we consider only the information that is relevant to the inferential connection between c
and d  for example  assume a knowledge base composed only of the set of conditionals
d    p q  q r  q t  p t   now  following the procedure for rational closure we obtain
that p is an exceptional proposition  the only one  and so we cannot derive neither p r nor
p t  but  while we do not want to derive p t  as we already have p t  intuitively we
do not have any reason to avoid the conclusion p r  in fact  such a conclusion would be
desirable  since p is a q  and p being an r does not generate any conict with the rest of the
information in the knowledge base 
so  our aim is to specify a way to decide which information in the kb is relevant
w r t  a particular connection  in the above case  p r   in order to determine such a local
relatedness we are going to consider ins  we use their graphical characterisation in order
to identify the relevant information w r t  the connection we want to investigate  and then
we apply the ranking procedure to the pieces of information recognised as relevant 

   boolean defeasible inheritance networks
here we present a new decision procedures for ins  based on classical propositional decisions 
that  in addition to being a main step in the nonmonotonic construction we are going to
present later on  turns out to be an interesting in decision procedure per se 
in the following  we proceed as follows  at rst  we dene a procedure for ins  and then
we map it into propositional logic  obtaining the desired renement of rational closure 
    exceptionality levels in inheritance nets
our rst aim is to apply to ins a modied version of the decision procedure for rational
closure  we do this in order to dene a method for deciding validity in ins that rely on
propositional calculus so to allow easily  i  to extend such a method in order to include into
the language also the propositional connectives       and  ii  to integrate it with rational
closure  in order to extend the inferential power of rational closure without compromising
its logical properties  a non negligible side product is that it is a propositional sat based
reasoning procedure 
we shall briey review the case of purely strict nets showing that this case is easily
manageable using propositional calculus  and then we shall focus on mixed nets 
      strict nets
for the strict part of the nets we want to obtain the same valid connections as in all classical
proposals  if a net is composed only of strict links  i e   n   hs  i  its valid connections and
its consistency can be easily checked using propositional calculus  indeed  dene a classical
propositional language  using the nodes in n as propositional letters  call pn such a set
of propositional letters   and  and  as connectives  and translate the set of links s into
the set of the corresponding propositional implications
    p  q   p  q  s    p  q   p   q  s   
   

ficasini   straccia

we indicate by l a literal in   being a literal a propositional letter or its negation   and
we dene a as the set of the antecedents of the implications in   that is
a    p   p  l     
then we can derive the valid paths using  and classical consequence relation     
proposition      consider a net n   hs  i and translate it into a set of propositional
implications   the following properties hold 
   if n is a consistent net  there is a valid strict positive  resp   negative  path hp    qi
from p to q  that is n
p  q  resp   n
p   q   iff   p  q  resp     p  q  
   n is inconsistent iff   p for some p  a  
   deciding strict consequence can be done in polynomial time 
so we can treat the decision problem in strict nets by means of classical propositional
calculus  obtaining exactly the same valid strict paths as in the classical approaches to nets 
note that there is a dierence in the notion of inconsistency between ins and propositional logic  as seen in section      a net is considered inconsistent if there is a node p
that  simultaneously  is positively and negatively connected to another node q  p is and
is not  simultaneously  a subclass of q  in the inheritance nets  such a situation is interpreted as a contradiction  while in the propositional logic the correspondent situation
      p  q    p  q   would just force the negation of the propositional letter  i e  
node  p    p   that would correspond to saying that no individual can fall under the
class p 
      mixed nets
now we consider nets with both strict and defeasible links  in what follows we will assume
that the strict part of a net n   hs  u i is inferentially closed  that is  if n
p  q  resp  
if n
p   q  then p  q  s  resp  p   q  s  
our procedure diers from the classical approaches to ins mainly because it is not based
on the notion of potential path  instead  we translate the nets links into propositional
formulae  and then we build an exceptionality ranking using a procedure that is similar to
the one dened for rational closure  the main dierence with the procedure dened for
rational closure lays on the local characterization of the exceptionality rankings  to check
if there is a valid connection between a pair of nodes p and q we proceed in dening an
exceptionality ranking of the nodes  however  we do not consider all the nodes in the net 
but only those related to p and q  such a relation is determined by means of the notion
of course  that is a generalisation of the potential path 
roughly  courses are simply routes on the net following the direction of the arrows 
without considering if each of them is a positive or a negative arrow 
definition      course   courses are defined as follows  where               
   note that strict links can be encoded as   cnf formulae  also called krom formulae  and that the
propositional   sat problem is in p  

   

fidefeasible inheritance based description logics

   every link p  q in n is a course    hp  qi in n   and
   if    h  qi is a course and q  r is a link in n that does not already appear in  
then     h  ri is a course in n  
the omission of repetitions in courses is needed to guarantee the niteness of courses
even if the net contains cycles  so  given a net n dened by a nite number of links  there
is only a nite set c n of courses  that  in turn  are nite sequences of nodes  we denote
n the set of all the courses in n going from node p to the node q  i e  
with cp q
n
cp q
     c n      hp      qi for some      

we next provide a procedure that denes the validity of a defeasible connection between
two nodes p and q  via a mapping into propositional logic  given a net n   hs  u i  we
dene a correspondent knowledge base
kn   hn   n i  
where
n    p  q   p  q  s    p  q   p   q  s 
and
n    p  q   p  q  u     p  q   p   q  u    
in the following  we may omit n if it is clear from the context 
we dene an exceptionality ranking of the nodes  that depends on the decision problem
with respect to p and q only  
so  let
p q    r  t   r  t      cp q   
 r  t   r   t      cp q    
and consider the set of relative antecedents  l being a literal 
ap q    a   a  l  n  p q    
in the following  n will denote the supra classical entailment relation obtained adding
to  the set of propositional formulae n as extra axioms  for the strict part of the net  if
p n q  resp   p n q   then we say that q  resp   q  follows strictly from p in n   and
we indicate it by p n q  resp   p n q  
on the other hand   n will indicate the inference relation for the defeasible part  that
is  p n q has to be read as a member of the class p is typically also a member of the class
q in n   analogously for p n q in the negative case 
   this is the main difference w r t  the procedure for propositional rational closure  while there we rank
all the information in the kb at once  here we rank only the information related to the connection we
are interested in  between p and q 

   

ficasini   straccia

now  we use n and p q to determine the exceptionality level  if we are investigating the connection between p and q  a node in ap q is exceptional if it is negated by the
information contained in  and p q  compare with step     in section      
e ap q      a  ap q   p q n a 
e p q      a  b  p q   a  e ap q     
therefore  like step     of section      we build a sequence
    ap q
i   e i     
and the corresponding sequence
e    p q
ei   e ei     
since ap q and p q are nite  and for every i i  i   and ei    ei   the sequences
terminate with an  empty or non empty  xed point of the function e  as in section     
dene now a ranking function  like step      r that associates to every implication in
p q a number  representing its level of exceptionality 
rp q  a    i if a  i and a 
  i  
rp q  a     if a  i for all i
rp q  a  b    i if  a  b   ei and  a  b  
  ei  
rp q  a  b     if  a  b   ei for all i  
clearly  r a  b    r a  for every a  b  p q   in the following  we assume that we
do not obtain any node with a ranking value of   that is  the function e terminates with
an empty set   we will see later on  proposition      that in this latter case the net is
inconsistent 
b p q of the implications a  b  p q that are at least as
we now consider the set 
exceptional as p 
b p q    a  b  p q   r a  b   r p    


and eventually dene

b p q  p  q
p n q i 
n
b
p n q i p q n p  q  

in the language of the nets  we indicate the inference relation generated by such a
procedure by the symbol    that is 
n



p  q i

p n q

p  q i

so  given n   hs  u i and a pair of nodes hp  qi  our inference procedure for ins can be
summarised as follows 
   

fidefeasible inheritance based description logics

   close s under strict validity 
   check if there is a direct  and hence valid  link in n connecting p to q  if there is 
the connection is valid  otherwise  proceed 
   determine the set cp q of the courses in n connecting p to q  map the links in s and
cp q into the sets of implications  and p q   dene the set ap q of the antecedents of
the implications in   p q  
   determine the ranking value of every proposition in ap q and every implication in
p q

   dene the set

example      consider the nixon diamond  see figure     where n is nixon  r is republican  q is quaker  and p is pacifist  it is another classical problem in nonmonotonic
reasoning  that is similar to the previous one but we are not informed if a path is more
specific of the other  while above the link p  b tells us that the information about the
penguins is more specific than the information about the birds   so  we do not want neither

the knowledge base k corresponding to the net is composed of

ficasini   straccia

so  even if in many situations the results of the two approaches are the same  we can
obtain dierent results with them  such dierent outcomes are mainly due to a dierence in
how conicts are interpreted  consider example      where we have an unresolved conict
between two paths from p to f   that is  no one of the two paths preempts the other  and so
none of them can be considered as valid  both in hortys and in our approach  in hortys
interpretation  such a conict prevents also the construction of paths starting at p and
passing through f   in order to be constructible a path has to be built augmenting a valid
shorter path  and thus we cannot construct any path starting from p and passing through
f  horty        def          so  an unresolved conict totally eliminates the possibility to
consider such paths in more ample argumentations  where they could play some role  on
the other hand  in our approach we are not so radical about conicts  the fact that we
cannot conclude neither p  f nor p   f does not eliminate the possibility that in the
actual world one of such connections is true  simply we do not have enough information to
decide  the possibility of p  f to be eectively valid invites us to take under consideration
such a potential argumentation in moving from p to b  so  looking for a connection between
p and b in example      while horty cannot consider the path hp  c  t  f  bi  avoiding the
rise of a conict with the path hp  e  bi  in our approach we still consider the possibility
for hp  c  t  f i to be eectively true  allowing the path hp  c  t  f  bi to play a role in deciding
whether there is a valid connection between p and b  in such a way we have a potential
conict with hp  e  bi that prevents the validity of the latter  for other signicant examples
of our approach see appendix a 
notice that  even if it is built on the notion of courses  our procedure respects the
classical notion of potential path  that is  every valid connection corresponds to a potential
path on the net  denition      
proposition      consider a net n   for every connection p n q  resp   p n q  validated
by our procedure  there is a corresponding positive  resp   negative  potential path from p to
q in the net n  
      inference relation

the meaning of the properties is still the same as the propositional case  simply readapted
to the expressivity of the ins  the net represents the information at our disposal  the
premises of the derivation  and the links are the informational atoms of our language 
   with            n   a  b in the premises indicates the addition of the direct link a  b to the net n  
   indicates the opposite arrow of   e g     is  iff  is   

   

fidefeasible inheritance based description logics

hence  the sense of the rules is the same as before   ref  indicates that whatever piece
of information  link  is in the premises  it appears also in the conclusions   ct  is a cut
condition  that states that if the validity of a link can be derived from the links in the rest of
the net  such a link can be eliminated without aecting the set of the conclusions derivable
from the net   cm  is a form of constrained monotony  opposite to  ct   that states that
whatever conclusion can be derived from the net  it can be added to the premises without
aecting the other conclusions   ct  and  cm  have an intuitive appeal  and from the
logical point of view characterize
as a closure operation  the translation of  rm  is less
intuitive  since we do not have in ins a classical notion of negation  but we have only a
notion of conict  hence the sense of the rule is that  if p  q is not a consequence of n  
then the addition of information conicting with p  q  i e   p   q  should not aect the
defeasible consequences of the net n   the fact that ins do not share with classical logic
the notions of contradiction and negation makes this formulation of  rm  less intuitive and
interesting 
the proprieties  ref    ct  and  cm  are often considered proprieties that a nonmonotonic consequence relation should satisfy  kraus et al         makinson         and so
it is interesting to check if they are satised in the in formalism  we know that the classical
approaches to inheritance nets do not satisfy  ct  and  cm   makinson        pp         
while our approach is logically more appealing 
proposition     



satisfies  ref    ct  and  cm  

while  rm  is not satised 
proposition     



does not satisfy  rm  

the following example proves the proposition
example      consider the net in figure    the net is composed of the links p  f  
f  b  and p  t  we have n
p  b and n   t  b  but n   t   b   p  b

figure    counterexample to rm 
this example actually shows that  dealing with the notion of negation and consistency
that characterize ins   rm  does not look as a desirable property anymore  since the addition of t   b to the net creates a nixon diamond from which we do not want to derive
p  b  see example

as indicated at the end of section      a net is considered inconsistent if we are forced
to conclude for some pair of nodes p  q that p and q are both positively and negatively
connected  since  as seen above   satises  sup   we can say that a mixed net is consistent
i we cannot conclude both n  p  q and n  p   q for any pair of nodes p  q 
now we are going to see that in order to check the consistency of a mixed net we can use
the ranking procedure  it is sucient to apply it to the whole net  as for the propositional
case  see section       the ranking procedures dened on the nodes of a net terminates 
after a nite number of steps  into either an empty set n or a xed point of the function
e  i e   the set of the nodes that result always exceptional  in such a case  we say that such
nodes have an innite ranking value  r p       if we want to check whether a net n is
consistent  it is sucient to apply the ranking procedure to the entire net  and see if there
are nodes with innite ranking 
proposition      a net n is consistent iff we do not have a node p with r p      that
is  we do not conclude both n  p  q and n  p   q for any pair p  q

      properties
in the eld of inheritance networks  a taxonomy of the dierent approaches has been developed on the basis of some relevant properties  horty         we briey check which of
them are satised by our approach 
 purely defeasible   mixed nets  cyclic   acyclic nets  our procedure deals easily with
two properties that often create problems in the traditional approaches  the presence
of both strict and defeasible links  mixed nets   and the presence of cycles  cyclic
nets  
 credulous   skeptical   directly skeptical approaches  our approach corresponds to a
directly skeptical approach  given a net  we obtain a unique set of valid connections in
it  vs  the credulous approach  that allows for dierent sets of valid paths  possibly in
conict with each other   and such a unique set is not obtained from the intersection
of dierent possible extensions  as in some skeptical approaches   but it is obtained
from a single closure operation 
 upward   downward chaining  for the denition of valid paths  we do not use any
form of induction on their length  neither starting from the initial node toward the
terminal node  upward chaining   nor in the reverse direction  downward chaining  
hence  no form of chaining is used in our procedure 
 on path   off path preemption  o path preemption is the classical form of preemption  used also by horty        def          while on path preemption is more
binding  requiring the preempting node to lie on the initial segment of the path it preempts  horty        sect          we do not exactly formalise a form of preemption 
since we do not confront directly the dierent paths between two nodes  however 
our procedure has a behaviour that is analogous to the use of o path preemption 
      computational complexity
to dene the overall complexity of our decision procedure over the nets  we have to consider
the complexity of the course identication procedure  that is  given a net n   hs  u i and
two nodes s  t in n   which is the computational cost to identify s t  note that  can easily

holds 
a  b  s   a   b  s   a  b  u   a   b  u  
recall that we have stated the presence of a   b in s implies that b   a is in s too  so 
for a   b  s we have both ha  bi and hb  ai in e 
once we have dened g  let us recall a well known result in graph theory saying that
in a directed graph  given two nodes p and q  determining if there is a path from p to q
can be determined in time o  v      e    e g  using bfs  breadth first search   cormen 
stein  rivest    leiserson         now  the following argument shows that indeed s t can
be determined in polynomial time     at rst  we check if there is a path between s and t 
if not  then s t     otherwise  we call the procedure delta s  below 
delta s   for each outgoing edge hs  xi of s  such that both hs  xi and x are not marked 
do  if there is a path between x and t then mark both hs  xi and x  and recursively 
call delta x  
once nished  s t can immediately be build from the marked edges  note that each edge
is marked once and each node is marked  i e   explored  once and  thus  the algorithm is
bounded polynomially by the size of the graph 
once we have found the set s t and   we have to apply the decision procedure based
on the propositional rational closure to decide if there is a valid connection between p and
q  as for section      the number of entailment tests is polynomially bounded by the size
of the net   as all formulae are   cnf  like proposition      we obtain that the decision

so far  we have used the link   to indicate that two classes are disjoint  p   q has p  q

will indicate the complementary class of a class p with p  hence  we can substitute every
link p   q in a net with four links  p  p  q  q  p  q  and q  p  moreover  we

      conjunction and disjunction
next  we extend inheritance nets to support conjunction and disjunction as well  by allowing
links a  b  c  conjunction of a and b is equivalent to c  and c  a  b  disjunction of a
and b is equivalent to c   we will assume that inheritance nets containing such kind of
links are closed according to the following rule  if there is a  b  c  resp   a  b  c  in
a net  then there are also c  a and c  b  resp   a  c and b  c  in the net  we call
these nets boolean defeasible inheritance networks  bins   we shall use a  b and a  b
to indicate  respectively  that a node represents the conjunction or the disjunction of a and
b  graphically  we indicate disjunctive and conjunctive links as in figure   and figure   
respectively 
we extend now our reasoning method to bins  to do so  we need to amplify the notion
of course  introducing the notion of duct  we consider not only linear routes from one point
to another  but also parallel routes  in order to model the introduction of the conjunction
in the consequent and the introduction of the disjunction in the antecedent  roughly 
   hs

will indicate a duct  that starts at node s and develops through the ducts  and     both
reaching the node t 
   

ficasini   straccia

definition      duct   ducts are defined as follows  where               
   every link p  q in n is a duct    hp  qi in n  
   if    h  qi is a duct and q  r is a link in n that does not already appear in   then
    h  ri is a duct in n  
   if    hq  i is a duct and r  q is a link in n that does not already appear in   then
    hr  i is a duct in n  
t 
   if ht    pi and hr      pi are ducts  then for s  t  r  s  hs  r 
   pi is a duct  and

   if hp    ti and hp      ri are ducts  then for t  r  s  s  hp   t
  r   si is a duct 
now our reasoning method for bins is as follows  given a net n   hs  u i  we can dene
a correspondent knowledge base k   h  i  where
    p  q   p  q  s 
  p  q   p  q  s

    p  q   p  q  u

n  or simply c   as the set of the ducts from p to q

now  we ask whether a is connected to c  it can be verified that
a c    a  b  b  c  b  d  a  f    
note that b  d  a c   as there is a duct from a to c that passes through c and d in order

a  f is a direct link  we have that a n f  i e   a n  c  d    and hence we know that
we cannot conclude both a n c and a n d  but  since we have no evidence whether one of
such conclusions has to be preferred to the other  we do not conclude either of them  the
result of our skeptical approach is that a  n c  a  n c  a  n d  and a  n d  on the other
hand  since the only duct connecting a to e is ha  b  ei  that is  the nodes c  d  g  and f do
not play any role in any possible argumentation connecting a to e   we can conclude a n e

the sense is the same as in the propositional case  and it remains intuitive also in

      consistency
also w r t  consistency  we obtain the same result as for ins  i e   the net is consistent if the
ranking procedure terminates into an empty set 
proposition       a bin n is consistent iff we do not have any node p with r p     
that is  we cannot conclude both p  q and p   q for any pair p  q 
remark    as seen in section       the notion of consistency in inheritance nets is different from the notion of consistency for propositional logic  using our procedure a net is
inconsistent if  applying the ranking function to the entire net  we obtain a node with  as
ranking value  see proposition       up to this point  if we find that a net is inconsistent 
we simply stop our decision procedure 
in what follows we are going to work with bins in the framework of propositional logic 
so  in order to assimilate the notion of consistency with the one of propositional logic  from
now on we shall consider a modified version of our procedure for bins  suppose we have
to decide the validity of the connection between two nodes p  q in a net n   if n results
consistent  then we proceed as above  otherwise  if our net results inconsistent  some node
has infinite ranking value  we do not simply stop  but  in case r p      we still apply our
procedure  otherwise  if p itself has infinite ranking value  r p       we do not proceed
further 
      computational complexity
as for ins  we have to determine s t  computing  is again immediate  from the ducts
in a bin  now  it is not dicult to see that a recursive bfs graph travelling procedure
as the one devised for ins can be worked out for bins as well  by illustration  refer to
figure   and assume we are processing node b  since from b  both d and c are reachable
and d  c  g  s  and  recursively  there is a path from g to c  we can mark hb  ci and hb  di 
and mark the conjunction d  c  g  s as visited  again  all nodes and aggregated
nodes are visited at most ones  guaranteeing polynomial cost for computing s t  
now  while s t and  can be determined in polynomial time  and as for section     
the number of entailment tests is polynomially bounded by the size of the net  the strict
part may encode any propositional formula and  thus  unlike the case of ins  we have 
proposition       deciding defeasible consequence for bins  
problem 

bin  

is a conp complete

   defeasible inheritance in propositional logic
now  we depart from bins and apply a similar reasoning procedure in the framework of
propositional logic  and show how to obtain a kind of closure of a knowledge base that
   

fidefeasible inheritance based description logics

results to be a rational consequence relation  but that is more informative than the classical
rational closure  lehmann   magidor        
we consider a propositional language with only      as connectives  so  we start with
a conditional kb k   ht   di  see section       with t    c   d            cn  dn   and
d    e   f            em  fm   
step    given a conditional base k   ht   di  check if k is preferentially consistent  that
is  check if its materialisation is consistent  section      step       if it is consistent 
we dene a bin from k  i e   a net nk   hsk   uk i  modelling the information in k
in the following way 
 i  we consider every formula c that appears as antecedent or as succedent in the
conditionals in k  and we create a node c representing each of them  modulo
logical equivalence  that is  a node c represents the class of the formulae logically
equivalent to c  
 ii  for each node we add also  if not already present  the complementary node  the
node representing its negation   and we link them by   
 iii  we add the strict links  if c  d  t we add the strict link c  d to the net 
we also add to sk all the strict links that correspond to the logical dependencies
between the formulae represented by the nodes w r t  the consequence relation
t   if  appears in a conditional  we add to the net a correspondent node  
and  for every other node n in the net  we add a strict node n    analogously 
for  we add   n for every node n in the net 
 iv  eventually  for c d  d  we add a defeasible link  from node c to node d 
step    we apply the reasoning procedure for bins to nk  section      to identify all valid
defeasible connections c n d and we add them as c d to the conditional base k
to obtain a new conditional base k   ht   d  i    
step    finally  we apply to k its rational closure  section      and we dene a nonmonotonic consequence relation  k by
c k d i c d  r k    
now  we can show that
proposition       k is a rational consequence relation containing k 
example      consider again the penguin example  we modify it slightly in order to
consider also the use of the connectives  while birds  b  typically fly  live on trees  and have
wings  f   t  w   penguins do not fly and do not live on trees  f  t   so  our knowledge
base k   ht   di will be

   p  b 

d    b f  b t  b w  p f  t   
   we do not modify t   since all the strict connections valid in the net are classically derivable from t

to be able to derive it from the information at our disposal  that is  we would like to conclude
p w  please note that this is not possible using classical preferential approaches  but we
can obtain such a conclusion passing trough the first step of our closure operation  that is 
defining the corresponding net

are the strict arrows that are not explicit in the conditional base  but that are logically valid
and that are added to sk in the construction of the net nk

fidefeasible inheritance based description logics

that would not be present in the rational closure of k  see remark    
now  following the procedure defined in section      we compute the rational closure
of the new knowledge base k   obtaining a rational consequence relation that contains the
original k 
please note that  if we were using only bins  we could have not derived anything else 
since our vocabulary would be limited to the propositions expressed by the nodes  however 
by relying on the rational closure of propositional knowledge bases  we can reason using the
full expressivity of a propositional language  deriving new conditionals as  for example 
b  green f  
which can not be derived using bins as green does not appear in the net 
the next example shows another characteristic of this approach  in the preferential
approach typicality is an absolute property of a proposition w r t  the agents knowledge
base  that is  if a class results atypical w r t  some other class  as penguins w r t  birds  
it results atypical w r t  the entire knowledge base  in our approach instead  typicality is
a comparative notion  we can consider a class as exceptional with respect to a superclass 
but absolutely typical with respect to another 
example      consider a red fish  r   it is both a fish  f   and a pet  p   typically  a fish
has gills  g  and scales  s   while pets are docile  d  and play with kids  k   red fishes are
not typical pets  since they do not play with kids  so  the k   ht   di is
t

   r  f  r  p 

d    r k  p k  p d  f  g  f  s   
in the rational closure red fishes  since they are atypical pets  they do not play with kids  
result atypical in general  and they cannot inherit any of the typical properties of all their
super classes 
instead  we want red fishes to inherit  besides the properties of pets that are compatible
with them  d   also all the typical properties of fishes  g and s   since we consider them
typical fishes 
to do so  we translate our knowledge base into the net in figure     from such a net
we obtain a new knowledge base k   ht   d  i  with
d     r k  p k  p d  f  g  f  s  r d  r g  r s 
and so we have derived exactly the desired conditionals 
next  we compute the rational closure of k   following the procedure defined in section
     and we obtain a rational consequence relation containing k and more information about
red fishes  information that  as intuitive as it is  we would not be able to derive from the
simple rational closure of k 
therefore  we have dened a new rational consequence relation for k that extends k 
as k  r k    and that contains intuitive conditionals not in the rational closure of k

   defeasible inheritance in dls
next  we apply our method to a signicant dl representative  namely alc  baader et al  
      ch      alc corresponds to a fragment of rst order logic  using monadic predicates 
called concepts  and dyadic ones  called roles 
in order to stress the parallel between the procedure presented in section     and the
proposal in alc  we are going to use the same notation for the components playing an
analogous role in the two construction  we use p  q  r        for concept names  and c  d  e       
to indicate concepts in general  instead  respectively  of atomic propositions and propositions  and    and   to indicate  respectively  the classical consequence relation of alc and
   

fidefeasible inheritance based description logics

a non monotonic consequence relation in alc   will indicate a default concept  that is  a
concept that we assume as applying to every individual  if not informed of the contrary 
we have a nite set of concept names c    p  q  r          a nite set of role names r  
 r  s  t         and the set l of alc concepts is dened inductively as follows   i  c  l 
 ii      l   iii  c  d  l  c  d  c  d  c  l  and  iv  c  l  r  r 
r c  r c  l  concept c  d is used as a shortcut of c  d  the symbols  and 
correspond  respectively  to the conjunction  and the disjunction  of classical logic 
given a set of individuals o  indicated by bold letters a  b  c         an assertion is of
the form a c  c  l  or of the form  a  b  r  r  r   respectively indicating that the
individual a is an instance of concept c  and that the individuals a and b are connected
by the role r 
a general inclusion axiom  gci  is of the form c  d  c  d  l  and indicates that
any instance of c is also an instance of d  we use c   d as a shortcut of the pair of
c  d and d  c 
from a fol point of view  assertions and inclusion axioms can easily be mapped in
fol by the following transformation 
  a c      a  c  
  c  d    x    x  c     x  d   
  x  a    a x  
  x  c  d      x  c     x  d  
  x  r c    y  r x  y     y  c  
  x  r c    y  r x  y     y  c  

   a  b  r    r a  b  
  x       x     x       x  
  x  c      x  c  
  x  c  d      x  c     x  d  
where y is a new variable 
where y is a new variable  

now  a classical knowledge base is dened by a pair k   ha  t i  where t is a nite
set of gcis  the tbox   and a is a nite set of assertions  the abox    whereas a defeasible
knowledge base is represented by a triple k   ha  t   di  where additionally d is a nite
 d  an instance of a concept c is typically an instance of a concept
set of conditionals c 
 
d   with c  d  l  
example      consider again the penguin example  just add a role p rey in the vocabulary 
where a role instantiation  a  b  p rey is read as a preys on b  and add also two more
concepts  i  insect  and f i  fish   an example of defeasible kb is
k   ha  t   di
with
a    a p  b b   a  c  p rey   b  c  p rey 
t    p  b  i  f i 
 f  b  f  p  p rey f i  b  p rey i   
d    p 



the particular structure of a defeasible kb allows for the isolation of the pair ht   di 
that we could call the conceptual system of the agent  from the information about the
individuals  formalized in a  
   since for the monotonic part we substitute the meta linguistic conditionals c  d with formulae c  d 
we substitute also for the defeasible part of the knowledge base the conditionals c d with conditional
 d  that we could call defeasible inclusion axioms 
formulae c 

   

ficasini   straccia

in what follows we are going to work with the information about concepts ht   di rst 
exploiting the immediate analogy with the homonymous pair in the propositional setting 
and then we will address the case involving individuals as well  we show that by using
our method we overcome to the limits of classical rational closure  already presented for
alc  casini   straccia         in a similar way as for the propositional case  please note
that the procedure presented here is based on a slightly modied version of the procedure
for rational closure previously presented by casini and straccia         i e   on the one
presented by britz et al          the latter is accompanied by a semantic characterization 
based on dl interpretations with a preferential relation dened over the individuals  such a
semantic characterization of rational closure for alc characterises all the steps of our procedure  the local applications of rational closure and the nal one   however  we still lack
a semantic characterization of the overall procedure  accounting also for the modularization
of the knowledge base done using the ins

that would not be derivable from the rational closure  as presented by casini and straccia        
computational complexity  from a computational complexity point of view  as deciding entailment in alc is exptime complete  donini   massacci        and  as for
section      the number of entailment tests is polynomially bounded by the size of the
knowledge base  following exactly the same procedures dened for the propositional case 
we conclude that
proposition      deciding c k d in alc is an exptime complete problem 
    closure operation over individuals
so far we left out the abox  but we are going to consider it here  the procedure for the
abox is built over the above procedure for the tbox  that is  we consider a knowledge base
ha  t   di such that all the strict knowledge has already been moved into t   i e   in d we
do not have axioms with  as ranking value  that is  they correspond to the sets te and
e obtained using the procedure in the previous section   the basic idea of the following
d
procedure is to consider each individual named in the abox as much typical as possible 
that is  to associate to it all the possible defeasible information that is consistent with the
rest of the knowledge base  in order to apply the defeasible information locally to each
   

ficasini   straccia

individual  we encode such information using the materialisations of the inclusion axioms 
e in the section
i e   the set    h            n i  s t     i  i   for    i   n  the set 
  
above    we want to be able to associate to each individual a  o  with o being the set
of the individuals named in the abox  the strongest formula i that is consistent with the
e   had   t i  that we call
knowledge base  in such a way we dene a new knowledge base k
a abox extension of the knowledge base ha  t   di 
definition      abox extension   given a knowledge base k   ha  t   di  a knowledge
base had   t i is an abox extension of k   ha  t   di iff
 had   t i is classically consistent and a  ad  
 ad   a is composed of all the assertions a c such that a  o and c   i for some i 
and for every h s t  h   i 
ht   ad   a h  i    
the above denition identies the extensions of the original abox a s t  to every
individual is associated all the defeasible information that is consistent with the rest of the
knowledge base  still  the main problem is that  since the individuals can be related to
each other through roles  the possibility of associating a default concept to an individual
can be inuenced by the default information associated to other individuals  as shown in
the following example 
 ar a 
example      consider k   ha  di  with a     a  b  r  and d   d      
 hence we have    h  i   ha  r ai   if we associate   to a  we obtain b a and we
cannot associate   to b  on the other hand  if we apply   to b  we derive b a and we are
not anymore able to associate   to a  hence  we define two possible rational extensions of
k 


this implies that  given a knowledge base ha  t   di  even if the closure of ht   di is
always unique there is the possibility that we have more than one abox extensions  a
simple procedure to obtain all the possible extensions of a knowledge base ha  t   di  with
o the set of the individuals in named in a  is the following 
definition      procedure for abox extensions  
 consider the set s of all the linear orders of the individuals in o 
 for each s   ha            am i in s do 
 set j     
 set asd    a
 repeat until j   m     
 find the first default i   such that hasd   aj  i    t  i        
 asd    asd   aj  i   
e and 
e must be done
    note that  given a conditional knowledge base  the procedure to determine te   d
once for all 

   

fidefeasible inheritance based description logics

 j  j  
 return hasd   t i
where we indicate by asd the abox extension of a obtained using the sequence s 
now  it can be shown that
proposition      given a linear order of the individuals in k  the above procedure determines an abox extension of k  vice versa  every abox extension of k corresponds to the
knowledge base generated by some linear order of the individuals in o 
e    ha a a  r a   i
for instance  related to example      we obtain the extension k
e
from the order ha  bi  while k    ha   b a  r a   i is obtained from the order hb  ai 
example      refer to example      and let k    a  t   d   where
a    a p  b b   a  c  p rey   b  c  p rey 
t    p  b  i  f i 
 f  b  p rey i  p  f  p  p rey f i 
d    b 




from such a knowledge base we define a set             with

     b  f     b  p rey i    p  f     p  p rey f i 
     p  f     p  p rey f i   
if we consider an order where a comes before b  then we associate   to a  and consequently c is presumed to be a fish and we are prevented in the association of   to b  if we
consider b before a  c is not a fish and we cannot apply   to a 
now  if we x a priori a linear order s on the individuals  we can say that a c is a
e    a c  where k
e is
defeasible consequence of k w r t  the order s  written k s a c  i k
the abox extension generated from k based on the order s 

for instance  related to example     and order s    ha  bi  we may infer that k s  a a 
while with order s    hb  ai  we may infer that k s  b a 
the interesting point of such a consequence relation is that it still satises the properties
of a rational consequence relation in the following way

we can show that
proposition      given k and a linear order s of the individuals in k  the consequence
relation s satisfies the properties  refdl     rmdl   
note that from a computational complexity point of view  as entailment w r t  a alc tbox
is exptime complete  donini   massacci        and the number of individuals in k is linearly bounded by  k   we get immediately
proposition      deciding k s a c in alc is a exptime complete problem 
in the presence of multiple abox extensions  we can also dene the inference relation
  a more conservative inference relation independent from any order on the individuals 
that corresponds to the intersection of all the inference relations s modelling a rational
extension 
 

 

 s   s is a linear order on the elements of o 

however  there is the possibility that we lose the property of rational monotonicity  as
shown in the following example

fidefeasible inheritance based description logics

we have no increase in the computational complexity of the decision procedure  assuming that the number of individuals named in the abox is n  we have to perform a s  test
for each possible sequences s dened on the n individuals  that is  in the worst case we
k
need to do n  s tests  each of which can be done in time o   k    for some k  now  it can
 
be shown that   n     n and  thus  the decision problem for  remains in exptime 
proposition      deciding k  a c in alc is a exptime complete problem 
notwithstanding  we conjecture that in many  probably most  of the real world cases  a
knowledge base would have a single rational abox extension  and in such cases  rmdl   is
still valid  to check whether a knowledge base ha  t   di has a single rational abox extension  it is sucient to associate to each individual in o the strongest i modulo consistency
w r t ha  t   di  exactly as in the procedure in denition      but doing the consistency
check of aj  i w r t  the original a instead that w r t  asd   in the end  check whether
hasd   t i is consistent  in such a case we have obtained the only rational abox extension of
ha  t   di 
the following is a knowledge base with a unique abox extension 
example      consider the kb in example      where  b  c  p rey is replaced with  b  d  p rey 
then  whatever is the order on the individuals  we obtain the following association between
the default formulae and the individuals  a     b     c     and d     using the information
in these defaults  we obtain an unique default assumption extension 

a semantic characterization of  and s   making use of preferential dl models  is
presented by casini et al         
now lets briey consider some heuristics that are useful in case we want to present to
the system specic abox queries  assume we want to know if a particular individual a
presumably falls under a concept c  and we want to draw the safest possible conclusion 
in the presence of multiple acceptable extensions  the classical solution is to use a skeptical
approach  i e   to use the inference relation   corresponding to the intersection of all the
inference relations associated to each possible ordering s of the individuals appearing in a 
as we have seen above  in case of multiple rational extensions the computational complexity of the  decision problem does not rise w r t the classical alc decision problem 
moreover  in case of multiple extensions  the amount of defeasible information associable to
an individual a can be inuenced only by the individuals related to it by means of a role  it
is immediate to see that if there is no role connection in the abox between two individuals
a and b  then the information that is associated to a does not inuence at all the amount
of defeasible information that we can associate to b  and the other way around  hence 
we can ease the decisions w r t  the abox introducing the notion of cluster  i e   a set of
individuals named in the abox that are linked by means of a sequence of role connections 
to do so  given an abox a  we indicate with q the symmetric and transitive
s closure of all
the roles in our vocabulary  i e   the symmetric and transitive closure of r 
definition
     cluster   define q as the reflexive  symmetric and transitive closure of
s
r  given an individual a  o  we call the cluster of a the set  a  of the individuals

    this can be shown by induction on n  or see e g http   lifecs likai org         better upper bound forfactorial html

hence  in order to know what we can presumably conclude about a  it is sucient to

   comparison with related work
between non monotonic logics  the so called preferential approach can be distinguished
from the other various proposals  as reiters defaults  modal approaches  defeasible inheritance        mainly due its logical properties  since the former approach is committed to the
satisfaction of some desirable structural properties of the consequence relation  see section
      on the other hand  considering them from the point of view of the inferential capacity
the preferential approach often results weaker than other proposals  since often there are
desirable  intuitive conclusions that we cannot derive  see remark    
in our proposal we have tried to combine the classical rational closure with inheritance
networks in order to overcome the inferential limits without prejudicing the logical properties
of the consequence relation 
in section   we also present an alternative way to reason about defeasible inheritance 
despite our proposal has been presented mainly to integrate it with propositional language
and rational closure  it results an interesting approach per se  and in appendix a we
compare it with hortys classical skeptical extension  horty        sect       and sandewalls
landmark examples  sandewall        
as indicated in the introduction  there have been many papers aimed at the implementation of non monotonic reasoning into the dl formalisms  for most of such proposals the
comparison with our approach has to be done considering the dierent non monotonic formalisms  independently from the dl environment  so we refer to makinsons work       
for a comparison between the various non monotonic approaches 
in the last years the main proposals for the implementation of nonmonotonic reasoning
in dls have been connected to two approaches  the preferential one and circumscription 
in the preferential approach  the work by britz and al   britz et al         britz  meyer 
  varzinczak        on preferential dl semantics is strongly connected to our approach 
and one of the results has been the semantic characterization of rational closure cited above
 britz et al         
still very close to our approach is the work by giordano et al       b   that is based too
on a preferential approach  the conclusions that we can derive using the logic alc tmin
   

fidefeasible inheritance based description logics

are intuitive  but the complexity of the decision problem for the abox is co nexpnp  giordano et al       b  thm       and the procedure cannot be reduced to classical entailment 
among the proposals based on circumscription  the work by bonatti et al         is
particularly representative  from the point of view of the quality of the inferences  in such
a proposal it results more dicult w r t  the preferential approach to draw the expected
conclusions  for example  assume that our knowledge base contains the information that
mammals typically live on land  but that whales are abnormal mammals that do not live
on the land  and the abox contains the information a m ammal  w hale  not knowing
anything else about the individual a  we would like our reasoning system to reason on the
assumption that we are dealing with a typical mammal  since  moreover  it is specied that
a is not a whale  and hence being able to derive that a lives on the land  however  using
circumscription  the conclusions we can draw changes w r t  which concepts the user decides
to keep fixed or varying  a non trivial choice   and the results can be that we are not able
to derive a habitat land  that we are able to derive it  or we can even derive that whales
do not exist  bonatti et al         sect        in our proposal instead  we can formalize the
problem with a knowledge base ha  t   di with a    a m ammal   we do not need to specify
that it is not a whale   t    w hale  m ammal  w hale  habitat land  and d  
 habitat land   without needing any kind of choice from the user  the system
 m ammal 
can derive automatically a habitat land  moreover  we have seen that the computational
cost of our procedure involving an abox is exponential  while in the circumscription case  for
languages analogous to alc  the complexity of the instance problem is co nexpnp  bonatti
et al         sect          some of the issues just discussed have been addressed and solved
by bonatti et al             a   but only for circumscriptive systems that are specically
built for low complexity dls such as el 
on the other hand  procedures based on circumscription are able to derive defeasible
information about individuals that are implicit in the abox  that is  they can  for exam d that presumably a r d  our procedure involving
ple  conclude from a r c and c 
aboxes is not able to make such a kind of derivation  since we can add defeasible information
only to the individuals named in the abox  we are working on a further renement of the
procedure in order to deal also with the implicit individuals  a rst attempt to take under
consideration also such individuals has been proposed in a previous publications  casini  
straccia        pp         adding a completion procedure for the abox in order to explicitly
name in the abox the implicit individuals  but such a procedure needs to be rened 
among the proposals regarding the introduction of probabilistic reasoning in dls 
lukasiewicz        presents a combination of nonmonotonic and probabilistic reasoning 
the nonmonotonic part is based on the preferential approach  and he too presents a construction that augments the inferential power of rational closure  let us consider his proposal by eliminating the probabilistic part  i e   considering only conditionals associated to
probability    conditionals           in his notation   since they convey the same meaning
as our defeasible conditionals  his procedure seems to give back the same results as ours in
most of the cases  but the two proposals dier in the general approach  he proceeds with a
renement of the ranking structure  while we use a renement of the content of the knowledge base  in fact  the behaviour of the two can dier  consider for example a knowledge
 b  a  d  b  c  c  e  d  e   in lukasiewiczs notation it would
base h  di  with d    a 




correspond to a knowledge base with an empty tbox and a set p containing the conditionals
   

ficasini   straccia

 b a                    in our construction we can derive a c  since there is simply a duct ha  b  ci
from a to c  while in lukasiewiczs approach we cannot  since we have to consider what follows from all the three preferred subset of the knowledge base that are consistent with
 b  a  d  b  c  c  e    a  b  a  d  b  c  d  e    a  b  a  d  c  e  d  e   
a  that are  a 











and a c does not follow from the latter 

   conclusions
by combining the classical rational closure with ideas from defeasible inheritance networks 
we have proposed a new rational consequence relation that overcomes some limits of both the
formalisms  by doing so  we have extended the defeasible inference capabilities by allowing
an atypical class still to inherit some properties from its superclass while maintaining the
desired logical properties of rational closure  the table below summarizes the structural
properties satised by the systems taken under consideration

as we can see  our proposals for defeasible inheritance based propositional logic and
description logics still satisfy all axioms of classical rational closure  another feature is
that our method does uniquely require the existence of a decision procedure of classical
entailment and  thus  can be implemented on top of exiting propositional sat solvers and
dl reasoners  since we have introduced a procedure that is interesting also from the point
of view of inheritance nets  we have presented the more comprehensive procedure for logical
knowledge bases making use of the nets formalism  notwithstanding  we are condent that
the procedure can be reformulated avoiding the shift from one formalism to another 
the procedure presented for alc can be straightly extended to languages more expressive than alc  on the other hand  at present the procedure needs a language that is
closed under propositional connectives  and hence we need to augment the expressivity of
the language in order to apply it to less expressive dl languages as el  forcing in this way
an increase in the computational costs w r t  the classical decision problem 
hence  looking for an adaptation of the procedure appropriate for dealing with tractable 
less expressive dls is one of the main open problems of the present proposal  together with
a more proper semantic characterization of the procedure and the ability of reasoning in a
defeasible way about implicit individuals  as discussed in the previous section 
    the example corresponds to the structure of example a   in appendix a  just eliminating the link at
the center of the figure

appendix a  examples
we are going to validate our decision procedures for inheritance nets against some signicant
examples proposed by horty        and sandewall         we shall use bins  but  in order
to simplify the graphical representation  we shall also use   as a macro  as explained in

cases too 
example a    horty        ex        consider the net in figure     horty claims that the
desirable conclusion should be a p  since in the environment of mixed nets          certain
kinds of compound defeasible paths can legitimately be thought to carry immediate information   namely  those paths consisting of a single defeasible link followed by a strict end
segment  of any length  horty        p        that corresponds to the condition of  rw

implication in a p with ranking grater than   is s  r  and  since s  r  a  p  we have
a k p 
example a    horty        ex        consider the net in figure     in this example horty
claims that we should not prefer the negative path ha  p  si over the positive path ha  r  si 
since the negative link a   q nullifies the path from p to r  our procedure satisfies such a

appendix b  proofs
proposition      consider a net n   hs  i and translate it into a set of propositional
implications   the following properties hold 
   if n is a consistent net  there is a valid strict positive  resp   negative  path hp    qi
from p to q  that is n
p  q  resp   n
p   q   iff   p  q  resp     p  q  
   n is inconsistent iff   p for some p  a  
   

ficasini   straccia

   deciding strict consequence can be done in polynomial time 
proof  first  it is easy to prove by induction on the length of the paths that  if there is a
positive  resp   negative  path in s from p to q  then   p  q  resp     p  q   hence
we have 
 a  if n is a consistent net and there is a valid strict positive  negative  path  p    q 
from p to q  then   p  q    p  q  
moreover  if n is inconsistent  then we can conclude  for some p  q in it  p  q and
p   q  and so we have   p  q and   p  q  that is    p  so we have one half of
the second statement 
 a  if    p for every p  a   then n is consistent 
now we move to show the other halves of the statements 
 b  if n is a consistent net and   p  q  resp     p  q   then there is a valid strict
positive  resp   negative  path  p    q  from p to q 
in order to model the classical consequence relation   we use the propositional resolution method  we use the symbol r to indicate the inferences in the resolution
method 
every element of  has the forms p  q or p  q  such implications correspond  in
the clause form  respectively to the clauses  i e   sets of literals   p  q  and  p  q  
call  the set of the clauses corresponding to   for example  if we assume that
 r  p  q   that is    p  q   we have that the set of clauses    p    q  resolves
into the empty set  that is     p  q     
   positive case  n
p  q   assume   p  q for some p  q  pn   in order to
apply the refutational approach  p  q has to be negated  and  since  p  q 
is equivalent to p  q  we introduce the clauses  p    q   so  in the resolution
approach   p  q is translated into    p    q  r   we have also assumed
that  is consistent  and hence we have that   r   since the set  is composed
only of pairs of literals  of form  p  q  or  p  q    every reduction step between
them gives back again a pair of literals  for example  from  p  q  and  q  r  
we obtain  p  r    therefore  in order to obtain the empty set we need to use
both  p  and  q  in the refutation procedure  so  the clause  q  must be
eliminated using a clause containing q  such a clause must necessarily have the
form  ri   q  for some ri   and we obtain a new clause  ri    again   ri   can
be eliminated only by a clause of form  rj   ri    obtaining a clause  rj    since
the set  is nite  such a procedure has to terminate  and it can only be done if
we obtain a clause  p   that can be resolved by  p   that is  there has to be in
 a clause  p  rl    for some rl   s t   rl   appears in the reduction procedure 
now  the clauses of  used in the reduction process correspond to a chain of
links in the net s  p  rl           ri  q  that dene a valid path  p    q  in s 
   negative case  n
p   q   assume   p  q for some p  q  ps   p  q has
to be negated and it is translated into the clauses  p    q    q  can be combined
   

fidefeasible inheritance based description logics

with a clause of form  q  ri    that represents q  ri   that  in turn  represents
a link q   ri    case     or with a clause of form  q  ri    i e   q  ri   that  in
turn  is q  ri    case    
case    we obtain the clause  ri    and the procedure is the same of the positive
case  the clauses used in the reduction process correspond to a strict negative path of form  p  rl           rj  ri   ri   q 
case    we obtain the clause  ri    and we would have combine it with a clause of
form  ri   rj    or of form  ri   rj    in the former case we move to case
   ending with a strict negative path p  rh           rl  rj   rj   ri   ri  q 
in the latter case we have a new clause  rj    and we are again in case
   however  such a procedure has to terminate  and  in order to terminate 
such a reduction procedure has at some point to move into the case    the
clauses used in the reduction procedure correspond to a path of form p 
ri           rj  rk   rk   rl   rl  rm           rn  q  where the link   corresponds
to the shift to the case   
 b  automatically  we have also that if n is consistent  then    p for every p  a  
otherwise  we would have   p  q and   p  q for some nodes p and q  that
would imply  by the procedure above  the inconsistency of n  
   about the third point  consider that strict links can be encoded as   cnf formulae 
also called krom formulae  and the propositional   sat problem is in p  

proposition      consider a net n   for every connection p n q  resp   p n q  validated
by our procedure  there is a corresponding positive  resp   negative  potential path from p to
q in the net n

b p q    p  q  and
proof  dene the set

b p q    p  q   following a procedure analogous to the one of the proof of

proposition     a net n is consistent iff we do not have a node p with r p      that is 
we do not conclude both n  p  q and n  p   q for any pair p  q 
it is proved combining the following two lemmas 
lemma b    given a net n   and two nodes p and q in it  we can conclude both p n q
and p n q iff r p     
proof  from left to right  it is immediate from the denition of the ranking procedure  if
r p       then the set of implications with at least the same ranking as p do not imply p 
and so they cannot imply both p  q and p  q for any q 
from right to left  if r p      we have a set e    of implications  with p between
their antecedents  such that e  p  that implies e  p  q and e  p  q for
whichever q  that is  p n q and p    n q 
lemma b    every node with ranking  in a set of courses c has the same ranking value
in every set of courses extending c 
proof  it is immediate from the monotony of the consequence relations n

from these lemmas we conclude that if a node p has innite ranking in a net  then the net is
inconsistent  p n q and p n q for some p and q   and  conversely  if a net is inconsistent 
then there is a node p with innite ranking

we have n bin p  t and n bin q  t  that is  
since n bin p  t and n bin q  t  by proposition     we have at least a duct between
p and t and one between q and t  so  since p  q  s  there is a duct from s to t  moreover 
since there is at least a duct between s and t and p  s and q  s  every duct connecting
s to t allows for a duct connecting p to t and q to t  hence  s t  p t and s t  q t
holds 
on the other hand  we have that  since p  q  s  s is connected to t by all the connections moving from p and from q  so  we have that p t  s t and q t  s t   hence 
p t   q t   s t holds and the ranking functions rs t   rp t   and rq t are the same as they

proposition     given a linear order of the individuals in k  our procedure determines an
abox extension of k  vice versa  every abox extension of k corresponds to the knowledge
base generated by some linear order of the individuals in o 
proof  the rst statement is quite immediate  for the second statement  assume that there
is a rational extension ha   t i of ha  t   di that cannot be generated by any sequence s of
the elements of o  a associates to every individual x a default concept from   that we
indicate as x  
now  consider a generic rational extension had   t i of ha  t   di that can be generated
using a sequence of elements of o  the following procedure allows to dene a sequence s
of the elements of o s t  had   t i can be generated using s  i e   had   t i   hasd   t i 
take each element of o and associate to it the strongest default concept in  consistent
with the knowledge base ha  t i  call it  x    look for an individual x s t  x    x   and
consider x the rst element of the sequence s  update a with x x   and repeat the procedure  until every individual has been associated to a default formula  with this procedure
we can generate a sequence over the dominion of the individuals that generates had   t i
from ha  t   di 
since there is no sequence s that can generate ha   t i  the above procedure has to fail 
that is  at some point it will not be possible to associate to any x a default  x s t  x    x  
that means that  for all the remaining x  x     x   for each such x  either x   x or
 x  x   the rst case is not possible  since ha   t i would be inconsistent   x has to be a
maximally consistent default   hence  x  x and x     x for all the remaining x  in such
a case  ha   t i would not be a rational extension of ha  t   di  since we could have another
consistent model with stronger defaults associated to some individuals 
proposition     given k and a linear order s of the individuals in k  the consequence
relation s satisfies the properties  refdl     rmdl   
proof  for refdl   lledl and rwdl the proof is quite immediate  for ctdl and
cmdl   assume ha  t   di s b d  that is hasd   t i  b d  hence  b d is consistent with
hasd   t i  this implies that for the rst individual in the sequence s  let it be a  and for
every i    a i is consistent with ha  t i i it is consistent with ha   b d   t i  and the
procedure associates to a the same default formula either we start with a or with a b d  
the same happens for all the following individuals in the sequence s  so we have that
hasd   b d   t i   h a   b d  sd   t i and hasd   b d   t i  a c i h a   b d  sd   t i 
a c  since  satises ct and cm   we have that hasd   t i  a c i h a b d  sd   t i  a c 
that is  ha  t   di s a c i ha   b d   t   di s a c 
for ordl   assume that ha   b d   t   di s a c  ha   b e   t   di s a c  and that
b is in the nth position in the sequence s  so  for the rst n    elements of s the association
with the default formulae is the same in both the models  for b  assume that the procedure

 j  i   in the rst case the procedure for the assignment of the defaults continues in the
same way in both the knowledge bases  and it is the same also if we have b d  e  that
is  ha   b d   t   di  ha   b e   t   di  and ha   b d  e   t   di are completed exactly
with the same defaults  obtaining  respectively  the aboxes  a   b d  sd   a   b d  
 a   b e  sd     a   b e   and  a   b d  e  sd   a   b d  e   for some abox
a   so we have that a   b d   a c and a   b e   a c  and  since  satises or 
we obtain a   b d  e   a c  that is  h a   b d  e  sd   t i  a c  if i  j and
b d  e  the procedure associates to b the strongest of the two defaults  that is  i   since
i is not consistent with b e  in every following consistency check the procedure will be
forced to consider that b d holds  and the assignment of the defaults to the individuals will
proceed as in the case where b d holds  and ha   b d  e   t   di will entail the same
formulae as ha   b d   t   di  analogously  if j  i   the default assumption extension of
ha   b d  e   t   di will correspond to the one of ha   b e   t   di 
finally  for rmdl   b d is consistent with hasd   t i  so the presence of b d in the
knowledge base does not inuence the association of the defaults to the individuals  and
asd   a   b d  sd   eventually  hasd   t i  a c implies h a   b d  sd   t i  a c  i e 
ha   b d   t   di s a c 
proposition     ha  t   di  a c iff ha a    t   di s a c for every ordering s of the individuals in a a  
proof  the proof is quite immediate  assume ha a    t   di  s a c for some s  let s be a
sequence of the individuals named in a obtained using s as initial segment  hence we have

that ha  t   di  s a c  the implies ha  t   di   a c 
now assume ha  t   di   a c  hence  for some sequence s ha  t   di 
  s a c  let s be a

restriction of s to the individuals named in a a    then we have that ha  t   di 
  s a c
