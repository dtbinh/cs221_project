   introduction

systems attempt determine whether one text snippet supports inference another

deleting node x means attaching children parent x  insertion inverse
deletion  means inserted node becomes parent consecutive sub sequence

set arabic p h pairs te task created semi automatic technique
two stages  first stage  section      responsible automatically collecting
p h pairs news websites  second stage  section      uses online annotation
system allows annotators annotate collected pairs manually  stages
explained detail below 
    collecting p h pairs
collected candidate p h pairs automatically so called headline lead paragraph
technique  burger   ferro        web  e g  newspaper corpora  pairing
first paragraph article  p  headline  h   based observation
news articles headline often partial paraphrase first paragraph
article  conveying thus comparable meaning  use updated version headlinelead paragraph strategy improve quality p h pair 
key idea pose queries search engine automatically filter
responses text snippets might entail query  pairs manually annotated entailment non entailment  texts automatically collected
freely occurring natural texts  eliminates possibility  indeed likelihood 
unconscious bias introduced hypotheses manually generated 
built corpus p h pairs using headlines websites arabic newspapers
tv channels queries input google via standard google api 
selecting first paragraph  usually represents related text snippet s 
article headline  burger   ferro         first    returned pages 
technique produces large number potential pairs without bias either
premises hypotheses  improve quality pairs resulted query 
use two conditions filter results   i  length headline must least five
words  avoid small headlines   ii  fewer     words headline
appear premise  avoid similar sentences 
problem p h similar would little
learn used training phase te system  would
almost worthless test pairvirtually te system get pair right 
serve discriminatory test pair  therefore eliminate excessively similar
p h pairs training testing  assess terms number shared
uncommon words 
order overcome problem  matched headlines one source stories
another  major stories typically covered range outlets  usually variations emphasis wording  stories different sources linked looking
common words headlinesit unlikely two stories about  in

stance  neanderthals news time  straightforward matching based
low frequency words proper names likely find articles topic 
terminology structure first text snippets articles  however  likely
quite different  thus using headline one source first text snippet
article story another source likely produce p h pairs
unduly similar  therefore link headline one newspaper related
sentences another 
    annotating p h pairs
pairs collected first stage still marked up human annotators 
least process collecting nearly bias free possible  pairs cover
number subjects politics  business  sport general news  annotation

positive entailment examples yes  p judged entails h  negative examples

guidelines used building rte task dataset  dagan  glickman    magnini 
      
pair annotated three annotators  inter annotator agreement  where
annotators agree  around     compared     annotator agrees
least one co annotator  suggests annotators found difficult task 
fact     agreement annotations produced three independent
annotators taken account sets upper bound reasonable expect
