abstract
we present naturalowl  a natural language generation system that produces texts
describing individuals or classes of owl ontologies  unlike simpler owl verbalizers  which
typically express a single axiom at a time in controlled  often not entirely fluent natural
language primarily for the benefit of domain experts  we aim to generate fluent and coherent multi sentence texts for end users  with a system like naturalowl  one can publish
information in owl on the web  along with automatically produced corresponding texts
in multiple languages  making the information accessible not only to computer programs
and domain experts  but also end users  we discuss the processing stages of naturalowl 
the optional domain dependent linguistic resources that the system can use at each stage 
and why they are useful  we also present trials showing that when the domain dependent
linguistic resources are available  naturalowl produces significantly better texts compared
to a simpler verbalizer  and that the resources can be created with relatively light effort 

   introduction
ontologies play a central role in the semantic web  berners lee  hendler    lassila       
shadbolt  berners lee    hall         each ontology provides a conceptualization of a
knowledge domain  e g   consumer electronics  by defining the classes and subclasses of the
individuals  entities  in the domain  the types of possible relations between them etc  the
current standard to specify semantic web ontologies is owl  horrocks  patel schneider 
  van harmelen         a formal language based on description logics  baader  calvanese

sia  patel schneider    sattler         given an owl ontology for a knowledge domain  one
can publish on the web machine readable data pertaining to that domain  e g   catalogues of
products  their features etc    with the data having formally defined semantics based on the
conceptualization of the ontology   following common practice in semantic web research 
we actually use the term ontology to refer jointly to terminological knowledge  tbox  that
establishes a conceptualization of a knowledge domain  and assertional knowledge  abox 
that describes particular individuals 
several equivalent owl syntaxes have been developed  but people unfamiliar with formal
knowledge representation often have difficulties understanding them  rector  drummond 
horridge  rogers  knublauch  stevens  wang    wroe         for example  the following
statement defines the class of st  emilion wines  using the functional style syntax of owl 
one of the easiest to understand  which we also adopt throughout this article  
equivalentclasses  stemilion
objectintersectionof  bordeaux
objecthasvalue  locatedin  stemilionregion  objecthasvalue  hascolor  red 
objecthasvalue  hasflavor  strong 
objecthasvalue  madefrom  cabernetsauvignongrape 
objectmaxcardinality    madefrom   

to make ontologies easier to understand  several ontology verbalizers have been developed
 schwitter      a   verbalizers usually translate the axioms  in our case  owl statements  of
the ontology one by one to controlled  often not entirely fluent english statements  typically
without considering the coherence of the resulting texts  and mostly for the benefit of domain
experts  by contrast  in this article we present a system that aims to produce fluent and
coherent multi sentence texts describing classes or individuals of owl ontologies  with the
texts intended to be read by end users  e g   customers of on line retail sites   for example 
our system can generate the following text from the owl statement above  if the ontology
has been annotated with domain dependent linguistic resources discussed below 
st  emilion is a kind of bordeaux from the st  emilion region  it has red color and strong flavor  it is
made from exactly one grape variety  cabernet sauvignon grapes 

our system  called naturalowl  is open source and supports both english and greek 
hence  greek texts can also be generated from the same owl statements  as in the following
product description  provided that appropriate greek linguistic resources are also available 
by contrast  owl verbalizers typically produce only english  or english like  sentences

the examples above illustrate how a system like naturalowl can help publish information on the web both as owl statements and as texts generated from the owl statements 
this way  information becomes easily accessible to both computers  which can process
the owl statements  and end users speaking different languages  and changes in the owl
statements can be automatically reflected in the texts by regenerating them  to produce
fluent  coherent multi sentence texts  naturalowl relies on natural language generation
 nlg  methods  mckeown        reiter   dale        to a larger extent compared to existing owl verbalizers  for example  it includes mechanisms to avoid repeating information 
to order the facts to be expressed  aggregate smaller sentences into longer ones  generate
referring expressions etc  although nlg is an established area  this is the first article to
discuss in detail an nlg system for owl ontologies  excluding simpler verbalizers  we do
not propose novel algorithms from a theoretical nlg perspective  but we show that there are
several particular issues that need to be considered when generating from owl ontologies 
for example  some owl statements lead to overly complicated sentences  unless they are
converted to simpler intermediate representations first  there are also several owl specific
opportunities to aggregate sentences  e g   when expressing axioms about the cardinalities
of properties   and referring expression generation can exploit the class hierarchy 
naturalowl can be used with any owl ontology  but to obtain texts of high quality
domain dependent generation resources are required  for example  the classes of the ontology
can be mapped to natural language names  the properties to sentence plans etc  similar
linguistic resources are used in most nlg systems  though different systems adopt different
linguistic theories and algorithms  requiring different resources  there is little consensus on
exactly what information nlg resources should capture  apart from abstract specifications
 mellish         the domain dependent generation resources of naturalowl are created
by a domain author  a person familiar with owl  when the system is configured for a new
ontology  the domain author uses the protege ontology editor and a protege plug in that
allows editing the domain dependent generation resources and invoking naturalowl to view
the resulting texts   we do not discuss the plug in in this article  since it is very similar to
the authoring tool of m piro  androutsopoulos  oberlander    karkaletsis        
owl ontologies often use english words or concatenations of words  e g   manufacturedby 
as identifiers of classes  properties  and individuals  hence  some of the domain dependent
generation resources can often be extracted from the ontology by guessing  for example 
that a class identifier like laptop in our earlier example is a noun that can be used to refer
to that class  or that a statement of the form objectpropertyassertion  manufacturedby x
y   should be expressed in english as a sentence of the form x was manufactured by y  
most owl verbalizers follow this strategy  similarly  if domain dependent generation resources are not provided  naturalowl attempts to extract them from the ontology  or it uses

in this article  version    galanis   androutsopoulos        used a less principled representation of its
domain dependent generation resources  without supporting owl  

   

fiandroutsopoulos  lampouras    galanis

generic resources  the resulting texts  however  are of lower quality  also  non english texts
cannot be generated  if the identifiers of the ontology are english like  there is a tradeoff
between reducing the effort to construct domain dependent generation resources for owl
ontologies  and obtaining higher quality texts in multiple languages  but this tradeoff has
not been investigated in previous work  we present trials we performed to measure the
effort required to construct the domain dependent generation resources of naturalowl and
the extent to which they improve the resulting texts  also comparing against a simpler
verbalizer that requires no domain dependent generation resources  the trials show that
the domain dependent generation resources help naturalowl produce significantly better
texts  and that the resources can be constructed with relatively light effort  compared to
the effort typically needed to construct an ontology 
overall  the main contributions of this article are   i  it is the first detailed discussion of
a complete  general purpose nlg system for owl ontologies and the particular issues that
arise when generating from owl ontologies   ii  it shows that a system that relies on nlg
methods to a larger extent  compared to simpler owl verbalizers  can produce significantly
better natural language descriptions of classes and individuals  provided that appropriate
domain dependent generation resources are available   iii  it shows how the descriptions can
be generated in more than one languages  again provided that appropriate resources are
available   iv  it shows that the domain dependent generation resources can be constructed
with relatively light effort  as already noted  this article does not present novel algorithms
from a theoretical nlg perspective  in fact  some of the algorithms that naturalowl uses
are of a narrower scope  compared to more fully fledged nlg algorithms  nevertheless  the
trials show that the system produces texts of reasonable quality  especially when domaindependent generation resources are provided  we hope that if naturalowl contributes
towards a wider adoption of nlg methods on the semantic web  other researchers may
wish to contribute improved components  given that naturalowl is open source 
naturalowl is based on ideas from ilex  odonnell  mellish  oberlander    knott 
      and m piro  isard  oberlander  androutsopoulos    matheson         the ilex
project developed an nlg system that was demonstrated mostly with museum exhibits  but
did not support owl   the m piro project produced a multilingual extension of the system
of ilex  which was tested in several domains  androutsopoulos et al          attempts to
use the generator of m piro with owl  however  ran into problems  androutsopoulos 
kallonis    karkaletsis         by contrast  naturalowl was especially developed for owl 
in the remainder of this article  we assume that the reader is familiar with rdf  rdf
schema  and owl  readers unfamiliar with the semantic web may wish to consult an
introductory text first  antoniou   van harmelen          we also note that the recently
very popular linked data are published and interconnected using semantic web technologies   most linked data currently use only rdf and rdf schema  but owl is in effect a
superset of rdf schema and  hence  the work of this paper also applies to linked data 
   dale et al         and dannels              also discuss nlg for museums 
   a longer version of this article  with more background for readers who are unfamiliar with owl and the
semantic web  is available as a technical report  androutsopoulos  lampouras    galanis         see

related work in the subsequent sections  section   then explains how naturalowl generates
texts  also discussing the domain dependent generation resources of each processing stage 
section   describes the trials we performed to measure the effort required to construct the
domain dependent generation resources and their impact on the quality of the generated
texts  section   concludes and proposes future work 

   related work
we use the functional style syntax of owl in this article  but several equivalent owl syntaxes exist  there has also been work to develop controlled natural languages  cnls   mostly
english like  to be used as alternative owl syntaxes  sydney owl syntax  sos   cregan 
schwitter    meyer        is an english like cnl with a bidirectional mapping to and from
the functional style syntax of owl  sos is based on peng  schwitter   tilbrook        
a similar bidirectional mapping has been defined for attempto controlled english  ace

 funk  tablan  bontcheva  cunningham  davis    handschuh        are other owl cnls 
mostly intended to be used by domain experts when authoring ontologies  denaux  dolbear 
hart  dimitrova    cohn         we also note that some owl cnls cannot express all the
kinds of owl statements  schwitter  kaljurand  cregan  dolbear    hart        
much work on owl cnls focuses on ontology authoring and querying  bernardi  calvanese    thorne        kaufmann   bernstein        schwitter      b   the emphasis is
mostly on the direction from cnl to owl or query languages   more relevant to our work
are cnls like sos and ace  to which automatic mappings from normative owl syntaxes are
available  by feeding an owl ontology expressed  for example  in functional style syntax
to a mapping that translates to an english like cnl  all the axioms of the ontology can be
turned into english like sentences  systems of this kind are often called ontology verbalizers 
this term  however  also includes systems that translate from owl to english like statements that do not belong in an explicitly defined cnl  halaschek wiener  golbeck  parsia 
kolovski    hendler        schutte        power   third        power        stevens 
malone  williams  power    third        liang  stevens  scott    rector      b  
although verbalizers can be viewed as performing a kind of light nlg  they typically
translate axioms one by one  as already noted  without considering the coherence  or topical cohesion  of the resulting texts  usually without aggregating sentences nor generating
referring expressions  and often by producing sentences that are not entirely fluent or natural  for example  ace and sos occasionally use variables instead of referring expressions
 schwitter et al          also  verbalizers typically do not employ domain dependent generation resources and typically do not support multiple languages  expressing the exact
meaning of the axioms of the ontology in an unambiguous manner is considered more important in verbalizers than composing a fluent and coherent text in multiple languages 
partly because the verbalizers are typically intended to be used by domain experts

applied to owl  power         and round trip authoring  davis  iqbal  funk  tablan  bontcheva  cunningham    handschuh        are bidirectional  but focus mostly on ontology authoring and querying

some verbalizers use ideas and methods from nlg  for example  some verbalizers include
sentence aggregation  williams   power        and text planning  liang  scott  stevens   
rector      a   overall  however  nlg methods have been used only to a very limited extent
with owl ontologies  a notable exception is ontosum  bontcheva         which generates
natural language descriptions of individuals  but apparently not classes  from rdf schema
and owl ontologies  it is an extension of miakt  bontcheva   wilks         which was

maynard    cunningham        and they provide graphical user interfaces to manipulate
domain dependent generation resources  bontcheva   cunningham         no detailed
description of ontosum appears to have been published  however  and the system does
not seem to be publicly available  unlike naturalowl  also  no trials of ontosum with
independently created ontologies seem to have been published  more information on how
ontosum compares to naturalowl can be found elsewhere  androutsopoulos et al         
mellish and sun        focus on lexicalization and sentence aggregation  aiming to
produce a single aggregated sentence from an input collection of rdf triples  by contrast 
naturalowl produces multi sentence texts  in complementary work  mellish et al        
consider content selection for texts describing owl classes  unlike naturalowl  their system
does not express only facts that are explicit in the ontology  but also facts deduced from
the ontology  nguyen et al         discuss how the proof trees of facts deduced from owl
ontologies can be explained in natural language  it would be particularly interesting to
examine how deduction and explanation mechanisms could be added to naturalowl 

   the processing stages and resources of naturalowl
naturalowl adopts a pipeline architecture  which is common in nlg  reiter   dale        
though the number and purpose of its components often vary  mellish  scott  cahill  paiva 
evans    reape         our system generates texts in three stages  document planning 
micro planning  and surface realization  discussed in the following sections  see figure   
    document planning
document planning consists of content selection  where the system selects the information
to convey  and text planning  where it plans the structure of the text to be generated 
      content selection
in content selection  the system first retrieves from the ontology all the owl statements
that are relevant to the class or individual to be described  it then converts the selected
   

figenerating natural language descriptions from owl ontologies

owl statements to message triples  which are easier to express as sentences  and it finally
selects among the message triples the ones to be expressed 
owl statements for individual targets
let us first consider content selection when naturalowl is asked to describe an individual
 an entity   and let us call that individual the target  the system scans the owl statements
of the ontology  looking for statements of the forms listed in the left column of table    
in effect  it retrieves all the statements that describe the target directly  as opposed to
statements describing another individual or a  named  class the target is related to 
owl allows arbitrarily many nested objectunionof and objectintersectionof operators  which may lead to statements that are very difficult to express in natural language 
to simplify text generation and to ensure that the resulting texts are easy to comprehend 
we do not allow nested objectintersectionof and objectunionof operators in the ontologies the texts are generated from  in table    this restriction is enforced by requiring class
identifiers to appear at some points where owl also allows expressions that construct unnamed classes using operators  if an ontology uses unnamed classes at points where table  
requires class identifiers  named classes   it can be easily modified to comply with table  
by defining new named classes for nested unnamed ones   in practice  nested objectunionof
and objectintersectionof operators are rare  see the work of power et al   power       
power   third        power        for information of the frequencies of different types of
owl statements   
statements of the form classassertion class target   may be quite complex  because
class is not necessarily a class identifier  it may also be an expression constructing an
unnamed class  as in the following example  this is why there are multiple rows for
classassertion in table   
classassertion 
objectintersectionof  wine
objecthasvalue  locatedin  stemilionregion 
objecthasvalue  hascolor  red 
objecthasvalue  madefrom  cabernetsauvignongrape 
 chateauteyssier     

objecthasvalue  hasflavor  strong 
objectmaxcardinality    madefrom  

naturalowl would express the owl statement above by generating a text like the following 
the      chateau teyssier is a wine from the st  emilion region  it has red color and strong flavor  it
is made from exactly one grape variety  cabernet sauvignon grapes 

recall that the texts of naturalowl are intended to be read by end users  hence  we
prefer to generate texts that may not emphasize enough some of the subtleties of the owl
   some owl statements shown in table   with two arguments can actually have more arguments  but they
can be converted to the forms shown 
   it is also easy to automatically detect nested unnamed classes and replace them  again automatically 
by new named classes  classes with owl identifiers   the domain author would have to be consulted 
though  to provide meaningful owl identifiers for the new classes  otherwise arbitrary identifiers would
have to be used  and natural language names for the new classes  see section       below  
    one could also refactor some nested operators  for example  t    a  b    c  d   is equivalent to
t   a  b  and t   c  d   the conversion to message triples  to be discussed below  in effect
also performs some refactoring  but it cannot cope with all the possible nested union and intersection
operators  which is why we disallow them as a general rule

figenerating natural language descriptions from owl ontologies

stricter texts of this kind  however  seem inappropriate for end users  in fact  it could be
argued that even mentioning that the wine is made from exactly one grape variety in the
text that naturalowl produces is inappropriate for end users  our system can be instructed
to avoid mentioning this information via user modeling annotations  discussed below 
owl statements for class targets
if the system is asked to describe a class  rather than an individual  it scans the ontology
for statements of the forms listed in the left column of table    the class to be described
must be a named one  meaning that it must have an owl identifier  and target denotes
its identifier  again  to simplify the generation process and to avoid producing complicated
texts  table   requires class identifiers to appear at some points where owl also allows
expressions that construct unnamed classes using operators  if an ontology uses unnamed
classes at points where table   requires class identifiers  it can be easily modified 
in texts describing classes  it is difficult to express informally the difference between
equivalentclasses and subclassof  equivalentclasses c  c    means that any individual
of c  also belongs in c    and vice versa  by contrast  subclassof c  c    means that any
member of c  also belongs in c    but the reverse is not necessarily true  if we replace
equivalentclasses by subclassof in the definition of stemilion of page      any member
of stemilion is still necessarily also a member of the intersection  but a wine with all the
characteristics of the intersection is not necessarily a member of stemilion  consequently 
one should perhaps add sentences like the ones shown in italics below  when expressing
equivalentclasses and subclassof  respectively 
st  emilion is a kind of bordeaux from the st  emilion region  it has red color and strong flavor  it is
made from exactly one grape variety  cabernet sauvignon grapes  every st  emilion has these properties 
and anything that has these properties is a st  emilion 
st  emilion is a kind of bordeaux from the st  emilion region  it has red color and strong flavor  it is
made from exactly one grape variety  cabernet sauvignon grapes  every st  emilion has these properties 
but something may have these properties without being a st  emilion 

naturalowl produces the same texts  without the sentences in italics  for both subclassof
and equivalentclasses  to avoid generating texts that sound too formal  also  it may
not mention some of the information of the ontology about a target class  e g   that a st 
emilion has strong flavor   when user modeling indicates that this information is already
known or that the text should not exceed a particular length  hence  the generated texts
express necessary  not sufficient conditions for individuals to belong in the target class 
owl statements for second level targets
in some applications  expressing additional owl statements that are indirectly related
to the target may be desirable  let us assume  for example  that the target is the individual
exhibit    and that the following directly relevant statements have been retrieved from the
ontology  naturalowl would express them by generating a text like the one below 
classassertion  aryballos  exhibit   
objectpropertyassertion  locationfound  exhibit    heraionofdelos 
objectpropertyassertion  creationperiod  exhibit    archaicperiod 
objectpropertyassertion  paintingtechniqueused  exhibit    blackfiguretechnique

the names of classes and individuals can be shown as hyperlinks to indicate that they can

more precisely  assuming that the target is an individual  the subsequent targets  called
second level targets  are the targets class  provided that it is a named one  and the individuals the target is directly linked to via object properties  naturalowl considers second level
targets only when the current target is an individual  because with class targets  second level
targets often lead to complicated texts  to retrieve owl statements for both the current
and the second level targets  when applicable   or only for the current target  we set the
maximum fact distance to   or    respectively  returning to exhibit    let us assume that

was a small      bodies with as a string  i e   as a canned sentence  rather than defining
classes  properties  and individuals for spreading actions  bodies  etc  and generating the
sentence from a logical meaning representation  canned sentences  however  have to be
entered in multiple versions  if several languages or user types need to be supported 
converting owl statements to message triples
tables   and   also show how the retrieved owl statements can be rewritten as triples
of the form hs  p  oi  where s is the target or a second level target  o is an individual 
datatype value  class  or a set of individuals  datatype values  or classes that s is mapped
to  and p specifies the kind of mapping  we call s the semantic subject or owner of the
triple  and o the semantic object or filler   the triple can also be viewed as a field named
p   owned by s  and filled by o  for example  the owl statements about exhibit   shown
above  including those about the second level targets  are converted to the following triples 
  exhibit    instanceof   aryballos 
  exhibit     locationfound   heraionofdelos 
  exhibit     creationperiod   archaicperiod

fiandroutsopoulos  lampouras    galanis

figure    graph view of message triples 
and  is a property of the ontology  we hereafter call properties all three types of p  
though types  ii  and  iii  are strictly not properties in the terminology of owl  when
we need to distinguish between the three types  we use the terms property of the ontology 
domain independent property  and modified property  respectively 
every owl statement or collection of owl statements can be represented as a set of rdf
triples    the triples of tables    are similar  but not the same as rdf triples  most notably  expressions of the form modifier   cannot be used as p in rdf triples  to avoid confusion  we call message triples the triples of tables     to distinguish them from rdf triples 
as with rdf triples  message triples can be viewed as forming a graph  figure   shows the
graph for the message triples of exhibit    the triple linking blackfiguretechnique to a
canned sentence is not shown to save space  the second level targets are the classes and
individuals at distance one from the target  exhibit       by contrast  the graph for the
rdf triples representing the owl statements would be more complicated  and second level
targets would not always be at distance one from the target 
each message triple is intended to be easily expressible as a simple sentence  which is
not always the case with rdf triples representing owl statements  the message triples also
capture similarities of the sentences to be generated that may be less obvious when looking
at the original owl statements or the rdf triples representing them  for example  the
classassertion and subclassof statements below are mapped to identical message triples 
apart from the identifiers of the individual and the class  and the similarity of the message
triples reflects the similarity of the resulting sentences  also shown below 
classassertion objectmaxcardinality    madefromgrape   product    
  product     maxcardinality  madefromgrape     

product     is made from at most one grape 

    see http   www w  org tr owl  mapping to rdf  
    instead of retrieving the owl statements about the target and second level targets and then converting
them to message triples  one could equivalently convert all the owl statements of the ontology to message
triples and select the message triples connecting the target to nodes up to distance two from the target 

   

figenerating natural language descriptions from owl ontologies

subclassof  stemilion objectmaxcardinality    madefromgrape  
  stemilion  maxcardinality  madefromgrape     

st  emilion is made from at most one grape 

by contrast  without the conversion to message triples  the owl statements and the rdf
triples representing them would lead to more difficult to follow sentences like the following 
product     is a member of the class of individuals that are made from at most one grape 
st  emilion is a subclass of the class of individuals that are made from at most one grape 

as a further example  tables   and   discard objectintersectionof operators  producing
multiple message triples instead  for example  the equivalentclasses statement defining
stemilion on page     would be converted to the following message triples 
  stemilion 
  stemilion 
  stemilion 
  stemilion 
  stemilion 
  stemilion 

isa   bordeaux 
 locatedin   stemilionregion 
 hascolor   red 
 hasflavor   strong 
 madefromgrape   cabernetsauvignongrape 
maxcardinality  madefromgrape     

the resulting message triples correspond to the sentences below  where subsequent references to stemilion have been replaced by pronouns to improve readability  the sentences
could also be aggregated into longer ones  as discussed in later sections 
st  emilion is a kind of bordeaux  it is from the st  emilion region  it has red color  it has strong flavor 
it is made from cabernet sauvignon grape  it is made from at most one grape variety 

by contrast the original owl statement of page     and the rdf triples representing it
would lead to the stricter text of page      which is inappropriate for end users  as already
noted  notice  also  that table   converts equivalentclasses and subclassof statements to
identical triples  where p is isa  since naturalowl produces the same texts for both kinds
of statements  as already discussed 
tables   and   also replace objectunionof operators by disjunctions of message triples 
the following owl statement is mapped to the message triple shown below 
classassertion 
unionof objecthasvalue  hasflavor  strong  objecthasvalue  hasflavor  medium  
 housewine 
or   housewine   hasflavor   strong     housewine   hasflavor   medium  

which leads to the first sentence below  the sentence can then be shortened during aggregation  leading to the second sentence below 
the house wine has strong flavor or it has medium flavor 
the house wine has strong or medium flavor 

   

fiandroutsopoulos  lampouras    galanis

by contrast  the owl statement and the corresponding rdf triples in effect say that 
the house wine is a member of the union of   i  the class of all wines that have strong flavor  and  ii  the
class of all wines that have medium flavor 

interest scores and repetitions
expressing all the message triples of all the retrieved owl statements is not always
appropriate  let us assume  for example  that the maximum fact distance is   and that a
description of exhibit   of figure   has been requested by a museum visitor  it may be the
case that the visitor has already encountered other archaic exhibits  and that the duration
of the archaic period was mentioned in previous descriptions  repeating the duration of
the period may  thus  be undesirable  we may also want to exclude message triples that
are uninteresting to particular types of users  for example  there may be message triples
providing bibliographic references  which children would probably find uninteresting 
naturalowl provides mechanisms allowing the domain author to assign an importance
score to every possible message triple  and possibly different scores for different user types
 e g   adults  children   the score is a non negative integer indicating how interesting a user
of the corresponding type will presumably find the information of the message triple  if the
information has not already been conveyed to the user  in the museum projects naturalowl
was originally developed for  the interest scores ranged from    completely uninteresting  to
   very interesting   but a different range can also be used  the scores can be specified for
all the message triples that involve a particular property p  e g   p   madefrom   or for all
the message triples that involve semantic subjects s of a particular class  e g   s  statue
or s   statue  and a particular property p   or for message triples that involve particular
semantic subjects  e g   s  exhibit    and a particular property p   for example  we may
wish to specify that the materials of the exhibits in a collection are generally of medium
interest  p   madefrom  score     that the materials of statues are of lower interest  s 
statue  p   madefrom  score     perhaps because all the statues of the collection are made
from stone  but that the material of the particular statue exhibit   is very important  s  
exhibit    p   madefrom  score     perhaps because exhibit   is a gold statue 
we do not discuss the mechanisms that can be used to assign interest scores to message
triples in this article  but a detailed description of these mechanisms can be found elsewhere
 androutsopoulos et al          we also note that when human authored texts describing
individuals and classes of the ontology are available along with the owl statements or  more
generally  the logical facts they express  statistical and machine learning methods can be
employed to learn to automatically select or assign interest scores to logical facts  duboue  
mckeown        barzilay   lapata        kelly  copestake    karamanis         another
possibility  demir  carberry    mccoy        would be to compute the interest scores with
graph algorithms like pagerank  brin   page        
the domain author can also specify how many times each message triple has to be
repeated  before it can be assumed that users of different types have assimilated it  once a
triple has been assimilated  it is never repeated in texts for the same user  for example  the
domain author can specify that children assimilate the duration of a historical period when
it has been mentioned twice  hence  the system may repeat  for example  the duration of
the archaic period in two texts  naturalowl maintains a personal model for each end user 
the model shows which message triples were conveyed to the particular user in previous
   

figenerating natural language descriptions from owl ontologies

texts  and how many times  again  more information about the user modeling mechanisms
of naturalowl can be found elsewhere  androutsopoulos et al         
selecting the message triples to convey
when asked to describe a target  naturalowl first retrieves from the ontology the relevant owl statements  possibly also for second level targets  it then converts the retrieved
statements to message triples  and consults their interest scores and the personal user models to rank the message triples by decreasing interest score  discarding triples that have
already been assimilated  if a message triple about the target has been assimilated  then all
the message triples about second level targets that are connected to the assimilated triple
are also discarded  for example  if the creationperiod triple  edge  of figure   has been assimilated  then the triples about the archaic period  the edges leaving from archaicperiod 
are also discarded  the system then selects up to maxmessagesperpage triples from the most
interesting remaining ones  maxmessagesperpage is a parameter whose value can be set to
smaller or larger values for types of users that prefer shorter or longer texts  respectively 
limitations of content selection
owl allows one to define the broadest possible domain and range of a particular property 
using statements like the following 
objectpropertydomain  madefrom  wine 

objectpropertyrange  madefrom  grape 

in practice  more specific range restrictions are then imposed for particular subclasses of
the propertys domain  for example  the following statements specify that when madefrom
is used with individuals from the subclass greekwine of wine  the range  possible values  of
madefrom should be restricted to individuals from the subclass greekgrape of grape 
subclassof  greekwine  wine  subclassof  greekgrape  grape 
subclassof  greekwine allvaluesfrom  madefrom  greekgrape  

naturalowl considers allvaluesfrom and similar restrictions  see tables   and     but not
objectpropertydomain and objectpropertyrange statements  the latter typically provide
too general and  hence  uninteresting information from the perspective of end users 
more generally  naturalowl does not consider owl statements that express axioms
about properties  meaning statements declaring that a property is symmetric  asymmetric 
reflexive  irreflexive  transitive  functional  that its inverse is functional  that a property is
the inverse of  or disjoint with another property  that it is subsumed by a chain of other
properties  or that it is a subproperty  more specific  of another property  statements of
this kind are mostly useful in consistency checks  in deduction  or when generating texts
describing the properties themselves  e g   what being a grandparent of somebody means    
      text planning
for each target  the previous mechanisms produce the message triples to be expressed 
with each triple intended to be easily expressible as a single sentence  the text planner of
naturalowl then orders the message triples  in effect ordering the corresponding sentences 
    subproperties without sentence plans  discussed below  could inherit sentence plans from their superproperties  but in that case we automatically extract sentence plans from the ontology instead 

   

fiandroutsopoulos  lampouras    galanis

global and local coherence
when considering global coherence  text planners attempt to build a structure  usually
a tree  that shows how the clauses  sentences  or larger segments of the text are related to
each other  often in terms of rhetorical relations  mann   thompson         the allowed
or preferred orderings of the sentences  or segments  often follow  at least partially  from
the global coherence structure  in the texts  however  that naturalowl is intended to
generate  the global coherence structures tend to be rather uninteresting  because most of
the sentences simply provide additional information about the target or the second level
targets  which is why global coherence is not considered in naturalowl   
when considering local coherence  text planners usually aim to maximize measures that
examine whether or not adjacent sentences  or segments  continue to focus on the same entities or  if the focus changes  how smooth the transition is  many local coherence measures
are based on centering theory  ct   grosz  joshi    weinstein        poesio  stevenson 
  di eugenio         consult the work of karamanis et al         for an introduction to
ct and a ct based analysis m piros texts  which also applies to the texts of naturalowl 
when the maximum fact distance of naturalowl is    all the sentence to sentence transitions are of a type known in ct as continue  which is the preferred type  if the maximum
fact distance is    however  the transitions are not always continue  we repeat below the
long aryballos description of page     without sentence aggregation  for readers familiar
with ct  we show in italics the most salient noun phrase of each sentence un   which realizes
the discourse entity known as the preferred center cp  un    the underlined noun phrases realize the backward looking center cb  un    roughly speaking the most salient discourse entity
of the previous sentence that is also mentioned in the current sentence 
    this  exhibit  is an aryballos      an aryballos is a kind of vase      an aryballos was a small
spherical vase with a narrow neck  in which the athletes kept the oil they spread their bodies with  
    this aryballos was found at the heraion of delos      it was created during the archaic period     
the archaic period was when the greek ancient city states developed      it spans from     bc to    
bc       this aryballos was decorated with the black figure technique      in the black figure technique 
the silhouettes are rendered in black on the pale surface of the clay  and details are engraved       
this aryballos is currently in the museum of delos 

in sentence    where cp  u    is the target exhibit  cb  u    is undefined and the transition from
sentence   to   is a nocb  a type of transition to be avoided  we mark nocb transitions with
bullets  in sentence    cp  u      cb  u       cb  u     and we have a kind of transition known as
smooth shift  poesio et al          less preferred than continue  but better than nocb 
another nocb occurs from sentence   to    followed by a smooth shift from sentence  
to    and another nocb from sentence   to     all the other transitions are continue 
the text planner of naturalowl groups together sentences  message triples  that describe a particular second level target  e g   sentences         and    and places each
group immediately after the sentence that introduces the corresponding second level target
 immediately after sentences       and     thus the transition from a sentence that introduces a second level target to the first sentence that describes the second level target  e g  
    liang et al       a  and power        seem to agree that very few rhetorical relations are relevant when
generating texts from owl ontologies 

   

figenerating natural language descriptions from owl ontologies

from sentence   to    from   to    from   to    is a smooth shift  or a continue in the
special case from the initial sentence   to     a nocb occurs only at sentences that return
to providing information about the primary target  after a group of sentences that provide
information about a second level target  all the other transitions are of type continue 
a simple strategy to avoid nocb transitions would be to end the generated text once
all the message triples that describe a second level target have been reported  and record
in the user model that the other message triples that content selection provided were not
actually conveyed  in our example  this would generate sentences   to    then if the user
requested more information about the exhibit  sentences   to   would be generated etc 
topical order
when ordering sentences  we also need to consider the topical similarity of adjacent
sentences  compare  for example  the following two texts 
 locationsection the stoa of zeus eleutherios is located in the western part of the agora  it is located
next to the temple of apollo patroos    buildsection it was built around     bc  it was built in the doric
style  it was built out of porous stone and marble    usesection it was used during the classical period 
the hellenistic period  and the roman period  it was used as a religious place and a meeting point  
 conditionsection it was destroyed in the late roman period  it was excavated in      and       today it
is in good condition  
the stoa of zeus eleutherios was built in the doric style  it was excavated in      and       it was

temple of apollo patroos  it was built around     bc  today it is in good condition  it was used during
the classical period  the hellenistic period  and the roman period 

even though both texts contain the same sentences  the second text is more difficult to
follow  if at all acceptable  the first one is better  because it groups together topically
related sentences  we mark the sentence groups in the first text by curly brackets  but the
brackets would not be shown to end users  in longer texts  sentence groups may optionally
be shown as separate paragraphs or sections  which is why we call them sections 
to allow the message triples  and the corresponding sentences  to be grouped by topic 
the domain author may define sections  e g   locationsection  buildsection  and assign
each property to a single section  e g   assign the properties isinarea and isnextto to
locationsection   each message triple is then placed in the section of its property  an
ordering of the sections and of the properties inside each section can also be specified  causing the message triples to be ordered accordingly  e g   we may specify that locationsection
should precede buildsection  and that inside locationsection  the isinarea property should
be expressed before isnextto   the sections  the assignments of the properties to sections 
and the order of the sections and the properties are defined in the domain dependent generation resources  androutsopoulos et al         
the overall text planning algorithm
naturalowls text planning algorithm is summarized in figure    if the message triples
to be ordered include triples that describe second level targets  i e   triples hs  p  oi whose
owner s is a second level target  then the triples of the primary and each second level target

figure    a lexicon entry for the verb to find 
    micro planning
the processing stages we have discussed so far select and order the message triples to
be expressed  the next stage  micro planning  consists of three sub stages  lexicalization 
sentence aggregation  and generation of referring expressions  see also figure   on page     
      lexicalization
during lexicalization  nlg systems usually turn the output of content selection  in our case 
the message triples  to abstract sentence specifications  in naturalowl  for every property
of the ontology and every supported natural language  the domain author may specify one or
more template like sentence plans to indicate how message triples involving that property
can be expressed  we discuss below how sentence plans are specified  but first a slight
deviation is necessary  to briefly discuss the lexicon entries of naturalowl 
lexicon entries
for each verb  noun  or adjective that the domain author wishes to use in the sentence
plans  a lexicon entry has to be provided  to specify the inflectional forms of that word   
all the lexicon entries are multilingual  currently bilingual   this allows sentence plans to be
reused across similar languages when no better option is available  as discussed elsewhere
 androutsopoulos et al          figure   shows the lexicon entry for the verb whose english
base form is find  as viewed by the domain author when using the protege plug in of
naturalowl  the identifier of the lexicon entry is tofindlex  the english part of the entry
shows that the base form is find  the simple past is found etc  similarly  the greek
part of the lexicon entry would show the base form of the corresponding verb   
and its inflectional forms in the various tenses  persons etc  the lexicon entries for nouns
and adjectives are very similar 
most of the english inflectional forms could be automatically produced from the base
forms by using simple morphology rules  we hope to exloit an existing english morphology
component  such as that of simplenlg  gatt   reiter         in future work  similar
morphology rules for greek were used in the authoring tool of m piro  androutsopoulos et
al          and we hope to include them in a future version of naturalowl  rules of this kind
would reduce the time a domain author spends creating lexicon entries  in the ontologies
we have considered  however  a few dozens of lexicon entries for verbs  nouns  and adjectives
    no lexicon entries need to be provided for closed class words  like determiners and prepositions 

   

fiandroutsopoulos  lampouras    galanis

suffice  hence  even without facilities to automatically produce inflectional forms  creating
the lexicon entries is rather trivial  another possibility would be to exploit a general purpose
lexicon or lexical database  like wordnet  fellbaum        or celex  though resources of
this kind often do not cover the highly technical concepts of ontologies   
the lexicon entries and  more generally  all the domain dependent generation resources
of naturalowl are stored as instances of an owl ontology  other than the ontology the texts
are generated from  that describes the linguistic resources of the system  androutsopoulos
et al          the domain author  however  interacts with the plug in and does not need to
be aware of the owl representation of the resources  by representing the domain dependent
generation resources in owl  it becomes easier to publish them on the web  check them for
inconsistencies etc   as with other owl ontologies 
sentence plans
in naturalowl  a sentence plan is a sequence of slots  along with instructions specifying how to fill them in  figure   shows an english sentence plan for the property
usedduringperiod  as viewed by the domain author when using the protege plug in of naturalowl  the sentence plan expresses message triples of the form hs  usedduringperiod  oi
by producing sentences like the following 
 slot  this stoa   slot  was used   slot  during   slot  the classical period  
 slot  the stoa of zeus eleutherios   slot  was used   slot  during   slot  the classical period  the hellenistic
period  and the roman period  

the first slot of the sentence plan of figure   is to be filled in with an automatically
generated referring expression for the owner  s  of the triple  for example  if the triple to
express is   stoazeuseleutherios   usedduringperiod   classicalperiod   an appropriate
referring expression for s may be a demonstrative noun phrase like this stoa  a pronoun
 it   or the monuments natural language name  the stoa of zeus eleutherios   we
discuss the generation of referring expressions below  along with mechanisms to specify
natural language names  the sentence plan also specifies that the referring expression must

its or this stoas  as in this stoas height is   meters  
the second slot is to be filled in with a form of the verb whose lexicon identifier is
touseverb  the verb form must be in the simple past and passive voice  in positive polarity
 as opposed to was not used   its number must agree with the number of the expression
in the first slot  for example  we want to generate the stoa of zheus eleutherios was
used  but stoas were used  the third slot is filled in with the preposition during 
the fourth slot is filled in with an expression for the filler  o  of the message triple  in
accusative case    with   stoazeuseleutherios   usedduringperiod   classicalperiod  
the slot would be filled in with the natural language name of classicalperiod    the
sentence plan also allows the resulting sentence to be aggregated with other sentences

figure    a sentence plan for the property usedduringperiod 
more generally  the instructions of a sentence plan may indicate that a slot should be
filled in with one of the following  ivii  
 i  a referring expression for the s  owner  of the message triple  a sentence plan may
specify a particular type of referring expression to use  e g   always use the natural language
name of s  or  as in the example of figure    it may allow the system to automatically
produce the most appropriate type of referring expression depending on the context 
 ii  a verb for which there is a lexicon entry  in a particular form  possibly a form that
agrees with another slot  the polarity of the verb can also be manually specified or  if the
filler  o  of the message triple is a boolean value  the polarity can be automatically set to
match that value  e g   to produce it does not have a built in flash when o is false  
 iii  a noun or adjective from the lexicon  in a particular form  e g   case  number   or
in a form that agrees with another slot 
 iv  a preposition or  v  a fixed string 
 vi  an expression for the o  filler  of the triple  if o is an individual or class  then the
expression is the natural language name of o  if o is a datatype value  e g   an integer  
then the value itself is inserted in the slot  and similarly if o is a disjunction or conjunction
of datatype values  individuals  or classes 
 vii  a concatenation of property values of o  provided that o is an individual  for
example  we may need to express a message triple like the first one below  whose  anonymous
in the rdf sense  object  n is linked to both a numeric value  via hasamount  and an
individual standing for the currency  via hascurrency  
  tecra    hasprice    n 

   n   hasamount         xsd float 

   n   hascurrency   eurocurrency 

we would want the sentence plan to include a slot filled in with the concatenation of the
hasamount value of  n and the natural language name of the hascurrency value of  n  e g  
    euro in english       in greek  
default sentence plan
if no sentence plan has been provided for a particular property of the ontology  naturalowl uses a default sentence plan  consisting of three slots  the first slot is filled in
with an automatically generated referring expression for the owner  s  of the triple  in
nominative case  the second slot is filled in with a tokenized form of the owl identifier of
the property  the third slot is filled in with an appropriate expression for the filler  o  of
   

fiandroutsopoulos  lampouras    galanis

the triple  as discussed above  in accusative case  if applicable   for the following message
triple  the default sentence plan would produce the sentence shown below 
  stoazeuseleutherios   usedduringperiod  and  classicalperiod   hellenisticperiod   romanperiod  

stoa zeus eleutherios used during period classical period  hellenistic period  and roman period 

notice that we use a single message triple with an and      filler  instead of a different
triple for each period  this kind of triple merging is in effect a form of aggregation  discussed
below  but it takes place during content selection  also  we assumed in the sentence above
that the natural language names of the individuals have not been provided either  in this
case  naturalowl uses tokenized forms of the owl identifiers of the individuals instead 
the tokenizer of naturalowl can handle both camelcase  e g    usedduringperiod  and
underscore style  e g    used during period   when other styles are used in the identifiers
of properties  classes  and individuals  the output of the tokenizer may be worse than the
example suggests  but the resulting sentences can be improved by providing sentence plans
and by associating classes and individuals with natural language names  discussed below 
using rdfs label strings
owl properties  and other elements of owl ontologies  can be labeled with strings in
multiple natural languages using the rdfs label annotation property  defined in the rdf and
owl standards  for example  the usedduringperiod property could be labeled with was
used during as shown below  there could be similar labels for greek and other languages 
annotationassertion rdfs label  usedduringperiod  was used during  en 

if an rdfs label string has been specified for the property of a message triple  naturalowl
uses that string in the second slot of the default sentence plan  the quality of the resulting
sentences can  thus  be improved  if the rdfs label strings are more natural phrases than
the tokenized property identifiers  with the rdfs label shown above  the default sentence
plan would produce the following sentence 
stoa zeus eleutherios was used during classical period  hellenistic period  and roman period 

even with rdfs label strings  the default sentence plan may produce sentences with disfluencies  also  the rdfs label strings do not indicate the grammatical categories of their
words  and this does not allow the system to apply many of the sentence aggregation rules
discussed below  a further limitation of the default sentence plan is that it does not allow
the slots for s and o to be preceded or followed  respectively  by any other phrase 
sentence plans for domain independent and modified properties
the domain author does not need to provide sentence plans for domain independent
properties  e g   instanceof  isa  see tables      these properties have fixed  domainindependent semantics  hence  built in sentence plans are used  the english built in sentence plans  which also serve as further examples of sentence plans  are summarized in

plans as templates in table    and we do not show the sentence plans for negated domainindependent properties  e g   not isa    which are similar  additional slot restrictions not

table    built in english sentence plans for domain independent properties 
shown in figure   require  for example  subject verb number agreement and the verb forms

articles or no articles at all should be used  e g   the n   mini  exhibit     a st  emilion or the st  emilion or simply st  emilion   and what the default number of each
name is  e g   a wine color is or wine colors are   it is also possible to modify the
built in sentence plans  for example  in a museum context we may wish to generate an
aryballos was a kind of vase instead of an aryballos is a kind of vase 
the sentence plans for modified properties  e g   mincardinality manufacturedby   see
tables     are also automatically produced  from the sentence plans of the unmodified
properties  e g   manufacturedby  
specifying the appropriateness of sentence plans
multiple sentence plans may be provided for the same property of the ontology and the
same language  different appropriateness scores  similar to the interest scores of properties 
can then be assigned to alternative sentence plans per user type  this allows specifying  for
example  that a sentence plan that generates sentences like this amphora depicts miltiades is less appropriate when interacting with children  compared to an alternative sentence
plan with a more common verb  e g   shows   automatically constructed sentence plans
inherit the appropriateness scores of the sentence plans they are constructed from 
related work on sentence plans
the sentence plans of naturalowl are similar to expressions of sentence planning languages like spl  kasper   whitney        that are used in generic surface realizers  such as
fuf surge  elhadad   robin         kpml  bateman         realpro  lavoie   ram   

fiandroutsopoulos  lampouras    galanis

bow         nitrogen halogen  langkilde         and openccg  white         the
sentence plans of naturalowl  however  leave fewer decisions to subsequent stages  this
has the disadvantage that our sentence plans often include information that could be obtained from large scale grammars or corpora  wan  dras  dale    paris         on the
other hand  the input to generic surface realizers often refers to non elementary linguistic concepts  e g   features of a particular syntax theory  and concepts of an upper model
 bateman         the latter is a high level domain independent ontology that may use a very
different conceptualization than the ontology the texts are to be generated from  hence 
linguistic expertise  for example in systemic grammars  halliday        in the case of kpml
 bateman         and effort to understand the upper model are required  by contrast  the
sentence plans of naturalowl require the domain author to be familiar with only elementary linguistic concepts  e g   tense  number   and they do not require familiarity with an
upper model  our sentence plans are simpler than  for example  the templates of busemann and horacek        or mcroy et al          in that they do not allow  for instance 
conditionals or recursive invokation of other templates  see also the work of reiter       
and van deemter et al         for a discussion of template based vs  more principled nlg 
when corpora of texts annotated with the message triples they express are available 
templates can also be automatically extracted  ratnaparkhi        angeli  liang    klein 
      duma   klein         statistical methods that jointly perform content selection 
lexicalization  and surface realization have also been proposed  liang  jordan    klein 
      konstas   lapata      a      b   but they are currently limited to generating single
sentences from flat records 
specifying natural language names
the domain author can assign natural language  nl  names to the individuals and
named classes of the ontology  recall that by named classes we mean classes that have owl
identifiers  if an individual or named class is not assigned an nl name  then its rdfs label
or a tokenized form of its identifier is used instead  the nl names that the domain author
provides are specified much as sentence plans  i e   as sequences of slots  for example  we
may specify that the english nl name of the class italianwinepiemonte is the concatenation
of the following slots  we explain the slots below 
 indef an   adj italian   headnoun wine   prep from   def the   noun piemonte   noun region 

this would allow naturalowl to generate the sentence shown below from the following
message triple  a tokenized form of the identifier of wine   is used 
  wine    instanceof   italianwinepiemonte 

wine    is an italian wine from the piemonte region 

similarly  we may assign the following nl names to the individuals classicalperiod  stoa
zeuseleutherios  gl      and the classes computerscreen and red  naturalowl makes no
distinction between common and proper nouns  both are entered as nouns in the lexicon 
and may be multi word  e g   zeus eleutherios   naturalowl can also be instructed to
capitalize the words of particular slots  e g   classical  
   

figenerating natural language descriptions from owl ontologies

 def the   adj classical   headnoun period     def the   headnoun stoa   prep of   noun zeus eleutherios  
 headnoun gl          indef a   noun computer   headnoun screen     headadj red 

these nl names could be used to express the message triples shown below 
  stoazeuseleutherios   usedduringperiod 

 classicalperiod 

the stoa of zeus eleutherios was used during the classical period 
  gl      instanceof   computerscreen 

  gl      instanceof   red 

gl      is a computer screen  gl      is red 

more precisely  each nl name is a sequence of slots  with accompanying instructions
specifying how the slots are to be filled in  each slot can be filled in with 
 i  an article  definite or indefinite  the article in the first slot  if present  is treated as
the article of the overall nl name 
 ii  a noun or adjective flagged as the head  main word  of the nl name  exactly one
head must be specified per nl name and it must have a lexicon entry  the number and case
of the head  which is also taken to be the number and case of the overall nl name  can be
automatically adjusted per context  for example  different sentence plans may require the
same nl name to be in nominative case when used as a subject  but in accusative when used
as the object of a verb  and some aggregation rules  discussed below  may require a singular
nl name to be turned into plural  using the lexicon entries  which list the inflectional forms
of nouns and adjectives  naturalowl can adjust the nl names accordingly  the gender of
head adjectives can also be automatically adjusted  whereas the gender of head nouns is
fixed and specified by their lexicon entries 
 iii  any other noun or adjective  among those listed in the lexicon  the nl name may
require a particular inflectional form to be used  or it may require an inflectional form that
agrees with another slot of the nl name 
 iv  a preposition  or  v  any fixed string 
as with sentence plans  the domain author specifies nl names by using the protege
plug in of naturalowl  multiple nl names can be specified for the same individual or class 
and they can be assigned different appropriateness scores per user type  hence  different
terminology  e g   common names of diseases  can be used when generating texts for nonexperts  as opposed to texts for experts  e g   doctors   the domain author can also specify 
again using the plug in  if the nl names of particular individuals or classes should involve
definite  indefinite  or no articles  and if the nl names should be in singular or plural by
default  for example  we may prefer the texts to mention the class of aryballoi as a single
particular generic object  or by using an indefinite singular or plural form  as shown below 
the aryballos is a kind of vase  an aryballos is a kind of vase  aryballoi are a kind of vase

      sentence aggregation
the sentence plans of the previous section lead to a separate sentence for each message triple 
nlg systems often aggregate sentences into longer ones to improve readability  in naturalowl  the maximum number of sentences that can be aggregated to form a single longer
sentence is specified per user type via a parameter called maxmessagespersentence  in the
museum contexts our system was originally developed for  setting maxmessagespersentence
to   or   led to reasonable texts for adult visitors  whereas a value of   was used for children  the sentence aggregation of naturalowl is performed by a set of manually crafted
rules  intended to be domain independent  we do not claim that this set of rules  which
was initially based on the aggregation rules of m piro  melengoglou         is complete 
and we hope it will be extended in future work  see  for example  the work of dalianis
       for a rich set of aggregation rules    nevertheless  the current rules of naturalowl
already illustrate several aggregation opportunities that arise when generating texts from
owl ontologies 
to save space  we discuss only english sentence aggregation  greek aggregation is similar  we show mostly example sentences before and after aggregation  but the rules actually
operate on sentence plans and they also consider the message triples being expressed  the
rules are intended to aggregate short single clause sentences  sentence plans that produce
more complicated sentences may be flagged  using the tickbox at the bottom of figure
   to signal that aggregation should not affect their sentences  the aggregation rules apply almost exclusively to sentences that are adjacent in the ordering produced by the text
planner  the only exception are aggregation rules that involve sentences about cardinality
restrictions  hence  depending on the ordering of the text planner there may be more or
fewer aggregation opportunities  see the work of cheng and mellish        for related discussion  also  the aggregation rules of naturalowl operate on sentences of the same topical
section  because aggregating topically unrelated sentences often sounds unnatural 
the aggregation of naturalowl is greedy  for each of the rules discussed below  starting
from those discussed first  the system scans the original  ordered  sentences from first to
last  applying the rule wherever possible  provided that the rules application does not lead
to a sentence expressing more than maxmessagespersentence original sentences  if a rule can
be applied in multiple ways  for example to aggregate two or three sentences  the application
that aggregates the most sentences without violating maxmessagespersentence is preferred 
avoid repeating a noun with multiple adjectives  message triples of the form hs  p  o  i         
hs  p  on i will have been aggregated into a single message triple hs  p  and o            on  i 
if the nl names of o            on are  apart from possible initial determiners  sequences of
adjectives followed by the same head noun  then the head noun does not need to be repeated 
let us consider the following message triple  assuming that the nl names of the three
periods are as in the first sentence below  the original sentence will repeat period three
times  the aggregation rule omits all but the last occurrence of the head noun

cardinality restrictions and values  this is a set of rules that aggregate all the sentences  not
necessarily adjacent  that express message triples of the form hs  m  p    oi and hs  p  oi  for
the same s and p   with m being any of mincardinality  maxcardinality  exactcardinality 
when these rules are applied  maxmessagespersentence is ignored  for example  these rules
perform aggregations like the following 
model    is sold in at most three countries  model    is sold in at least three countries  model    is sold
in spain  italy  and greece 

 model    is sold in exactly three countries  spain  italy  and greece 

class and passive sentence  this rule aggregates  i  a sentence expressing a message triple
hs  instanceof  ci or hs  isa  ci and  ii  a passive immediately subsequent sentence expressing a single triple of the form hs  p  oi  for the same s  where p is an  unmodified  property
of the ontology  the subject and auxiliary verb of the second sentence are omitted 
bancroft chardonnay is a kind of chardonnay  it is made in bancroft 

 bancroft chardonnay is a

kind of chardonnay made in bancroft 

class and prepositional phrase  the second sentence now involves the verb to be in the
active simple present  immediately followed by a preposition  the other conditions are as in
the previous rule  the subject and verb of the second sentence are omitted 
bancroft chardonnay is a kind of chardonnay  it is from bancroft 

 bancroft chardonnay is a kind

of chardonnay from bancroft 

class and multiple adjectives  this rule aggregates  i  a sentence of the same form as in
the previous two rules  and  ii  one or more immediately preceding or subsequent sentences 
each expressing a single message triple hs  pi   oi i  for the same s  where pi are  unmodified 
properties of the ontology  each of the preceding or subsequent sentences must involve the
verb to be in the active simple present  immediately followed by only an adjective  the
adjectives are absorbed into sentence  i  maintaining their order 
this is a motorbike  it is red  it is expensive 

 this is a red  expensive motorbike 

same verb conjunction disjunction  in a sequence of sentences involving the same verb
form  each expressing a single message triple hs  pi   oi i  where s is the same in all the
triples and pi are  unmodified  properties of the ontology  a conjunction can be formed by
mentioning the subject and verb once  the and is omitted when a preposition follows 
 it has medium body and moderate flavor 
he was born in athens  he was born in        he was born in athens in      
it has medium body  it has moderate flavor 

a similar rule applies to sentences produced from disjunctions of message triples  as illustrated below  a variant of the first aggregation rule is then also applied 
the house wine has strong flavor or it has medium flavor 
flavor 

 the house wine has strong or medium flavor 
   

 the house wine has strong flavor or medium

fiandroutsopoulos  lampouras    galanis

different verbs conjunction  when there is a sequence of sentences  not involving the same
verb form  each expressing a message triple hs  pi   oi i  where s is the same in all the triples
and pi are  unmodified  properties of the ontology  a conjunction can be formed 
bancroft chardonnay is dry  it has moderate flavor  it comes from napa 

 bancroft chardonnay is

dry  it has moderate flavor  and it comes from napa 

      generating referring expressions
a sentence plan may require a referring expression to be generated for the s of a message
triple hs  p  oi  depending on the context  it may be better  for example  to use the nl
name of s  e g   the stoa of zeus eleutherios   a pronoun  e g   it   a demonstrative
noun phrase  e g   this stoa  etc  similar alternatives could be made available for o 
but naturalowl currently uses o itself  if it is a datatype value  or the nl name of o  its
tokenized identifier  or its rdfs label  if o is an entity or class  and similarly for conjunctions
and disjunctions in o  hence  below we focus only on referring expressions for s 
naturalowl currently uses a limited range of referring expressions  which includes only
nl names  or tokenized identifiers or rdfs label strings   pronouns  and noun phrases
involving only a demonstrative and the nl name of a class  e g   this vase   for example 
referring expressions that mention properties of s  e g   the vase from rome  are not
generated  although the current referring expression generation mechanisms of naturalowl
work reasonably well  they are best viewed as placeholders for more elaborate algorithms

koller    striegnitz        ren  van deemter    pan        
let us consider the following generated text  which expresses the triples hsi   pi   oi i
shown below  we do not aggregate sentences in this section  to illustrate more cases where
referring expressions are needed  aggregation would reduce  however  the number of pronouns  making the text less repetitive  for readers familiar with ct  section         we
show again in italics the noun phrase realizing cp  un    we show underlined the noun phrase
realizing cb  un    and we mark nocb transitions with bullets

naturalowl pronominalizes sn  for n      only if sn   sn    as in sentences          and
   since typically cp  ui     si   we obtain cp  un     cp  un     whenever sn is pronominalized  if the pronoun is resolved by the reader as intended  people tend to prefer readings
where cp  un     cp  un     if no other restriction is violated  e g   gender  number  world
knowledge   this helps the pronouns that naturalowl generates to be correctly resolved
by readers  even when they would appear to be potentially ambiguous  for example  the
pronoun of sentence   is most naturally understood as referring to the exhibit  as it is intended to  not the gallery  even though both are neuter and can be in excellent condition 
   

figenerating natural language descriptions from owl ontologies

note that with both referents  the transition from sentence   to   is a continue  hence 
transition type preferences play no role  the gender of each generated pronoun is the gender
of the  most appropriate  nl name of the s that the pronoun realizes    if s does not have
an nl name  naturalowl uses the gender of the  most appropriate  nl name of the most
specific class that includes s and has an nl name  or one of these classes  if they are many  
nl names can also be associated with sets of genders  which give rise to pseudo pronouns
like he she  this may be desirable in the nl name of a class like person 
with some individuals or classes  we may not wish to use nl names  nor tokenized
identifiers or rdfs label strings  this is common  for example  in museum ontologies  where
some exhibits are known by particular names  but many other exhibits are anonymous and
their owl identifiers are not particularly meaningful  naturalowl allows the domain author
to mark individuals and classes as anonymous  to indicate that their nl names  tokenized
identifiers  and rdfs label strings should be avoided  when the primary target is marked as
anonymous  naturalowl uses a demonstrative noun phrase  e g   this statue  to refer to
it  the demonstrative phrase involves the nl name of the most specific class that subsumes
the primary target  has an nl name  and has not been marked as anonymous  especially
in sentences that express isa or instanceof message triples about the primary target  the
demonstrative phrase is simply this  to avoid generating sentences like this statue is
a statue  the marking of anonymous individuals and classes currently affects only the
referring expressions of the primary target 
    surface realization
in many nlg systems  the sentences at the end of micro planning are underspecified  for
example  the order of their constituents or the exact forms of their words may be unspecified 
large scale grammars or statistical models can then be used to fill in the missing information
during surface realization  as already discussed  section         by contrast  in naturalowl
 and most template based nlg systems  the  ordered and aggregated  sentence plans at the
end of micro planning already completely specify the surface  final  form of each sentence 
hence  the surface realization of naturalowl is mostly a process of converting internal 
but fully specified and ordered sentence specifications to the final text  punctuation and
capitalization are also added  application specific markup  e g   html tags  hyperlinks  or
images can also be added by modifying the surface realization code of naturalowl 

   trials
in our previous work  naturalowl was used mostly to describe cultural heritage objects 
in the xenios project  it was tested with an owl version of an ontology that was created
during m piro to document approximately    archaeological exhibits  androutsopoulos et
al            the owl version comprised    classes      individuals  including cities  persons
etc    and    properties  in xenios  naturalowl was also embedded in a robotic avatar
that presented the exhibits of m piro in a virtual museum  oberlander  karakatsiotis 
    in languages like greek that use grammatical instead of natural genders  the pronouns genders cannot
be determined by consulting the ontology  e g   to check if the referent is animate or inanimate  
    xenios was co funded by the european union and the greek general secretariat of research and technology  see http   www ics forth gr xenios  

   

fiandroutsopoulos  lampouras    galanis

isard    androutsopoulos         more recently  in the indigo project  naturalowl was
embedded in mobile robots acting as tour guides in an exhibition about the ancient agora
of athens    an owl ontology documenting    monuments was used  there were    classes 
    individuals  and    properties in total 
in xenios and indigo  the texts of naturalowl were eventually indistinguishable from
human authored texts  we participated  however  in the development of the ontologies  and
we may have biased them towards choices  e g   classes  properties  that made it easier for
naturalowl to generate high quality texts  hence  in the trials discussed below  we wanted
to experiment with independently developed ontologies  we also wanted to experiment with
different domains  as opposed to cultural heritage 
a further goal was to compare the texts of naturalowl against those of a simpler verbalizer  we used the owl verbalizer of the swat project  stevens et al         williams 
third    power         which we found to be particularly robust and useful    the verbalizer produces an alphabetical glossary with an entry for each named class  property  and
individual  without requiring domain dependent generation resources  each glossary entry
is a sequence of english like sentences expressing the corresponding owl statements of the
ontology  the swat verbalizer uses a predetermined partial order of statements in each
glossary entry  for example  when describing a class  statements about equivalent classes
or super classes are mentioned first  and individuals belonging in the target class are mentioned last    the verbalizer actually translates the owl ontology to prolog  it extracts
lexicon entries from owl identifiers and rdfs label strings  and it uses predetermined sentence plans specified as a dcg grammar  it also aggregates  in effect  message triples of the
same property that share one argument  s or o   williams   power        
our hypothesis was that the domain dependent generation resources would help naturalowl produce texts that end users would consider more fluent and coherent  compared
to those produced by the swat verbalizer  but also those produced by naturalowl without
domain dependent generation resources  we also wanted to demonstrate that high quality
texts could be produced in both english and greek  and to measure the effort required
to create the domain dependent generation resources of naturalowl for existing ontologies  this effort had not been measured in our previous work  because the development
of the domain dependent generation resources was combined with the development of the
ontologies  since the time needed to create the domain dependent generation resources
depends on ones familiarity with naturalowl and its protege plug in  exact times are not
particularly informative  instead  we report figures such as the number of sentence plans 
lexicon entries etc  that were required  along with approximate times  we do not evaluate

the usability of the protege plug in of naturalowl  since it is very similar to the authoring
tool of m piro  previous experiments  androutsopoulos et al         showed that computer
science graduates with no expertise in nlg could learn to use effectively the authoring tool
of m piro to create the necessary domain dependent generation resources for existing or
new ontologies  after receiving the equivalent of a full day introduction course 
    trials with the wine ontology
in the first trial  we experimented with the wine ontology  which is often used in semantic
web tutorials    it comprises    wine classes     wine individuals  a total of     classes and
individuals  including wineries  regions  etc    and    properties 
we submitted the wine ontology to the swat verbalizer to obtain its glossary of englishlike descriptions of classes  properties  and individuals  we retained only the descriptions
of the    wine classes and the    wine individuals  subsequently  we also discarded    of
the    wine class descriptions  as they were for trivial classes  e g   redwine  and they were
stating the obvious  e g   a red wine is defined as a wine that has as color red     in
the descriptions of the remaining    wine classes and    wine individuals  we discarded
sentences expressing axioms that naturalowl does not consider  for example sentences
providing examples of individuals that belong in a class being described  the remaining
sentences express the same owl statements that naturalowl expresses when its maximum
fact distance is set to    two examples of texts produced by the swat verbalizer follow 
chenin blanc  class   a chenin blanc is defined as something that is a wine  is made from grape the
chenin blanc grape  and is made from grape at most one thing  a chenin blanc both has as flavor
moderate  and has as color white  a chenin blanc both has as sugar only off dry and dry  and has as
body only full and medium 
the foxen chenin blanc  individual   the foxen chenin blanc is a chenin blanc  the foxen chenin
blanc has as body full  the foxen chenin blanc has as flavor moderate  the foxen chenin blanc has
as maker foxen  the foxen chenin blanc has as sugar dry  the foxen chenin blanc is located in the
santa barbara region 

subsequently  we generated texts for the    classes and    individuals using naturalowl
without domain dependent generation resources  hereafter called naturalowl    setting
the maximum fact distance to    the resulting texts were very similar to swats 
we then constructed the domain dependent generation resources of naturalowl for the
wine ontology  the resources are summarized in table    they were constructed by the
second author  who devoted three days to their construction  testing  and refinement   
our experience is that it takes weeks  if not longer  to develop an owl ontology the size
of the wine ontology  acquire domain knowledge  formulate the axioms in owl  check for
inconsistencies  populate the ontology with individuals etc    hence  a period of a few days is
    see http   www w  org tr owl guide wine rdf 
    third        discusses how owl axioms leading to undesirable sentences of this kind might be detected 
    some of the resources were constructed by editing directly their owl representations  rather than using
the protege plug in  which was not fully functional at that time  by using the now fully functional
plug in  the time to create the domain dependent generation resources would have been shorter

table    domain dependent generation resources created for the wine ontology 
relatively light effort  compared to the time needed to develop an owl ontology of this size 
only english texts were generated in this trial  hence  no greek resources were constructed 
we defined only one user type  and we used interest scores only to block sentences stating
the obvious  by assigning zero interest scores to the corresponding message triples  we also
set maxmessagespersentence to    only   of the    properties of the wine ontology are used
in the owl statements that describe the    classes and    individuals  we defined only  
sentence plans  as some of the   properties could be expressed by the same sentence plans 
we did not define multiple sentence plans per property  we also assigned the   properties
to   sections  and ordered the sections and properties  we created nl names only when
the automatically extracted ones were causing disfluencies  the extracted nl names were
obtained from the owl identifiers of classes and individuals  no rdfs label strings were
available  to reduce the number of manually constructed nl names further  we declared
the    individual wines to be anonymous  and provided no nl names for them   most of
the    lexicon entries were used in the remaining    nl names of classes and individuals 
nl names were very simple  having   slots on average  we used naturalowl with the
domain dependent resources  hereafter called naturalowl     to re generate the    texts 
again setting the maximum fact distance to    example texts follow 
chenin blanc  class   a chenin blanc is a moderate  white wine  it has only a full or medium body  it
is only off dry or dry  it is made from exactly one wine grape variety  chenin blanc grapes 

the foxen chenin blanc  individual   this wine is a moderate  dry chenin blanc  it has a full body  it
is made by foxen in the santa barbara county 

the resulting     texts         of the three systems  swat verbalizer  naturalowl   
naturalowl     were shown to    computer science students  both undergraduates and
graduate students   who were not involved in the development of naturalowl  they were all
fluent in english  though not native english speakers  and they did not consider themselves
wine experts  the students were told that a glossary of wines was being developed for people
who were interested in wines and knew basic wine terms  e g   wine colors  wine flavors  
but who were otherwise not wine experts  each one of the     texts was given to exactly
one student  each student was given approximately    texts  approximately    randomly
selected texts from each system  the owl statements that the texts were generated from
were not shown  and the students did not know which system had generated each text 
each student was shown all of his her texts in random order  regardless of the system that
had generated them  the students were asked to score each text by stating how strongly
they agreed or disagreed with statements s  s  below  a scale from   to   was used    
disagreement     ambivalent     agreement

table    results for texts generated from the wine ontology by the swat verbalizer and
naturalowl with     and without    domain dependent generation resources 
 s    sentence fluency  the sentences of the text are fluent  i e   each sentence on its own is grammatical
and sounds natural  when two or more smaller sentences are combined to form a single  longer sentence 
the resulting longer sentence is also grammatical and sounds natural 
 s    referring expressions  the use of pronouns and other referring expressions  e g   this wine  is
appropriate  the choices of referring expressions  e g   when to use a pronoun or other expression instead
of the name of an object  sound natural  and it is easy to understand what these expressions refer to 
 s    text structure  the order of the sentences is appropriate  the text presents information by moving
reasonably from one topic to another 
 s    clarity  the text is easy to understand  provided that the reader is familiar with basic wine terms 
 s    interest  people interested in wines  but who are not wine experts  would find the information
interesting  furthermore  there are no redundant sentences in the text  e g   sentences stating the obvious    

s  assesses content selection  the first processing sub stage  we expected the differences
across the three systems to be very small  as they all reported the same information  with the
exception of redundant sentences blocked by using zero interest assignments in naturalowl 
s  assesses text planning  the second sub stage  again we expected small differences  as many
of the wine properties can be mentioned in any order  though there are some properties  e g  
maker  location  that are most naturally reported separately from others  e g   color  flavor  
which is why we used two sections  table     s  assesses lexicalization and aggregation  we
decided not to use separate statements for these two stages  since it might have been difficult
for the students to understand exactly when aggregation takes place  s  assesses referring
expression generation  s  measures the overall perceived clarity of the texts  there was no
statement for surface realization  as this stage had a rather trivial effect 
table   shows the average scores of the three systems  with averages computed on the
   texts of each system  along with     confidence intervals  of sample means   for each
criterion  the best score is shown in bold  the confidence interval of the best score is also
shown in bold if it does not overlap with the other confidence intervals   
as expected  the domain dependent generation resources clearly help naturalowl produce more fluent sentences and much better referring expressions  the text structure scores
show that the assignment of the ontologys properties to sections and the ordering of the
sections and properties had a greater impact on the perceived structure of the texts than
we expected  the highest score of the swat verbalizer was obtained in the clarity criterion  which agrees with our experience that one can usually understand what the texts of
the swat verbalizer mean  even if their sentences are often not entirely fluent  not particularly well ordered  and keep repeating proper names  naturalowl   had the highest clarity
    the students were told not to consider whether or not additional information should have been included 
    when two intervals do not overlap  the difference is statistically significant  when they overlap  the
difference may still be statistically significant  we performed paired two tailed t tests           in these
cases  in a pilot study  we also measured the inter annotator agreement of two of the students on a sample
of    texts     from each system   agreement was very high  sample pearson correlation r        in all
five criteria  a similar pilot study was performed in the next trial  also indicating very high agreement

score  but the difference from the swat verbalizer  which had the second highest score  is not
statistically significant  naturalowl   also obtained higher interest scores than the other
two systems  with statistically significant differences from both  these differences  which are
larger than we expected  can only be attributed to the zero interest score assignments of
the domain dependent generation resources  which blocked sentences stating the obvious 
because otherwise all three systems report the same information 
the swat verbalizer obtained higher scores than naturalowl    with the text structure score being the only exception  only the difference in the referring expression scores
of the two systems  though  is statistically significant  both systems  however  received
particularly low scores for their referring expressions  which is not surprising  given that
they both always refer to individuals and classes by extracted names  the slightly higher
score of the swat verbalizer is probably due to its better tokenization of owl identifiers 
    trials with the consumer electronics ontology
in the second trial  we experimented with the consumer electronics ontology  an owl ontology for consumer electronics products and services    the ontology comprises    classes
and     individuals  e g   printer types  paper sizes  manufacturers   but no information
about particular products  we added    individuals describing    digital cameras     camcorders  and    printers  the    individuals were randomly selected from a publicly available
dataset of     digital cameras      camcorders  and    printers  whose instances comply
with the consumer electronics ontology   
we submitted the consumer electronics ontology with the additional    individuals
to the swat verbalizer  and retained only the descriptions of the    individuals  again 
we removed sentences expressing axioms naturalowl does not consider  we also renamed
the string values of some datatype properties to make the texts easier to understand  e g  
cmt became cm   an example description follows 
the sony cyber shot dsc t   is a digital camera 
the sony cyber shot dsc t   has as manufacturer sony 
the sony cyber shot dsc t   has as data interface type usb    
the sony cyber shot dsc t   has as depth depth  depth has as unit of measurement cm  depth has as value
float     
the sony cyber shot dsc t   has as digital zoom factor the digital zoom factor  the digital zoom factor has
as value float               
the sony cyber shot dsc t   has as feature video recording  microphone and the automatic picture stabilizer 
the sony cyber shot dsc t   has as self timer true          

in this ontology  many properties have composite values  expressed by using auxiliary individuals  in the example above  a property  hasdepth  connects the digital camera to an
auxiliary individual depth  similar to the anonymous node  n of the property concatenation
price example of page       which is then connected via two other properties  hasvaluefloat
    consult http   www ebusiness unibw org ontologies consumerelectronics v  
    see http   rdf ecommerce esolda com  for the dataset that we used  a list of similar datasets is
available at http   wiki goodrelations vocabulary org datasets 

   

figenerating natural language descriptions from owl ontologies

and hasunitofmeasurement  to the float value     and the unit of measurement  centimeters   respectively  we obtained the descriptions of the auxiliary individuals  e g   depth  
which are different entries in the glossary of the swat verbalizer  and we copied them immediately after the corresponding sentences that introduce the auxiliary individuals  we
also formatted each text as a list of sentences  as above  to improve readability 
we then generated texts for the    products using naturalowl    setting the maximum
fact distance to    descriptions of auxiliary individuals were also generated and copied
immediately after the sentences introducing them  the texts were very similar to those of
the swat verbalizer  and they were formatted in the same manner 
in this trial  we also wanted to consider a scenario where the set of individuals to be
described changes frequently  e g   the products sold by a reseller change  new products arrive etc   along with changes in other connected individuals  e g   new manufacturers may
be added   but nothing else in the ontology changes  i e   only the assertional knowledge
changes  in this case  it may be impractical to update the domain dependent generation
resources whenever the population of individuals changes  our hypothesis was that by considering a sample of individuals of the types to be described  printers  cameras  camcorders 
in our case   it would be possible to construct domain dependent generation resources  e g  
sections  the ordering of sections and properties  sentence plans  the nl names of classes 
that would help naturalowl generate reasonably good descriptions of new  unseen  individuals  products   without updating the domain dependent generation resources  using the
tokenized owl identifiers or rdfs label strings of the new individuals as their nl names 
to simulate this scenario  we randomly split the    products in two non overlapping sets 
the development set and the test set  each consisting of    digital cameras     camcorders 
and    printers  again  the second author constructed and refined the domain dependent
generation resources of naturalowl  this time by considering a version of the ontology that
included the    development products  but not the    test products  and by viewing the
generated texts of the    development products only  this took approximately six days  for
two languages     hence  relatively light effort was again needed  compared to the time it
typically takes to develop an ontology of this size  with terminology in two languages  texts
for the    products of the test set were then also generated by using naturalowl and the
domain dependent generation resources of the development set 
as in the previous trial  we defined only one user type  and we used interest scores only
to block sentences stating the obvious  the maximum messages per sentence was again   
we constructed domain dependent generation resources for both english and greek  the
resources are summarized in table    we created sentence plans only for the    properties
of the ontology that were used in the development set  one sentence plan per property   the
test set uses two additional properties  for which the default sentence plans of naturalowl
 for english and greek  were used  we also assigned the    properties to   sections  and
ordered the sections and properties  we created nl names only when the automatically
extracted ones were causing disfluencies in the development texts  unlike the previous
trial  the products to be described were not declared to be anonymous individuals  but the
number of nl names that had to be provided was roughly the same as in the previous trial 
    again  some of the domain dependent generation resources were constructed by editing their owl representations  as a test  the second author later reconstructed the domain dependent generation resources
from scratch using the fully functional protege plug ing  this time in four days

since fewer automatically extracted names were causing disfluencies  in particular  all the
products had reasonably good rdfs label strings providing their english names 
an example description from the development set produced by naturalowl   follows 
we formatted the sentences of each section as a separate paragraph  headed by the name of
the section  e g   other features    this was easy  because naturalowl can automatically
mark up the sections in the texts  the maximum fact distance was again    but the sentence
plans caused naturalowl to automatically retrieve additional message triples describing
the auxiliary individuals at distance    hence  we did not have to retrieve this information

the     english texts that were generated by the three systems for the    development
and    test products were shown to the same    students of the first trial  the students
were now told that the texts would be used in on line descriptions of products in the web
site of a retailer  again  the owl statements that the texts were generated from were not
shown to the students  and the students did not know which system had generated each
text  each student was shown    randomly selected texts    for products of the development
set    texts per system  and   for products of the test set  again   texts per system   each
student was shown all of his her texts in random order  regardless of the system that had
generated them  the students were asked to score the texts as in the previous trial 
table   shows the results for the english texts of the development set    as in the previous trial  the domain dependent generation resources clearly help naturalowl produce
much more fluent sentences  and much better referring expressions and sentence orderings 
the text structure scores of the swat verbalizer and naturalowl  are now much lower
than in the previous trial  because there are now more message triples to express per individual and more topics  and the texts of these systems jump from one topic to another
making the texts look very incoherent  for example  a sentence about the width of a camera
may be separated from a sentence about its height by a sentence about shutter lag  this
    when a confidence interval is       this means that all the students gave the same score to all texts

incoherence may have also contributed to the much lower clarity scores of these two systems  compared to the previous trial  the interest scores of these two systems are also much
lower than in the previous trial  this may be due to the verbosity of their texts  caused by
their frequent references to auxiliary individuals in the second trial  combined with the lack
 or very little use  of sentence aggregation and pronoun generation  by contrast  the clarity and interest of naturalowl   were judged to be perfect  the poor clarity and interest
of the other two systems may have contributed to these perfect scores though  again  the
swat verbalizer obtained slightly better scores than naturalowl without domain dependent
generation resources  except for clarity  but the differences are not statistically significant 
table   shows the results for the english texts of the test set  the results of the swat
verbalizer and naturalowl  are very similar to those of table    as one would expect 
also  there was only a very marginal decrease in the scores of naturalowl     compared to
the scores of the same system for the development set in table    there is no statistically
significant difference  however  between the corresponding cells of the two tables  for any
of the three systems  these results support our hypothesis that by considering a sample
of individuals of the types to be described one can construct domain dependent generation
resources that can be used to produce high quality texts for new individuals of the same
types  when the rest of the ontology remains unchanged  the fact that all the products  but
not the other individuals  had rdfs label strings providing their english names probably
contributed to the high results of naturalowl   in the test set  but rdfs label strings of
this kind are common in owl ontologies 
we then showed the    greek texts that were generated by naturalowl   to the same

significant difference from the corresponding results for english  cf  the last columns of tables   and     there is also no statistically significant difference in the results for the greek
texts of the development and test sets  table     we note  however  that it is common to
use english names of electronics products in greek texts  which made using the english
rdfs label names of the products in the greek texts acceptable  in other domains  for
example cultural heritage  it might be unacceptable to use english names of individuals 
hence  one would have to provide greek nl names for new individuals 
    ablation trials with the consumer electronics ontology
in the last trial  we studied how the quality of the generated texts is affected when various components and domain dependent generation resources of naturalowl are gradually
removed  we used the consumer electronics ontology  with the domain dependent generation resources that we had constructed for the    development products of the previous
trial  we also used    new test products     digital cameras     camcorders  and    printers  from the same publicly available dataset   other than the    development and the   
test products of the previous trial 
we generated english texts for the    new test products  using the   configurations of
naturalowl of table     the resulting           texts were shown to   students  who had
the same background as in the previous trials  each student was shown the   texts of   or  
test products     or    texts per student   for each product  the   texts were shown side by
side in random order  and the students were instructed to take into account the differences
of the   texts  the students did not know which system had generated which text  the
same criteria  statements s  s  of section      were used again  but a scale from   to  
was used this time     strong disagreement     disagreement     ambivalent     agreement 
   strong agreement   to make it easier to distinguish between the   configurations 
the first configuration  naturalowl     is naturalowl with all of its components enabled  using all the available domain dependent generation resources  as in the previous
trial  see table     the texts of this configuration were judged to be near perfect by all the
criteria  the second configuration was the same  but without the interest score assignments 
the results of the second configuration were very close to the results of the first one  since
interest score assignments were used only to avoid generating sentences stating the obvious

the interest criterion  as one would expect  but the scores for sentence fluency and clarity
were also affected  presumably because the sentences that state the obvious sound unnatural
   

figenerating natural language descriptions from owl ontologies

and seem to introduce noise  there were very small differences in the scores for referring
expressions and text structure  which seem to suggest that when the overall quality of the
texts decreases  the judges are biased towards assigning lower scores in all of the criteria   
the third configuration was the same as the second one  but the component that generates pronouns and demonstrative noun phrases was disabled  causing naturalowl to always
use the nl names of the individuals and classes  or names extracted from the ontology  there
was a big decrease in the score for referring expresions  showing that despite their simplicity  the referring expression generation methods of naturalowl have a noticeable effect 
we mark big decreases in italics in table     the scores for sentence fluency  interest  and
clarity were also affected  presumably because repeating the names of the individuals and
classes made the sentences look less natural  boring  and more difficult to follow  there was
almost no difference  a very small positive one  in the text structure score 
in the fourth configuration  the nl names of the individuals and classes were also removed  forcing naturalowl to always use automatically extracted names  there was a
further decrease in the score for referring expressions  but the decrease was small  because
the referring expressions were already poor in the third configuration  note  also  that
the nl names are necessary for naturalowl to produce pronouns and demonstrative noun
phrases  hence  the higher referring expression score of the third configuration would not
have been possible without the nl names  the sentence fluency and clarity scores were also
affected in the fourth configuration  presumably because the automatically extracted names
made the texts more difficult to read and understand  there were also small decreases in the
scores for interest and even text structure  suggesting again that when the overall quality
of the texts decreases  the judges are biased towards lower scores in all of the criteria 
in the fifth configuration  aggregation was turned off  causing naturalowl to produce
a separate sentence for each message triple  with sentences sharing the same subject no
longer being aggregated  more referring expressions for subjects had to be generated  since
the component that generates pronouns and demonstrative noun phrases had been switched
off and the nl names had been removed  more repetitions of automatically extracted names
had to be used  which is why the score for referring expressions decreased further  sentence
fluency was also affected  since some obvious aggregations were no longer being made  which
made the sentences look less natural  there was also a small decrease in the score for the
perceived text structure and interest  but no difference in the score for clarity  overall  the
contribution of aggregation to the perceived quality of the texts seems to be rather small 
in the sixth configuration  all the sentence plans were removed  forcing naturalowl to
use the default sentence plan and tokenized property identifiers  there was a sharp decrease
in sentence fluency and clarity  as one would expect  but also in the perceived interest of
the texts  there was also a small decrease in the perceived text structure  and no difference
in the score for referring expressions  overall  these results indicate that sentence plans are
a very important part of the domain dependent generation resources 
in the seventh configuration  the sections  assignments of properties to sections  and the
ordering of sections and properties were removed  causing naturalowl to produce random
    in all of the criteria  all the differences from one configuration to the next one are statistically significant  with the only exceptions being the differences in clarity between configurations   and    and the
differences in the scores for referring expressions between configurations    and     again  when the
    confidence intervals overlapped  we performed paired two tailed t tests

orderings of the message triples  there was a very sharp decrease in the score for text
structure  the scores for the perceived interest  clarity  but also sentence fluency were also
affected  again suggesting that when the overall quality of the texts decreases  the judges
are biased towards lower scores in all of the criteria 
we conclude that the sections and ordering information of the domain dependent generation resources are  along with the sentece plans  particularly important  we note  however 
that the best scores were obtained by enabling all the components and using all the available
domain dependent generation resources 

   conclusions and future work
we provided a detailed description of naturalowl  an open source nlg system that produces english and greek texts describing individuals or classes of owl ontologies  unlike
simpler verbalizers  which typically express a single axiom at a time in controlled  often
not entirely fluent english primarily for the benefit of domain experts  naturalowl aims to
generate fluent and coherent multi sentence texts for end users in more than one languages 
we discussed the processing stages of naturalowl  the optional domain dependent generation resources of each stage  as well as particular nlg issues that arise when generating
from owl ontologies  we also presented trials we performed to measure the effort required
to construct the domain dependent generation resources and the extent to which they improve the resulting texts  also comparing against a simpler owl verbalizer that requires no
domain dependent generation resources and employs nlg methods to a lesser extent  the
trials showed that the domain dependent generation resources help naturalowl produce
significantly better texts  and that the resources can be constructed with relatively light
effort  compared to the effort that is typically needed to develop an owl ontology 
future work could compare the effort needed to construct the domain dependent generation resources against the effort needed to manually edit the lower quality texts produced
without domain dependent generation resources  our experience is that manually editing
texts generated by a verbalizer  or naturalowl    is very tedious when there is a large
number of individuals  e g   products  of a few types to be described  because the editor has
to repeat the same  or very similar  fixes  there may be  however  particular applications
where post editing the texts of a simpler verbalizer may be preferable 
we also aim to replace in future work the pipeline architecture of naturalowl by a global
optimization architecture that will consider all the nlg processing stages in parallel  to avoid
greedy stage specific decisions  marciniak   strube        lampouras   androutsopoulos 
    a      b   finally  we hope to test naturalowl with biomedical ontologies  such as the
gene ontology and snomed
