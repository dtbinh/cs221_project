    suboptimality spa
perhaps simplest example individual greed part agents lead
collective detriment occurs two agents determine shortest path
shared link limited capacity  second option slightly
less preferable  case  using common link degrades performance
parties  since due limited capacity performance link quickly fall
second option 
precisely  consider case shared link cost given x 
traversed x packets  router optional second link destination
cost trac x traverse second link  x  acting alone  single
packet send  would send packet shared link  cost    
however so  incur larger cost  cost    used
second choices  cost     without knowing ahead time
 information conventionally contained routing tables   agents necessarily
mistaken cost estimates therefore make incorrect routing decisions  this  even
limit differentially small packets  use spa lead wrong routing decision
