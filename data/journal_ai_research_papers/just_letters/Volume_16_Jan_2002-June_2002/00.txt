abstract
fusions are a simple way of combining logics  for normal modal logics  fusions have
been investigated in detail  in particular  it is known that  under certain conditions  decidability transfers from the component logics to their fusion  though description logics
are closely related to modal logics  they are not necessarily normal  in addition  abox
reasoning in description logics is not covered by the results from modal logics 
in this paper  we extend the decidability transfer results from normal modal logics to
a large class of description logics  to cover different description logics in a uniform way 
we introduce abstract description systems  which can be seen as a common generalization
of description and modal logics  and show the transfer results in this general setting 

   introduction
knowledge representation systems based on description logics  dl  can be used to represent the knowledge of an application domain in a structured and formally well understood
way  brachman   schmolze        baader   hollunder        brachman  mcguinness 
patel schneider  alperin resnick    borgida        woods   schmolze        borgida 
      horrocks         in such systems  the important notions of the domain can be described by concept descriptions  i e   expressions that are built from atomic concepts  unary
predicates  and atomic roles  binary predicates  using the concept constructors provided
by the description logic employed by the system  the atomic concepts and the concept
descriptions represent sets of individuals  whereas roles represent binary relations between
individuals  for example  using the atomic concepts woman and human  and the atomic
role child  the concept of all women having only daughters  i e   women such that all their
children are again women  can be represented by the description woman u child woman 
and the concept of all mothers by the description woman u child human  in this example 
we have used the constructors concept conjunction  u   value restriction  r c   and existential restriction  r c   in the dl literature  also various other constructors have been
considered  a prominent example are so called number restrictions  which are available in
almost all dl systems  for example  using number restrictions the concept of all women
c

having exactly two children can be represented by the concept description
woman u    child  u    child  
the knowledge base of a dl system consists of a terminological component  tbox  and
an assertional component  abox   in its simplest form  the tbox consists of concept
definitions  which assign names  abbreviations  to complex descriptions  more general tbox
formalisms allow for so called general concept inclusion axioms  gcis  between complex
descriptions  for example  the concept inclusion
human u    child  v entitled taxbreak
states that people having at least three children are entitled to a tax break  the abox
formalism consists of concept assertions  stating that an individual belongs to a concept 
and role assertions  stating that two individuals are related by a role   for example  the
assertions woman mary   child mary  tom   human tom  state that mary is a woman 
who has a child  tom  who is a human 
dl systems provide their users with various inference capabilities that allow them to
deduce implicit knowledge from the explicitly represented knowledge  for instance  the subsumption problem is concerned with subconcept superconcept relationships  c is subsumed
by d  c v d  if  and only if  all instances of c are also instances of d  i e   the first description is always interpreted as a subset of the second description  for example  the concept
description woman obviously subsumes the concept description woman u child woman 
the concept description c is satisfiable iff it is non contradictory  i e   it can be interpreted
by a nonempty set  in dls allowing for conjunction and negation of concepts  subsumption can be reduced to  un satisfiability  c v d iff c u d is unsatisfiable  the instance
checking problem consists of deciding whether a given individual is an instance of a given
concept  for example  w r t  the assertions from above  mary is an instance of the concept
description woman u child human  the abox a is consistent iff it is non contradictory 
i e   it has a model  in dls allowing for negation of concepts  the instance problem can be
reduced to  in consistency of aboxes  i is an instance of c w r t  the abox a iff a c i  
is inconsistent 
in order to ensure a reasonable and predictable behavior of a dl system  reasoning
in the dl employed by the system should at least be decidable  and preferably of low
complexity  consequently  the expressive power of the dl in question must be restricted in
an appropriate way  if the imposed restrictions are too severe  however  then the important
notions of the application domain can no longer be expressed  investigating this trade off
between the expressivity of dls and the complexity of their inference problems has thus
been one of the most important issues in dl research  see  e g   levesque   brachman

this paper investigates an approach for extending the expressivity of dls that  in many
cases  guarantees that reasoning remains decidable  the fusion of dls  in order to explain
 

fifusions of description logics and abstract description systems

the difference between the usual union and the fusion of dls  let us consider a simple
example  assume that the dl d  is alc  i e   it provides for the boolean operators u  t 
 and the additional concept constructors value restriction r c and existential restriction
r c  and that the dl d  provides for the boolean operators and number restrictions
  nr  and   nr   if an application requires concept constructors from both dls for
expressing its relevant concepts  then one would usually consider the union d   d  of d 
and d    which allows for the unrestricted use of all constructors  for example  the concept
description c      r a  u  r a  u    r  is a legal d   d  description  note that this
description is unsatisfiable  due to the interaction between constructors of d  and d    the
fusion d  d  of d  and d  prevents such interactions by imposing the following restriction 
one assumes that the set of all role names is partitioned into two sets  one that can be used
in constructors of d    and another one that can be used in constructors of d    thus  the
description c  from above is not a legal d   d  description since it uses the same role r
both in the existential restrictions  which are d   constructors  and in the number restriction
 which is a d   constructor   in contrast  the descriptions  r   a  u  r   a  u    r   
and  r      r     are admissible in d   d  since they employ different roles in the d  and d   constructors  if the concepts that must be expressed are such that they require
both constructors from d  and d    but the ones from d  for other roles than the ones from
d    then one does not really need the union of d  and d    the fusion would be sufficient 
what is the advantage of taking the fusion instead of the union  basically  for the union
of two dls one must design new reasoning methods  whereas reasoning in the fusion can be
reduced to reasoning in the component dls  indeed  reasoning in the union may even be
undecidable whereas reasoning in the fusion is still decidable  as an example  we consider
the dls  i  alcf  which extends the basic dl alc by functional roles  features  and
the same as constructor  agreement  on chains of functional roles  hollunder   nutt       
baader  burckert  nebel  nutt    smolka         and  ii  alc    t   which extends alc by
transitive closure  composition  and union of roles  baader        schild         for both
dls  subsumption of concept descriptions is known to be decidable  hollunder   nutt 
      schild        baader         however  their union alcf    t has an undecidable
subsumption problem  baader et al          this undecidability result depends on the fact
that  in alcf    t   the role constructors transitive closure  composition  and union can
be applied to functional roles that also appear within the same as constructor  this is not
allowed in the fusion alcf  alc    t   of course  failure of a certain undecidability proof
does not make the fusion decidable 
why do we know that the fusion of decidable dls is again decidable  actually  in
general we dont  and this was our main reason for writing this paper  the notion fusion was introduced and investigated in modal logic  basically to transfer results like finite
axiomatizability  decidability  finite model property  etc  from uni modal logics  with one
pair of box and diamond operators  to multi modal logics  with several such pairs  possibly satisfying different axioms   this has led to rather general transfer results  see  e g  
wolter        kracht   wolter        fine   schurz        spaan        gabbay      
for results that concern decidability   which are sometimes restricted to so called normal
modal logics  chellas         since there is a close relationship between modal logics and
dls  schild         it is clear that these transfer results also apply to some dls  the question is  however  to which dls exactly and to which inference problems  first  some dls
 

fibaader  lutz  sturm    wolter

allow for constructors that are not considered in modal logics  e g   the same as constructor
mentioned above   second  some dl constructors that have been considered in modal logics  such as qualified number restrictions   nr c     nr c   hollunder   baader        
which correspond to graded modalities  van der hoek   de rijke         can easily be
shown to be non normal  third  the transfer results for decidability are concerned with the
satisfiability problem  with or without general inclusion axioms   aboxes and the related
inference problems are not considered  aboxes can be simulated in modal logics allowing
for so called nominals  i e   names for individuals  within formulae  prior        gargov
  goranko        areces  blackburn    marx         however  as we will see below  the
general transfer results do not apply to modal logics with nominals 
the purpose of this paper is to clarify for which dls decidability of the component dls
transfers to their fusion  to this purpose  we introduce so called abstract description systems
 adss   which can be seen as a common generalization of description and modal logics 
we define the fusion of adss  and state four theorems that say under which conditions
decidability transfers from the component adss to their fusion  two of these theorems
are concerned with inference w r t  general concept inclusion axioms and two with inference
without tbox axioms  in both cases  we first formulate and prove the results for the
consistency problem of aboxes  more precisely  the corresponding problem for adss  and
then establish analogous results for the satisfiability problem of concepts 
from the dl point of view  the four theorems shown in this paper are concerned with
the following four decision problems 
 i  decidability of consistency of aboxes w r t  tbox axioms  theorem     
 ii  decidability of satisfiability of concepts w r t  tbox axioms   corollary     
 iii  decidability of consistency of aboxes without tbox axioms  theorem      and
 iv  decidability of satisfiability of concepts without tbox axioms  corollary     
these theorems imply that decidability of the consistency problem and the satisfiability
problem transfers to the fusion for most dls considered in the literature  the main exceptions  which do not satisfy the prerequisites of the theorems  are
 a  dls that are not propositionally closed  i e   do not contain all boolean connectives 
 b  dls allowing for individuals  called nominals in modal logic  in concept descriptions 
and
 c  dls explicitly allowing for the universal role or for negation of roles 
results from modal logic for problem  iv  usually require the component modal logics to
be normal  our theorem    is less restrictive  and thus also applies to dls allowing for
constructors like qualified number restrictions 

   description logics
before defining abstract description systems in the next section  we introduce the main
features of dls that must be covered by this definition  to this purpose  we first introduce
 

fifusions of description logics and abstract description systems

alc  the basic dl containing all boolean connectives  and the relevant inference problems 
then  we consider different possibilities for extending alc to more expressive dls 
definition    alc syntax   let nc   nr   and ni be countable and pairwise disjoint sets
of concept  role  and individual names  respectively  the set of alc concept descriptions
is the smallest set such that
   every concept name is a concept description 
   if c and d are concept descriptions and r is a role name  then the following expressions are also concept descriptions 
 c  negation   c u d  conjunction   c t d  disjunction  
 r c  existential restriction   and r c  value restriction  
we use   as an abbreviation of a t a and  as an abbreviation for a u a  where a is
an arbitrary concept name  
let c and d be concept descriptions  then c v d is a general concept inclusion axiom
 gci   a finite set of such axioms is called a tbox 
let c be a concept description  r a role name  and i  j individual names  then c i  is
a concept assertion and r i  j  a role assertion  a finite set of such assertions is called an
abox 
the meaning of alc concept descriptions  tboxes  and aboxes can be defined with
the help of a set theoretic semantics 
definition    alc semantics   an alc interpretation i is a pair  i   i    where i
is a nonempty set  the domain of the interpretation  and i is the interpretation function 
the interpretation function maps
 each concept name a to a subset ai of i  
 each role name r to a subset ri of i  i  
 each individual name i to an element ii of i such that different names are mapped
to different elements  unique name assumption  
for a role name r and an element a  i we define ri  a      b    a  b   ri    the
interpretation function can inductively be extended to complex concepts as follows 
 c i    i   c i
 c u d i    c i  di
 c t d i    c i  di
 r c i     a  i   ri  a   c i     
 r c i     a  i   ri  a   c i  
an interpretation i is a model of the tbox t iff it satisfies c i  di for all gcis c v d
in t   it is a model of the abox a iff it satisfies ii  c i for all concept assertions c i   a
and  ii   j i    ri for all role assertions r i  j   a  finally  i is a model of an abox
relative to a tbox iff it is a model of both the abox and the tbox 
 

fibaader  lutz  sturm    wolter

given this semantics  we can now formally define the relevant inference problems 
definition    inferences   let c and d be concept descriptions  i an individual name 
t a tbox  and a an abox  we say that c subsumes d relative to the tbox t  d vt c 
iff di  c i for all models i of t   the concept description c is satisfiable relative to the
tbox t iff there exists a model i of t such that c i      the individual i is an instance of
c in the abox a relative to the tbox t iff ii  c i for all models of a relative to t   the
abox a is consistent relative to the tbox t iff there exists a model of a relative to t  
these three inferences can also be considered without reference to a tbox  c subsumes
d  c is satisfiable  iff c subsumes d  c is satisfiable  relative to the empty tbox  and i
is an instance of c in a  a is consistent  iff i is an instance of c in a  a is consistent 
relative to the empty tbox 
we restrict our attention to dls that are propositionally closed  i e   allow for the
boolean operators conjunction  disjunction  and negation   consequently  subsumption
can be reduced to  un satisfiability since c vt d iff c u d is unsatisfiable relative to t  
conversely   un satisfiability can be reduced to subsumption since c is unsatisfiable relative
to t iff c vt   for this reason  it is irrelevant whether we consider the subsumption or the
satisfiability problem in our results concerning the transfer of decidability of these problems
from component dls to their fusion  informally called transfer results in the following  
similarly  the instance problem can be reduced to the  in consistency problem and vice
versa  i is an instance of c in a relative to t iff a   c i   is inconsistent relative to t  
and a is inconsistent relative to t iff i is an instance of  in a relative to t   where i is an
arbitrary individual name  consequently  it is irrelevant whether we consider the instance
problem or the consistency problem in our transfer results 
finally  the satisfiability problem can be reduced to the consistency problem  c is satisfiable relative to t iff the abox  c i   is consistent relative to t   where i is an arbitrary
individual name  however  the converse need not be true  it should be obvious that this
implies that a transfer result for the satisfiability problem does not yield the corresponding
transfer result for the consistency problem  from decidability of the consistency problem
for the component dls we can only deduce decidability of the satisfiability problem in their
fusion  what might be less obvious is that a transfer result for the consistency problem need
not imply the corresponding transfer result for the satisfiability problem  if the satisfiability
problems in the component dls are decidable  then the transfer result for the consistency
problem can just not be applied  since the prerequisite of this transfer result  namely  decidability of the consistency problem in the component dls  need not be satisfied   however 
we will show that the method used to show the transfer result for the consistency problem
also applies to the satisfiability problem 
    more expressive dls
there are several possibilities for extending alc in order to obtain a more expressive dl 
the three most prominent are adding additional concept constructors  adding role constructors  and formulating restrictions on role interpretations  in addition to giving examples
for such extensions  we also introduce a naming scheme for the obtained dls  additional
concept constructors are indicated by appending caligraphic letters to the language name 
role constructors by symbols in superscript  and restrictions on roles by letters in subscript 
 

fifusions of description logics and abstract description systems

we start with introducing restrictions on role interpretations  since we need to refer to
such restrictions when defining certain concept constructors 
      restrictions on role interpretations
these restrictions enforce the interpretations of roles to satisfy certain properties  such as
functionality  transitivity  etc  we consider three prominent examples 
   functional roles  here one considers a subset nf of the set of role names nr  
whose elements are called features  an interpretation must map features f  nf to
functional binary relations f i  i  i   i e   relations satisfying a  b  c f i  a  b  
f i  a  c   b   c  we will sometimes treat functional relations as partial functions 
and write f i  a    b rather than f i  a  b   alc extended with features is denoted by
alc f  
   transitive roles  here one considers a subset nr  of nr   role names r  nr 
are called transitive roles  an interpretation must map transitive roles r  nr  to
transitive binary relations ri  i  i   alc extended with transitive roles is
denoted by alc r   
   role hierarchies  a role inclusion axiom is an expression of the form r v s with
r  s  nr   a finite set h of role inclusion axioms is called a role hierarchy  an
interpretation must satisfy ri  s i for all r v s  h  alc extended with a role
hierarchy h is denoted by alc h h    if h is clear from the context or irrelevant  we
write alch instead of alc h h   
the above restrictions can also be combined with each other  for example  alc hr  is alc
with a role hierarchy and transitive roles 
transitive roles in dls were first investigated by sattler         features were introduced in dls by hollunder and nutt        and  under the name attributes  in the
classic system  brachman et al          in both cases in conjunction with feature agreements and disagreements  see concept constructors below   features without agreements
and disagreements are  e g   used in the dl shif  horrocks   sattler         albeit in a
more expressive local way  where functionality can be asserted to hold at certain individuals  but not necessarily on the whole model  according to our naming scheme  we indicate
the presence of features in a dl by the letter f in subscript  
a remark on role hierarchies is also in order  in our definition  if h  and h  are different
role hierarchies  then alc h h    and alc h h    are different dls  in the dl literature 
usually only one logic alch is defined and role hierarchies are treated like tboxes  i e  
satisfiability and subsumption are defined relative to tboxes and role hierarchies  see  e g  
horrocks         for our purposes  however  it is more convenient to define one dl per role
hierarchy since distinct role hierarchies impose distinct restrictions on the interpretation of
roles  the advantages of this approach will become clear later on when frames and abstract
description systems are introduced 
   note that some authors  e g   horrocks   sattler        use an appended f to denote local features 
following hollunder and nutt         we will use f to denote a dl that allows for feature agreements

      concept constructors
concept constructors take concept and or role descriptions and transform them into more
complex concept descriptions  in addition to the constructors available in alc  various
other concept constructors are considered in the dl literature  a small collection of such
constructors can be found in figure    where  s  denotes the cardinality of a set s  the
symbols in the rightmost column indicate the naming scheme for the resulting dl  as
mentioned above the name modifiers for concept constructors are not written in subscript 
they are appended to the language name  for example  alc hr  extended with qualified
number restrictions is called alcqhr    the syntax of the extended dls is as expected  i e  
the constructors may be arbitrarily combined  the semantics is obtained by augmenting
the semantics of alc with the appropriate conditions  which can be found in the third
column in figure    nominals and feature  dis agreements need some more explanation 
 nominals  we consider a set no of  names for  nominals  which is pairwise disjoint
to the sets nc   nr   and ni   elements from no are often denoted by i  possibly
with index   an interpretation must map nominals to singleton subsets of i   the
intention underlying nominals is that they stand for elements of   just like individual
names  however  since we want to use the nominal i  no as a  nullary  concept
constructor  i must interpret them by a set  namely the singleton set consisting of
the individual that i denotes 
 feature  dis agreements  alcf is the extension of alc f with feature agreements
and disagreements  beside the additional concept constructors  alcf uses feature
chains as part of the  dis agreement constructor  a feature chain is an expression of
the form u   f       fn   the interpretation ui of such a feature chain is just the
composition of the partial functions f i           fni   where composition is to be read from
left to right 
dls including nominals or feature  dis agreements and additional concept constructors or
restrictions on role interpretations are defined  and named  in the obvious way 
number restriction are available in almost all dl systems  the dl alcn  i e   alc
extended with number restrictions  was first treated by hollunder and nutt         as was
alcf  the dl alcq was first investigated by hollunder and baader         and alco
by schaerf

figure    some description logic role constructors 
      role constructors
role constructors allow us to build complex role descriptions  a collection of role constructors can be found in figure    again  the rightmost column indicates the naming scheme 
where name modifiers for role constructors are written in superscript and separated by
commas  for example  alcq with inverse roles and transitive closure is called alcq     
in dls admitting role constructors  the set of role descriptions is defined inductively  analogously to the set of concept descriptions  the semantics of role constructors is given in
the third column of figure    as with concept descriptions  it can be used to extend the
interpretation function from role names to role descriptions 
in a dl with role constructors  role descriptions can be used wherever role names may
be used in the corresponding dls without role constructors  for example 
 r  u r    c u  r  t r    c
 u t

is an alc
 concept description  this concept description is unsatisfiable since r  t r 
is equivalent to the universal role  note that role descriptions can also be used within role
assertions in an abox 
the dl alc  t   was first treated by baader         under the name alc trans    schild
       has shown that this dl is a notational variant of propositional dynamic logic  pdl  
dls with boolean operators on roles were investigated by lutz and sattler         the
inverse operator was available in the system crack  bresciani  franconi    tessaris 
       and reasoning in dls with inverse roles was  for example  investigated by calvanese
et al         and horrocks et al          the universal role can be expressed using dls with
boolean operators on roles  see the above example   and it can in turn be used to simulate
general concept inclusion axioms within concept descriptions 
    restricting the syntax
until now  constructors could be combined arbitrarily  sometimes it makes sense to restrict
the interaction between constructors since reasoning in the restricted dl may be easier than
reasoning in the unrestricted dl  we will consider dls imposing certain restrictions on

   which roles may be used inside certain concept constructors 
   which roles may be used inside certain role constructors 
   the combination of role constructors  and
   the role constructors that may be used inside certain concept constructors 
as an example for the first case  consider the fragment of alcqr  in which transitive roles
may be used in existential and universal restrictions  but not in number restrictions  see 
e g   horrocks et al         
as the result of taking the fusion of two dls  we will obtain dls whose set of roles nr
is partitioned  for example  the fusion of alcq with alc   yields a fragment of alcq 
where nr is partitioned in two sets  say nr  and nr    in this fragment  the inverse role
constructor and roles from nr  may not be used within qualified number restrictions  while
roles from nr  may not be used inside the inverse role constructor   thus  this dl is an
example for the first  the second  and the fourth case 
now consider the dl alcf introduced above  which does not only extend alc f with
feature  dis agreement as a concept constructor  but also provides the role composition constructor  however  the role chains built using composition have to be comprised exclusively
of features and non functional roles may not appear inside feature  dis agreement  hence 
alcf is also an example for the first  second  and fourth case 
as an example for the third case  the fragment of alc  u in which role conjunction
may not be used inside the role complement constructor is considered by lutz and sattler
       
for these restricted dls  we do not introduce an explicit naming scheme  note that 
in this paper  we do not deal with dls in which the combinability of concept constructors
with each other is restricted since these dls would not fit into the framework of abstract
description systems introduced in the next section  an example of such a dl would be
one with atomic negation of concepts  i e   where negation may only be applied to concept
names  e g   the dl al discussed by donini et al         

   abstract description systems
in order to define the fusion of dls and prove general results for fusions of dls  one needs
a formal definition of what are description logics  since there exists a wide variety of dls
with very different characteristics  we introduce a very general formalization  which should
cover all of the dls considered in the literature  but also includes logics that would usually
not be subsumed under the name dl 
    syntax and semantics
the syntax of an abstract description system is given by its abstract description language 
which determines a set of terms  term assertions  and object assertions  in this setting 
concept descriptions are represented by terms that are built using the abstract description
   this will become clearer once we have given a formal definition of the fusion 

  

fifusions of description logics and abstract description systems

language  general inclusion axioms in dls are represented by term assertions and abox
assertions in dls are represented by object assertions 
definition    abstract description language   an abstract description language  adl 
is determined by a countably infinite set v of set variables  a countably infinite set x of
object variables  a  possibly infinite  countable set r of relation symbols of arity two   and
a  possibly infinite  countable set f of functions symbols f   which are equipped with arities
nf   all these sets have to be pairwise disjoint 
the terms tj of this adl are built using the follow syntax rules 
tj

 x  t    t   t    t   t    f  t            tnf   

where x  v   f  f  and the boolean operators      are different from all function
symbols in f  for a term t  we denote by var t  the set of set variables used in t  the
symbol   is used as an abbreviation of x  x and  as an abbreviation for x  x  where
x is a set variable  
the term assertions of this adl are
 t  v t    for all terms t    t   
and the object assertions are
 r a  b   for a  b  x and r  r 
  a   t   for a  x and t a term 
the sets of term and object assertions together form the set of assertions of the adl 
from the dl point of view  the set variables correspond to concept names  object
variables to individual names  relation symbols to roles  and the boolean operators as well
as the function symbols correspond to concept constructors  thus  terms correspond to
concept descriptions  as an example  let us view concept descriptions of the dl alcn u  
i e   alc extended with number restrictions and conjunction of roles  as terms of an adl 
value restrictions and existential restrictions can be seen as unary function symbols  for
each role description r  we have the function symbols fr and fr   which take a term tc
 corresponding to the concept description c  and transform it into the more complex terms
fr  tc   and fr  tc    corresponding to the concept descriptions r c and r c   similarly 
number restrictions can be seen as nullary function symbols  for each role description r
and each n  n  we have the function symbols fnr and fnr   hence  the alcn u  concept
description a u  r  u r     b u    r     corresponds to the term xa  f r  ur      xb 
f  r        we will analyze the connection between adls and dls more formally later on 
the semantics of abstract description systems is defined based on abstract description
models  these models are the general semantic structures in which the terms of the adl
are interpreted  it should already be noted here  however  that an abstract description
system usually does not take into account all abstract description models available for the
language  it allows only for a selected subclass of these models  this subclass determines
the semantics of the system 
   to keep things simpler  we restrict our attention to the case of binary predicates  i e   roles in dl 
however  the results can easily be extended to n ary predicates

definition    let l be an adl as in definition    an abstract description model  adm 
for l is of the form

ff
where w is a nonempty set  the f w are functions mapping every sequence x            xnf
of subsets of w to a subset of w   and the rw are binary relations on w  
since adms do not interpret variables  we need an assignment that assigns a subset
of w to each set variable  before we can evaluate terms in an adm  to evaluate object
assertions  we need an additional assignment that assigns an element of w to each object
variable 
ff


definition    let l be an adl and w   w  f w   rw be an adm for l  an assignment
for w is a pair a    a    a    such that a  is a mapping from the set of set variables v into
 w   and a  is an injective  mapping from the set of object variables x into w   let w be
an adm and a    a    a    be an assignment for w  with each l term t  we inductively
associate a value tw a in  w as follows 
 xw a    a   x  for all variables x  v  
 t w a  
   t   t   w a    tw a
 tw a
  t w a    w    t w a    t   t   w a    tw a
 
 
 
 f  t            tnf  w a    f w  tw a
          tw a
nf   
 
if x            xn are the set variables occurring in t  then we often write tw  x            xn   as
shorthand for tw a   where a is an assignment with xa
i   xi for    i  n 
the truth relation    between hw  ai and assertions is defined as follows 
 hw  ai    r a  b  iff a   a rw a   b  
 hw  ai    a   t iff a   a   tw a  
 
 tw a
 hw  ai    t  v t  iff tw a
 
 
in this case we say that the assertion is satisfied in hw  ai  if  for an adm w and a set of
assertions   there exists an assignment a for w such that each assertion in  is satisfied
in hw  ai  then w is a model for  
there are two differences between adms and dl interpretations  first  in a dl interpretation  the interpretation of the role names fixes the interpretation of the function
symbols corresponding to concept constructors that involve roles  like value restrictions 
number restrictions  etc    the interpretation of the concept names corresponds to an assignment  thus  a dl model is an adm together with an assignment  whereas an adm
alone corresponds to what is called frame in modal logics  second  in dl the roles used in
concept constructors may  of course  also occur in role assertions  in contrast  the definition
of adms per se does not enforce any connection between the interpretation of the function
symbols and the interpretation of the relation symbols  such connections can  however  be
enforced by restricting the attention to a subclass of all possible adms for the adl 
   this corresponds to the unique name assumption 

  

fifusions of description logics and abstract description systems

definition    an abstract description system  ads  is a pair  l  m   where l is an adl
and m is a class of adms for l that is closed under isomorphic copies  
from the dl point of view  the choice of the class m defines the semantics of the
concept and role constructors  and it allows us  e g   to incorporate restrictions on role
interpretations  in this sense  the ads can be viewed as determining a  description  logic 
to be more concrete  in a dl interpretation the interpretation of the function symbols
is determined by the interpretation of the role names  thus one can  for example  restrict
the class of models to adms that interpret a certain role as a transitive relation or as the
composition of two other roles  another restriction that can be realized by the choice of
m is that nominals  corresponding to nullary function symbols  must be interpreted as
singleton sets 
let us now define reasoning problems for abstract description systems  we will introduce
satisfiability of sets of assertions  with or without term assertions   which corresponds to
consistency of aboxes  with or without gcis   and satisfiability of terms  with or without
term assertions   which corresponds to satisfiability of concept descriptions  with or without
gcis  
definition    given an ads  l  m   a finite set of assertions  is called satisfiable in
 l  m  iff there exists an adm w  m and an assignment a for w such that hw  ai
satisfies all assertions in   the term t is called satisfiable in  l  m  iff  a   t  is satisfiable
in  l  m   where a is an arbitrary object variable 
 the satisfiability problem for  l  m  is concerned with the following question  given
a finite set of object assertions  of l  is  is satisfiable in  l  m  
 the relativized satisfiability problem for  l  m  is concerned with the following question  given a finite set of assertions  of l  is  is satisfiable in  l  m  
 the term satisfiability problem for  l  m  is concerned with the following question 
given a term t of l  is t satisfiable in  l  m  
 the relativized term satisfiability problem for  l  m  is concerned with the following
question  given a term t and a set of term assertions  of l  is  a   t    satisfiable
in  l  m  
in the next section  we will define the fusion of two adss  and show that  relativized 
satisfiability is decidable in the fusion if  relativized  satisfiability in the component adss
is decidable  for these transfer results to hold  we must restrict ourselves to so called local
adss

an ads s    l  m  is called local iff m is closed under disjoint unions 
in the remainder of this section  we first analyze the connection between adss and dls
in more detail  and then comment on the relationship to modal logics 
    correspondence to description logics
we will show that the dls introduced in section   correspond to adss  in order to do this 
we first need to introduce frames  a notion well known from modal logic  let l be one of
the dls introduced in section   
definition     frames   an l frame f is a pair  f   f    where f is a nonempty set 
called the domain of f  and f is the interpretation function  which maps
 each nominal i to a singleton subset i f of f   and
 each role name r to a subset rf of f  f such that the restrictions for role
interpretations in l are satisfied  for example  in alc r    each r  nr  is mapped
to a transitive binary relation 
the interpretation function f can inductively be extended to complex roles in the obvious
way  i e   by interpreting the role constructors in l according to their semantics as given in
figure   
an interpretation i is based on a frame f iff i   f   ri   rf for all roles r  nr  
and i i   i f for all nominals i  no  
a frame can be viewed as an interpretation that is partial in the sense that the interpretation of individual and concept names is not fixed  note that  in contrast to the case of
concept and individual names  the interpretation of nominals is already fixed in the frame 
the reason for this is that  if we do not interpret nominals in the frame  then we have to
treat them as set variables on the ads side  these would  however  have to be variables
to which only singleton sets may be assigned  since such a restriction is not possible in the
framework of adss as defined above  we interpret nominals in the frame  the consequence
is that they correspond to functions of arity   on the ads side 
now  we define the abstract description system s    l  m  corresponding to a dl l 
it is straightforward to translate the syntax of l into an abstract description language l 
definition     corresponding adl   let l be a dl with concept and role constructors
as well as restrictions on role interpretations as introduced in section    the corresponding
abstract description language l is defined as follows  for every concept name a in l  there
exists a set variable xa in l  and for every individual name i in l there exists an object
variable ai in l  let r be the set of  possibly complex  role descriptions of l  the set of
relation symbols of l is r  and the set of function symbols of l is the smallest set containing
   for every role description r  r  unary function symbols fr and fr  
  

fifusions of description logics and abstract description systems

   if l provides unqualified number restrictions  then  for every n  n and every role
description r  r  function symbols fnr and fnr of arity   
   if l provides qualified number restrictions  then  for every n  n and every role r  r 
unary function symbols fnr
and fnr
 


   if l provides nominals  then  for every i  no   a function symbol fi of arity   
   if l provides feature agreement and disagreement  then  for every pair of feature chains
 u    u     two function symbols fu  u  and fu  u  of arity   
for an l concept description c  let tc denote the representation of c as an l term 
which is defined in the obvious way  concept names a are translated into set variables xa  
the concept constructors   u  and t are mapped to     and   respectively  and all other
concept constructors are translated to the corresponding function symbols  obviously  both
the sets of function and relation symbols of l may be infinite 
an example of the translation of concept descriptions into terms of an adl was already
given above  the alcn u  concept description a u  r  u r     b u    r     corresponds
to the term xa  f r  ur      xb  f  r       
we now define the set of abstract description models m corresponding to the dl l 
for every l frame  m contains a corresponding adm 
definition     corresponding
let
f    f   f   be a frame  the corresponding

abstract description model w   w  f w   rw has domain w    f   the relation symbols
of l are just the role descriptions of l  and thus they are interpreted in the frame f  for
each relation symbol r  r we can hence define rw    rf  
to define f w   we need to define f w for every nullary function symbol f in l  and
w
f  x  for every unary function symbol f in l and every x  i   let a be an arbitrary
concept name  for each x  f   let ix be the interpretation based on f mapping the
concept name a to x and every other concept name to    to define f w   we make a case
distinction according to the type of f

the class of adms m thus obtained from a dl l is obviously closed under isomorphic copies since this also holds for the set of l frames  independently of which dl l we
consider   hence  the tuple s    l  m  corresponding to a dl l is indeed an ads 
as an example  let us view the dl alcn u as an ads  the adl l corresponding to
alcn u has already been discussed  thus  we concentrate on the class of adms m induced

domain and interpretations rf of the role names r  the adm w   w  f w   rw induced
by f is defined as follows  the set w is identical to the domain of f  each role description
yields a relation symbol  which is interpreted in w just as in the frame  for example 
 r  u r   w   r f  r f   it remains to define the interpretation of the function symbols 
we illustrate this on two examples  first  consider the  unary  function symbol f r  ur     
w
given a subset x of w   the function f r
maps x to
  ur   
w
f r
 x      w  w   v  x for all v with  w  v   r f  r f   
  ur   

i e   the interpretation of the concept description  r  u r    a in the interpretations based
on f interpreting a by x  accordingly  the value of the constant symbol f  r  in w is
given by the interpretation of    r  in the interpretations based on f 
it is easy to show that the interpretation of concept descriptions in l coincides with the
interpretation of the corresponding terms in s    l  m

lemma     let f be a frame  w   w  f w   rw be the adm corresponding to f  a  
 a    a    be an assignment for w  c be a concept description  and let the concept names
used in c be among a            ak   for all interpretations i based on f with aii   a   xai  
for all    i  k  we have that
c i   tw a
 
c
as an easy consequence of this lemma  there is a close connection between reasoning
in a dl l and reasoning in the corresponding ads  given a tbox t and an abox a of
the dl l  we define the corresponding set s t   a  of assertions of the corresponding adl
 l  m  in the obvious way  i e   each gci c v d in t yields a term assertion tc v td   each
role assertion r i  j  in a yields an object assertion r ai   aj    and each concept assertion
c i  yields an object assertion ai   tc  
proposition     the abox a is consistent relative to the tbox t in l iff s t   a  is
satisfiable in the corresponding ads 
we do not treat non relativized consistency explicitly since it is the special case of
relativized consistency where the tbox is empty 
as already mentioned above  our transfer results require the component adss to be
local  we call a dl l local iff the ads  l  m  corresponding to l is local  it turns out
that not all dls introduced in section   are local 
proposition     let l be one of the dls introduced in section    then  l is local iff l
does not include any of the following constructors  nominals  role complement  universal
role 
proof  we start with the only if direction  which is more interesting since it shows why
adss corresponding to dls with nominals  role complement  or the universal role are not
local  we make a case distinction according to which of these constructors l contains 
 nominals  consider the disjoint union w of the adms w  and w    and assume
that w  and w  correspond to frames of a dl with nominals  by definition of the

disjoint union  we know that w   w      if i  no is a nominal  then the
definition of the disjoint union implies that fiw   fiw   fiw    since nominals are
interpreted by singleton sets in w  and w    and since the domains of w  and w 
are disjoint  this implies that fiw is a set of cardinality    consequently  w cannot
correspond to an adm induced by a frame for a dl with nominals  since such frames
interpret nominals by singleton sets 
 universal role  again  consider the disjoint union w of the adms w  and w    and
assume that w  and w  correspond to frames of a dl with the universal role  let u
denote the universal role  i e   a role name for which the interpretation is restricted to
the binary relation relating each pair of individuals of the domain  by the definition of
the disjoint union  we have u w   u w  u w    w  w  w  w     w w  
consequently  w cannot correspond to an adm induced by a frame for a dl with
universal role  since such a frame would interpret u by w  w

and assume that w  and w  correspond to frames of a dl with role negation  for an

it remains to prove the if direction  assume that l is one of the dls introduced in
section   that does not allow for nominals  role complements  and
 the universal role

it should be noted that arguments similar to the ones used in the proof of the only
if direction show that  in the presence of the universal role or of role negation  function
symbols  e g   fu   may also violate the locality condition 
the transfer results for decidability that are developed in this paper only apply to fusions
of local adss  hence  the only if direction of the proposition implies that our results
are not applicable to fusions of adss corresponding to dls that incorporate nominals  role
complement  or the universal role 
    correspondence to modal logics
in this paper our concern are fusions of description logics and not modal logics  nevertheless 
it is useful to have a brief look at the relationship between adss and modal logic  standard
modal languages can be regarded as adls without relation symbols and object variables
 just identify propositional formulas with terms   given such an adl l  a set l of l terms
is called a classical modal logic iff is contains all tautologies of classical propositional logic
and is closed under modus ponens  substitutions  and the regularity rule
x   y            xnf  ynf
f  x            xnf    f  y            ynf  
for all function symbols f of l  the minimal classical modal logic in the language with one
unary function symbol is known as the logic e  see chellas        
any ads  l  m  based on l determines a classical modal logic l by taking the valid
terms  i e   by defining
t  l iff tw a   w for all w  m and assignments a in w 
  

fifusions of description logics and abstract description systems

the logic e is determined by the ads with precisely one unary operator whose class
of adms consists of all models  chellas formulates this completeness result  theorem
    in chellas        for so called minimal models  alias neighborhood frames   which are 
however  just a notational variant of abstract description models with one unary operator
 dosen         if the classical modal logic l is determined by an ads with decidable term
satisfiability problem  then l is decidable since t  l iff t is unsatisfiable 
a classical modal logic l is called normal iff it additionally contains
f  x            xj    xj  yj   xj             xnf    f  x            xj    xj   xj             xnf   
f  x            xj    yj   xj             xnf  
and
f                  f                            f                 
for all function symbols f and all j with    j  nf  jonsson   tarski        jonsson  
tarski        goldblatt         this definition of normal modal logics assumes that the
formulas  terms  are built using only necessity  box  operators   we will work here only
with necessity operators  the corresponding possibility operators are definable by putting
f    x            xnf     f  x            xnf   
the minimal normal modal logic in the language with one unary operator is known as k
 chellas        
we call a function f   w n  w normal iff for all    j  n and x            xn   yj  w

any x  y  w   a function symbol f is called normal in an ads  l  m  iff the functions
f w are normal for all w  m 
for any role r of some dl  the function symbol fr is normal in the corresponding
ads  to the contrary  it is readily checked that neither fnr

normal

obviously  an ads  l  m  determines a normal modal logic iff all function symbols of
l are normal in  l  m   completeness of k with respect to kripke semantics  chellas 
      implies that the logic k is determined by the ads with one unary operator whose
class of adms consists of all models interpreting this operator by a normal function 
   note that some authors define normal modal logics using possibility  diamond  operators  in which case
the definitions are the duals of what we have introduced and thus at first sight look quite different

   fusions of abstract description systems
in this section  we define the fusion of abstract description systems and prove two transfer theorems for decidability  one concerning satisfiability and the other one concerning
relativized satisfiability 
definition     the fusion s   s     l   l    m   m    of two abstract description
systems s     l    m    and s     l    m    over
 disjoint sets of function symbols f of l  and g of l   
 disjoint sets of relation symbols r of l  and q of l    and
 the same sets of set and object variables
is defined as follows  l   l  is the adl based on
 the union f  g of the function symbols of l  and l    and
 the union r  q of the relation symbols of l  and l   
and m   m  is defined as
e

d

  w  f w  g w   rw  qw   w  f w   rw  m  and w  g w   qw  m    
as an example  consider the adss s  and s  corresponding to the dls alcf and
alc    t introduced in section    we concentrate on the function symbols provided by
their fusion  in the following  we assume that the set of role names employed by alcf
and alc    t are disjoint 
 the ads s  is based on the following function symbols   i  unary functions symbol
fr and fr for every role name r of alcf   ii  nullary functions symbols corresponding to the same as constructor for every pair of chains of functional roles of
alcf 
 the ads s  is based on the following function symbols   iii  unary functions symbol
fq and fq for every role description q built from role names of alc    t using
union  composition  and transitive closure 
since we assumed that the set of role names employed by alcf and alc    t are disjoint 
these sets of function symbols are also disjoint  the union of these sets provides us both
with the symbols for the same as constructor and with the symbols for value and existential restrictions on role descriptions involving union  composition  and transitive closure 
however  the role descriptions contain only role names from alc    t   and thus none of
the functional roles of alcf occurs in such descriptions  thus  the fusion of alcf and
alc    t yields a strict fragment of their union alcf    t  
    relativized satisfiability
we prove a transfer result for decidability of the relativized satisfiability problem  show that
this also yields a corresponding transfer result for the relativized term satisfiability problem 
and investigate how these transfer results can be extended to adss that correspond to dls
providing for the universal role

      the transfer result
this section is concerned with establishing the following transfer theorem 
theorem     let s  and s  be local adss  and suppose that the relativized satisfiability
problems for s  and s  are decidable  then the relativized satisfiability problem for s   s 
is also decidable 
the idea underlying the proof of this theorem is to translate a given set of assertions 
of s   s  into a set of assertions   of s  and a set of assertions   of s  such that  is
satisfiable in s   s  iff   is satisfiable in s  and   is satisfiable in s    the first  naive 
idea for how to obtain the set i  i         is to replace in  alien terms  i e   subterms
starting with function symbols not belonging to si   by new set variables  the surrogate
variables introduced below   with this approach  satisfiability of  would in fact imply
satisfiability of the sets i   but the converse would not be true  the difficulty arises when
trying to combine the models of   and   into one for   to ensure that the two models
can indeed be combined  the sets i must contain additional assertions that make sure that
the surrogate variables in one model and the corresponding alien subterms in the other
model are interpreted in a compatible way  to be more precise  there are  finitely many 
different ways of adding such assertions  and one must try which of them  if any  leads to
a satisfiable pair   and    
for the proof of theorem     we fix two local adss si    li   mi    i          in which
l  is based on the set of function symbols f and relation symbols r  and l  is based on g
and q  let l   l   l  and m   m   m   
in what follows  we use the following notation  for a set of assertions   denote by
term   and obj   the set of terms and object names in   respectively 
we start with explaining how alien subterms in the set  can be replaced by new set
variables  for each l term t of the form h t            tn    h  f  g  we reserve a new variable
xt   which will be called the surrogate of t  we assume that the set of surrogate variables
is disjoint to the original sets of variables  as sketched above  the idea underlying the
introduction of surrogate variables is that the decision procedure for s   s    cannot deal
with terms containing function symbols from g  f   thus  these alien function symbols
must be replaced before applying the procedure  to be more precise  we replace the whole
alien subterm starting with the alien function symbol by its surrogate  for example  if the
unary symbol f belongs to f  and the unary symbol g belongs to g  then f  g f  x    is a
mixed l term  to obtain a term of l    we replace the subterm g f  x   by its surrogate 
which yields f  xg f  x      analogously  to obtain a term of l    we replace the whole term
by its surrogate  which yields xf  g f  x      we now define this replacement process more
formally 
definition     for an l term t without surrogate variables  denote by sur   t  the l   term
resulting from t when all occurrences of terms g t            tn    g  g  that are not within the
scope of some g    g are replaced by their surrogate variable xg t       tn     for a set  of
terms  put sur         sur   t    t    and define sur   t  as well as sur     accordingly 
denote by sub   the set of subterms of terms in   and by sub     the variables
occurring in  as well as the subterms of alien terms  i e   terms starting with a symbol
  

fibaader  lutz  sturm    wolter

from g  in   more formally  we can define
sub        sub t   xt  var sur        var   
define sub     accordingly 
for example  let f  f be unary and g  g be binary  if t   f  g x  f  g x  y      then
sur   t    f  xg x f  g x y       note that the restriction not within the scope of some g    g
is there to clarify that only the top most alien subterms are to be replaced  for the term t
of this example  we have sub    t      g x  f  g x  y     f  g x  y    g x  y   x  y  
note that the boolean operators occurring in terms are shared function symbols in
the sense that they are alien to neither l  nor l    thus  sur   f  x g x  y     f  x xg x y 
and sur   f  x   g x  y     xf  x   g x  y  
of course  when replacing whole terms by variables  some information is lost  for
example  consider the  inconsistent  assertion  r       r   u   r      i  and assume that
r  is a role of one component of a fusion  and r  a role of the other component  translated
into abstract description language syntax  the concept description r       r    u    r    
yields the term t    fr   f   r     f   r       where fr  is a function symbol of l  and
the other two function symbols belong to l    now  sur   t    fr   x  y   where x is the
surrogate for f   r    and y is the surrogate for f   r      if the decision procedure for the
first ads only sees fr   x  y   it has no way to know that the conjunction of the alien
subterms corresponding to x and y is unsatisfiable  in fact  for this procedure x and y are
arbitrary set variables  and thus x  y is satisfiable  to avoid this problem  we introduce
so called consistency set consisting of types  where a type says for each relevant formula
whether the formula itself or its negation is supposed to hold  the sets   and   will then
contain additional information that basically ensures that their models satisfy the same
types  this will allow us to merge these models into one for  
definition     given a finite set  of l terms  we define the consistency set c   of  as
c       tc   c     where the type tc determined by c   is defined as
tc   

 

      c  

 

         c  

given a finite set  of assertions in l  we define subi       subi  term     we abbreviate
c i       c subi      for i         
in the example above  we have
sub   fr   f   r     f   r         f   r      f   r      
and thus c     ai   fr   f   r     f   r        consists of the   terms

fifusions of description logics and abstract description systems

given a set of terms   an element tc of its consistency set c   can indeed be considered
as the type of an element e of the domain of an adm w r t    any such element e
belongs to the interpretations of some of the terms in   and to the complements of the
interpretations of the other terms  thus  if c is the set of terms of  to which e belongs 
then e also belongs to the interpretation of tc and it does not belong to the interpretation
of any of the other terms in c    in this case we say that e realizes the type tc  
we are now ready to formulate the theorem that reduces the relativized satisfiability
problem in a fusion of two local adss to relativized satisfiability in the component adss 
a proof of this theorem can be found in the appendix 
theorem     let si    li   mi    i          be two local adss in which l  is based on
the set of function symbols f and relation symbols r  and l  is based on g and q  and
let l   l   l  and m   m   m    if  is a finite set of assertions from l  then the
following are equivalent 
    is satisfiable in  l  m  
   there exist
 a  a set d  c      
 b  for every term t  d an object variable at   obj   
 c  for every a  obj   a term ta  d 
such that the union   of the following sets of assertions in l  is satisfiable in
 l    m    
w
 d   at   sur   t    t  d      v sur    d   
 e   a   sur   ta     a  obj    

 f    r a  b    r a  b     r  r  
 g   sur   t    v sur   t      t  v t       a   sur   s     a   s     
and the union   of the following sets of assertions in l  is satisfiable in  l    m    
w
 h   at   sur   t    t  d      v sur    d   
 i   a   sur   ta     a  obj    

 j   q a  b    q a  b     q  q  
intuitively    a  guesses a set d of types  i e   elements of the consistency set   the
idea is that these are exactly the types that are realized in the model of   to be constructed
when showing        and given when showing          condition   b  introduces for
every type in d a name for an object realizing this type  and   c  guesses for every object
variable occurring in  a type from d 
w regarding   d  and   h   one should note that the set of assertions  at   t   t  d    v
d  states that every type in d is realized  i e   there is an object in the model having
this type  and that every object has one of the types in d  the sets of assertions   d  and
  h  are obtained from this set through surrogation to make it digestible by the decision
procedures of the component logics 
  

fibaader  lutz  sturm    wolter

the assertions in   e  and   i  state  again in surrogated versions  that the object
interpreting the variable a has type ta   this ensures that  in the models of   and  
 given when showing          the objects interpreting a have the same type ta from d 
otherwise  these models could not be combined into a common one for  
the sets   f  and   j  are obtained from  by distributing its relationship assertions
between   and     depending on the relation symbol used in the assertion 
the set   g  contains  in surrogated version  the term assertions of the form t  v t  and
the membership assertions of the form a   s of  
condition   is asymmetric in two respects  first  it guesses a subset of c      rather than
a subset of c       of course this is arbitrary  we could also have chosen index   instead
of   here  second  the set   neither contains the assertions  sur   t    v sur   t      t  v
t     nor  a   sur   s     a   s      if we added these assertions  the theorem would
still be true  but this would unnecessarily increase the amount of work to be done by the
combined decision procedure  in fact  since the other assertions in   and   enforce a tight
coordination between the models of   and     the fact that the membership assertions and
term assertions of  are satisfied in the models of   implies that they are also satisfied in
the models of    see the appendix for details  
to prove theorem     we must show how theorem    can be used to construct a
decision procedure for relativized satisfiability in s   s  from such decision procedures for
the component systems s  and s    for a given finite set of assertions  of s   s    the set
c      is also finite  and thus there are finitely many sets d in   a  and choices of types for
object variables in   c   consequently  we can enumerate all of them and check whether
one of these choices leads to satisfiable sets   and     by definition of the sets i and of
the functions suri   the assertions in i are indeed assertions of li   and thus the satisfiability
algorithm for  li   mi   can be applied to i   this proves theorem    
regarding the complexity of the obtained decision procedure  the costly step is guessing
the right set d  since the cardinality of the set sub     is linear in the size of   the
cardinality of c      is exponential in the size of   and each element of it has size quadratic
in    thus  there are doubly exponentially many different subsets to be chosen from  since
the cardinality of the chosen set d may be exponential in the size of   also the size of  
and   may be exponential in   because of the big disjunction over d   from this  the
following corollary follows 
corollary     let s  and s  be local adss  and suppose that the relativized satisfiability
problems for s  and s  are decidable in exptime  pspace   then the relativized satisfiability problem for s   s  is decidable in  exptime  expspace  
p  n 

proof  assume that  has size n  then we must consider       for some polynomial p   
p  n 
different sets d in   a   each such set has size  p   n  and thus we have of      choices
in   c   for some polynomial p     overall  this still leaves us with doubly exponentially
many choices  now assume that the relativized satisfiability problems for s  and s  are
decidable in exptime  since each call of these procedures is applied to a set of assertions of
p  n 
p  n 
exponential size  it may take double exponential time  say      and       for polynomials
p  and p     overall  we thus have a time complexity of
  

p   n 

   

p   n

p   n

p n 

which can clearly be majorized by   
for an appropriate polynomial p  this shows
membership in  exptime 
the argument regarding the space complexity is similar  here one must additionally
take into account that doubly exponentially many choices can be enumerated using an
exponentially large counter 

      the relativized term satisfiability problem
the statement of theorem    itself does not imply a transfer result for the relativized term
satisfiability problem  the problem is that decidability of the relativized term satisfiability
problem in s  and s  does not necessarily imply decidability of the relativized satisfiability
problem in these adss  and thus the prerequisite for the theorem to apply is not satisfied 
however  if we consider the statement of theorem     then it is easy to see that this theorem
also yields a transfer result for the relativized term satisfiability problem 
corollary     let s  and s  be local adss  and suppose that the relativized term satisfiability problems for s  and s  are decidable  then the relativized term satisfiability problem
for s   s  is also decidable 
proof  consider the satisfiability criterion in theorem     if we are interested in relativized term satisfiability  then  is of the form  a   t       where   is a set of term
assertions  in this case  the sets of assertions   and   do not contain object assertions
involving relations  now  assume that i is of the form  a    t            an   tn     i   where  i
is a set of term assertions  since two assertions of the form b   s    b   s  are equivalent to
one assertion b   s   s    we may assume that the ai are distinct from each other  since si
is local  it is easy to see that the following are equivalent 
    a    t            an   tn     i is satisfiable in si  
    aj   tj     i is satisfiable in si for all j              n 
since        is trivial  it is enough to show         given models wj  mi of  aj  
tj     i  j              n   their disjoint union also belongs to mi   and it is clearly a model of
 a    t            an   tn     i  
the second condition can now be checked by applying the term satisfiability test in si
n times 

      dealing with the universal role
as stated above  proposition      adss corresponding to dls with the universal role are
not local  and thus theorem    cannot be applied directly  nevertheless  in some cases
this theorem can also be used to obtain a decidability result for fusions of dls with the
universal role  provided that both of them provide for a universal role   we will comment
on the usefulness of this approach in more detail in section      
definition     given an ads s    l  m   we denote by s u the ads obtained from s by
   extending l with two function symbols fus and fus   and

for adss s corresponding to a dl l  the ads s u corresponds to the extension of l
with the universal role  where the universal role can only be used within value and existential
restrictions   there is a close connection between the relativized satisfiability problem in s
and the satisfiability problem in s u  
proposition     if s is a local ads  then the following conditions are equivalent 
   the relativized  term  satisfiability problem for s is decidable 
   the  term  satisfiability problem for s u is decidable 
   the relativized  term  satisfiability problem for s u is decidable 

proof  we restrict our attention to the term satisfiability problem since the equivalences
for the satisfiability problem can be proved similarly 
the implication        is trivial  and        is easy to show  in fact  t is satisfiable in
s relative to the term assertions  s  v t            sn v tn   iff tfus    t  s         tn sn   
is satisfiable in s u  
to show         we assume that the relativized term satisfiability problem for s is
decidable  let s    l  m  and s u    lu   mu    in the following  we use fu as an
abbreviation for fus   since we can replace equivalently in any term the function symbol
fus by fu   we may assume without loss of generality that fus does not occur in terms
of lu  
suppose a set     a   s    from lu is given  where  is a set of term assertions  we
want to decide whether  is satisfiable in some model w  mu   to this purpose  we transform  into a set of assertions not containing fu   the idea underlying this transformation
is that  given a model w  mu   we have fu  t w   w     depending on whether tw   w
or not  consequently  if we replace fu  t  accordingly by   or   the evaluation of this term
in w does not change  however  in the satisfiability test we do not have the model w  we
are trying to decide whether one exists   and thus we must guess the right replacement 
a term t from lu is called a u  term iff it starts with fu   the set of u  terms that
occur  possibly as subterms  in  is denoted by u   set  inductively  for any function
   note that it is not necessary to add the universal role u to the set of relation symbols since an assertion
of the form u  a  b  is trivially true  however  the use of the universal role within  qualified  number
restrictions is not covered by this extension

where the at are mutually distinct new object variables  note that  does not contain the
function symbol fu   and thus it can be viewed as a set of assertions of s  in addition  though
it contains more than one membership assertion  it does not contain assertions involving
relation symbols  consequently  the satisfiability of  in s can be checked using the term
satisfiability test for s  see the proof of corollary    above   decidability of the relativized
term satisfiability problem for s u then follows from the following claim 
claim   is satisfiable in a member of mu iff there exists a mapping    u       
such that  is satisfiable in a member of m 
to 
prove this claim  firstff suppose that  is satisfied under an assignment a in a member

the only critical case is the one where t   fu  s   first  assume that  fu  s      fu  s    
 
   then  contains   v s   and thus w    s  w a   sw  a   where the second identity
 
 
holds by induction  however  sw  a   w implies  fu  s  w  a   w    w a   the case where
 fu  s      fu  s      can be treated similarly  here the term assertion as   s ensures
that s  and thus by induction s  is not interpreted as the whole domain  consequently 
applying fu to it yields the empty set 
since hw  ai       the identity    implies that hw    ai      this completes the proof
of the claim  and thus also of the proposition 

for normal modal logics  the result stated in this proposition was already shown by
goranko and passy         the proof technique used there can  however  not be transfered
  

fibaader  lutz  sturm    wolter

to our more general situation since it strongly depends on the normality of the modal
operators 
using proposition     we obtain the following corollary to our first transfer theorem 
corollary     let s    s  be local adss and assume that  for i          the relativized
 term  satisfiability problem for si is decidable  then the relativized  term  satisfiability
problem for s u  s u is decidable 
proof  we know by theorem     corollary     that the relativized  term  satisfiability
problem for s   s  is decidable  hence  proposition    yields that the relativized  term 
satisfiability problem for  s   s   u is decidable  but s u  s u is just a notational variant
of  s   s   u   the function symbols fus  and fus  can be replaced by fus  s   and
analogously for fus  s    since all three have identical semantics 

    satisfiability
note that theorem    does not yield a transfer result for the unrelativized satisfiability
problem  of course  if the relativized satisfiability problems for s  and s  are decidable 
then the theorem implies that the satisfiability problem for s   s  is also decidable  since
it is a special case of the relativized satisfiability problem   however  to be able to apply
the theorem to obtain decidability of the satisfiability problem in the fusion  the component
adss must satisfy the stronger requirement that the relativized satisfiability problemwis decidable  indeed  the set i in theorem    contains a term assertion  namely   v suri   d  
even if  does not contain any term assertions 
there are cases where the relativized satisfiability problem is undecidable whereas the
satisfiability problem is still decidable  for example  theorem    cannot be applied for
the fusion of alcf and alc    t since the relativized satisfiability problem for alcf is
already undecidable  baader et al          however  the satisfiability problem is decidable
for both dls 
      covering normal terms
before we can formulate a transfer result for the satisfiability problem  we need to introduce
an additional notion  which generalizes the notion of a normal modal logic 
definition     covering normal terms   let  l  m  be an ads and f be a function
symbol of l of arity n  the term tf  x   with one variable x  is a covering normal term for
f iff the following holds for all w  m 
 tw
f  w     w
w
w
 for all x  y  w   tw
f  x  y     tf  x   tf  y    and

 for all x  x            yn  w   x  xi   x  yi for    i  n implies
w
w
w
tw
f  x   f  x            xn     tf  x   f  y            yn   

an ads  l  m  is said to have covering normal terms iff one can effectively determine a
covering normal term tf for every function symbol f of l 
  

fifusions of description logics and abstract description systems

intuitively  the first two conditions state that the covering normal term behaves like a
value restriction  or box operator   consider the term fr  x   where fr is the function
symbol corresponding to the value restriction constructor for the role r  then fr  x 
obviously satisfies the first two requirements for covering normal terms  note that the
second condition implies that the function induced by tf is monotonic  i e   x  y implies
w
tw
f  x   tf  y    the third condition specifies the connection between the covering normal
term and the function symbol it covers  with respect to elements of tw
f  x   the values
w
w
of the functions f  x            xn   and f  y            yn   agree provided that their arguments
agree on x  it is easy to see that fr  x  is a covering normal term for the function symbols
corresponding to the value  existential  and  qualified  number restrictions on the role r
 see proposition    below  
given covering normal terms tf for the function symbols f of a finite set of function
symbols e  one can construct a term te that is a covering normal term for all the elements
of e 
lemma     suppose the ads  l  m  has covering normal terms and l is based on a set
of function symbols f   denote by tf the covering normal term for the function symbol f  
for all f  f   then  for every finite set e  f of function symbols  the term
te  x    

 

tf  x 

f e

is a covering normal term for all f  e 
      correspondence to normal modal logics
the following result shows that any ads in which every function symbol is normal has
covering normal terms  hence  the notion of covering normal terms generalizes the notion
of normality in modal logics 
proposition     let  l  m  be an ads  and assume that f is a normal function symbol
in  l  m   then
tf  x     f  x               f    x                 f              x 
is a covering normal term for f   in particular  if f is nullary  unary   then tf  x     
 tf  x    f  x   is a covering normal term for f  
proof  the first two conditions in the definition of covering normal terms immediately
follow from the definition of normal function symbols  thus  we concentrate on the third
condition  assume  for simplicity  that f is binary  suppose w  m and x  x    x    y    y  
w with x  xi   x  yi for i         and set f    f w   then f  x  x    x  x     
f  x  y    x  y     since f is normal  we know that
f  x  x    x  x      f  x  x   f  x  x     f  x    x   f  x    x    
f  x  y    x  y      f  x  x   f  x  y     f  y    x   f  y    y

and thus
f  x  x   f  x  x     f  x    x   f  x    x     
f  x  x   f  x  y     f  y    x   f  y    y    
since  by normality of f  
f  x  x   f  x  x     f  x    x   tw
f  x  
f  x  x   f  x  y     f  y    x   tw
f  x  
w
this implies tw
f  x   f  x    x      tf  x   f  y    y    



      the transfer result
using covering normal terms  we can now formulate the second transfer theorem  which is
concerned with the transfer of decidability of  non relativized  satisfiability 
theorem     let s  and s  be local adss having covering normal terms  and suppose
that the satisfiability problems for s  and s  are decidable  then the satisfiability problem
for s   s  is also decidable 
as in the proof of theorem     we fix two local adss si    li   mi    i          in which
l  is based on the set of function symbols f and relation symbols r  and l  is based on g
and q  let l   l   l  and m   m   m   
the proof of theorem    follows the same general ideas as the proof of theorem    
there are  however  notable differences in the way satisfiability in s   s  is reduced to
satisfiability in s  and s    in theorem    we had to guess a set d of types  and then
based on this set and some additional guesses  a pair of satisfiability problems   and   in
s  and s    respectively  was generated  in the proof of theorem     we do not need to guess
d  instead  we can compute the right set  however  this computation requires us to solve
additional satisfiability problems in the fusion s   s    nevertheless  this yields a reduction
since the alternation depth  i e   number of alternations between function symbols of s 
and s    decreases when going from the input set  to these additional mixed satisfiability
problems 
before we can describe this reduction in more detail  we must introduce somewnew
notation  in the case of relativized satisfiability  term assertions of the w
form   v suri   d 
were used to assert that all elements of thew domain belong to suri   d   now  we use
covering normal terms to propagate suri   d  into terms up to a certain depth  for a
set of function symbols e  define the e depth de  t  of a term t inductively 
de  xi      
de  t    de  t 
de  t   t      de  t   t      max de  t     de  t    
de  f  t            tn      max de  t             de  tn        if f  e
de  f  t            tn      max de  t             de  tn    if f   e
  

fifusions of description logics and abstract description systems

if  is a finite set of assertions  then
de       max de  t    t  term    
put  for a term t x  with one variable x  t   x     x  tm    x     t tm  x    t   x     x  and
tm    x     tm    x   tm  x  
we are now in the position to formulate the result that reduces satisfiability in the fusion
of two local adss with covering normal terms to satisfiability in the component adss 
theorem     let si    li   mi    i          be two local adss having covering normal
terms in which l  is based on the set of function symbols f and relation symbols r  and
l  is based on g and q  and let l   l   l  and m   m   m    let  be a finite set
of object assertions from l  put m    df     r    dg     and let c x   d x   be a covering
normal term for all function symbols in  that are in f  g  
for i          denote by i the set of all s  c i    such that the term s is satisfiable in
 l  m   then the following three conditions are equivalent 
    is satisfiable in  l  m  
   there exist
 for every t    an object variable at   obj  
 for every a  obj   a term ta   
such that the union   of the following sets of object assertions is satisfiable in
 l    m    
w
  at   sur   t  cm  sur           t      
w
  a   sur   ta  cm  sur           a  obj    
  r a  b    r a  b     r  r  
  a   sur   s     a   s     
and the union   of the following sets of object assertions is satisfiable in  l    m    
w
  at   sur   t  dr  sur           t      
w
  a   sur   ta  dr  sur           a  obj    
  q a  b    q a  b     q  q  

   the same condition as in     above  with   replaced by    
the sets i in the above theorem are very similarwto the ones in theorem     the
main difference is that
w the term assertion   v suri   d  is no longer there  instead 
the disjunction suri       is directly inserted into the terms using the covering normals
terms  as already mentioned above  another difference is that the set d  which had to be
guessed in theorem     is replaced by the set   in     and   in      actually  guessing the
set d is no
w longer possible in this case  in the proof of theorem    we need to know that
  v suri   d  is satisfiable in si  i e   holds in at least one model in mi    but we have no
way to check this effectively since we do not have an algorithm for relativized satisfiability
  

fibaader  lutz  sturm    wolter

in si   taking the set i ensures that this property is satisfied  see the proof in the appendix
for details  
by definition  i is the set of all s  c i    such that the term s is satisfiable in  l  m  
recall that the term s is satisfiable iff  a   s  is satisfiable in  l  m  for an arbitrary
object variable a  since the elements of c i    are still mixed terms  i e   terms of the
fusion   computing the set i actually needs a recursive call to the decision procedure for
satisfiability in  l  m   this recursion is well founded since the alternation depth decreases 
definition     for a term s of l  denote by a   s  and a   s  the   alternation and the
  alternation depth of s  respectively  that is to say  a   s  is the length of the longest
sequence of the form  g    f    g           such that
g          f         g          
with gj  g and fj  f appears in s  the   alternation depth a   s  is defined by exchanging
the roles of f and g  put a s     a   s    a   s   and call this the alternation depth  for a
finite set  of terms  a   is the maximum of all a s  with s   
thus  a   s  counts the maximal number of changes between symbols from the first and
the second ads  starting with the first symbol from s   i e   the first symbol from s 
counts as a change  even if it does not occur inside the scope of a symbol from s     the
  alternation depth is defined accordingly  the alternation depth sums up the    and the
  alternation depth 
lemma     if a term         then a c         a term    or a c         a term    
proof  we show that  if a term         then we have a sub        a term    or
a sub        a term     which  by definition of c i   clearly implies the lemma  first
note that  by definition of subi   we have
ai  subj      ai  term    for all i  j 

  

we now make a case distinction as follows 
   a   term     a   term     we want to show that a   sub        a   term    
since  by     this implies a sub        a term     assume to the contrary that
a   sub       a   term     then    implies a   sub        a   term     hence 
there exists a term s  sub     and a sequence  g    f    g            of function symbols
gi  g  fi  f of length a   term    such that g          f         g           occurs in s  by
definition of sub    this implies the existence of a term t  term   and a function
symbol f  f such that f        g          f         g            occurs in t  since the length of
 g    f    g            is a   term     this obviously yields a   term      a   term    which
is a contradiction 
   a   term     a   term     similar to the previous case  just exchange the roles of
a  and a    f and g  and sub  and sub

to prove theorem     we must show how theorem    can be used to construct a decision
procedure for satisfiability in s   s  from such decision procedures for the component
systems s  and s    let us first consider the problem of computing the sets   and    
if a  term         then  consists of boolean combinations of set variables  in this
case  c i    consists of set variables  and i   i         can be computed using boolean
reasoning  if a term         then lemma    states that there is an i         such
that a c i       a term     by induction we can thus assume that i can effectively be
computed  consequently  it remains to check condition  i      of theorem    for i         
since i is finite  we can guess for every object variable a occurring in  a type ta in i   the
sets   and   obtained this way are indeed sets of assertions of l  and l    respectively 
thus  their satisfiability can effectively be checked using the decision procedures for s  and
s    this proves theorem    
the argument used above also shows why in theorem    it was not sufficient to state
equivalence of     and      as in theorem      in fact  the induction argument used above
does not necessarily always apply to the computation of     in some cases  the alternation
depth may not decreases for     but only for     it should be noted that theorem    could
also have been formulated in this symmetric way  we have not done this since it was not
necessary for proving theorem    
regarding the complexity of the combined decision procedure  we must in principle also
consider the complexity of computing covering normal terms and the size of these terms 
in the examples from dl  these terms are just value restrictions  and thus their size and
the complexity of computing them is linear  here  we assume a polynomial bound on both 
under this assumption  we obtain the same complexity results as for the case of relativized
satisfiability  in fact  the complexity of testing condition     and     of theorem    agrees
with the complexity of testing condition     of theorem     it adds one exponential to the
complexity of the decision procedure for the single adss  in order to compute i   we need
exponentially many recursive calls to the procedure  since the recursion depth is linear in
the size of   we end up with at most exponentially many tests of condition     and     
corollary     let s  and s  be local adss having covering normal terms  and assume
that these covering normal terms can be computed in polynomial time  if the satisfiability
problems for s  and s  are decidable in exptime  pspace   then the satisfiability problem
for s   s  is decidable in  exptime  expspace  
with the same argument as in the case of relativized satisfiability  we can extend the
transfer result also to term satisfiability 
corollary     let s  and s  be local adss having covering normal terms  and suppose
that the term satisfiability problems for s  and s  are decidable  then the term satisfiability
problem for s   s  is also decidable 

   fusions of description logics
given two dls l  and l    their fusion is defined as follows  we translate them into the
corresponding adss s  and s    and then build the fusion s   s    the fusion l   l 
of l  and l  is the dl that corresponds to s   s    since the definition of the fusion of
adss requires their sets of function symbols to be disjoint  we must ensure that the adss
  

fibaader  lutz  sturm    wolter

corresponding to l  and l  are built over disjoint sets of function symbols  for the dls
introduced in section    this can be achieved by assuming that the sets of role names of l 
and l  are disjoint and the sets of nominals of l  and l  are disjoint  the dl l   l  then
allows the use of the concept and role constructors of both dls  but in a restricted way 
role descriptions are either role descriptions of l  or of l    there are no role descriptions
involving constructors or names of both dls  concept descriptions may contain concept
constructors of both dls  however  a constructor of li may only use a role description of
li  i         
let us illustrate these restrictions by two simple examples  the fusion alc    alc  
of the two dls alc   and alc   is the fragment of alc     whose set of role names is
partitioned into two sets nr  and nr  such that
 the transitive closure operator may only be applied to names from nr   
 the inverse operator may only be applied to names from nr   
for example  if a is a concept name  r  nr  and q  nr    then r   a u q   a is
a concept description of alc    alc     but r   a u r   a and  q      a are not 
note that  although the two source dls have disjoint sets of role names  in alc    alc  
role names from both sets may be used inside existential and value restrictions since these
concept constructors are available in both dls 
the fusion alcq  alc r  of the two dls alcq and alc r  is the fragment of
alcqr  whose set of role names nr  with transitive roles nr   nr   is partitioned into
two sets nr  and nr  with nr   nr  such that  inside qualifying number restrictions 
only role names from nr  may be used  in particular  this means that transitive roles
cannot occur within qualified number restrictions 
in the following  we give examples that illustrate the usefulness of the transfer results
proved in the previous section  first  we will give an example for the case of satisfiability and
then for relativized satisfiability  subsequently  we will consider a more complex example
involving so called concrete domains  here  our general transfer result can be used to prove
a decidability result that has only recently been proved by designing a specialized algorithm
for the fusion  finally  we will give an example that demonstrates that the restriction to
local adss is really necessary 
    decidability transfer for satisfiability
in this subsection  we will give an example for an application of theorem    where the
decidability result could not be obtained using theorem    
theorem    requires the adss to have covering normal terms  this is  however  satisfied
by all the dls that yield local adss 
proposition     let l be one of the dls introduced in section    and let the corresponding
ads s    l  m  be local  then s has covering normal terms  and these terms can be
computed in linear time 
proof  for all function symbols f in l  the term tf has the form fr  x  for some role
description r  the semantics of value restrictions implies that terms of this form satisfy

the first two properties of definition     this completes the proof for all function symbols
f of arity   since for these the third condition of definition    is trivially satisfied  thus 
for nullary function symbols  fr  x  for an arbitrary role name r does the job 
it remains to show that  for every unary function symbol f   fr   fr   fnr
  fnr
  


the term fr  x  also satisfies the third property  this is an immediate consequence of the

in the following  we consider the two description logics alcf and alc    t   hollunder
and nutt        show that satisfiability of alcf concept descriptions is decidable  the
same is true for consistency of alcf aboxes  lutz         note  however  that relativized
satisfiability of alcf concept descriptions and thus also relativized abox consistency in
alcf is undecidable  baader et al          for alc    t   decidability of satisfiability is
shown by baader        and schild          decidability of abox consistency in alc    t
is shown in chapter   of  de giacomo        
the unrestricted combination alcf    t of the two dls is undecidable  to be more precise  satisfiability of alcf    t  concept descriptions  and thus also consistency of alcf    t aboxes  is undecidable  this follows from the undecidability of relativized satisfiability of
alcf concept descriptions and the fact that the role operators in alcf    t can be used
to internalize tboxes  schild        baader et al          in contrast to the undecidability
of alcf    t   theorem    immediately implies that satisfiability of concept descriptions
in the fusion of alcf and alc    t is decidable 
theorem     satisfiability of concept descriptions and consistency of aboxes is decidable
in alcf  alc    t   whereas satisfiability of alcf    t  concept descriptions is already
undecidable 
taking the fusion thus yields a decidable combination of two dls whose unrestricted
combination is undecidable  the price one has to pay is that the fusion offers less expressivity than the unrestricted combination  the concept f  f  u f    c is an example of a
concept description of alcf    t that is not allowed in the fusion alcf  alc    t  
    decidability transfer for relativized satisfiability
as an example for the application of corollary     and thus of theorem      we consider the

an expressive fragment with a decidable relativized satisfiability problem can be obtained
by building the fusion of the two sublanguages alc    t
and alc    t u

theorem     satisfiability of alc    u t
 concept descriptions is undecidable 
f
undecidability can be shown by a reduction of the domino problem  berger       
knuth         see  e g   baader   sattler        for undecidability proofs of dls using such
a reduction   the main tasks to solve in such a reduction is that one can express the 
grid and that one can access all points on the grid  one square of the grid can be expressed

by a description of the form  xyuyx     where x  y are features  in fact  this description
expresses that the points belonging to it have both an x  y and a y  x successor  and
that these two successors coincide  accessing all point on the grid can then be achieved by
using the role description  x t y    
note that this undecidability result is also closely related to the known undecidability
of idpdl  i e   deterministic propositional dynamic logic with intersection  harel        
however  the undecidability proof for idpdl by harel        uses the test construct  which
is not available in alc    u t

next  we show that relativized satisfiability in two rather expressive sublanguages of
alc    u t
is decidable 
f
theorem     relativized satisfiability of concept descriptions is decidable in alc f   t and
alc    t u  
proof sketch  in both cases  tboxes can be internalized as described by schild       
and baader et al          thus  it is sufficient to show decidability of  unrelativized 
satisfiability 
  this follows from decidability of dpdl  ben ari  halpern    pnueli 
for alc    t
f
       the known correspondence between pdl and alc    t  schild         and the fact
that non functional roles can be simulated by functional ones in the presence of composition
and transitive closure  parikh        
for alc    t u   decidability of satisfiability follows from decidability of ipdl  i e   pdl
with intersection  danecki        

given this theorem  corollary    now yields the following decidability result 
corollary     relativized satisfiability of concept descriptions is decidable in the fusion
alc f   t  alc    t u  
    a concrete example
description logics with concrete domains were introduced by baader and hanschke       
in order to allow for the reference to concrete objects like numbers  time intervals  spatial
regions  etc  when defining concepts  to be more precise  baader and hanschke       
define the extension alc d  of alc  where d is a concrete domain  see below   under
suitable assumptions on d  they show that satisfiability in alc d  is decidable  one of the
main problems with this extension of dls is that relativized satisfiability  and satisfiability in dls where tboxes can be internalized  is usually undecidable  baader   hanschke 
       though there are exceptions  see lutz         for this reason  haarslev et al        
introduce a restricted way of extending dls by concrete domains  and show that the corresponding extension of alcn hr  has a decidable relativized satisfiability problem    in
the following  we show that this result can also be obtained as an easy consequence of
    to be more precise  they even show that relativized abox consistency is decidable in their restricted
extension of alcn hr  by concrete domains  here  we restrict ourself to satisfiability of concepts
since the aboxes introduced by haarslev et al         also allow for the use of concrete individuals and
for predicate assertions on these individuals  which is not covered by the object assertions for adss
introduced in the present paper

our theorem     moreover  alcn hr  can be replaced by an arbitrary local dl with a
decidable relativized satisfiability problem 
definition     concrete domain   a concrete domain d is a pair  d   d    where d
is a nonempty set called the domain  and d is a set of predicate names  each predicate
name p  d is associated with an arity n and an n ary predicate p d  nd   a concrete
domain d is called admissible iff     the set of its predicate names is closed under negation
and contains a name  d for d   and     the satisfiability problem for finite conjunctions
of predicates is decidable 
given a concrete domain d and one of the predicates p  d  of arity n   one can
define a new concept constructor f            fn  p  predicate restriction   where f            fn are

features are interpreted by partial functions from the abstract domain i into the concrete
domain d   we consider the basic dl that allows for boolean operators and these new
concept constructors only 
definition     b d    let nc be a set of concept names and nfc be a set of names for
concrete features disjoint from nc   and let d be an admissible concrete domain  concepts
descriptions of b d  are boolean combinations of concept names and predicate restrictions  i e   expressions of the form f            fn  p where p is an n ary predicate in d and
f            fn  nfc  
the semantics of b d  is defined as follows  we consider an interpretation i  which
has a nonempty domain i   and interprets concept names as subsets of i and concrete
features as partial functions from i into d   the boolean operators are interpreted as
usual  and
 f            fn  p  i    a  i   x            xn  d  
fii  a    xi for all    i  n and  x            xn    p d   
note that concept descriptions are interpreted as subsets of i and not of i  d  
thus  if we go to the ads corresponding to b d   the concrete domain is not an explicit
part of the corresponding adms  it is only used to define the interpretation of the function
symbols corresponding to predicate restrictions  the predicate restriction constructor is
translated into a function symbol ff       fn  p of arity    and  for an adm w corresponding
w
to a frame f  ff
is defined as  f            fn  p  i   where i is the interpretation based
       fn  p
on f that maps all concept names to the empty set 
theorem     let d be an admissible concrete domain  then  b d  is local and the
relativized satisfiability problem for b d  concept descriptions is decidable 
proof  given the family  wi  ii of adms wi corresponding to the frames fi over pairwise
disjoint
domains fi  i  i   we first build the union f of the frames  the domain of f is
s
f
i and it interprets the concrete features in the obvious way  i e   f f  x     f fi  x  if
ii 
    note that the general framework introduced by baader and hanschke        allows for feature chains in
predicate restrictions  considering only feature chains of length one is the main restriction introduced
by haarslev et al

x  fi   let w be the adm induced by f  tosprove that w is in fact the disjoint union of
wi

 wi  ii   it remains to show that ff
  ii ff
  this is an easy consequence
       fn  p
       fn  p
of the semantics of the predicate restriction constructor  the interpretation of the concrete
features in f  and the fact that the domains fi are pairwise disjoint 
decidability of the unrelativized satisfiability problem is an immediate consequence of
the decidability results for alc d  given by baader and hanschke         since b d  is a
very simple dl that does not contain any concept constructors requiring the generation of
abstract individuals  it is easy to see that a b d  concept description c  is satisfiable relative
to the tbox c  v d            cn v dn iff it is satisfiable in a one element interpretation  but
then the tbox can be internalized in a very simple way  c  is satisfiable relative to the
tbox c  v d            cn v dn iff c  u  c  t d    u       u  cn t dn   is satisfiable 

given this theorem  corollary    now yields the following transfer result  which shows
that concrete domains with the restricted form of predicate restrictions introduced above can
be integrated into any local dl with a decidable relativized satisfiability problem without
losing decidability 
corollary     let d be an admissible concrete domain and l be a local dl for which
relativized satisfiability of concept descriptions is decidable  then  relativized satisfiability
of concept descriptions in b d   l is also decidable 
    non local dls
by proposition     dls allowing for nominals  the universal role  or role negation are not
local  it follows that the decidability transfer theorems are not applicable to fusions of such
dls  in the following  we try to clarify the reasons for this restricted applicability of the
theorems 
first  we show that there are dls with decidable satisfiability problem such that their
fusion has an undecidable satisfiability problem  the culprit in this case is the universal
role  or role negation  
theorem     satisfiability of concept descriptions is decidable in alc u and alcf  but
undecidable in their fusion alc u  alcf 
proof  decidability of alcf was shown by hollunder and nutt        and of alc u by
baader et al         and goranko and passy         undecidability of alc u  alcf
 which is identical to alcf u   follows from the results by baader et al         and the fact
that the universal role can be used to simulate tboxes  see proposition     

note that role negation can be used to simulate the universal role  just replace u c
by r c u r c and u c by r c t r c  in addition  decidability of alc  is known
to be decidable  lutz   sattler         consequently  the theorem also holds if we replace
alc u by alc   
it should be noted that the example given in the above theorem depends on the fact
that one of the two dls allows for the universal role and the other becomes undecidable
if the universal role is added  in fact  corollary    shows that decidability does transfer if
both dls already provide for the universal role 
  

fifusions of description logics and abstract description systems

concerning nominals  we do not have a counterexample to the transfer of decidability
in their presence  however  we think that it is very unlikely that there can be a general
transfer result in this case  in fact  note that for each dl l without nominals introduced in
section    its fusion with alco is identical to l extended with nominals  since  relativized 
satisfiability in alco is decidable  a general transfer result in this case would imply that
this extension is decidable provided that l is decidable  consequently  this would yield a
general transfer result for adding nominals 

   conclusion
regarding related work  the work that is most closely related to the one presented here is
 wolter         there  analogs of our theorems    and    are proved for normal modal
logics within an algebraic framework  the present results extend the ones from wolter
       in two directions  first  we have added object assertions  and thus can also prove
transfer results for abox reasoning  second  we can show transfer results for satisfiability in
non normal modal logics as long as we have covering normal terms  this allows us to handle
non normal concept constructors like qualified number restrictions  graded modalities  in
our framework 
we also think that the introduction of abstract description systems  adss  is a contribution in its own right  adss abstract from the internal structure of concept constructors
and thus allow us to treat a vast range of such constructors in a uniform way  nevertheless  the model theoretic semantics provided by adss is less abstract than the algebraic
semantics employed by wolter         it is closer to the usual semantics of dls  and thus
easier to comprehend for people used to this semantics  the results in this paper show
that adss in fact yield a good level of abstraction for proving general results on description logics  recently  the same notion has been used for proving general results about
so called e connections of representation formalisms like description logics  modal spatial
logics  and temporal logics  kutz  wolter    zakharyaschev         in contrast to fusions 
in an e connection the two domains are not merged but connected by means of relations 
regarding complexity  our transfer results yield only upper bounds  basically  they
show that the complexity of the algorithm for the fusion is at most one exponent higher
than of the ones for the components  we believe that the complexity of satisfiability in the
fusion of adss can indeed be exponentially higher than the complexity of satisfiability in
the component adss  however  we do not yet have matching lower bounds  i e   we know
of no example where this exponential increase in the complexity really happens 
note that spaans results        on the transfer of np and pspace decidability from
the component modal logics to their fusion are restricted to normal modal logics  and that
they make additional assumptions on the algorithms used to solve the satisfiability problem
in the component logics  nevertheless  for many pspace complete description logics it is
easy to see that their fusion is also pspace complete  in this sense  the general techniques
for reasoning in the fusion of descriptions logics developed in this paper give only a rough
complexity estimate

appendix a  proofs
in this appendix  we give detailed proofs of criteria for  relativized  satisfiability in the
fusion of local adss  recall that  from these criteria  the transfer theorems for decidability
easily follow  we have deferred the proofs of these theorems to the appendix since they are
rather technical 
a   proof of theorem   
before we can prove this theorem  we need a technical lemma  in the proof of theorem    
we are going to merge models w   m  and w   m  by means of a bijective function b
from the domain w  of w  onto the domain w  of w  in such a way that the surrogates
suri  t   t  c       are respected by b in the sense that
 

w  sur   t w   a  b w   sur   t w   a

 

for all w  w  and t  c       the existence of such a bijection is equivalent to the condi 
 
 
 
tion that the cardinalities  sur   t w   a   of sur   t w   a and  sur   t w   a   of sur   t w   a
coincide for all t  c       if t    t  for t  t   c       then t contains a conjunct which is
i
 equivalent to  the negation of a conjunct of t    hence  for all such t  t    we have suri  t wi  a 
i
suri  t   wi  a    for i          which clearly yields the above equivalence  the following
lemma will be used to choose models in such a way that this cardinality condition is satisfied 
 we refer the reader to  e g   gratzer       for information about cardinals  
lemma     let  l  m  be a local ads and  a set of assertions satisfiable in  l  m  
then there
exists aff cardinal  such that  for all cardinals      there exists a model


w   w  f w   rw  m with  w       and an assignment a with hw  ai     and
 sw a            for all terms s 


ff
proof  by assumption  there exists an adm w    w    f w    rw   m and an assignment b   hb    b  i in it such that hw    bi      let    max      w      we
show that
let      take   disjoint isomorphic copies hw   b  i

          ffof hw    b  i   the first member of the list coincides
with w     let w   w  f w   rw be the disjoint union of the w          and define
hw  a   ha    a  ii by putting a   a    b   a   for all a  x   and
  
a   x   
b   x  
  

for all x  v   note that all object variables are interpreted in w    it follows from the
definitions of term semantics and disjoint unions that
 
sw a  
sw  b  
  
  

for all terms s  hence  w       and hw  ai      it remains to show that  sw a           
for every term s  suppose  sw a    
     then  by         sw a              which means

as noted above  the disjointness of the sets suri  t wi  a and suri  t   wi  a  for t    t   
is required in order to ensure the existence of the bijection b  more precisely  in order to
i
merge models w    w    the sets suri  t wi  a for t member of some relevant subset of c     
must form a partition of wi s domain that satisfies a certain cardinality condition  this is
formalized by the following definition 
definition     let  be a cardinal  a set  x            xn   is called a  partition of a set w
iff
    xi       for all    i  n 
   xi  xj    whenever i    j  and
s
   w    in xi  
 x            xn   is a  partition of an adm w with domain w iff it is a  partition of w  
in the proof  we will enforce that properties   and   hold by appropriate constructions 
while property   holds by definition of c      
before proving theorem     we repeat its formulation 
theorem     let si    li   mi    i          be two local adss in which l  is based on
the set of function symbols f and relation symbols r  and l  is based on g and q  and

a   a    to prove the implication from     to     of the theorem it remains to show that
hw  ai      to this end it suffices to prove the following claim 
claim  for all terms t  sub      we have
 

 

tw a   sur   t w   a   b   sur   t w   a   
before we prove this claim  let us show that it implies hw  ai      first note that  from
the claim  we obtain
 
tw a   sur   t w   a for all t  term   
   
this may be proved by induction on the construction of t  term   from terms in sub    
using the booleans and function symbols from l    only  the basis of induction  i e   the
equality for members of sub      is stated in the claim and the induction step is straightforward 
we now show that hw  ai     is a consequence of      suppose r a  b     then
r a  b     and thus hw  ai    r a  b   similarly  q a  b    implies q a  b     and
 
hw  ai    q a  b   suppose  a   t     then  a   sur   t      and so a    a   sur   t w   a

sur   t    v sur   t       and so  by      tw a
 tw a
  hence hw  ai    t  v t   
 
 
we come to the proof of the claim  it is proved by induction on the structure of t 
due to the following equalities holding for all t  sub      it suffices to show that tw a  
 
sur   t w   a  
sur   t w   a

 

 

 

 

 sur   s w   a   s  d  t is a conjunct of s

the first equality holds since sur    d w   a   w  and  for all s  d  either t or t
is a conjunct of s  the second equality is true by definition of b and the validity of the
thirdwequality can be seen analogously to the validity of the first one by considering that
 
sur    d w   a   w   
 

hence let us show tw a   sur   t w   a   for the induction start  let t be a variable  the

the set of models m is closed under disjoint unions  hence  there exists a model w

we repeat the formulation of the theorem to be proved 
theorem     let si    li   mi    i          be two local adss having covering normal
terms in which l  is based on the set of function symbols f and relation symbols r  and
l  is based on g and q  and let l   l   l  and m   m   m    let  be a finite set
of object assertions from l  put m    df     r    dg     and let c x   d x   be a covering
normal term for all function symbols in  that are in f  g  
for i          denote by i the set of all s  c i    such that the term s is satisfiable in
 l  m   then the following three conditions are equivalent 
    is satisfiable in  l  m  
   there exist
 for every t    an object variable at   obj  
 for every a  obj   a term ta   
such that the union   of the following sets of object assertions is satisfiable in
 l    m

   the same condition as in     above  with   replaced by    
we start the proof with the direction from     to     and     to      the proofs are

we prove that the set   of assertions based on ta   a  obj    and as   s      is satisfiable
in  l    m     the proof is rather similar to the proof of the direction from     to     in the
proof of theorem      let f w  resp  g w   denote the restriction of  f  g w to the symbols

we concentrate on the first  in the proof of theorem    it was possible to construct the

pieces of the models and have to add new pieces as well  to define those pieces we need a

satisfying the properties listed in claim    we may assume that
 w   xm     w   yr      
using an appropriate bijection b from xm onto yr we may also assume that xm   yr  
a   a    b   a  for all object variables a  obj      and
sur   s w   a  xm   sur   s w   b  xm for all s     

   

this follows from the fact that all object variables are mapped by a  and b  into xm and
yr   a     b     respectively  the injectivity of the mappings a  and b    and the conditions
 a   and  b   which state that  sur   s w   a  xm   s      and  sur   s w   b  yr   s     
both form  partitions of xm   yr   some abbreviations are useful  set

so far we have merged the xm  part of w  with the yr  part of w    it remains to take care
of the sets ai      i   m  and bi      i   r  the sets ai will be merged with new
models wi  m  and the sets bi will be merged with new models vi from m    thus 
the final model will be obtained by merging the disjoint union of w  and wi      i   m

of course  when merging ai   i     with a new model wi we have to respect the partition

proof of claim    by  c   it suffices to prove the first equation  the proof is by induction
on the cardinal k    k    the induction base k    k      follows from sur   s    sur   s  for
df  s    dg  s      
suppose the claim is proved for all xk   yk  with k  m  k    r and k   k     k    k    we
prove the claim for xk    yk    the proof is by induction on the construction of terms s with
df  s   k  and dg  s   k    the boolean cases are trivial 
suppose s   f  s            sl   with df  s   k  and dg  s   k    we have to show the
following two statements 
 i  xk   sw c   xk   sur   s m c  
 ii  yk   sw c   yk   sur   s m c  
consider  i  first  the induction hypothesis yields
xk     sw c
  xk     sur   si  w c

for    i  l  we have

  xk     cw  xk       sur   s w c  
the second equation is an immediate consequence of the third property of covering normal
terms as given in definition     now the equation follows from  c    i e  xk   xk    
cw  xk        i  is proved 
 ii  suppose first that k    r  then yk    xm and the claim can be proved as above
since xm  xk  and  by induction hypothesis  xk     sw c

assume now that k    r  by induction hypothesis

we intersect both sides of the equation with yk  and derive with the help of  c

this means yk   sw c   yk   sur   s w c   and the equation follows  the statements are
