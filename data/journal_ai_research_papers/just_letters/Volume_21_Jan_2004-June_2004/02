many distributed systems multi agent interactions  interested parties cannot control
rules interactions  network manager example cannot simply change communication protocols given distributed systems order lead desired behaviors

work introduce study implementation desired behaviors interested
party above   two major issues make task non trivial challenging 
   interested party may wish assume little possible agents rationality 
ideally  assumed agent adopt strategy dominated
another strategy 
   interested party may wish minimize expenses 
consider following simple congestion setting   assume two agents 
     select among two service providers  e g   machines  communication

capture agent obtaining payo   one

payo  is  agents use f one obtains payo   
agents use one obtains    matrix form  game described
