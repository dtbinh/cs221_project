abstract
the predominant knowledge based approach to automated model construction  compositional
modelling  employs a set of models of particular functional components  its inference mechanism
takes a scenario describing the constituent interacting components of a system and translates it into
a useful mathematical model  this paper presents a novel compositional modelling approach aimed
at building model repositories  it furthers the field in two respects  firstly  it expands the application domain of compositional modelling to systems that can not be easily described in terms of
interacting functional components  such as ecological systems  secondly  it enables the incorporation of user preferences into the model selection process  these features are achieved by casting the
compositional modelling problem as an activity based dynamic preference constraint satisfaction
problem  where the dynamic constraints describe the restrictions imposed over the composition of
partial models and the preferences correspond to those of the user of the automated modeller  in
addition  the preference levels are represented through the use of symbolic values that differ in
orders of magnitude 

   introduction
mathematical models form an important aid in understanding complex systems  they also help
problem solvers to capture and reason about the essential features and dynamics of such systems 
constructing mathematical models is not an easy task  however  and many disciplines have contributed approaches to automate it  compositional modelling  falkenhainer   forbus        keppens   shen      b  is an important class of approaches to automated model construction  it uses
predominantly knowledge based techniques to translate a high level scenario into a mathematical
model  the knowledge base usually consists of generic fragments of models that provide one of
the possible mathematical representation of a process that occurs in one or more components  the
inference mechanisms instantiate this knowledge base  search for the most appropriate selection of
model fragments  and compose them into a mathematical model  compositional modelling has been
successfully applied to a variety of application domains ranging from simple physics  over various
engineering problems to biological systems 
the present work aims at a compositional modelling approach for building model repositories
of ecological systems  in the ecological modelling literature  a range of models have been devised
to formally characterise the various phenomena that occur in ecological systems  for example 
the logistic growth  verhulst        and the holling predation  holling        models describe the
changes in the size of a population  the former expresses changes due to births and deaths and the
latter changes due to one population feeding on another  a compositional model repository aims

to make such  partial  models more generally usable by providing a mechanism to instantiate and
compose them into larger models for more complex systems involving many interacting phenomena 
thus  the input to a compositional model repository is a scenario describing the configuration
of a system to be modelled  a sample scenario may include a number of populations and various
predation and competition relations between them  the output is a mathematical model  called a
scenario model  representing the behaviour of the system specified in the given scenario  a set of
differential equations describing the changes in the population sizes in the aforementioned scenario
due to births  natural deaths  deaths because of predation  available food supply or competition
would constitute such a scenario model 
this application domain poses three important new challenges to compositional modelling 
firstly  the processes and components of an ecological system that are to be represented in the
resulting composed model depend on one another and on the ways they are described  in population dynamics for example  models describing the predation or competition phenomena between
two populations rely on the existence of a population growth model for each of the populations
involved in the phenomenon  this inhibits the conventional approach of searching for a consistent and adequate combination of partial models  one for each component in the scenario  this
approach provides an adequate solution for physical systems because these are comprised of components implementing a particular functionality that can be described by one or multiple partial
models  although the seminal work on compositional modelling  falkenhainer   forbus       
recognised the existence of more complex interdependencies in model construction in general  it
provided only a partial solution for it  all the conditions under which certain modelling choices
were relevant had to be specified manually in the knowledge base 
secondly  the domain of ecology lacks a complete theory of what constitutes an adequate model 
most existing compositional modellers are based on a predefined concept of model adequacy  they
employ inference mechanisms that are guaranteed to find a model that meets such adequacy criteria 
however  criteria to determine how adequate an ecological model may be vary between ecological
domains and even between the ecologists that require the model within the same domain  therefore 
the compositional modeller requires a facility to define the properties that the generated ecological
models must satisfy 
thirdly  it is not possible to express all the criteria imposed on the scenario model in terms of
hard requirements  often  ecological models that describe mechanisms and behaviours are only partially understood  in such cases  the choice of one model over another becomes a matter of expert
opinion rather than pure theory  therefore  in the ecological domain  modelling approaches and presumptions are  to some extent  selected based on preferences  existing compositional modellers are
not equipped to deal with such user preferences and this paper presents the very first compositional
modeller that incorporates them 
generally speaking  the above three issues are tackled in this paper by means of a method to
translate the compositional modelling problem into an activity based dynamic preference constraint
satisfaction problem  adpcsp   keppens   shen         an adpcsp integrates the concept of
activity based dynamic constraint satisfaction problem  adcsp   miguel   shen        mittal  
falkenhainer        with that of order of magnitude preferences  keppens   shen         the
attributes and domains of this adpcsp correspond to model design decisions  with constraints describing the restrictions imposed by consistency requirements and properties and order of magnitude
preferences describing the users preferences on modelling choices  the translation method brings
the additional advantage that compositional modelling problems can now be solved by means of

efficient adcsp techniques  as such  compositional modellers can benefit from recent and future
advances in constraint satisfaction research 
the remainder of this paper is organised as follows  section   introduces the concept of an
adpcsp  a preference calculus that is suitable to express subjective user preferences for model
design decisions and to be integrated with the general framework of adpcsps  it also gives a
solution algorithm for adpcsps  next  section   presents the compositional model repository and
shows how such an adpcsp is employed for automated model construction  these theoretical
ideas are then illustrated by means of a large example in section    applying the compositional
model repository to population dynamics problems  section   concludes this paper with a summary
and an outline of further research 

   dynamic constraint satisfaction with order of magnitude preferences
in this section  a preference calculus based on order of magnitude reasoning is introduced and integrated into the activity based dynamic constraint satisfaction problem  adcsp  to form an adcsp
with order of magnitude preferences  adpcsp   then  a solution algorithm for such adpcsps is
presented  the theory is illustrated with examples from the compositional modelling domain 
    background  activity based dynamic preference constraint satisfaction
a hard constraint satisfaction problem  csp  is a tuple hx  d  ci  where
 x    x            xn   is a vector of n attributes 
 d    dx            dxn   is a vector containing exactly one domain for each attribute in x 
each domain dx  d is a set of values  di            dini   that may be assigned to the attribute
corresponding to the domain 
 c is a set of compatibility constraints  a compatibility constraint c  xi      xj    c defines a
relation over a subset of the domains dxi        dxj   and hence c xi      xj    dxi         dxj  
a solution to a hard constraint satisfaction problem is any tuple hx     dx            xn   dxn i such
that
 each attribute is assigned a value from its domain  xi  x  dxi  dxi   and
 all compatibility constraints are satisfied  x xi      xj    c  hdxi           dxj i  c xi      xj    
an activity based dynamic csp  adcsp   originally proposed in by mittal and falkenhainer
        extends conventional csps with the notion of activity of attributes  in an adcsp  not all
attributes are necessarily assigned in a solution  but only the active ones  as such  each attribute is
either active and assigned a value or inactive 

xi  x  dxi  dxi   xi   dxi  active xi  

the activity of attributes in an adcsp is governed by activity constraints that enforce under which
assignments of attributes  an assignment to another attribute is relevant or possible  this information
is important because it not only dictates for which attributes a value must be searched  but also the
set of compatibility constraints that must be satisfied  clearly  only the compatibility constraints
   

fik eppens   s hen

c xi      xj    c for which all attributes xi           xj are active must be satisfied  and a hard csp is a
sub type of adcsp in which all attributes are always active 
in summary  an activity based dynamic constraint satisfaction problem  adcsp  is a tuple
hx  d  c  ai  where
 hx  d  ci is a hard csp  and
 a is a set of activity constraints  an activity constraint restricts the sets of attribute value
assignments under which an attribute is active or inactive 
axi   xj      xk    dxj         dxk   active xi    active xi   
where xi    xj           xk   
a solution to an activity based dynamic constraint satisfaction problem is any tuple hx    
dx            xl   dxl i such that
 the attributes that are part of the solution are assigned a value from their domain  x i 
 x            xl    dxi  dxi  
 all activity constraints are satisfied 

and



axi   xj      xk    a  xj    x            xl           xk    x            xl   

xi   x            xl    hdxj           dxk   active xi  i  axi   xj      xk   

xi    x            xl    hdxj           dxk   active xi  i  axi   xj      xk  

 all compatibility constraints are satisfied 
c xi      xj    c  active xi           active xj    hdxi           dxj i  c xi      xj  
    order of magnitude preferences  omps 
although an adcsp can capture the hard constraints over decisions in a given problem as well as
their dynamically changing solution space  as described by the activity constraints   the representation scheme it employs does not take into account any preferences users may have over possible
alternative value assignments  therefore  this work is extended to allow preference information to
be attached to attribute value assignments  the way in which this can be achieved depends on the
representation and reasoning mechanisms underlying the preference calculus  in general  a preference calculus can be defined as a tuple h      i where 


is the set of preferences 

  is a commutative  associative operator that is closed in   and
   forms a partial order  that is  reflexive  anti symmetric and transitive relation defined over
  
because   is reflexive  antisymmetric and transitive  comparing preferences with the   relation
yields one of four possible results 
   

fic ompositional m odel r epositories

 two preferences p    p  
p    p    

are equal to one another  denoted p    p    iff p    p  and

 a preference p  
is strictly greater than a preference p  
p     p  and p    p   

 denoted p   p    iff

 a preference p  
is strictly smaller than a preference p  
p    p  and p     p   

 denoted p   p    iff

 two preferences p    p  
and p     p   

are incomparable with one another  denoted p   p    iff p     p 

thus  an activity based dynamic preference constraint satisfaction problem  adpcsp  is a tuple
hx  d  c  a  h      i  p i where
 hx  d  c  ai is an adcsp 
 h      i is a preference calculus  and
 p is a mapping dx          dxn  
preferences 

from the individual attribute value assignments to the

the preferences attached to attribute value assignments express the relative desirability of these
assignments  the aim of the adpcsp is to find a solution with the highest combined preference 
that is  given an adpcsp hx  d  c  a  h      i  p i  any solution hxi   dxi           xj   dxj i of the
adcsp hx  d  c  ai such that no other solution hxk   dxk           xl   dxl i of hx  d  c  ai exists
with p  xi   dxi           p  xj   dxj    p  xk   dxk           p  xl   dxl   is a solution to the adpcsp 
in this section  a preference calculus is introduced to extend an adcsp into an adpcsp  the
calculus will be illustrated with examples from the compositional modelling domain

of

omp s

technically  omps are combinations of so called basic preference quantities  bpqs   which are the
primitive units of preference or utility valuation associated with possible design decisions  because
it is often difficult to evaluate these bpqs numerically  they are ordered relative to one another employing similar ordering relations as those employed by relative order of magnitude calculi  dague 
    a      b  
let be the set of all bpqs with respect to a particular decision problem  the bpqs in are
ordered with respect to one another at two levels of granularity  by two relations  and    first 
is partitioned into orders of magnitude  which are ordered by   then  the bpqs within each order
of magnitude are ordered by    formally  an order of magnitude ordering over bpqs is a tuple
ho  i  where o    o            oq   is a partition of and  is an irreflexive and transitive binary
relation over o  any subset of bpqs o  o is said to be an order of magnitude in   similarly  a
within magnitude ordering over a set of bpqs is a tuple ho   i  where o is an order of magnitude
in and   is an irreflexive and transitive binary relation over o 
to illustrate these ideas  consider the problem of constructing an ecological model describing a
scenario containing a number of populations  let some of the populations be parasites and others
be hosts for these parasites  also  assume that certain populations compete with others for scarce
resources  in order to construct a scenario model  the compositional modeller must make a number

the sake of illustration  the presumption is made that the quality of a scenario model depends on the
inclusion of types of model  rather than on the inclusion or exclusion of phenomena  apart from
b   and b     all bpqs correspond to standard textbook ecological models     bpq b   stands for the

omp s

by definition  omps are combinations of bpqs  the implicit value of an omp p equals the combination b          bn of its constituent bpqs b            bn   this property allows omps to be defined
as functions such that an omp p   b          bn is a function fp       b  fp  b  where
   to be precise  the bpqs b     b     b     b     b     b   and b   respectively correspond to the inclusion of rogers

is the set of bpqs  is the set of natural numbers and fp  b  equals the number of occurrences of b
in b            bn  
for example  let pmodel denote the omp associated with the scenario model that contains three
logistic population growth models  b      two holling predation model  b     and one competition

by describing omps as functions  the concept of combinations of omps becomes clear  for
two omps p  and p    the combined preference p   p  is defined as 
fp  p   

 

  b  fp  p   b    fp   b    fp   b 

note that the combination operator  is assumed to be commutative  associative and strictly monotonic  p  p  p    the latter assumption is made to better reflect the ideas underpinning conventional utility calculi  binger   hoffman        
      partial ordering of omp s
based on the combinations of omps  a partial order   over the omps can be computed by exploiting the constituent bpqs of the omps considered  this partial order implies that a comparison of
any pair of omps either returns equal preference      smaller preference     greater preference
   or incomparable preference      this calculus is developed assuming the following 
 prioritisation  a combination of bpqs is never an order of magnitude greater than its constituent bpqs  that is  given the set of bpqs belonging to the same order of magnitude
 b    b            bn    o  and a bpq b  o  belonging to a higher order of magnitude  i e 
o   o    then
b   b          bn  b
with respect to the ongoing example  this means that any bpq taken from the order of magnitude o  is preferred over any combination of bpqs taken from o    in other words  the choice
of a model to describe a host parasitoid phenomenon is considered more important than the
choice of population growth model  see figure    
prioritisation also means that distinctions at higher orders of magnitude are considered to
be more significant than those at lower orders of magnitude  consider a number of bpqs
b            bm    bm           bn taken from one order of magnitude o  and a pair of bpqs  b  b   
taken from an order of magnitude that is higher than o    if b   b    then  irrespective of the
ordering of the bpqs taken from o   
b          bm   b  bm         bn  b

 strict monotonicity  even though distinctions at higher orders of magnitude are more significant  distinctions at lower orders of magnitude are not negligible  that is  given an omp
p and two bpqs b  and b  taken from the same order of magnitude with b    b    then
 irrespective of the orders of magnitude of the bpqs that constitute p  
b   p  b   p
for instance  the preference ordering depicted in figure   shows that a scenario model with a
rogers host parasitoid model and two logistic predation models is preferred over one with a
rogers host parasitoid model and two exponential predation models 
b    b    b    b    b    b  
note that this is a departure from conventional order of magnitude reasoning  if the omps
associated with two  partial  outcomes contain equal bpqs at a higher order of magnitude  it is
usually desirable to compare both solutions further in terms of the  less important  constituent
bpqs at lower orders of magnitude  as the example illustrated  however  conventional orderof magnitude reasoning techniques can not handle this 
 partial ordering maintenance  conventional order of magnitude reasoning is motivated by
the need for abstract descriptions of real world behaviour  whereas the omp calculus is motivated by incomplete knowledge for decision making  as opposed to conventional orderof magnitude reasoning and real numbers  omps are not necessarily totally ordered  this
implies that  when the user states  for example  that b    b    b and that b    b    b  the
explicit absence of ordering information between the bpqs in  b     b    and those in  b    b   
means that the user is unable to compare them  e g  because they are entirely different things  
consequently  b   b  would be deemed incomparable to b   b   i e  b   b   b   b     rather
than roughly equivalent 
from the above  it can be derived that given two omps p  and p  and an order of magnitude o 
p  is less or equally preferred to p  with respect to the order of magnitude o  denoted p   o p   
provided that
bi  o  fp   bi

bj o bi  bj


fp   bj    fp   bi

thus  comparing two omps within an order of magnitude can yield four possible results 
 p  is less preferred than p  with respect to o  p  o p    iff  p   o p      p    p    
 p  is more preferred than p  with respect to o  p  o p    iff  p   o p      p    p    
 p  is equally preferred than p  with respect to o  p   o p    iff  p   o p      p    p    
and
 p  is incomparable to p  with respect to o  p   o p    iff  p   o p      p    p

in the ongoing example of figure    for instance  the preference of a scenario model with a
rogers host parasitoid model and a holling predation model is p     b    b   and the preference
of a scenario model with a rogers host parasitoid model and a lotka volterra predation model
is p    b    b     the latter model is less than or equally preferred to the former within the
host parasitoid order of magnitude  o     i e  p   o  p    because
fp   b              fp   b     
fp   b      fp   b              fp   b      fp   b

similarly  it can be established that the reverse  i e  p   o  p    is not true  therefore  the latter
scenario model is less preferred than the former within o    i e  p  o  p   
the above result can be further generalised such that given two omps p   and p    p  is less or
equally preferred to p   denoted p    p    if
oi  o   p   oi p      oj  o  oi  oj  p  oj p   
more generally  the relations       and   can be derived in the same manner as with the
relation   where o   o    o and  o with  o  
to illustrate the utility of such orderings  consider the scenario of one predator population that
feeds on two prey populations while the two prey populations compete for scarce resources  the
following are two plausible scenario models for this scenario 
 model   contains two holling predation models and three logistic population growth models 
and has preference p    b    b    b    b    b    
 model   contains one competition model  two holling predation models  two logistic population growth models and an exponential population growth model  and has preference
p    b    b    b    b    b    b    
as demonstrated earlier  it can be shown that p   o  p    p  o  p    and p  o  p    from these
relations it follows that p    p  because
 for o    p   o  p  since p   o  p   
 for o    there exists an order of magnitude o  where o   o  and p  o  p   
 for o    p   o  p  since p  o  p   
as the reverse is not true  it can be concluded that scenario model   is preferred over scenario model
  
    solving adpcsps
this section presents a basic algorithm for solving adpcsps  although omps are used in this
work  this algorithm can take any adpcsp provided that it employs a preference calculus with a
   

fik eppens   s hen

commutative  associative and monotonic combination operator  however  the use of omps provides
a convenient way of specifying incomplete preference information 
an adpcsp is similar to valued csps as presented by schiex  fargier and verfaillie       
and also to semiring based csps  bistarelli  montanari    rossi         however  it extends both
approaches with activity constraints and involves different underlying presumptions in its valuation
structure  the preference valuations in this work are allowed to be ordered partially  as opposed to
the valued csps 
an adpcsp represents an important type of constraint satisfaction optimisation problem  tsang 
       in order to tackle the optimisation of preferences an a  type algorithm is employed  hart 
nilsson    raphael        raphael         a  algorithms are known to be efficient in terms of
the total number of nodes explored in an effort to find optimal solutions  with a given amount of
information  on the downside  they have an exponential space complexity  naturally  a number of
alternative approaches could have been explored  including conventional constraint based solving
methods such as depth first branch and bound search  however  the use of an a  like algorithm is
sufficient for solving the adpcsps in the domain of the present interest  in particular  algorithm  
implements an a  search strategy that is capable of handling activity constraints  which involves
the use of basic csp techniques such as constraint propagation and backtracking 
an a  algorithm maintains the explored attribute value assignments by means of a priority
queue q of nodes  each node n in q corresponds to a set of attribute value assignments  solution n  
the search proceeds through a number of iterations  at each iteration  a node n is taken from q 
and replaced by nodes that extend solution n  with an additional attribute value assignment  more
specifically  for each node n in q  a set xu  n  of remaining active but unassigned attributes is
maintained  at each iteration  the possible assignments of the first attribute x  x u  n   where
n is the node taken from q at the current iteration  are processed  for every assignment x   d
that is consistent with solution n   i e  solution n    x   d   c      a new child node n     with
solution n      solution n    x   d  and xu  n      xu  n    x   is created and added to q 
the activity constraints are processed via propagation rather than constraint satisfaction  whenever a node n is taken from q such that xu  n  is empty  the activity constraints are fired in order to
obtain a new set of active but unassigned attributes  that is  x u  n  is assigned
 xi   solution n   a   active xi     xa  n 
where xa  n  represents the active  but already assigned attributes in node n 
in the priority queue q  nodes are maintained by means of two heuristics  committed preference
cp  n  and potential preference p p  n   here  given a node n

where xnd  n  is the set of unassigned attributes that can still be activated given the partial assignment solution n   as indicated previously  the actual implementation employs an assumption based

longer be supported   in other words  cp  n  is the preference associated with the partial attributevalue assignment in node n and p p  n  is cp  n  combined with the highest possible preference

computes an upper boundary on the preference of an adpcsp solution that includes the partial
attribute value assignments corresponding to n 
the following theorem shows that algorithm   is guaranteed to find the set of attribute value
pairs with the highest combined preferences  within the set of solutions that satisfy the constraints 
theorem   solve x  d  c  a  p   is admissible
proof  solve x  d  c  a  p   is an a  algorithm guided by a heuristic function p p  n    cp  n 
h n   where cp  n  is the actual preference of node n and h n     xxnd  n  maxddx p  x   d  
it follows from the previous discussion that h n  is greater than or equal to the combined preference
of any value assignment of unassigned attributes that is consistent with the partial solution of n  in
this algorithm  the nodes n are maintained in a priority queue in descending order of p p  n   let 
be a distance function that reverses the preference ordering such that  p       p     p   p   
solve  x  d  c  a  p   can then be described as an a  algorithm  where the nodes n in the priority

queue q are ordered in ascending order of  p p  n    such that  p p  n      cp  n     h n  
and  h n   is a lower bound on the distance between n and the optimal solution  therefore  following the work by hart  nilsson and raphael         solve x  d  c  a  p   is an admissible
algorithm  guaranteed to find a solution s with a minimal  p  s   or a maximal p  s  
to illustrate algorithm    consider the problem of finding an ecological model that describes the
behaviour of two populations  one of which predates on the other  an adpcsp is constructed for
the compositional modelling problem with the following attributes and domains  note that section
  demonstrates how the attributes  domains and constraints of this problem can be constructed
automatically and that section   illustrates these ideas in the context of a larger example

the attributes x    x  and x  respectvely describe the relevance of the following phenomena 
the change in size of the predator population  the change in size of the prey population and the
predation of the prey by the predator  the attributes x  and x  represent the choice of type of
population growth model  two types of such models are incorporated in the problem  the logistic
one and the other  finally  attribute x  is associated with the choice of model type of the predation
phenomenon  here  two types of model  the holling model and the lotka volterra model  are
included 
because the holling predation model presumes that logistic models are employed to describe
population growth  and because the lotka volterra model incorporates its own population growth
model  the combinations of assignments to x    x    and x  are restricted  hence  the adpcsp
contains a set c    c x   x      c x   x      of compatibility constraints  with

furthermore  a model type of predator prey growth must be selected if and only if the corresponding population growth phenomenon is deemed relevant  also  a model type of predation must be selected if and only if both population growth phenomena and the predation phenomenon are deemed relevant  because ecological models describing predation rely on submodels
describing population growth of the predator and the prey   hence  the adpcsp contains a set

when applied to this problem  algorithm   initialises the search by creating a node n     where 
 xu  n     the set of currently active attributes  is initialised to  x    x    x     because the activity
of these attributes does not depend on other attribute value assignments 
 xa  n    and cp  n    are initialised to the empty set and to   respectively  since no attributes
have been assigned yet 
 finally  p p  n    equals pother  pother  pholling because this is the combination of highest
omps associated with each domain 
this initial node is enqueued in q  next  the algorithm proceeds through a number of iterations 
at each iteration  the node with most potential  as measured by p p and cp   is dequeued  and its
children are generated and enqueued in q  the nodes that are created in this way are depicted in
figure    the number i in the subscript of each node ni indicates the order of node generation  and
the thick arrows show the order in which the search space is explored 
note that there are three important features of the algorithm that could not be clearly demonstrated within figure    firstly  at node n    the initial set of unassigned attributes is exhausted

xu  n    is reset to  x    x    x    
secondly  node n   corresponds to an assignment of all  active  attributes that is consistent with
the activity and compatibility constraints

this assignment is not a solution to the adpcsp  because the corresponding preference is not guaranteed to be maximal  and  the assignment is  in fact  not optimal   after the creation of n      the priority queue q looks as follows  the ordering between n  and n  may vary since p p  n      p p  n   
and cp  n      cp  n     
 n     n    n     n    n    n   
therefore  the next node to be explored  after n  and the subsequent creation of n     is n    
thirdly  node n   does correspond with an optimal solution  after its creation  q equals 
 n     n     n    n    n   
as a consequence  n   is dequeued in the next iteration  because no children of n    can be created
 xu  n        and the activity constraints activate no more attributes   n    is retained as a solution 
if the user is interested in finding multiple alternative solutions  the search may proceed until
q contains no more nodes with a p p value that is not smaller than the maximum preference of

   compositional model repositories
the adpcsps discussed in the previous section provide the foundation for the development of the
compositional model repositories  this section specifies the problem that a compositional model
repository is built to solve and shows how it can be translated into an adpcsp  and hence be resolved
using the proposed adpcsp solution algorithm 
    background  assumption based truth maintenance
an atms is a mechanism that keeps track of how each piece of inferred information depends
on presumed information and facts and of how inconsistencies arise  in an atms  each piece of
information used or derived by the problem solver is stored as a node  certain pieces of information
are not known to be true and cannot be inferred from other pieces of information  yet plausible
inference may be drawn from them  such nodes are categorised by a special type and referred to as
assumptions 
inferences between pieces of information are maintained within the atms as dependencies between the corresponding nodes  in its extended form  see de kleer        or keppens         the
atms can take inferences  called justifications of the form n i         nj  nk         nl  nm  
where ni           nj   nk           nl   nm are nodes that the problem solver is interested in  an atms
can also take a specific type of justification  called nogood  that leads to an inconsistency  of the
form ni         nj  nk         nl    meaning that at least one of the statements in
 ni           nj   nk           nl   must be false   in the atms  these nogoods are represented as justifications of a special node  called the nogood node 
based on the given justifications and nogoods  the atms computes a label for each  nonassumption  node  a label is a set of environments and an environment is a set of assumptions 
in particular  an environment e depicts a possible world where all the assumptions in e are true 
thus  the label l n  of a node n describes all possible worlds in which n can be true  the label
computation algorithm of the atms guarantees that each label is

    knowledge representation
as with any other knowledge based approach  building a compositional modeller requires a formalism for the specification of its inputs  its outputs and its knowledge base  the work developed here
is loosely based on the compositional modelling language  bobrow  falkenhainer  farquhar  fikes

concepts

the most primitive constructs in a compositional modeller are participants  relations and assumptions  this subsection summarises these concepts and explains how they are represented herein 
participants  refer to the objects of interest  which are involved in the scenario or its model 
these participants may be real world objects or conceptual objects  such as variables that express
features of real world objects in a mathematical model  for instance  a population of a species is
a typical example of a real world object  and a variable that expresses the number of individuals
of this species forms an example of a conceptual object  it is natural to group objects that share
something in common into classes  participants are herein grouped into participant classes  with
each representing a set of participants that share certain common features  each class will be given
a name for easy reference 
relations describe how the participants are related to one another  as with participants  some
relations represent a real world relationship  such as 
   some of the previous work in compositional modelling refers to these as individuals and quantities  but such names
would not suit the present application  ecological models typically describe the behaviour of populations rather than
that of individuals and it is often hard to distinguish between quantities

other relations may be conceptual in nature  such as equation      which describes an important
textbook model of logistic population growth  ford

to be consistent with other compositional modelling approaches  this paper employs a lispstyle notation for relations  as such  the above two sample relations become

assumptions form a special type of relation that are employed to distinguish between alternative
model design decisions  internally  assumptions will be stored in the form of assumption nodes in
the atms  see section         but in the knowledge base  assumptions appear as relations with a
specific syntax and semantics 
two types of assumptions are employed in this article  relevance assumptions state what phenomena are to be included in or excluded from the scenario model  typical examples of phenomena
are the population growth and predation phenomena  the general format of a relevance assumption
is shown in      the phenomenon that is incorporated in the scenario model when describing a relevance assumption is identified by hnamei and is specific to the subsequent participants or relations 
for example  relevance assumption     states that the growth of participant  population is to be
included in the model

model assumptions specify which type of model is utilised to describe the behaviour of a certain
participant or relation  typical examples of model types include the exponential  malthus       
and the logistic  verhulst        model types of population growth  the formal specification of a
model assumption is given in      often the hnamei in     corresponds to the name of a known
 partial  model of the phenomenon or process being described  the example in     states that the
population  population is being modelled using the logistic approach

      s cenarios and scenario models
as formalised by keppens and shen      b   a compositional modeller takes two inputs and produces one output  the first input is a representation  which is itself a model  that describes the
system of interest by means of an accessible formalism  this model  which normally consists of
 mainly  real world participants and their interrelationships  is called the scenario  the second input
is the task description  it is a formal description of the criteria by which the adequacy of the output
is evaluated  the output is a new model that describes the scenario in a more detailed formalism 
usually a set of variables and equations  which the model based reasoner can employ readily  such a
model  which normally contains conceptual participants and interrelationships  is called a scenario
model  the aim of any compositional modeller is to translate the scenario into a scenario model  by
means of the task description 
in this work  a model is formally defined by a tuple hp  ri  where p is a set of participants and
r is a set of relations over the participants in p   this definition applies to both the scenario and the
scenario model  a typical example of a scenario is a description of a predator population  a prey
population and a predation relation between the predator and the prey  this scenario is a model
hp  ri with

the aim of the compositional model repository is to translate a scenario into a scenario model 
within this work  both systems dynamics stock flow formalism  forrester        and ordinary differential equations  odes  will be employed as the modelling formalisms  for example  a scenario
model that corresponds to the above scenario is depicted in figure    formally  a scenario model is

the relation between the variables of the mathematical model and those used in the stock flow diagram is given in table    generally speaking  stock flow diagrams are graphical representations of
systems of  ordinary or qualitative  differential equations  in the automated modelling literature in
general  and engineering and physical systems modelling in particular  more sophisticated representational formalisms have been developed to enable the identification of mathematical models of the
behaviour of dynamic systems from observations  examples include bond graphs  karnopp  margolis    rosenberg        and generalised physical networks  easley   bradley         however 
the potential benefits of these more advanced formalisms are not exploited here  but remain as an
interesting future work  instead  stock flow diagrams are employed throughout this paper as they
are far more commonly used in ecological modelling  ford        
it is often possible to construct multiple scenario models from a single given scenario  and the
task specification is employed to guide the search for the most appropriate one s   in this work 
scenario models are selected on the basis of hard constraints and user preferences  the hard constraints stem from restrictions imposed on compositionality by the representational framework  see
section        and from properties the scenario model is required to satisfy  see section         the

knowledge base

to construct scenario models from a given scenario  a compositional modeller relies on the use
of a knowledge base that is particular to the problem domain  to illustrate the ideas  this section
presents the constructs employed in the compositional modeller that is developed to synthesise
scenario models in the ecological domain 
composable relations the knowledge base in this approach consists of partial models that can be
instantiated and composed into more complex scenario models  the composition of partial models
into a scenario model may involve the composition of partial relations  coming from different partial
models  in compounded relations  in the sample scenario model of section        the following
relation describes the changes of population size of the prey population
d
nprey   bprey  dprey  pprey
dt

   

in      nprey is the population size  bprey the number of births  dprey the number of natural deaths
and pprey the number of prey who died due to predation  thus  relation     actually describes two
phenomena that affect the population size nprey   natural population growth  bprey  dprey   and
predation related deaths  pprey    when constructing the knowledge base  it is desirable to represent
these two phenomena in isolation because they do not always occur in combination  for example 
some species do not have predators  and it is therefore unnecessary to always include predation
as a cause of death  from this viewpoint  relation     can be seen as composed from different
composable relations in the knowledge base

the use of composable relations enables the knowledge base to cover as many combinations
of the phenomena that may affect a relation as possible  by representing each phenomenon individually rather than precompiling everything together  because only the component parts  i e  the
composable relations  of relations need to be represented  instead of all possible  and however complex  combinations of them  the knowledge base can be smaller and more effective  this section
describes how such composable relations are represented in the knowledge base  as well as whether
and how they can be composed to form compounded relations 
   

fic ompositional m odel r epositories

composable relations are those containing composable functors and for which a method of
composition exists  that describes how a complete set of composable relations can be composed  
the composable functors employed are those proposed by bobrow et al         with a new addition 
composable selection  a summary of such composable relations is presented in table   
the composable relations introduced by bobrow et al         are easy to understand  the
formulae f in v   c    f   and v   c   f   represent terms  respectively f and f   of a sum  and
the formulae f in v   c   f   and v   c   f   represent factors  respectively f and f    of a product 
however  ecological models in use typically contain selection statements which declare that
one certain equation must be employed when a condition is satisfied and some other one otherwise 
formally  a selection is a relation of the form
if c  then v   r  else if c        else v   rn

   

where v is a participant  each ci  with i              n   is a relation describing a condition statement
and each rj  with j              n  is a relation  this selection relation consists of the partial relations 
if ci then v   ri

with i              n   

else v   rn
therefore  a selection relation can be composed from two types of composable relation  the first
is a composable if relation  which has the form v   c if p  a  f    where v is a participant  p is an
element taken from a total order  such as the set of natural numbers   which denotes the priority of
the composable if relation in the sequence  and a and f are two given relations  the second type
of composable relation is a composable else relation  which has the form v   c else  felse    where
felse is a given relation assigned to v if none of the antecedents in the composable if relations is
true 
to illustrate this notation  the selection relation     can be composed from the following composable relations 
v   c if p   c    r   
  
 
v   c if pn   cn    rn

to combine the composable relations  a number of rules are defined to implement the semantics
of the representational formalism  in theory  a set of rules can be generated that enables the aggregation of any set of composable relations  in practice  however  a trade off must be made between
flexibility  the ability to combine many different types of composable relation  and comprehensibility  the use of a set of rules that is easily understood by the knowledge engineer who employs
composable relations   thus  the types of composable relations that can be combined has to be
restricted 
table   summarises what composable relations can be joined to form compounded relations 
the principle guiding the construction of this table is to allow only the composition of relations of
certain types for which a resulting compound relation is intuitively obvious  for example  according

table    composibility of composable relations
to table    a composable addition relation x   c    y  can be combined with a composable subtraction relation x   c   z  because their combination is clearly x   y  z  however  according to
table    a composable addition relation x   c    y  can not be combined with a composable multiplication relation x   c   z   because an arbitrary and non intuitive rule would otherwise have to
be defined to decide whether the compound relation would be x   y   z or x   y  z 
the order in which the composable selections must be considered is defined by the priorities
 or is implicit in the case of c else    therefore  composable selections can be combined with one
another provided no two composable if relations have the same priority 
in order to derive the actual rules of composition  the sets of all composable relations with the
same functor for a given model hp  ri are defined first 

r v  c        v   c    fi      v   c    fi     r 
r v  c       v   c   fi      v   c   fi     r 
r v  c       v   c   fi      v   c   fi     r 
r v  c       v   c   fi      v   c   fi     r 
r v  c if      v   c if pi  ai   fi      v   c if pi  ai   fi     r 
r v  c else      v   c else  fi      v   c else  fi     r 
from this  the rules of composition can be built as given in the expressions           and      
they jointly state how a given set of composable relations can be rewritten as a single compound
relation  each of these rules contains a complete set of all composable relations in the antecedent 
in particular  the antecedent of rule     contains the set of all composable addition and subtraction
relations with the same participant v in the left hand side 
similarly  the antecedent rule      contains the complete set of composable multiplication relations  finally  the antecedent of rule      is satisfied for the complete set of composable if and else
relations with the same left hand participant v  provided that the priorities are strictly ordered  i e 
no two priorities are equal  and that there is only a single composable else relation  the latter two
conditions are added because two composable if relations with the same priority or two composable
else relations can not be compounded  the consequents of the rules of composition explain how
these complete sets of composable relations can be joined  this is simply a matter of applying the
appropriate mathematical operation to the provided terms

property definitions property definitions describe features of interest to the application requiring
a scenario model  a property definition  is a tuple hp s     i where p s    ps          psm   is a set of
source participants  a predicate calculus sentence  whose free variables are elements of p s   and
 is a relation  whose free variables are also elements of p s   such that
ps            psm   

a typical example of a feature of interest is the requirement that a certain variable in the model
is endogenous or exogenous  to be more specific  the property definitions below describe when a
variable  v is endogenous and exogenous respectively 
 defproperty endogenous
 source participants    v  type variable  
 structural condition   or      v     d dt  v     
 property  endogenous  v  
 defproperty exogenous
 source participants    v  type variable  
 structural condition   not  endogenous  v   
 property  exogenous  v  
d
 v     is true  where   matches
the first definition states that whenever either  v     or dt
any constant or formula    v is deemed to be endogenous  the second property definition indicates
that a variable is said to be exogenous if such an object exists and it is not endogenous 
by describing such features formally in the knowledge base  property definitions enable them
to be imposed as criteria on the selection of scenario models  in this way  the variable describing
the size of a particular population in an eco system  for instance  can be forced to be endogenous 
note that required properties can be specified in two different ways  either globally as goals for
the scenario model construction or locally as a required purpose of a certain model fragment  the
latter use of model properties will be illustrated later

model fragments model fragments are the building blocks with which scenario models are constructed  a model fragment  is a tuple hp s   p t   s   t   a  i where p s    ps          psm   is a
set of variables called source participants  p t    pt            ptn   is a set of variables called targetparticipants  s    s            sv   is a set of relations  called structural conditions  whose free variables are elements of p s   t    t            tx   is a set of relations  called postconditions  whose free
variables are elements of p s  p t   a    a            ay   is a set of relations  called assumptions  and
   is a set of relations  called purpose required properties  such that

note that  in this work  each property definition hp s     i is equivalent to a model fragment
hp s                   i 
for example  the model fragment below states that a population  p can be described by two
variables  p size  describing the size of  p  and  p change  describing the rate of change in
population size  and a differential equation
d
 p size    p change
dt
the usage of this partial scenario model is subject to two conditions      the growth phenomenon is
relevant with regard to  p  and     the variable  p change is endogenous in the eventual scenario
model  the former requirement is indicated by the relevance assumption and the latter by the
purpose required property 
 defmodelfragment population growth
 source participants    p  type population  
 assumptions   relevant growth  p  
 target participants    p size  type variable 
  p change  type variable  
 postconditions   size of  p size  p 
 change of  p change  p 
 d dt  p size  p change  
 purpose required   endogenous  p change   

the purpose required property is usually satisfied by additional model fragments  such as the
one below 
 defmodelfragment logistic population growth
 source participants    p  type population 
  p size  type variable 
  p change  type variable  
 structural conditions   size of  p size  p 
 change of  p births  p  
 assumptions   model  p size logistic  
 target participants    r  type parameter 
  k  type variable 
  d  type variable  
 postconditions   capacity of  k  p 
 density of  d  p size 
     d  c add     p size  k   
     p change        r  p size       d

model fragments are rules of inference that describe how new knowledge can be derived from
existing knowledge by committing the emerging model to certain assumptions  they are used
to generate a space of possible models  model fragments are instantiated by matching sourceparticipants to existing participants in the scenario or an emerging model  and by matching the
structural conditions to corresponding relations  for each possible instantiation  a new instance is
generated for each of the target participants  and where necessary  new instances are also created for
the postconditions and assumptions  such instances  as well as the inferential relationships between
the instances of the source participants  structural conditions and assumptions on the one hand  and
those of the target participants and postconditions on the other  are stored in an atms  forming the
model space  this is to be further explained in section       
a model fragment is said to be applied if it is instantiated and the underlying assumptions
hold  if a model fragment is applied  the instances of the target participants and postconditions
corresponding to the instantiation of that model fragment must be added to the resulting model  with
respect to the above example  the model fragment that implements the logistic population growth
model is instantiated whenever variables exist that describe the size and change in a population  and
it is applied if the logistic model for population size has also been selected 
note that in most compositional modellers  such as the ones devised by heller and struss       
       levy  iwasaki and fikes         nayak and joskowicz         and rickel and porter        
model fragments represent direct translations of components of physical systems into influences between variables  because the compositional modeller presented herein aims to serve as an ecological
model repository  the contents of the model fragments employed differs from that of conventional
compositional modellers in two important regards 
firstly  model fragments contain partial models describing certain phenomena instead of influences  these partial models normally correspond to those developed in ecological modelling
research  typical examples include the logistic population growth model  verhulst        and the
holling predation model  holling        devised in the population dynamics literature 
secondly  the partial models contained in the model fragments often need to be composed incrementally  for example  the aforementioned sample model fragment logistic populationgrowth requires an emerging scenario model  which may be generated by the other sample model
fragment population growth  thus  one model fragment  e g  logistic populationgrowth  can expand on the partial model contained in another  e g  population growth  because of this feature  it is  correctly  presumed that no model fragment  generates new relations
that are preconditions of model fragments that  expands on  violating this presumption would
make little sense in the context of the present application as it would imply a recursive extension of
an emerging scenario model with the same set of variables and equations 
      participant class declaration and participant type hierarchies
in general  participant classes need not be defined  however  certain types of participant may be
described in terms of other interesting participants  irrespective of the modelling choices  this
feature provides syntactic sugar for describing important relations between participants  making it
easier to declare required properties of a scenario model in terms of the participants of the scenario 
for example  the behaviour of a population may be described in terms of population size and growth
rate variables 
 defentity population
 participants  size growth rate  

   

fik eppens   s hen

participant class declarations may also be employed within model fragments to provide a more
specific definition of the meaning of the source participants and the target participants  in this way 
participant specifications are constrained to be a feature of another participant by means of the
 entity statement  as the following example illustrates 
 defmodelfragment define population growth phenomenon
 source participants    p  type population  
 target participants
   ps  type stock  entity  size  p  
  pg  type variable  entity  growth rate  p  
  pb  type flow 
  pd  type flow  
 assumptions   relevant growth  p  
 postconditions       pg     pb  pd  
 flow  pb source  pl 
 flow  pd  pl sink   

furthermore  participant class declarations may define one class to be an immediate subclass of
another  for example  the population participant class of holometabolous insects  e g  butterflies 
may be defined as a subclass of the population participant class 
 defentity holometabolous insect population
 subclass of  population 
 participants
 larva number pupa number adult number  

in this way  a participant type hierarchy is defined  each subclass inherits all participants of its
superclasses  i e  its immediate superclass and superclasses of superclasses  
in summary  a participant class declaration is a tuple    h s   p i where s is a participant
class  called the immediate superclass of the participant class and p is a set of participants classes
that describe important features of the participant class 
    inference
the compositional modelling method presented herein employs a four step inference procedure 
   model space construction  the model space is an atms that efficiently stores all the participants  relations and model design decisions  represented in the form of relevance and model
assumptions  that may be part of the final scenario model  as well as the conditions under
which each of these participants and relations must or must not be part of the scenario model 
   adcsp construction  the model space contains a number of hard constraints on the participants and relations that may be combined  this inference step extracts such restrictions and
translates them into an adcsp 
   inclusion of order of magnitude preferences  preferences are associated with relevance and
model assumptions in the scenario space as they reflect the relative appropriateness of these
assumptions  resulting in an adpcsp 
   scenario model selection  this inference step solves the adpcsp  the resulting solutions
correspond to scenario models that are consistent according to the domain knowledge and
optimise the overall preference with respect to the order of magnitude preference calculus

these four steps correspond to the four squares of the compositional model repository in figure  
in this section  each of these inference steps is discussed in detail and illustrated by means of
simple examples  the next section contains a more detailed example and shows how this procedure
can be applied to a non trivial ecological modelling domain 
      s cenario   k nowledge base   m odel s pace
as previously stated  the aim of a compositional modeller is to translate a scenario into a scenario
model  both are representations of the system of interest though they model the system at a different
level of detail  the knowledge base provides the foundation for translation  all the scenario models
that can be constructed from the given scenario  with regard to the knowledge base  are stored in the
model space 
a model space is an atms  de kleer        containing all the participants  relations and assumptions that can be instantiated from a given scenario  in this work  the generalised version of
the atms  as introduced by de kleer         is employed as it allows the use of negations of nodes
in the justifications  the algorithm generate m odel s pace ho  ri  describes how such a model
space can be created from a scenario ho  ri  it first initialises the model space  with the participant instances  o  and the relation instances  r  from the scenario  then  for each model fragment whose source participants and structural conditions match participants and relations already
in   new instances of its target participants  assumptions and postconditions are added to   because each property definition hp s     i is equivalent to a model fragment hp s                   i 
this procedure applies to property definitions as well as model fragments  matching the sourceparticipants and structural conditions of a model fragment  to the emerging model space is performed by the function match       as specified below  where  is the model fragment being
matched  and  is a substitution from the source participants of  to participant instances 


true if     ps   o            psm  om

match        
o            om  



  s       




false otherwise
each match  specified by a model fragment  and a substitution   is processed as follows 

 for each assumption a  a    a new node  denoting the assumption instance a  is created
and added to  
 then  a new node n      denoting the instantiation of  via substitution   is created  added
to  and justified by the implication 
 aa   a    pp s    p    s       n   
 finally  a new instance for each target participant p  p t    and for each postcondition
  t     provided  does not already exist in the model space   is created  for the
target participants  this involves creating a new symbol for each new participant instance with
the function gensym   and extending  with the substitution  p gensym     a new node n

 non composable relations  in any mathematical formalism designed to describe simulation
models of dynamic systems  certain combinations of relations may over constrain the model 
and hence  be unsuitable for generating the behaviour of a system of interest  within the
system dynamics and ode formalisms used in this paper  assignments of relations to the
same variable are only composable if those relations are explicitly deemed composable  in
other words  two relations v   ri and v   rj can only be combined with one another if ri
and rj are composable  examples of pairs of non composable relations include
x   c    y  and x   c   z  because c   and c  relations are not composable  and
a   c    b  and a   c   d because c   d is not a composable relation 
combinations of such non composable relations must be reported as an inconsistency as well 
this type of inconsistency is depicted in figure   c

   generate the attributes and domain values from the assumptions  the adcsp attributes correspond to the underlying assumption classes  i e  groups of assumptions indicating alternative
choices with regards to the same model construction decision   a relevance assumption and
its negation jointly form an assumption class  for example  a      relevant growth
frog    relevant growth frog   specifies such an assumption class  the set of
model assumptions involving the same participants relations  but with different model names
and hence different descriptions  also form an assumption class  for instance  a      model
nfrog exponential    model nfrog logistic    model nfrog other    where
nfrog is a variable denoting the size of a population  specifies such an assumption class  running this step of the algorithm  an attribute is created for each assumption class  with the
domain of such an attribute consisting of all assumption instances in the assumption class 
   create activity constraints  the attributes and domain values generated in the previous step
are only meaningful in situations where the participant and or relation instances contained in
the arguments of the corresponding assumptions exist  for example  the assumption  model
nfrog logistic  is only relevant if the participant instance nfrog exists  clearly  all assumptions within one assumption class have the same participant and or relation instances as
their arguments  because each assumption class corresponds to one attribute  the attribute
can be activated if and only if the participant and or relation instances associated with the related assumption class are active  therefore  this step creates activity constraints that activate
an attribute based on the conjunction of the environments contained within the labels of the
participants relations of the assumption class  for instance  as can be deduced from figure
   nfrog is activated when  relevant growth frog  is committed  thus  the attribute
corresponding to assumption class a    defined in step    is activated under the attribute value
assignment associated with the  relevant growth frog  assumption 
   create compatibility constraints  in the atms  or model space   all sources of inconsistencies are contained in the label of the nogood node  therefore  the compatibility constraints
are created directly by translating the environments in the label l   into the corresponding
conjunctions of attribute value assignments

preferences

  a dpcsp

the adcsp produced as above formalises the hard requirements imposed upon the scenario models 
among the scenario models that meet these requirements  some may be better than others  because
the underlying model design decisions may be deemed more appropriate by the user  preferences
that express this  relative  level of appropriateness are attached to the assumptions that describe the
model design decisions  and by extension  to the attribute value pairs in the adcsp  as discussed in
section    such an extension to the adcsp constitutes an adpcsp 
more specifically  it is worth recalling that in section     an order of magnitude preference
calculus is presented that enables representation and reasoning with subjective user preferences for
different relevance and modelling assumption  next  section     introduces a solution algorithm for
adpcsps that include an adcsp  such as the ones constructed with the approach of section       
and are extended with subjective user preferences for alternative design decisions

    outline analysis of complexity
the complexity of the work arises from four major sources     model space construction     label
propagation in the atms     model space to adcsp translation  and    adpcsp solution 
generate m odel s pace  ho  ri  essentially performs a fixed sequence of instructions and
produces a small set of nodes and inferences for each match of a model fragment  therefore  its
time and space complexity are linear with respect to the number of possible matches of model
fragments  createa dcsp   extracts certain information from the model space and rewrites it in
a different formalism without further manipulations  therefore  its time and space complexity are
linear with respect to the size of the model space 
the label propagation algorithm of an atms is known to have an exponential time complexity 
however  because the model space is built up incrementally  by generate m odel s pace ho  ri  
from the root nodes of the atms network  i e  those that correspond to facts and have no antecedents  to the leaf nodes  i e  those that have have no consequents  other than the nogood node 
and because the inconsistencies are added at the end  this complexity only increases exponentially
with the depth of the network and the number of participants and relations in individual model fragments  rather than with the size of the model space  this fact significantly limits the complexity
impact of label propagation  firstly  the depth of the atms network is restricted by the domain 
in many conventional compositional modellers  where model fragments are direct translations from
scenario components to scenario model equations  this depth would be only one  empirically  constructing the model space for sophisticated eco systems  the depth of a model space never exceeded
   secondly  the size of the individual model fragments does not change significantly with the size
of the knowledge base 
the fourth and final source of complexity is driven by the fact that the constraint satisfaction
algorithm must determine a consistent combination of assumptions in the model space  the space
of attribute value assignments increases exponentially with the size of the number of assumptions
and hence  with the model space  thus  the overall complexity of the present approach is largely
dominated by the constraint satisfaction algorithm employed 
if the user does not specify any preference  the csp is an adcsp  recently  a number of efficient
methods have been devised for solving adcsps as presented by minton et al          mittal and
falkenhainer         and verfaillie and schiex         this helps minimise the overhead incurred
for compositional modelling 
with preferences  the csp becomes an adpcsp  as argued in section    this presents a new
problem that has not yet been studied in detail  in this work  an a  algorithm has been proposed to
implement the csp solution method  this approach is known to be the most efficient in terms of
the proportion of the search space the algorithm needs to explore before finding an optimal solution 
when compared to other search methods that are based on the same heuristic  hart et al          a
disadvantage is that it incurs an exponential space complexity  as explained by miguel and shen
     a      b   and tsang         a wide range of alternative solution techniques exist for ordinary
csps and many of these could also be extended to solve adpcsps  a detailed examination of these
techniques is a topic of future research 
    automated modelling and scientific discovery
as mentioned previously  a compositional model repository is designed in order to compose models
from a systems structure and relevant domain knowledge  as such  this approach gives rise to a po   

fik eppens   s hen

tentially beneficial means to operationalise the outcomes of scientific discovery  more specifically 
the resultant compositional model repositories will allow existing knowledge on model construction
to be applied to unexperienced scenarios and to support investigation into situations which may be
physically difficult to replicate or create but which may be synthesised in computational representations 
the present work has been applied to the vegetation component of the modmed n species
model  legg  muetzelfeldt    heathfield         this n species model offers a system dynamics
representation of populations of mediterranean vegetations and of how they are affected by populations of farm animals  climate and environmental management  the purpose of the model is to
be instantiated with respect to various mediterranean communities  and to serve as a component
of a very large scale simulation that is designed to simulate the effects of various environmental
policies on the mediterranean landscape  a knowledge base containing approximately    model
fragments and   property definitions has been constructed  on the basis of the most complex parts
of the n species model in about two man weeks  this knowledge base can be employed to reconstruct variations of the n species model to accommodate a variety of possible scenarios  as well as
to examine simplifications of the original n species model which exclude certain phenomena 
the compositional model repository is most closely related to the seminal work on compositional modelling  falkenhainer   forbus         that approach has a similar functionality but
it is devised specifically for physical systems and relies on a component connection formalism to
represent scenarios 
another approach which has recently been developed and applied to the ecological domain by
heller and struss               this work derives a systems structure from observations of its
behaviour and domain knowledge  therefore  it is able to perform diagnosis of ecological systems
and therapy suggestion  another important distinction of this work from the present study is that
it presumes that each process can only be described in just one way instead of allowing multiple
alternative models 
in the machine learning community  a number of approaches have been devised by bradley 
easley and stolle         langley et al          and todorovski and dzeroski              to
induce sets of differential equations from a  observations of behaviour  b  domain knowledge represented in the form of hypothetical equations  and c  a description of the structure of the system 
these approaches aim at scientific discovery by generalising observed behaviour into mathematical
models  the specifications of the scenario and the domain knowledge in these methods are similar
to those used in this article  this is especially true for the work by langley et al          and todorovski and dzeroski               because that work has also been applied to population dynamics 
however  the internal mechanisms of these approaches are very different as they essentially rely on
exhaustive search procedures instead of constraint satisfaction techniques 

   a population dynamics example
the examples used throughout the previous sections were taken from a more extensive application
study of the present work  the application was aimed to construct a repository of basic population
dynamic models  describing the phenomena of growth  predation and competition  this section
presents an overview of how the proposed approach is employed in this application to show the
ability of the work to scale to larger problems

    knowledge base
this subsection illustrates how a set of model fragments can be constructed  the challenge of
this task lies in the fact that model fragments must encompass a sufficiently general and reusable
component part of the ecological models  in instances of models found in the literature on ecological
modelling  the boundaries of the recurring component parts are hidden  and it is therefore up to the
knowledge engineer to identify them 
first  a hierarchy of entity types is set up  the system dynamics models shown earlier contain
only three types of participant  variables  stocks and flows  here  stocks and flows are a special
type of variable with a predetermined meaning  that is  a flow f into a stock s corresponds to the
d
d
s   c    f   and a flow f out of a stock s denotes dt
s   c   f    hence  stocks and
equation dt
flows are defined as subclasses of the participant class variable 
 defentity variable 
 defentity stock
 subclass of  variable  
 defentity flow
 subclass of  variable  

the sample properties defined in section        which describe the condition under which a
variable is endogenous or exogenous  are employed in this knowledge base 
 defproperty endogenous  
 source participants    v  type variable  
 structural conditions       v    
 property  endogenous  v  
 defproperty endogenous

 structural conditions   d dt  v    
 property  endogenous  v  
 defproperty exogenous
 source participants    v  type variable  
 structural conditions   not  endogenous  v   
 property  exogenous  v  

the next three model fragments contain the rules of the stock flow diagrams employed by systems dynamics models  they respectively describe that 
 a flow  flow into a stock  stock corresponds to the composable differential equation 
d

dt
 a flow  flow out of a stock  stock corresponds to the composable differential equation

once the above declarations are in place  the knowledge base of model fragments can be defined  the first model fragment describes the population growth phenomenon  note that all of the
aforementioned growth  predation and competition models contain a stock representing population
size and two flows  one flow of births into the stock and another flow of deaths out of the stock  this
common feature of models on population dynamics is contained in a single model fragment

the variables  birth flow and  death flow become endogenous if the model contains

there is one twist in compositional modelling of population growth  sometimes  the actual
growth model is implicitly contained within another type of model  in such cases  the growth
phenomenon and the corresponding differential equations are still relevant  but none of the dedicated
growth models can be employed  for example  as will be shown later  the lotka volterra predation
model comes with its own equations describing growth 
   

fik eppens   s hen

the model fragment other growth allows for an empty growth model  named other  to
be selected  however  due to the purpose required property that any instance of  p change must
be endogenous  this empty model can only be selected if a growth model is implicitly included
elsewhere

in addition to population growth  two other phenomena are included in the knowledge base 
predation and competition  predation and competition relations between species are represented by
predicates over the populations  e g   predation foxes rabbits  and  competition
sheep cows   however the existence of a phenomenon does not necessarily mean that it must be
contained within the model  it would make little sense to model predation and competition without
modelling the size of the populations  because models of these phenomena relate population sizes
to one another  therefore  the incorporation of the predation phenomenon is made dependent upon
the existence of variables representing population size  also  human expert modellers may prefer
to leave a phenomenon out of the resulting model  to keep this choice open  the following two
model fragments construct a participant representing the phenomena of predation and competition 
and make it dependent upon a relevance assumption

the holling model employs a variable denoting the capacity of a population  such a variable

predation models are often used in conjunction  the compositional modeller need not be aware of
such combinations of models  however  all it needs to know is the prerequisites of the individual
component models contained within each model fragment

figure     model space for the   predator and   competing prey scenario
    model space
a model space is constructed when the knowledge base is instantiated with respect to a given scenario  consider for example the following scenario  which describes a predator population that
preys on two other populations  prey  and prey   whilst the two prey populations compete with
one another 
 defscenario pred prey prey scenario
 entities   predator  type population 
 prey   type population 
 prey   type population  
 relations   predation predator prey  
 predation predator prey  
 competition prey  prey    

the full specification of the model space is too unwieldy to present here but an abstract graphical
representation of the model space for this scenario is shown in figure     this model space contains
the following knowledge 
 from each of the three populations in the scenario  a set of three population growth models
 i e  exponential  logistic and other  is derived  this inference is dependent upon
a relevance assumption of the population growth phenomenon  and a model assumption that
corresponds to one of the three population growth models 
   

fic ompositional m odel r epositories

 from both predation relations  i e   predation predator prey   and  predation
predator prey     and the populations related by them  a set of two predation models
 i e  lotka volterra and holling  is derived  this inference is dependent upon a relevance assumption of the predation phenomenon and a model assumption that corresponds to
one of the two predation models 
 from the competition relation  competition prey  prey    and the populations related by it  a competition model is derived  because there is only one competition model 
the inference of the competition model is only dependent upon a relevance assumption that
corresponds to the competition phenomenon 
in addition to the hypergraph of figure     the model space also contains a number of constraints
on the conjunctions of assumptions that are consistent  as explained earlier  these stem from two
sources     non composable relations and    purpose required properties  an example will be given
of each type 
let predation phen   be the predation phenomenon between predator and prey  
and prey  size be the variable representing the size of the prey  population  in this example  the model fragments exponential population growth and lotka volterra
will each generate an equation for computing the value of a variable representing the change in
prey  size  because both equations can not be composed  the following inconsistency is generated 
 relevant growth prey     model prey  size exponential 
 relevant growth predator    relevant predation predator prey  
 model predation phen   lotka volterra   

inconsistencies also arise from purpose required properties  for example  if the model fragment predation phenomenon is applicable and the predation relation is deemed relevant  then
the purpose required property  has model  pred phen  will become a condition for consistency  under certain combinations of assumptions  this property may not be satisfied  say  when the
holling predation and exponential growth models are both selected  the holling model is not generated because there is no  capacity for which  capacity  capacity  pred  is true  no
predation model is created in this case  because the holling model fragment can not be instantiated   even though the predation phenomenon is deemed relevant under this set of assumptions  this
is inconsistent with the has model purpose required property in the predation phenomenon
model fragment  and the responsible combination of assumptions is therefore marked as nogood 
 relevant growth predator    model predator size exponential 
 relevant growth prey     model prey  size exponential 
 relevant predation predator prey     model predation phen   holling   

    adpcsp and solution
the resultant model space is translated into an adcsp to enable the selection of a consistent set of
assumptions  using advanced csp solution techniques  the adcsp derived from the above model
space is depicted in figure

table    the adcsp for the   predator and   competing prey scenario  domains and their contents
and meaning

this adcsp contains    attributes  they are listed with the corresponding assumption classes
in table    the first   attributes correspond to the notion of relevance phenomenon    population
growth phenomena    predation phenomena and   competition phenomenon to be precise  the other
  attributes correspond to   sets of model types    sets of population growth models and   sets of
predation models 
the assumptions from which the attributes were generated form domains of values  the resulting domains of the aforementioned attributes are summarised in table   
the activity constraints in the adcsp describe the conditions that instantiate the subject of the
assumptions that correspond to an attribute  since each participant or relation has a label in the
model space  a minimal set of assumptions under which it becomes part of the emerging model
is available  when a participant or relation is the subject of an assumption  this label explicitly
describes the sets of assumptions under which the attribute that corresponds to that subject should

be activated  by translating the label of a subject into sets of attribute value assignments  the antecedents of the activity constraints are constructed 
in this example  the relevance assumptions  attributes x            x    take their subjects from the
scenario  and hence  they are always active  the attributes related to the model assumptions for
population growth are active if the corresponding assumptions denoting relevance of population
growth are true  that is 
x    d  y  active x   
x    d  y  active x   
x    d  y  active x   
the attributes related to the assumptions about the predation models are active if the corresponding
assumptions denoting relevance of predation  and the assumptions describing relevance of population growth  are true for the populations involved in the predation relation  that is 
x    d  y  x    d  y  x    d  y  active x    
x    d  y  x    d  y  x    d  y  active x    
figure    shows a graphical representation of these activity constraints 
the compatibility constraints correspond directly to the inconsistencies in the nogood node 
these inconsistencies have been discussed in the previous section and are depicted in figure    
once the adcsp is constructed  preferences may be attached to attribute value assignments 
suppose that preferences are only assigned to the standard population modelling choices  i e  expo

of competition  because only one type model has been implemented for this phenomenon   for
example  the following bpqs could be employed 
pexponential   plogistic
plotka volterra   pholling
pcompetition
the logistic and holling models are preferred over the exponential and lotka volterra models because the former are generally regarded as being more accurate  note that the preferences have
been ordered in such a way that those corresponding to different phenomena are not related to one
another  the justification for this ordering is that  even though the models are structurally connected
 there are restrictions over which models can combined with one another   models of different phenomena inherently describe behaviours that can not be compared with one another  the preference
assignments for attribute value assignments are summarised in table   
solving this adpcsp is simple  first  the attributes x            x  are activated  each of these
attributes is assigned xi   di y because that assignment maximises the potential preference  then 
the attributes x            x   are activated  here  attributes x            x  are assigned xi   di l because the
logistic growth model has the highest preference  finally  x    and x   are assigned x     d   h and
x     d   h because the holling models have the highest preference and are not inconsistent with the
logistic model committed earlier  the resulting solution satisfies the following set of assumptions

figure     deducing a scenario model from the model space  given a set of assumptions

    sample scenario model
figure    shows how a scenario model can be deduced from the above set of assumptions by exploiting the model space  the nodes corresponding to the aforementioned assumptions and those
that logically follow from the assumption set are indicated in the figure 
when combining the participants and relations in the resulting scenario model  the model given
in figure    can be drawn  this model corresponds to the one that an ecologist would draw if the
logistic growth and holling predation models were regarded to be appropriate for the task at hand 

   conclusion and future work
this article has presented a novel approach to compositional modelling that enables the construction
of models of ecological systems  this work differs from existing approaches in that it automatically
translates the compositional modelling problem into an adcsp with  order of magnitude  preference valuations  there are several benefits to this method 
the use of a translation algorithm that converts the compositional modelling problem into an
adcsp allows criteria to be formalised  more importantly  it also enables efficient  existing and
future  adcsp solution techniques to be effectively applied to solving compositional modelling
problems

the extension of the adcsps with  order of magnitude  preferences  to form adpcsps  also
permits the incorporation of softer requirements in the compositional modelling problem  in this
paper  order of magnitude preferences have been employed to express the appropriateness of alternative model types for certain phenomena  while such considerations may be described by hard
constraints in the physical systems domain    they are more subjective in less understood problem
domains  such as the ecological modelling domain  the approach presented herein provides a means
to capture and represent the subtlety of the flexible model design decisions 
the theoretical ideas presented in this article have been applied to real world ecological modelling problems  in this paper  it has been demonstrated how the resultant compositional modeller
can be employed to create a repository of population dynamics models  the approach has also been
applied to automated model construction of large and complex ecosystems such as the modmed
model of mediterranean vegetation  legg et al          as reported by keppens        
there are some practical and theoretical issues that need to be addressed  however  on the practical side  the types of ecological model design decisions  as represented by the assumptions and
assumption classes  and as supported by the inference mechanisms  should be extended  ecological
systems tend to involve interrelated populations of individuals  instead of functional compositions of
individual components as with physical systems  one particularly important type of design decision
in ecological modelling is therefore granularity  this requires the introduction of novel representation formalisms and inference mechanisms such as aggregation and disaggregation  initial work for
considering populations as single entities and for dividing such entities into sub populations when
necessary has been carried out  keppens   shen      a   integration of such work into the present
adpcsp framework requires further investigation 
on the theoretical side  the analysis of the complexity of the present approach is rather informal 
much remains to be done in this regard  especially when comparing to the complexity of existing
compositional modellers  for this comparison  additional work will be required to adapt the current translation procedure to suit existing compositional modelling problems  most compositional
modellers are of exponential complexity  however  as they employ problem specific solution algorithms  little is known about opportunities for improving their efficiency  this work hopes to be a
first step toward further understanding this important issue
