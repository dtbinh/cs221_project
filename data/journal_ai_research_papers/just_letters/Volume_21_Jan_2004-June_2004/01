yet hotels price finalized auction closessome minutes game  depending
random closing order  agents tend submit serious hotel bids first
closing imminent  useful information revealed price quotes fourth minute
play  complementarity among goods dictates outcomes early auctions significantly affect
value agent places particular hotel later game  conversely  prices hotels
available later dictate whether agent bid wisely early game 
anticipating hotel prices key element several decisions facing tac agent  particular

   selecting trip itineraries  flight prices tend increase  agents great incentive
commit traveling particular days early game  yet quality day choices
depends crucially hotel prices included travel days 
   bidding policy  likelihood obtaining good given bid depends obviously
resulting clearing price  moreover  value particular good general function
price others  example  value obtaining room hotel  s    increasing

given importance price prediction  surprising tac researchers explored
variety approaches  stone et al         noted diversity price estimation methods among
tac    agents  particular interest problem certainly connected tac   
agent  walverine  introduced method quite distinct reported previously  thus 
highly motivated characterize performance price prediction task 
indeed  competitions tac successful facilitating research  necessary separately evaluate techniques developed problem subtasks  stone         although
interesting subtasks tend strictly separable complex game  price prediction
component trading strategy may easier isolate most  particular  problem
formulated terms  natural absolute accuracy measures  fact  see below 
agent developers independently chose define price prediction distinct task
agent designs 
divide price prediction two phases  initial interim  initial refers beginning
game  hotel auctions close provide quote information  interim refers
method employed thereafter  since information available initial prediction  flight prices 
client preferencessee section      strict subset available interim  which adds transaction hotel price data   agents treat initial prediction  simpler  special case 
initial prediction relevant bidding policy first hotel closing  especially salient
trip choices typically made early game  interim prediction supports ongoing revision bids hotel auctions start close  analysis report focus initial prediction 
mainly simpler two tasks  involving less potential information  moreover 
agents initially relatively comparable information sets  thus providing cleaner analysis 
interim prediction quite important interesting  focus work

    forms prediction
one distinction observed tac    agents explicitly formulated predictions terms
probability distributions prices  rather point estimates  predictions form enable
agent properly account price uncertainty decision making  thus  asked entrants
form predictions survey 
although agents generate point predictions  notable exceptions  attacs boosting algorithm  stone et al         expressly learns probability distributions associated game
features  roxybot tabulates game price statistics direct estimation deciles hotel
auction  packatac harami measure historical variance  combining historical averaging define parametric distribution hotel price  walverine predicts point prices 
hedging approach decisions amounts forming effective distribution around them 
given prediction form distribution  agents may make decisions sampling
decision analytic techniques  distribution may facilitate interim prediction task  enabling updates based treating observations price quotes evidence 
however  first controlled experiment evaluating distribution feature  context attac
 stone et al          find overall advantage decision making based distributions
compared using mean values  authors offered several possible explanations observed
performance  including     implementation employs insufficient samples     
use distributions makes unrealistic assumption subsequent decisions made
full knowledge actual price values  greenwald      b  found bidding marginal utility based means outperformed bidding expected marginal utility based distributions  time
implemented context roxybot  since performed analogous trials using walverinewhich generates applies distributions yet third wayand found bidding based
means superior distribution based bidding agent actually employed tac    
although source deficiency conclusively established  speculate
second reason adduced attac designers plausible 
  

fiw ellman   r eeves   l ochner     vorobeychik

despite evidence  alternative ways using distributions may well prove beneficial 
study greenwald      b  demonstrated advantage roxybots      strategy evaluating
candidate bid sets respect distributions  compared      strategy evaluating
respect means 
nevertheless  agents predict probability distributions  take mean distributions subject analysis  may discount potential advantages  based
discussion above  suspect thatwith possible exception roxybotagents
actually benefit predicting distributions tac

tac economy  defined set prices markets would clear  assuming
agents behave price takers  katzner         taking account exogenously determined

let vector hotel prices  consisting elements denoting price hotel type

prices constitute competitive equilibrium aggregate demand equals aggregate supply

starting initial guess   walverine searches equilibrium prices using tatonnement protocol  iterative price adjustment mechanism originally conceived walras  arrow
  hahn         given specification aggregate demand  tatonnement iteratively computes

although equilibrium prices guaranteed exist given discreteness complementarities tac environment  found procedure typically produces approximate

   limitations
important emphasize several limitations study  must qualify conclusions
drawn efficacy prediction methods evaluated here 
first  focused exclusively initial price prediction  whereas many agents placed
greater emphasis interim prediction task 
second  many cases represented agents predictions abstraction actual
object produced prediction modules  particular  reduce probability distributions
means  consider first unit priceline prediction  generally 
account different ways agents apply predictions generate  without question
even measure introduce  evpp  inspired thinking terms walverine uses
predictions  perhaps measures tailored processes agents would  justifiably  show
predictions favorable light 
third  recognized despite desirability isolating focused components
agent analysis  complete separation possible principle  prediction evaluation relative
agent uses prediction  makes tradeoffs  e g  
commits flights   ultimately entire strategy  complexity  studies
must strive balance benefits decomposition appreciation interconnections
synergies among elements sophisticated agents behavior 

    conclusions
presented comprehensive survey approaches initial price prediction tac    
quantitative analysis relative accuracy  analysis introduces new measure  expected
value perfect prediction  captures important sense instrumental value accurate
predictions  beyond nominal correspondence realized outcomes 
draw several conclusions price prediction tac exercise  first  results
clearly demonstrate instance specific information provide significant leverage pure
background history  three agents use instance specific information perform better least
one measure constant prediction  particular  initial flight prices provide substantial
predictive value  induced verified empirically  seen success
machine learning agents  predictive value flows influence flight prices demand
hotels  indicated success competitive analysis capturing relationship 
believe striking purely analytical approach  without empirical tuning  could
achieve accuracy comparable best available machine learning method  moreover  many
would surely skeptical straight competitive analysis could prove successful  given
manifest unreality assumptions applied tac  analysis certainly show
competitive equilibrium best possible model price formation tac 
demonstrate deriving shape market idealized economic theory surprisingly effective

several advantages model based reasoning  obviously ability perform
minimal empirical data  even historical information available  misleading rely nonstationary environment  tournament setup tac naturally violates
stationarity  agent pool evolves time  selection well individual learning
development  course  dealing time variance  particularly multiagent environments 
active area current research  ultimately best methods combine elements
model based data based reasoning 
finally  suggest present study represents evidence research competitions
right circumstances produce knowledge insights beyond might emerge independent research efforts  hope additional researchers inspired bring innovative
ideas trading strategy next tac  look forward investigating results
