suppose procedure making inferences probabilistic knowledge
base  sensitive way knowledge represented  consider following
examples  use perhaps best known non deductive notion probabilistic inference 
maximum entropy  jaynes         
example      suppose information whatsoever regarding whether
object colorful  probability assign proposition colorful   symmetry
arguments might suggest      since information  seems object
likely colorful non colorful  conclusion reached
maximum entropy provided language proposition colorful  
suppose know colors red  blue  green  propositions corresponding
colors  moreover  colorful actually mean red blue green 
case  maximum entropy dictates probability red blue green      note that 
cases  conclusion follows constraints trivial one 
probability query somewhere     
example      suppose told half birds fly  two reasonable ways represent information  one propositions bird fly 
use knowledge base kb fly
   def  pr fly   bird           second might
basic predicates bird flying bird   use knowledge base kb fly
   def   flying bird

inference procedures it  paper attempt understand notion
representation dependence  study extent achievable 
study representation dependence  must first understand mean
representation  real world complex  reasoning process  must focus
certain details ignore others  semantic level  relevant distinctions captured
using space x possible alternatives states  possible worlds   example     
first representation focused single attribute colorful   case  two
states state space  corresponding colorful true false  respectively 
second representation  using red   blue  green  richer state space  clearly 
distinctions could make 
interpret representation syntactic entity  case  typically capture relevant distinctions using formal language  example  use propositional
logic basic knowledge representation language  choice primitive propositions
characterizes distinctions chosen make  take states
truth assignments propositions  similarly  use probabilistic representation language belief networks  pearl        knowledge representation
language  must choose set relevant random variables  states
possible assignments values variables 
mean shift representation  i e   state space  x another representation   roughly speaking  want capture level state space shift
from  say  feet meters  thus  x distances might described terms feet
might described terms meters  would expect constraint
relating feet meters  constraint would give extra information x 
would relate worlds x worlds   thus  first attempt capture representation independence somewhat indirectly  requiring adding constraints relating x
place constraints x result different conclusions x 
resulting notion  called robustness  turns surprisingly strong  show
every robust inference procedure must behave essentially logical entailment 
try define representation independence directly  using mapping f
one representation another  example  f could map world individual
  feet tall corresponding world individual      meters tall 
obvious constraints f necessary ensure corresponds intuition
representation shift  define representation independent inference procedure
one preserves inferences every legitimate mapping f   i e   kb  
kb   iff f  kb     f    
definition turns somewhat reasonable first attempt 
exist nontrivial representation independent inference procedures  however  still
strong notion  particular  representation independent inference procedure must
act essentially logical entailment knowledge base objective information
 i e   essentially non probabilistic information   moreover  show representation
independence incompatible even simplest default assumption independence 
even told nothing propositions p q  representation independence
allow us jump conclusion p q independent 
results suggest want inference procedures capable jumping
nontrivial conclusions  must accept least degree representation de

pendence  add support claim choice language carry great

positive note  show use intuition choice language
carries information get limited forms representation independence  idea
language put constraints counts appropriate representation
shift  example  suppose certain propositions represent colors others represent
birds  may willing transform colorful red blue green  may
willing transform red sparrow   reason demand inference procedure behave way suddenly shift wildly inappropriate representation 
symbols mean something completely different  provide general approach
constructing inference procedures invariant specific class representation
shifts  construction allows us combine degree representation independence
certain non deductive properties want inference procedure  particular  present inference method supports default assumption independence 
yet invariant natural class representation shifts

   probabilistic inference
begin defining probabilistic inference procedures  discussed introduction 
two quite different ways term used  one  given prior
distribution probability space  knowledge typically consists events
space  used condition distribution obtain posterior 
other  focus work  probabilistic inference procedure takes input
probabilistic knowledge base returns probabilistic conclusion 
take knowledge base conclusion assertions probabilities events measurable space  x  fx    measurable space consists
set x algebra fx subsets x  that is  fx set subsets x closed
union complementation  containing x itself    formally  assertions viewed
statements  or constraints on  probability measures  x  fx    example 
   x infinite  may want consider countably additive probability measures take fx
closed countable unions  issue play significant role paper  simplicity 
restrict finite additivity require fx closed finite unions

fx   statement pr s      holds distributions probability
least      therefore   x fx   set probability measures  x  fx    that
is  probability measures domain fx    view knowledge base set
constraints  x fx     fx clear context  often omit notation 
writing x rather  x fx    
place restrictions language used express constraints 
assume includes assertions form pr s  subsets fx rational
        closed conjunction negation  kb kb  
knowledge bases expressing constraints  kb kb   kb    however 
langauge could include many assertions besides obtained starting assertions
form pr s  closing conjunction negation   since language
puts constraints probability measures  cannot directly say fx must hold 
closest approximation language assertion pr s       thus  call
constraints objective  knowledge base consisting objective constraints called
objective knowledge base  since pr t        pr t        equivalent pr t  t        
without loss generality  objective knowledge base consists single constraint
form pr t        given knowledge base kb placing constraints x   write    kb
measure x satisfies constraints kb   use   kb   x denote
measures satisfying constraints 
practice  knowledge typically represented syntactically  using logical language describe possible states  typical languages include propositional logic  firstorder logic  language describing values set random variables  general 
base logic l defines set formulas l   given vocabulary   propositional
logic  vocabulary simply set propositional symbols  probability theory 
vocabulary consist set random variables  first order logic  vocabulary
set constant symbols  function symbols  predicate symbols  facilitate comparison
vocabularies  assume base logic vocabularies finite
subsets one fixed infinite vocabulary  
working language  assume state state space defines
interpretation symbols hence formulas l    case
propositional logic  thus assume associate state truth assignment
primitive propositions   first order logic  assume associate
state domain interpretation symbols   probabilistic
setting  assume associate state assignment values
random variables  often convenient assume state space fact
subset w w    set interpretations  or assignments to  vocabulary  
note truth formula l   determined state  true
state w  write w     
probabilistic extension lpr    base logic l   simply set probability
formulas l    formally  l    pr   numeric term  formulas
lpr    defined boolean combinations arithmetic expressions involving
numeric terms  example  pr fly   bird       formula lpr   fly  bird     where
interpret conditional probability expression pr      pr     pr

knowledge base  particular respect treatment irrelevant information 
consider knowledge base consisting constraint pr fly   bird        even
though know nothing suggest red relevant  entailment allow us
reach nontrivial conclusion pr fly   bird red
