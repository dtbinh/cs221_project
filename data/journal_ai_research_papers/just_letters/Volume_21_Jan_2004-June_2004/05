proportional commissions

 

however  current online brokers charge small proportional commissions  perhaps addition small flat commission rate trades    means large
investor scale investment suffer small proportional transaction rate 
additional caveat assumption trades could implemented using
closing price  principle nothing special closing price  i e 
algorithms trade time trading day  practical consideration related
dataset gathering availability dictated use prices    algorithms
    note blum kalai        showed performance guarantee universal still holds
 and gracefully degrades  case proportional commissions 
    example  usa site  e trade  https   us etrade com  offers flat fee     trade
     shares      share thereafter 
    specifically  historical closing prices public domain allow experimental reproducibility 
historical intraday trading quotes gathered data usually protected
costly obtain

assume portfolio adjustments implemented using quoted prices receive
inputs  means transactions implemented simultaneously using
quoted prices  current online brokers computerized system issue transaction
orders almost instantly guarantee implemented instantly 
trading friction necessarily generate discrepancies input prices
implementation prices 
related problem one must face actually trading difference
bid ask prices  bid ask spreads  and availability stocks buying
selling  functions stock liquidity typically small large market capitalization
stocks  consider large market cap stocks 
report abnormal returns using historical markets suspected data
snooping  particular  historical data sets conditioned fact
stocks traded every day bankrupcies stocks became
virtually worthless data sets  furthermore  dataset excessively
mined testing many strategies substantial chance one strategies
successful simple over fitting  another data snooping hazard stock selection

   concluding remarks
traditional work financial economics tend focus understanding stock price
determination  main question is  predict stock market  judging
extensive inconclusive work done financial forecasting  perhaps
beneficial question ask  rather  computer program consistently outperform
market  besides practicality  clear successful portfolio selection algorithm
mathematical model provide new intuition stock price formation 
example  case  algorithms suggest stock price fluctuations
sufficiently periodic anti correlated 
number well respected works report statistically robust abnormal returns
simple technical analysis heuristics  slightly beat market  example 
landmark study brock  lakonishok  lebaron        apply    simple trading
heuristics djia index           provide strong support technical
analysis heuristics  consistently beating market considered significant  if
impossible  challenge  approach portfolio selection indicates beating best
stock achievable goal  mainly focused idealized frictionless
setting  believe even frictionless setting  which seems reasonable
starting point  results previously claimed literature 
results presented raise various interesting questions  since simple statistical
relations correlation give rise outstanding returns plausible various
other  perhaps sophisticated machine learning techniques  give rise better

portfolio selection algorithms capable larger returns tolerating larger commissions

theoretical side  missing point time analytical model
better explains active trading strategies successful  regard 
investigating various statistical adversary models along lines suggested raghavan
       chou et al          namely  would show algorithm performs
well  relative benchmark  market sequence satisfies certain constraints
empirical statistics 
one final caveat needs mentioned  namely  entire theory portfolio selection
algorithms assumes one portfolio selection algorithm impact market
