   personalized conversational recommendation systems
research goals two fold  first  want improve interaction quality
recommendation systems utility results returned making user adaptive
conversational  second  want improve dialogue system performance means
personalization  such  goals user modeling differ commonly assumed
recommendation systems  improving accuracy related measures precision
recall  goals differ previous work user modeling dialogue
systems  haller   mcroy        kobsa   wahlster        carberry        kass        
emphasizes ability track users goals dialogue progresses 
typically maintain models across multiple conversations 
hypothesis improvements efficiency effectiveness achieved
using unobtrusively obtained user model help direct systems conversational search
items recommend  approach assumes large database items
choose  reasonably large number attributes needed describe
items  simpler techniques might suffice situations database small
items easy describe 
    personalization
personalized user adaptive systems obtain preferences interactions users 
keep summaries preferences user model  utilize model generate
customized information behavior  goal customization increase

user models stored personalized systems represent stereotypical users  chin 
      rich        individuals  hand crafted learned  e g   questionnaires  ratings  usage traces   contain information behavior

fithompson  goker    langley

decision made learn models  another design decision relates method
system collects preferences subsequent input learning algorithm s  
distinguish two approaches  direct feedback approach places
burden user soliciting preference information directly  example  system
might ask user complete form asks classify weight interests using
variety categories item characteristics  recent study  mcnee  lam  konstan 
  riedl        showed forcing user provide ratings items  movies 
case  choose  rather system chooses  actually lead
better accuracy rates better user loyalty  however  users irritated need
complete long questionnaires even begin enjoy given service 
study context dialogue system involved simpler interaction 
another  slightly less obtrusive  form direct feedback encourages user provide
feedback continues use particular service 
second approach acquiring user models  one taken adaptive
place advisor  infer user preferences unobtrusively  examining normal online behavior  fiechter   rogers        rafter  bradley    smyth         feel unobtrusive
collection preferences advantageous  requires less effort user  also  users
often cannot articulate preferences clearly learn domain 
possible disadvantage unobtrusive approaches users may trust understand
systems actions change one interaction next  could
addressed letting user view modify user model  kay   thomas        
systems typically take one two approaches preference determination  contentbased methods recommend items similar ones user liked past  segal  
kephart        pazzani  muramatsu    billsus        lang         contrast  collaborative
methods select recommend items users similar current user liked

maltz  herlocker  gordon    riedl        shardanand   maes         collaborative
filtering bases recommendations previous selections users  suitable
new one off items users uncommon preferences  content based approach 
hand  uses item description recommendation  therefore
prone problems  however  content based techniques tend prefer attribute
values users preferred past  though allow new combinations

fipersonalized conversational recommendation

    conversational recommendation
goal recommendation systems help users find items interest  thus
must eliminate choices consideration keeping others  achieve this 
must either know determine interests current user  present items
satisfy interests 
one widely used approaches information acquisition recommendation
systems use simple form  usually single query box  user fills in  coupled
this  common presentation format ranked list approach  scheme 
system presents usually long list results  ordered predicted relevance
user  combined technique information acquisition form presentation
list originated information retrieval  used help find documents
reports library research  basic method  refer ranked list
approach  general  however  underlies simpler search engines
world wide web  used regularly many different selection tasks 
contrast  adaptive place advisor supports conversations mode
interaction  approach  one conversational participant  call inquirer 
asks second participant  call advisor  assistance selecting item 
example  inquirer deciding restaurant dinner  conversation
may proceed follows 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
   
   
   
   

inquirer  think eat tonight 
advisor  type food would like 
inquirer  types there 
advisor  say things chinese  indian  mediterranean 
inquirer  oh  maybe cheap indian place 
advisor  kind parking would like 
inquirer  dont care  long palo alto 
advisor  im sorry  dont know restaurants that  would search
price 
inquirer  no  think id chinese instead 
advisor  mandarin gourmet     ramona sound  
inquirer  no  else have 
advisor  jing jing szechwan hunan gourmet     emerson street 
inquirer  sure  sounds fine 

refer systems mimic approach recommendation conversational
recommendation systems 
interaction supported conversational recommendation systems quite different
found ranked list approach  important distinction
interaction takes form sequence questions  designed eliminate items
consideration  answering questions plays similar role giving keywords
form  aim remove alternatives rather rank results list 
   system support exact sample dialogue  example  point conversation
displays information restaurant screen asks one sound 
similar question 

   

fithompson  goker    langley

conversational process help inquirer better understand desires  since
thinking possible questions answers may clarify goals ways keyword entry
encourage  addition  conversation support user variability letting
user control item attribute choices conversation  finally  inquirer never
hears complete item choices remain  avoids presenting
long list items lets user narrow choices iterative  manageable
fashion 
dialogues seem better recommendations must delivered speech rather
visually  example engaged inquirer driving  seem
ideal  independent modality  tasks destination selection help desk support
 goker   roth berghofer        aha   breslow         user needs converge
items  hand  keyword entry ranked list methods seem
appropriate situations user prefers provide requirements once 
situations information presented visually  situations user
may want examine many options 
eliminating options  conversational recommendation systems ultimately direct
users suitable solution  however  conversation become tiring quality
first result returned may acceptable user  interactions
friend knows concerns directed produce better results
stranger  dialogues conversational advisor become efficient
effective time  goals user modeling include improvement subjective
quality effectiveness results  found items  conversation leads
results  example  several conversations inquirer above  new
interaction may proceed follows  question parking eliminated
item presentation order changed

engine  interacts database retrieve items  any  satisfy currently agreed upon constraints  module interacts query determine
similar items users preferences determine best ordering
attributes constraining relaxing  appropriate  types interactions
user model support goal quickly narrowing search satisfactory item 
similar way human advisor bases assumptions regarding inquirer
previous interactions  system uses cumulative experience  reflected user model 
basis computation  retrieval engine represents users preferences
requirements expanded query  partial  probabilistic item specification determined
conversation user model  query initialized user model 
thus contains preference based probabilities attributes values user
yet explicitly specified along users item preferences  course
conversation  system updates query reflect values user specifies 
attribute  sets probability value agreed upon conversation     
probabilities zero  example  user says chinese italian 
system sets value probabilities chinese italian      cuisine
probabilities zero  equivalent disjunction probabilistic queries  one

first main aspect retrieval engine personalized item ranking
technique  unlike typical case based similarity computation  retrieves items beyond
match query exactly  computation used system restricts retrieved
items desirable user  system filters items included
current case base according characteristics explicitly specified user sorts
remaining items according similarity items user liked past 
thus  engine first queries database retrieve items match current
constraints exactly   then  place advisor uses probability distributions

system calculates similarity item  compares items similarity constant

second main personalized aspect retrieval engine ranking attributes
under  over constrained situations  helps assure user likely
respond informatively systems questions under constrained situations 
allow suggested attribute relaxed over constrained situations 
situations  one option order attributes randomly  technique used
simple dialogue systems  another option use conditional entropy measure select
attributes  see section       third rank attributes order desirability
user  reflected user model  take option 
addition using long term user model rank attributes  system uses
attribute weights reflected query  see see later querys
attribute weights  initialized user model  influenced conversation  over constrained situation  attribute ranking order highest lowest 
under constrained situation  reverse   using attribute weights rather
conditional entropy avoids pitfalls arise continuously changing value
distribution data  new restaurants  restaurants going business  etc   
affect attribute rankings  users may confused resulting variability 
even worse  would reflect users preferences  further  every question
high information gain high relevance user selecting destination  e g   parking
options may high score asked user decided
cuisine location  
summary  user model influences item retrieval  item ranking  attribute ranking  turn influence systems utterances conversation 
    conversing user
converses user  dialogue manager uses results retrieval engines
functions  system uses frame containing simple list constraints support
interactive constraint satisfaction search  see jurafsky et al       dowding et al      
similar formulation   usual type system  user respond
system request fill constraint ignoring attribute specifying value
   cbr systems necessarily use weighting factors similarity computation
question ordering  however  application area  correct make assumption
attributes importance impact similarity computation

basic approach unobtrusively derive user preferences  thus  system
introduce unnecessary interactions  learns interactions needed support
item recommendation  describe system gathers item  attribute  value

three circumstances chose user model update     users
accept speech acts suggest relax situation      users accept speech

recommend item speech act system  first  assume user accepts
item  indicating      preference item itself      preferences attributes

appropriate item  attributes  values increased  item preference 
system simply adds one presentation acceptance counts  attribute
value preferences  system increases probability appropriate weight small
amount proportional current weight  renormalizes weights  thus attribute
value preferences biased measures avoid zero counts values user

item  since user specified characteristics  therefore  rejected
items system simply adds one presentation count 
third situation system updates user model when  query

relaxation  situation  assume that  matching item 
user would satisfied it  since characteristics specified conversation
far satisfactory  therefore  relaxation occurs  system increases
