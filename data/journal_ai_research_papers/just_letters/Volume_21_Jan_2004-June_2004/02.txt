abstract
this paper discusses an interested party who wishes to inuence the behavior of agents
in a game  multi agent interaction   which is not under his control  the interested party
cannot design a new game  cannot enforce agents behavior  cannot enforce payments by the
agents  and cannot prohibit strategies available to the agents  however  he can inuence
the outcome of the game by committing to non negative monetary transfers for the dierent
strategy proles that may be selected by the agents  the interested party assumes that
agents are rational in the commonly agreed sense that they do not use dominated strategies 
hence  a certain subset of outcomes is implemented in a given game if by adding nonnegative payments  rational players will necessarily produce an outcome in this subset 
obviously  by making suciently big payments one can implement any desirable outcome 
the question is what is the cost of implementation  in this paper we introduce the notion
of k implementation of a desired set of strategy proles  where k stands for the amount of
payment that need to be actually made in order to implement desirable outcomes  a major
point in k implementation is that monetary oers need not necessarily materialize when
following desired behaviors  we dene and study k implementation in the contexts of games
with complete and incomplete information  in the latter case we mainly focus on the vcg
games  our setting is later extended to deal with mixed strategies using correlation devices 
together  the paper introduces and studies the implementation of desirable outcomes by
a reliable party who cannot modify game rules  i e  provide protocols   complementing
previous work in mechanism design  while making it more applicable to many realistic cs
settings 

   introduction
the design and analysis of interactions of self interested parties are central to the theory and
application of multi agent systems  in particular  the theory of economic mechanism design
or  more generally  implementation theory  maskin        maskin   sjostrom        has
become a standard tool for researchers in the areas of multi agent systems and e commerce

a center denes an interaction for self motivated parties that will allow it to obtain some
desired goal  such as maximizing revenue or social welfare  taking the agents incentives

into account  this perspective has been largely motivated by the view of the center as a
government or a seller that can dene and control the rules of interaction  however  in
many distributed systems and multi agent interactions  interested parties cannot control
the rules of interactions  a network manager for example cannot simply change the communication protocols in a given distributed systems in order to lead to desired behaviors 
and a broker cannot change the rules in which goods are sold by an agency auctioneer to the
public  the focus of this paper is on how a reliable interested party  which cannot change
the rules of interaction  and cannot enforce behavior  can obtain its desired goals  in service
of the community or for its own benets   the reliable party has only one source of power 
its reliability  it can commit to payments to the dierent agents  when certain observable
outcomes will be reached  and the agents can be sure that they will be paid appropriately 
in our work we introduce the study of implementation of desired behaviors by interested
party as above   there are two major issues that make the task non trivial and challenging 
   the interested party may wish to assume as little as possible about agents rationality 
ideally  all that will be assumed is that an agent does not adopt a strategy if it is dominated
by another strategy 
   the interested party may wish to minimize its expenses 
consider the following simple congestion setting   assume that there are two agents 
  and    that have to select among two service providers  e g   machines  communication
lines  etc   one of the service providers  f   is a fast one  while the other  s  is a slower one 
we capture this by having an agent obtaining a payo of   when he is the only one that
uses f   and a payo of   when he is the only one who uses s  if both agents select the same
service provider then its speed of operation decreases by a factor of    leading to half the
payo  that is  if both agents use f then each one of them obtains a payo of    while if
both agents use s then each one of them obtains    in a matrix form  this game is described
by the following bimatrix 

f

s

   for another interesting use of an interested party see naor  pinkas  and sumner        
   congestion in the context of self motivated parties is a central topic in the recent cs literature  koutsoupias   papadimitriou        roughgarden        roughgarden   tardos         as well as in the
game theory literature  rosenthal        monderer   shapley         this example is used for purposes
of illustration only  however  the technique used in this example can be extended to arbitrary complex
games  as we will later show

assume that our reliable interested party may wish to prevent the agents from using the
same service provider  leading to low payos for both   then it can do as follows  it can
promise to pay agent   a value of    if both agents will use f   and promise to pay agent  
a value of    if both agents will use s  these promises transform m to the following game 

f

s

  

 

f
 

m  
 

 
 

s
 

  

notice that in m    strategy f is dominant for agent    and strategy s is dominant for
agent    as a result the only rational strategy prole is the one in which agent   chooses f
and agent   chooses s  hence  the interested party implements one of the desired outcomes 
moreover  given that the strategy prole  f  s  is selected the interested party will have to
pay nothing  it has just implemented  in dominant strategies  a desired behavior  obtained
in one of the nash equilibria  with zero cost  relying only on its creditability  without
modifying the rules of interactions or enforcing any type of behavior 
similar simple examples can be found in other contexts  see e g   segal         footnote
    and dybvig and spatt         spiegler          our work advocates the following line
of thought  instead of reasoning about how agents will behave in the given protocol  we
may wish to cause agents to follow particular behaviors by making them desirable  using
monetary oers  an important point is that the monetary oers need not necessarily be
fully materialized when agents follow the desired behavior 
more formally  in this paper we introduce the notion and study of k implementation
of a desired set of strategy proles  where k stands for the amount of payment that need
to be actually made in order to implement the desirable outcomes   section   provides
a characterization of k implementation of a single pure strategy prole for nite games
and innite regular games with complete information  this provides an eective algorithm
for determining the optimal monetary oers to be made in order to implement a desired
outcome  while minimizing expenses  in section   we address the problem of nding a kimplementation of a set of strategy proles  we show that the general problem in this regard
   notice that this perspective is in the spirit of work on articial social systems in ai  see e g   shoham
and tennenholtz          where we search for some form of modication to the system  such that
given the modied system  and assuming agents tend to work individually  a desirable outcome will be
obtained 

  

fimonderer   tennenholtz

is np hard  and consider a modication of k implementation  titled exact implementation 
under which the problem becomes tractable  
games with incomplete information introduce further challenges  in particular  in section   we consider the vcg mechanisms for combinatorial auctions     this setting has
interesting characteristics since the interested party cannot in general see the agents types
and needs to decide on appropriate payment only based on observed behaviors  we show
that in general   implementation  i e  implementation with zero cost  in settings with incomplete information is impossible  but any ex post equilibrium of a frugal vcg mechanism
is   implementable 
in section   we study the important case of mixed strategies  in that context  unless
we assume algorithmic observability  the interested party can observe only the actions selected and not the probabilistic process leading to the selection  and therefore our earlier
results do not apply  for example  consider the simple routing problem above  one may
wish to consider the implementation of a more fair outcome  such as the one obtained
in the mixed strategy nash equilibrium of the game m   in order to address this issue  we
introduce the concept of implementation devices  and show that any mixed strategy equilibrium is   implementable with an implementation device  we also show that any correlated
equilibrium has this property 

   k implementation
a pre game in strategic form is a pair g    n  x   where n               n  is the set of
players  x   x   x      xn   where for every i  xi is the set of strategies available to
player i  let i be a player  the set of strategy proles of all other players is denoted by xi  
and a generic element in xi is denoted by xi  
a payo function vector is an n tuple u    u    u         un    where ui   x   is the
payo function of player i  we assume that the payos of the players are represented by
some common monetary unit  and that the payo functions are bounded   
a pre game g and a payo function vector u denes a game in strategic form denoted
by g u    the game g u   is nite if the strategy sets are nite 
let xi   yi be strategies of player i in the game g u   
xi dominates yi if ui  xi   xi    ui  yi   xi   for every xi  xi   and there exists xi 
xi for which a strict inequality holds  yi is a dominated strategy if it is dominated by some
other strategy of i  xi is a dominant strategy for i if it dominates every other strategy of i 
a prole of strategies x is a  nash  equilibrium if for every player i  xi is a best response
   complexity of implementation when the organizer controls the structure of the game is discussed by
conitzer and sandholm        
   the vcg mechanisms  vickrey        clarke        groves        have been widely discussed in the
context of combinatorial auctions  a topic which received much attention in the recent multi agent
systems and e commerce literature  e g    nisan        sandholm  suri  gilpin    levine        parkes

that is  if every player i believes that all other players act according to x  he is better o
by playing according to x  modern economic theory has made an  some times implicit 
assumption that economic interactions are in equilibrium  however  the rationale for this
assumption is in debate in many cases  and it is particulary so when there exist multiple
equilibrium proles  in contrast  using a non dominated strategy is a rational behavior in
any reasonable denition of rationality  moreover  refraining from the use of dominated
strategies is taken as the most basic idea and agreed upon technique in decision theory 
let g    n  x  be a pre game  for every vector of payo functions v   let xi  v  
be the set of non dominated strategies of i in the game g v    and let x v     x   v   
x   v         xn  v    g v   is the game  n  x  v    where  by an innocent abuse of notations
v denotes the vector of the payo functions restricted to x  a vector v of payo functions
is non negative  v     if vi  x     for every player i and for every x  x 
consider a set of desired strategy proles o  x in the game g u    a non negative
vector of payo functions v implements o in g u   if
   x u   v    o 
such a v is called a k implementation of o in g u    if in addition

i   vi  x 

 k for every x  x u   v   

obviously  by paying every player i sucient amount of money for playing the strategy
associated with a particular strategy prole in o  one can implement o 
that is  the interested party commits herself to certain non negative payos v   in such
a way that rational players will only choose strategy proles in o  and such that in the
worst case the interested party will have to pay at most k 
note that implicitly we have made two important assumptions  
 output observability  the interested party can observe the actions chosen by the
players 
 commitment power  the interested party is reliable in the sense that the players
believe that she will indeed pay the additional payo dened by v  
however  the requirement v    means that the interested party cannot force players
to make payments based on their actions  in addition  the interested party cannot modify
the set of available strategies  or enforce behavior in any way  he can just reliably promise
positive monetary transfers conditioned on the observed outcome 
let k o  be the price of implementing o  that is  k o  is the greatest lower bound
 glb  of all non negative numbers q for which there exists a q  implementation  that is

   k implementation of singletons
when o is a singleton  that is o    z   we sometimes abuse notations and we will say
that z  instead of  z   has a k implementation in g u    and we refer to k z  as the price
of implementing z 
    finite games
in this section we focus on nite games  and on the characterization of optimal k implementation of singletons 
theorem   let g u   be a nite game with at least two strategies to every player  every
strategy prole z has an optimal implementation v   and moreover

proof   let z  x and let v implements z  let i  n   if for some xi    zi   for some
xi   vi  xi   xi        then one can modify vi by changing this term to    and get a cheaper
implementation of z  hence  we can assume without loss of generality that we deal with
payo function vectors v for which  for every i  vi  xi         for every xi    zi  
as zi is a dominant strategy for i in g u   v   
vi  zi   xi   ui  zi   xi    vi  xi   xi   ui  xi   xi  

for every xi  xi   and for every xi  xi  

since for xi    zi   vi  xi          a necessary condition for an implementation is
vi  zi   xi     ui  zi   xi    ui  xi   xi  

for every xi  xi  

that is 
vi  zi   xi    max  ui  xi   xi    ui  zi   xi    
xi xi

  

fik implementation

one can use xi    zi in order to get a costless strict inequality required by the denition
of domination   here we use our assumption that every player has at least two strategies  
hence  an optimal implementation vector for z  v is dened for every i by  vi  xi         for
xi    zi   and vi  zi   xi     maxxi xi  ui  xi   zi    ui  zi   zi       xi    where    xi  
is a nonnegative function that satises  zi        and for some xi    zi    xi       
therefore         is satised  
note that z is in equilibrium if and only if for every player i  maxxi xi  ui  xi   zi   
ui  zi   zi         hence the following characterization of equilibrium is a corollary of theorem   
corollary   let g u   be a nite game with at least two strategies to every player  and let
z  x  z is in equilibrium if and only if z has a zero  implementation 
    innite games
when the game g u   is innite  one can get phenomena that contradicts our intuition  for
example  it is possible that xi    zi   but zi is not a dominant strategy  e g   consider the
two person game in which player   can choose the strategy z    or any number     x      
and player   can choose z  or x    u   z    z           u   z    x          u   x        x    u  is
an arbitrary function  it is easily seen that every x  is dominated by a bigger number in
the open interval        z  is not dominated  and hence x     z     however  z  does not
dominate x  for x         moreover  the max operator used in the proofs of theorem   and
  may not be well dened for innite games  a game g u      n  x  u   is called regular if
every xi is a compact metric space  and the payo functions are continuous on x endowed
with the product metric 
theorem   theorems   holds for regular games 
proof   the proof requires very standard techniques  and therefore it is omitted 
we then immediately get 
corollary   corollary   holds for regular games 
    mixed strategies
for every nite set b we denote by  b  the set of
probability distributions over b  that is 
 b  consists of all functions q   b         with bb q b       let g u      n  x  u   be
a nite game  the mixed extension of g u   is the innite game gm  u m      n  x m   u m   
where x m    x      x          xn    and for every player i  uim  p    p         pn

xx p   x   p   x       pn  xn  ui  x   that is  ui  p  is the expected payo of player i when
every player j  including i  is choosing his strategy   independently of the other players 
with a randomizing device that chooses each strategy xj with probability pj  xj   
a prole of mixed strategies p  x m is called a mixed strategy equilibrium in g u   if
p is in equilibrium in the game gm  u m    by nash        every nite game possesses a
  

fimonderer   tennenholtz

mixed strategy equilibrium  note that every strategy xi  xi of i can be identied with
the mixed strategy in which i chooses xi with probability    in this sense  xi is a subset of
xim   when we deal with an environment in which mixed strategies are considered  we refer
to every strategy xi  xi as a pure strategy of i 
note that the possibility of using mixed strategies does not destroy our previous results 
that is  if xi is a dominant  dominated  strategy in g u    it continues to be a dominant
 dominated  strategy in gm  u m   
as gm  u m   is a regular game we can apply theorem   corollary   and deduce 
theorem   let g u   be a nite game in strategic form with at least two strategies for every
player  let p be a prole of mixed strategies in g u    p is a mixed strategy equilibrium in
g u   if and only if p has a   implementation in gm  u m   
hence  technically  the case of mixed strategies follows from the theorems regarding pure
strategies in innite games  however  the reader should notice that in this case our output
observability assumption has a strong implication  implementing a mixed strategy prole in
gm  u m   actually means algorithm observability in g u    that is  the interested party can
observe the mixed strategies used by the players  this is a realistic assumption if we think
about the interested party as a systems administrator that deploys algorithms submitted
by users  the designer is not allowed to alter the users algorithms  but can verify the exact
content of these algorithms  hence  for example  in such a setting  if a users algorithm
ips a coin in order to decide on its course of action  then the exact randomized algorithms 
including the particular coin ipping  can be viewed by the interested party  the interesting
case in which the interested party cannot observe the mixed strategies will be discussed in
section   

   k implementation of sets
in the previous sections we dealt with some properties of k  implementation  in particular
we emphasized the interesting cases of k implementations of singletons  however  from a
computational perspective  given a game g u    and a set of desired strategy prole o  it
may be of interest to nd the smallest integer k    for which a k  implementation exists 
we can show 
theorem   given a game g u    a set of desired strategy proles o  and an integer k    
deciding whether there exists a k implementation of o in g u   is np hard 
proof   in order to prove the above theorem  we use a reduction from the sat problem 
given a set of primitive propositions  x    x            xn    consider a cnf formula  a cnf
formula is a conjunction of clauses c   c          cm   where ci   l i  li          lisi  si    
and where ljq   xi or ljq   xi for some i  for every    j  m and    q  sj    the sat
problem is the following decision problem  given a cnf formula  is there a truth assignment
to the primitive propositions that satises it  this problem is known to be np complete 
  

fik implementation

we will now show a polynomial reduction from sat to the problem of deciding whether a
   implementation exists  where the games are   person games  this will suce to prove
our result  without loss of generality we restrict our attention to cnf formulas where both
xi and xi appear in the formula  and no clause refers to both xi and xi     i  n  
both agents will have a strategy ci associated with clause ci   for every    i  m 
in addition  both agents will have strategies yi   zi   associated with the literals xi and xi  
respectively     i  n  
the payo of agent    p    will be dened as follows  for any strategy prole of the form
 ci   yj   the payo will be   if xj appears in clause i and   otherwise  for any strategy prole
of the form  ci   zj   the payo will be   if xj appears in clause i and   otherwise  for any
strategy prole of the form  ci   cj   the payo will be    if i   j and   otherwise  for any
strategy prole of the form  yi   yj   the payo will be   if i   j and   otherwise  for any
strategy prole of the form  zi   zj   the payo will be   if i   j and   otherwise  for any
strategy prole of the form  yi   zj   or the form  zi   yj   the payo will be   if i   j and  
otherwise  for any strategy prole of the form  yi   cj   the payo will be    if xi or xi
appear in clause cj and   otherwise  for any strategy prole of the form  zi   cj   the payo
will be    if xi or xi appears in clause cj and   otherwise 
the payo to agent    p    will be as follows  the payo for any strategy prole of the
form  yi   yi   or  zi   zi   will be      the payo for any strategy prole of the form  yi   zi   or
 zi   yi   will be      the payo for any strategy prole of the form  yi   zj   or  zi   yj   where
i    j will be    the payo for any strategy prole of the form  ci   cj   will be    if i   j 
and   otherwise  for any strategy prole of the form  yi   cj     zi   cj   the payo will be    if
i   j and   otherwise  the payo for any strategy prole of the form  ci   yj     ci   zj   will be
  
the set o of desired strategy proles will include all strategy proles excluding the
following  all strategy proles of the form  ci   s   yi   zi    zi   yi    where s is any strategy 
will be prohibited 
if the formula is satisable then there is    implementation  add   to the payo obtained
by agent   in any strategy prole of the form  yi   s  if xi is true in the satisfying assignment 
and add   to the payo obtained by agent   in any strategy prole of the form  zi   s  if xi it
false  as for agent    increase its payo by   for  zi   yi   if xi is true  and increase its payo
by   for  yi   zi   if xi is false 
notice that given the above construction the strategies of the form ci of agent   will
become dominated and will be removed  in addition  if xi has been assigned true  resp 
false  then strategy zi  resp  yi   will become dominated  the corresponding strategies of
agent    i e  zi if xi is true and yi if xi is false  will become dominated too  which yield the
desired behavior 
similarly  notice that since we must remain with at least one yi or zi for agent    it
must be the case that at least one yi or zi will be removed for agent    and that this cannot
be obtained with a payment of    increasing the payo from     to       hence  in a  implementation the payment of agent   should be    however  notice that we must add  
to the payo of agent   for at least one of the elements of the form  yi   yi   or  zi   zi   which
  

fimonderer   tennenholtz

correspond to an xi or xi that appear in clause j  i e  for at least one of the literals in
clause j  we need to add   to a strategy prole of the form  yi   yi   or  zi   zi   associated with
that literal   notice that this is based on the fact that the strategy ci of agent i cannot
be removed by adding a payment of   to the outcome of any strategy of the form yj   zj   cj
of agent    where xj and xj do not appear in ci   since the payo of agent   for  yj   ci  
and for  zj   ci   is    while the payo of agent   for  ci   ci   is     moreover  if we add   to
the payo that agent   obtains for both  yi   yi   and  zi   zi   then both yi and zi will not be
dominated for agent    which will result in the possibility of playing a strategy prole which
is not desired given that it is impossible to remove both yi and zi for agent     hence  the
implementation corresponds to a sound truth assignment to the cnf formula  where xi is
assigned true i the payo for agent   at  yi   yi   has been augmented by   

notice that the previous result applies already in the case where we have a constant
number of agents  the previous result suggests one may wish to consider relaxations of the
optimal implementation problem that will be tractable   one interesting relaxation  is the
following one 
a non negative vector of payo functions v is called a k  exact implementation of o in
g u    if the following two conditions are satised 
 x u   v     o 
n

i   vi  x   k for every x  o 
hence  v implements o means that the set of non dominated strategies in g u   v   is a
subset of o  while v is an exact implementation of o if this set equals o  when dealing
with singletons the concepts of implementation and exact implementation coincide 
notice that the concept of exact implementation makes sense only when o   o  
o      on  x   x   x      xn since otherwise it will be impossible to  exactly 
implement o  we also assume that oi is strictly contained in xi for every agent i  and that
oi does not contain two strategies such that one dominates the other  we can show 
theorem   computing the optimal k for which an exact implementation exists is polynomial 
the algorithm leading to the above result is now illustrated for the case of two agents 
we construct the game matrix g   where the payo function of agent i is denoted by pi  
pi describes the payment to agent i for the dierent strategy proles  if when selected  
the matrix g will be the matrix of perturbations  non negative monetary promises   while
g will denote the perturbed matrix generated  let m   k     where k is the maximal
element in the original game matrix 
the optimal perturbation  op  algorithm 
   another approach may be to search for good approximation techniques

   incomplete information
in previous sections we dealt with games with complete information  however  in many
real life situations the players   and the interested party  have incomplete information
about certain parameters of the game  in the economic literature this phenomenon has
been mainly modelled by a bayesian setting  in this setting every player receives some
private signal  which is correlated with the unknown parameters  and the joint distribution
of signals is commonly known to all players  and to the interested party   in the following
subsection we deal with bayesian games without probabilistic information  such games are
called games in informational form 
    games in informational form
the precise denition of games in informational form will not be given in this paper  in
which we focus on a particular type of such games  combinatorial auctions  however  a
typical example is shown in figure

in this game  player   is about to receive one of the signals s  or t    and player   is
about to receive one of the signals     s  or t    the true game to be played is determined by
the pair  c    d     where c  d   s  t   however  neither player knows the exact game  given

a strategy of a player is a function dened on the set of signals  which assigns to every
signal an action   in the games that are consistent with this signal  for example  in the game
in figure    a strategy of player   is a function b     s    t      u    d    u    d     with the
property that b   s      u    d    and b   t      u    d     a strategy of player   is analogously
dened as a function b     s    t      l    r    l    r     the concepts of domination and of
equilibrium   traditionally referred to as ex post equilibrium  are naturally dened  for
example  in figure   the strategy of player   in which she chooses u  when she receives the
signal s    and she chooses d  given t  dominates each of the other four strategies of player

note that even under the output observability assumption a player does not have to
reveal her strategy  the signal of a player is her private knowledge  and she reveals only
the action she chooses  the interested party does not observe the signals  therefore  if the
action sets in all games are the same   as is the case in figure    the interested party does
not receive any information about the true game to be played  hence  the only thing he
can do is to use the same vector v at all games  therefore 
claim for every k    it is impossible to k implement the ex post equilibrium described
in figure

structure  our results for the complete information case are generalized 
    the vcg combinatorial auctions
combinatorial auctions constitute a special class of games in informational form  our
notations and denitions are taken from holzman and monderer        
in a combinatorial auction there is a seller  denoted by    who wishes to sell a set of m
goods a    a            am    m     that she owns  we denote by  a the family of all bundles
of goods  i e   subsets of a   there is a set of n buyers n               n   n     an allocation
of the goods is an ordered partition                     n   of a    we denote by  the set of
all allocations 
    note that the goods are allocated among the buyers and the seller  we assume  however  that the seller
derives no utility from keeping any of the goods  and that she does not set strategic reserve prices

this has the eect of pretending that the agent cares only about bundles in i  for which
he announces his true valuation   and derives his valuation for other bundles by maximizing
over the bundles in i that they contain

    in classical mechanism design the second condition is not required  we use it here for the sake of
consistency with the rest of this paper 
    this is one of the reasons to the fact that the concept of ex post equilibrium in the vcg auction
mechanisms with private values has largely been ignored in the economics literature  however  the truth
telling strategy is induces a high communication complexity  it requires each player to communicate  m
numbers  hence  from the computer science perspective  an ex post equilibrium with less communication
complexity is desirable  the tradeo between communication complexity and economic eciency is
discussed by holzman  kr dahav  monderer  and tennenholtz

      implementation of ex post equilibrium in frugal vcg auction
mechanisms
we begin with a formal denition of a frugal vcg combinatorial auction 
denition of frugal vcg mechanisms a vcg mechanism  d  h  is called frugal if d
    
does not allocate unnecessary goods to the buyers  that is  for every v
v            vn    v n

the mechanism selects an allocation d

v           dn  
v      which is optimal for v
and satises in addition 
 for every player i  and for every bi  i  
vi  bi     vi  i   
where i   di  
v  
intuitively  in a frugal vcg mechanism the center never allocates unnecessary goods 
if an agent has a bid for a bundle b  and the same bid for a superset of it  b    the center
will never allocate b  to that agent  the bid for b  should be strictly higher than the bid
for b  in order that allocating b  to that agent will be a possibility  
consider an interested party who wishes to   implement the ex post equilibrium b  
 b    b         bn   in the vcg auction mechanism  d  h   given the result by holzman and
monderer        stated at the end of the previous subsection we can assume almost without
loss of generality that bi   f  for every i  n   the interested party wishes to promise a
positive payment to every buyer i whenever he follows the recommendation to play according
to bi   and at least one of the players  say j  does not play according to bj   however  the
interested party does not know the valuation functions  hence  how could she know whether
a player follows the recommendation  indeed she cannot  however  since  is known to the
interested party she can partially monitor the players strategies  because  independently of
a players valuation function his reported valuation function must be  based  hence  the
best the interested party can do is to oer every player i a positive payment if his reported
valuation is  based  and at least one of the other players reported a valuation function 
which is not  based  these payments can be made arbitrarily high so that reporting a
 based valuation function will yield a higher payo for i than any other  non  based
valuation function if at least one of the other players does not report a  based valuation
function  however  player i can cheat within the set of  based valuations without being
caught  it turns out that when the vcg mechanism is frugal  every player is better o not
cheating

i
every prole of reported valuations of the other players  v

proof   without loss of generality we can assume that hj is constantly   for every j 
hence  the vcg mechanism is actually a vc mechanism  if vj is  based for every j  j    i 
the inequality follows from the fact that f  induces an ex post equilibrium  however  our
i   be the allocation chosen by the auctioneer
proof does not use this fact  let    d vi   v


when i reports vi   and let    d wi   vi    denote

vj  j   
t   max


j i

as the vcg mechanism is frugal  we have that i   and i    therefore we have
i    
that vi  i     vi  i    and vi  i     vi  i    by denition we have that ui  vi   vi   v



i      t  now since vi  i     vi  i   we have that ui  vi   vi   v
i     s vi   v
i      t 
s vi   v
i      t  s vi   v
i      t  however  since
by the optimality of  we get that s vi   v
frugality also implies that vi  i     vi  i    we get the following equation and the desired
inequality 
i      t   s vi   v
i      t   ui  vi   wi   v
i   
s vi   v
 
hence  in the proof of lemma   we used the fact that a frugal vcg mechanism must
allocate a subset of goods in  to every player who reports a  based valuation function 
the next example shows that lemma   does not hold for an arbitrary vcg mechanism 
example
there are two buyers and four goods a b c d 
      ab  cd  abcd  
the valuation function of   is v    and the reported valuation of   is v    consider a vc
auction mechanism that allocate ab to   and cd to   when   reports v    and it allocates abc
to    and d to    when   reports the  based valuation function w    in both cases   pays
   hence  reporting v  yields a utility of    while cheating yields      note that the vc
mechanism is not frugal because when   declares w  he receives abc  and w   ab    w   abc

 d  h  in which  the set of feasible valuation functions   and the set of bids  is v  m    which
is the set of all valuation functions v satisfying v a    m   the assumption of an upper
bound is natural but not common in the literature of mechanism design  it can be veried
that lemma   holds for a vcg combinatorial auctions with bounded valuation functions

   implementation devices
as we mentioned in section    the proof of our result  theorem    that every mixed strategy
equilibrium is   implementable relies on the assumption that the interested party observes
the mixed strategies used by the players  in this section we prove this result without this
assumption  that is  the interested party can observe only the actions generated by the
mixed strategies  but not the algorithms that generate them  in order to deal with this
issue we dene a new type of implementation by an implementation device 
let g u      n  x  u   be a nite game in strategic form  an implementation device
for g u   is a tuple i    s  h  v    where s   s   s      sn   h   s  is a probability
distribution over s  and v   s  x  n    si is the nite   set of signals that can be sent to
i  the interested party uses the implementation device i as follows  she makes the device
public  she secretly runs a randomizing scheme that chooses every s  s with a probability
h s   if s    s    s         sn   is chosen  she sends player i the signal si   if the strategy prole
x is selected then agent i is paid vi  s  x   the implementation device generates a new game
g u  i   this is actually a bayesian game  a strategy for i in this game is a function
bi   si  xi   for every si and xi   and a vector bi of the other players let wi  xi  si   bi   be
the expected payo of i in the game g u  i  if it chooses xi given that it receives the signal
si and all other players use bi   that is 
wi  xi  si   bi     esi  ui  xi   bi  si      vi  si   si   xi   bi  si   si    
where si    sj  j i   and bi  si      bj  sj   j i   a strategy
 bi is a dominant strategy for i
if for every signal si with a positive probability   that is ts ti  si h t        and for every
bi
wi  bi  si   si   bi    wi  xi  si   bi   for every xi  xi  
and there exists a prole bi of the other players for which a strict inequality holds 
every prole b    bi  in determines a probability distribution probb over x dened as
follows 
probb  x    h b    x    b    x         bn   xn   
    if s is an innite set  we must specify additional parameters required in probability theory  we associate
with each si a  algebra of events i   we endow s with the product  algebra    and we dene h over

let  be a desired probability distribution over x  we say that i implements  in g u   
if in g u  i  every player i has a dominant strategy bi   and probb     we say that i is a

    mixed strategies  removing the algorithm observability assumption
let p    p    p         pn   be a mixed strategy prole in a nite game g u    p generates a
probability distribution p over s as follows 
p  x    p   x   p   x       pn  xn  

for every x  x 

we say that an implementation device i implements p if it implements p  
in order to implement a mixed strategy equilibrium   the interested party employs an
implementation device i  in which the set of signals si is the set of actions of i  xi   h
is the product probability of p  that is  h x    p   x   p   x       pn  xn    and the function
vi   si  xi    is designated in such a way that the strategy bi  si     si   si  xi   is a
dominant strategy for every player i 
hence  the interested party ips a coin for each player i according to the probability
pi in the prole she wishes to implement  and she sends the outcome of this coin ipping
to i  thus  the signals sent to the players are just recommendations to play  the payo
functions vi   i  n are designed in such a way that obeying the recommendation is a
dominant strategy for every player 
theorem   let g u   be a nite game with at least two actions for every player  every
mixed strategy equilibrium prole p is   implementable in g u   with an appropriate implementation device i    s  h  v   in which s   x  and h   p is the product probability on x
dened by p 
proof   denote by bi the strategy of i in which it obeys every recommendation  that is
bi  si     si for every si  xi   the function vi should satisfy for every vector di of the other
players strategies 
wi  si  si   di    wi  xi  si   di   xi  xi  
we can assume without loss of generality that for every player i  vi  si   si   xi   yi       for
every xi    si   therefore the above inequality can be written as follows 




esi vi  si   si   si   di  si     esi ui  xi   di  si     ui  si   di  si     
if di   bi   that is dj  sj     sj for every j    i and for every sj  xj   the right hand side
of the above inequalities are non positive because p is a mixed strategy equilibrium  hence 
we may dene vi  s  s      for every s  x  to make sure that the inequalities hold in all
other cases  i e   for all di    we can dene vi  s  si   xi      m     for every xi    si  
where m     is an upper bound on the absolute value of all players payo functions  the
choice of  m      rather then  m   ensures the existence of a strict inequality required by
the denition of domination

denition let g u      n  x  u   be a nite game in strategic form  a correlated equilibrium of g u   is a probability distribution  over x     x   such that the strategies
bi  si     si   si  xi   i  n   form an equilibrium in the game g u  i   where i    s  h  v   is
the following implementation device 
 s   x 
 h    
 vi  s  x    ui  x  for every i  n and for every s  x  x 
hence   forms a correlated equilibrium if a mediator who makes no changes in the
players payo can run a randomization device according to   picks a prole of pure actions
s  and sends every player i the recommendation to play si   and every player is better o
obeying the recommendation if she believes that all other players obey the recommendations 
it is well known   and it was implicitly used in the proof of theorem    that if p is a mixed
strategy equilibrium  p is a correlated equilibrium  moreover  going over the proof of
theorem   reveals that the only property of the mixed strategy equilibrium p that we use
is the fact that p is a correlated equilibrium  hence we get 
theorem   let g u      n  x  u   be a nite game with at least two actions for every
player  every correlated equilibrium prole  is   implementable in g u   with an appropriate implementation device i    s  h  v   in which  s   x and h    
note that eventually  when the interested party implements a mixed strategy equilibrium
or a correlated equilibrium with the implementation device i  the players are using pure
strategies in the game g u  i   because the expected value operator is linear  it can be
easily seen that obeying the recommendation remains a dominant strategy for every player
even if this player believes that the other players use mixed strategies in g u  i   where
a mixed strategy of i in g u  i  is a probability distribution qi over the set of his pure
strategies  a mixed strategy is not a natural description of behavior in g u  i   a more
natural  and less computational demanding concept is the one of behavior strategy  a
behavior strategy of i in the game g u  i  is a function ci   si   xi    hence  a player
who is using a behavioral strategy chooses a mixed strategy in a game in strategic form as
a function of his signal  while a player who is using a mixed strategy in g u  i  is picking a
pure strategy in g u  i  with a randomization device before he receives the signal  the sets
of mixed and behavioral strategies are not technically related to each other  however  by
kuhn          see also hart        for details   for every player i  for every strategy bi of i
and for every prole qi    qj  j i of mixed strategies of the other players  there exists a
prole ci    cj  j i of behavioral strategies of the other players such that for every signal

si the expected utility of i when using bi given that all other players are using qi equals
his expected utility when all other players are using ci   and vice versa   
hence  theorems   and   remain valid in an environment that allows the utilization of
either mixed or behavioral strategies in g u  i  

   conclusions  discussion and further research
one may distinguish between two main lines of research in multi agent systems  one line
of research has to do with the design of mechanisms and protocols  in this context we
in fact deal with the design of games  such that when agents are assumed to behave in
particular way  e g   be law abiding  playing in equilibrium  reinforcement learners  etc  
then a desired behavior  e g   revenue maximization  the maximization of social surplus 
etc   will be obtained  the other line of research deals with the study of the behavior of
agents in a given game  in economic theory the leading paradigm in the last decades has
been that agents use equilibrium strategies  however  this paradigm implicitly assumes that
agents are rational and moreover  that agents believe that the other agents are rational   
in this paper we introduced an intermediate approach  the game interaction is given 
and agents are not provided with newly designed protocol  the inuence on agents behavior
is only through credible promises for positive monetary transfers conditioned on the actions
selected by the agents in the game  we also assume 
   minimal rationality  we would like to assume as little as possible on agent rationality 
indeed all that we assume is that an agent will not use a strategy if it is dominated
by another strategy 
   minimal expenses  we assume that the interested party wishes to minimize its expenses
while leading the agents to the desired behavior 
the notion of k implementation captures the above basic ideas  in the paper we have
provided several basic results about k implementation  we have provided full characterization of k implementation for the case of implementation of singletons in games with
complete information  in particular we have shown a formula for computing the optimal k 
which will yield the desired agent behavior  and fully specied a procedure for implementation  our result is also applicable to a general class of games with innitely many strategies 
we have shown that such characterization is likely to be impossible for the implementation
of sets of strategies  in particular  we have shown that the problem of whether the desired
behavior can be implemented with a cost of k is np hard  this led us to considering exact
k implementation that we have shown to be tractable  exact k implementation requires
that every desirable strategy prole will be rational as a result of the promises for monetary
    actually  the theorem presented by kuhn        is stronger than the one we quote here 
    in computer science the issue of how should an agent choose its action   unless he has a dominant strategy 
is a central one and no general satisfactory solution is known  researchers appeal in this case to the
concept of competitive analysis  borodin   el yaniv         in the context of games  some promising
results in this direction are presented by tennenholtz

transfers  in addition to the requirement that no undesirable strategy prole will remain
rational   in a sense  exact implementation requires that the number of strategies that
the system will remove will be minimal  this is consistent with basic ideas of normative systems where in order to obtain desired behavior we would like to have minimal laws
that leave maximal freedom to the agents as long as they will enable to obtain the desired
 social  behavior  for a discussion of this issue see  fitoussi   tennenholtz        
the extension of our results to the context of mixed strategies can be interpreted as
a strong evidence for the importance of nash equilibrium from the normative perspective 
and not only as a descriptive approach that attempts to explain predict agent behavior in
economic contexts  the fact that any mixed strategy equilibrium can made into a dominant
one with zero payments given that we have a credible interested party  who cannot force
behaviors or punish agents  tells us that in many practical situations nash equilibrium has
a special merit also from the normative perspective 
the games of incomplete information discussed in this section are games in informational form  rather than bayesian games  this is in the spirit of work in computer science
that tries to minimize probabilistic assumptions about the economic environment  and in
particular the use of those as part of a solution concept  in this context the vcg mechanisms are probably the most central and widely studied mechanisms and we turn our
attention to the study of k implementation in the context of these mechanisms  indeed  as
we show  unlike in the case of nite games with complete information where there is always
some large k that  if paid  can lead to any desired behavior  this is no longer true in games
with incomplete information  the vcg mechanisms turn out to be very complex in their
equilibrium analysis  as recent work has shown  holzman et al         there are exponentially many equilibria of the vcg mechanisms that dier from truth telling  these are of
special interest since these other equilibria exhibit lower communication complexity than
the standard truth revealing equilibrium  notice that these equilibria are obtained without
any restriction on the possible bids by the agents  this is the so called no imposition property   the interested party has no access to the vcg protocol  and can inuence it only
indirectly  we have proved   implementation of any ex post equilibrium of any frugal vcg
mechanism  and that the frugality requirement is necessary 
there are many things left to be done  in particular  it will be interesting to further
develop the study of k implementation for better understanding the case of k      for
example  it may be interesting to study the eects of the cost of implementation on economic
eciency  further study of tractable cases is also of interest  we are interested also in
extending our study of k implementation to games in informational form beyond the vcg
mechanisms  the issue of collusion may have very interesting ramications in the context
of k implementation  collusive agreements may make benet of the promises made by the
interested party  similarly  if failures in the system are possible  then the interested party
might nd itself paying its oers which he was hoping to ignore given rational behavior of
the agents  we have also assumed that there is only one interested party  in a case that
there are several interested parties who may wish to lead to dierent desired behaviors then
a new strategic situation emerges  we believe that these issues are of signicant importance 
we hope to address some of them in future work  and that others will join us in the study of
