make  partial  models generally usable providing mechanism instantiate
compose larger models complex systems involving many interacting phenomena 
thus  input compositional model repository scenario describing configuration
system modelled  sample scenario may include number populations various
predation competition relations them  output mathematical model  called
scenario model  representing behaviour system specified given scenario  set
differential equations describing changes population sizes aforementioned scenario
due births  natural deaths  deaths predation  available food supply competition
would constitute scenario model 
application domain poses three important new challenges compositional modelling 
firstly  processes components ecological system represented
resulting composed model depend one another ways described  population dynamics example  models describing predation competition phenomena
two populations rely existence population growth model populations
involved phenomenon  inhibits conventional approach searching consistent adequate combination partial models  one component scenario 
approach provides adequate solution physical systems comprised components implementing particular functionality described one multiple partial
models  although seminal work compositional modelling  falkenhainer   forbus       
recognised existence complex interdependencies model construction general 
provided partial solution it  conditions certain modelling choices
relevant specified manually knowledge base 
secondly  domain ecology lacks complete theory constitutes adequate model 
existing compositional modellers based predefined concept model adequacy 
employ inference mechanisms guaranteed find model meets adequacy criteria 
however  criteria determine adequate ecological model may vary ecological
domains even ecologists require model within domain  therefore 
compositional modeller requires facility define properties generated ecological
models must satisfy 
thirdly  possible express criteria imposed scenario model terms
hard requirements  often  ecological models describe mechanisms behaviours partially understood  cases  choice one model another becomes matter expert
opinion rather pure theory  therefore  ecological domain  modelling approaches presumptions are  extent  selected based preferences  existing compositional modellers
