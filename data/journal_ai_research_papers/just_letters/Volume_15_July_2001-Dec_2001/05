table    overview attac      s high level strategy 
   since airline prices periodically increase decrease equal probability  expected change price airline auction     indeed  shown
airline auction considered isolation  waiting end game
purchase tickets optimal strategy  except rare case price reaches
lowest allowed value  
   since hotel prices monotonically increasing  game proceeds  hotel prices
approach eventual closing prices 
therefore  attac      aims delay purchases  particularly airline
purchases  late game  attac      s high level bidding strategy based

anything  markets rarely advantageous change client s travel
package would mean wasting airline ticket expensive hotel room  thus requiring
additional ones purchased

    allocation strategy
evident section      attac      relies heavily computing current
profitable allocation goods clients  g   since g changes prices change  attac     
needs recompute every bidding opportunity  using integer linear programming
approach  attac      able compute optimal final allocations every game instance
tournament finals one   entrants so  
tac participants used form greedy strategy allocation  greenwald
  stone         computationally feasible quickly determine maximum utility
achievable client   given set purchased goods  move client   remaining
goods  etc  however  greedy strategy lead suboptimal solutions  example 
consider   clients b identical travel days iad idd well identical
entertainment values ev   a s ghv       b  s ghv         agent
exactly one type hotel room day  optimal assignment clearly
assign bgh client b   however  client a s utility optimized first 
assigned bgh  leaving b stay lfi  agent s resulting score would     less
could been 
improvement basic greedy strategy  implemented heuristic approach
implements greedy strategy     random client orderings chooses
profitable resulting allocation  empirically  resulting allocation often optimal 
never far optimal  addition  always quick compute  set seven
games tournament  greedy allocator run approximately    
times produced allocations averaged       optimal value

opponent modeling precluded system dynamics  nonetheless  attac      s
adaptivity one keys success  particularly avoiding skyrocketing hotels 
 nd  rd place agents used different strategy prepare possibility
skyrocketing hotels  rather avoiding popular hotels entirely tracking closing
prices across game instances  discouraged agents bidding many
particular hotel room  thus spreading demand across rooms  greenwald  
stone         strategy safer limit  i e   continues work even
everyone uses it   greater potential cost agent event hotel prices
skyrocket  since agent still distribute demand less desirable rooms 
hand  attac      would notice prices skyrocketing thus
bid optimal travel packages given current prices 

   conclusion future work

tac      first autonomous bidding agent competition  successful event  minor improvements would increase interest multiagent learning
perspective 

currently  incentive buy airline tickets end game 

price ights tend increase  supply limited  agents would
balance advantage keeping options open savings committing
travel packages earlier   

information structure tac setup impossible observe

bidding patterns individual agents games  nonetheless  strategic
behavior individual agents often profoundly affected market dynamics particularly
hotel auctions  seems would beneficial able directly observe
behavior individual agent  information available regarding
bidding behavior agents game  such agents could infer
clients  preferences  therefore market supply  demand  prices   tac agents
would potentially able learn predict market behavior game proceeds 

without modifications  hope able participate future tacs 
goal adding additional adaptive elements attac      
another direction future research apply lessons learned tac real
simultaneous interacting auctions  straightforward write bidding agents participate on line auctions single good value client fixed ahead time
