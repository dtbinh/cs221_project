abstract
matchmaking arises when supply and demand meet in an electronic marketplace  or
when agents search for a web service to perform some task  or even when recruiting agencies
match curricula and job proles  in such open environments  the objective of a matchmaking process is to discover best available oers to a given request 
we address the problem of matchmaking from a knowledge representation perspective 
with a formalization based on description logics  we devise concept abduction and concept contraction as non monotonic inferences in description logics suitable for modeling
matchmaking in a logical framework  and prove some related complexity results  we also
present reasonable algorithms for semantic matchmaking based on the devised inferences 
and prove that they obey to some commonsense properties 
finally  we report on the implementation of the proposed matchmaking framework 
which has been used both as a mediator in e marketplaces and for semantic web services
discovery 

   introduction
the promise of the semantic web initiative is to revolutionize the way information is coded 
stored  and searched on the internet  berners lee  hendler    lassila         the basic
idea is to structure information with the aid of markup languages  based on the xml
language  such as rdf and rdfs    and owl    these languages have been conceived
for the representation of machine understandable  and unambiguous  description of web
content through the creation of domain ontologies  and aim at increasing openness and
interoperability in the web environment 
widespread availability of resources and services enablesamong other advantages
the interaction with a number of potential counterparts  the bottleneck is that it is dicult
nding matches  possibly the best ones  between parties 
the need for a matchmaking process arises when supply and demand have to meet in a
marketplace  or when web services able to perform some task have to be discovered  but also
when recruiting agencies match curricula and job proles or a dating agency has to propose
partners to a customer of the agency  requests and oers may hence be generic demands
and supplies  web services  information  tangible or intangible goods  and a matchmaking
process should nd for any request an appropriate response  in this paper we concentrate

on automated matchmaking  basically oriented to electronic marketplaces and service discovery  although principles and algorithms are denitely general enough to cover also other
scenarios  we assume  as it is reasonable  that both requests and oers are endowed of
some kind of description  based on these descriptions the target of the matching process
is nding  for a given request  best matches available in the oers set  and also  given an
oer  determine best matching requests in a peer to peer fashion  we may hence think of an
electronic mediator as the actor who actively tries to carry out the matchmaking process 
obviously descriptions might be provided using unstructured text  and in this case such an
automated mediator should revert to adopting either basic string matching techniques or
more sophisticated information retrieval techniques 
the semantic web paradigm calls for descriptions that should be provided in a structured form based on ontologies  and we will assume in what follows that requests and oers
are given with reference to a common ontology  it should be noticed that even when requests
and oers are described in heterogeneous languages  or using dierent ontologies modelling
the same domain  schema data integration techniques may be employed to make them
comparable  as proposed e g   by madhavan  bernstein  and rahm         and shvaiko and
euzenat         but once they are reformulated in a comparable way  one is still left with
the basic matchmaking problems  given a request  are there compatible oers  if there are
several compatible oers  which  and why  are the most promising ones 
matchmaking has been widely studied and several proposals have been made in the past 
we report on them in section    recently  there has been a growing eort aimed at the
formalization with description logics  dls   baader  calvanese  mc guinness  nardi

donini    mongiello      c      a  among others   dls  in fact  allow to model structured
descriptions of requests and oers as concepts  usually sharing a common ontology  furthermore dls allow for an open world assumption  incomplete information is admitted 
and absence of information can be distinguished from negative information  we provide a
little insight on dls in section   
usually  dl based approaches exploit standard reasoning services of a dl system
subsumption and  un satisabilityto match potential partners in an electronic transaction  in brief  if a supply is described by a concept sup and a demand by a concept dem 
unsatisability of the conjunction of sup and dem  noted as sup  dem  identies the incompatible proposals  satisability identies potential partnersthat still have to agree on
underspecied constraintsand subsumption between sup and dem  noted as sup  dem 
means that requirements on dem are completely fullled by sup 
classication into compatible and incompatible matches can be useless in the presence of
several compatible supplies  some way to rank most promising ones has to be identied  also
some explanation on motivation of such a rank could be appreciated  on the other hand 
when there is lack of compatible matches one may accept to turn to incompatible matches
that could still be interesting  by revising some of the original requirements presented in
the request  as far as one could easily identify them 
in other words some method is needed to provide a logic based score for both compatible
and incompatible matches and eventually provide a partial full ordering  allowing a user

or an automated agent to choose most promising counteroers  furthermore it should be
possible  given a score  to provide logical explanations of the resulting score  thus allowing
to understand the rank result and ease further interaction to rene revise the request 
although this process is quite simple for a human being it is not so in a logic based fully
automated framework  we believe there is a need to dene non monotonic reasoning services
in a dls setting  to deal with approximation and ranking  and in this paper we propose
the use of concept abduction  di noia et al       a  and concept contraction  colucci

highlighted issues in a satisfactory way  contributions of this paper include 
 a logical framework to express requests and oers in terms of concept descriptions 
and properties that should hold in a matchmaking facilitator 
 concept abduction as a logical basis for ranking compatible counteroers to a given
oer and provide logical explanations of the ranking result 
 concept contraction as a logical basis for ranking incompatible matches  aimed at
discovering most promising near misses  and provide logical explanations of the
ranking result

   related work on matchmaking
matchmaking has been investigated in recent years under a number of perspectives and for
dierent purposes  with a renovated interest as the information overload kept growing with
the web widespreading use  we try here to summarize some of the relevant related work 
vague query answering  proposed by motro         was an initial eort to overcome limitations of relational databases  using weights attributed to several search variables  more
recent approaches along these lines aim at extending sql with preference clauses  in
order to softly matchmake data in structured databases  kieling         finin  fritzson 
mckay  and mcentire        proposed kqml as an agent communication language oriented to matchmaking purposes  kuokka and harada        investigated matchmaking
   

fidi noia  di sciascio   donini

as a process that allowed potential producers consumers to provide descriptions of their
products needs  either directly or through agents mediation  to be later unied by an engine identifying promising matches  two engines were developed  the shade system 
which again used kqml  and as description language kif  with matchmaking anyway not
relying on any logical reasoning  and coins  which adopted classical unstructured text information retrieval techniques  namely the smart ir system  similar methods were later
re considered in the grappa system  veit  muller  schneider    fiehn         classiedads matchmaking  at a syntactic level  was proposed by raman  livny  and solomon       
to matchmake semi structured descriptions advertising computational resources in a fashion
anticipating grid resources brokering  matchmaking was used in sims  arens  knoblock 
  shen        to dynamically integrate queries  the approach used kqml  and loom
as description language  loom is also used in the subsumption matching addressed by
gil and ramachandran         infosleuth  jacobs   shea         a system for discovery
and integration of information  included an agent matchmaker  which adopted kif and
the deductive database language ldl    constraint based approaches to matchmaking
have been proposed and implemented in several systems  e g   personalogic    kasbah  and
systems by maes  guttman  and moukas         karacapilidis and moraitis         wang 
liao  and liao         strobel and stolze        
matchmaking as satisability of concept conjunction in dls was rst proposed in the
same venue by gonzales castillo  trastour  and bartolini        and by di sciascio et al 
        and precisely dened by trastour et al          sycara  paolucci  van velsen  and
giampapa        introduced a specic language for agent advertisement in the framework
of the retsina multiagent infrastructure  a matchmaking engine was developed  sycara
et al         paolucci  kawamura  payne    sycara         which carries out the process on
ve possible levels  such levels exploit both classical text retrieval techniques and semantic
match using  subsumption  nevertheless  standard features of a semantic based system 
as satisability check are unavailable  it is noteworthy that in this approach  the notion
of plug in match is introduced  to overcome in some way the limitations of a matching approach based on exact matches  the approach of paolucci et al         was later extended
by li and horrocks         where two new levels for matching classication were introduced 
a similar classication was proposedin the same venueby di noia et al       c   along
with properties that a matchmaker should have in a dl based framework  and algorithms to
classify and semantically rank matches within classes  benatallah  hacid  rey  and toumani
       proposed the dierence operator in dls for semantic matchmaking  the approach
uses concept dierence  followed by a covering operation optimized using hypergraph techniques  in the framework of web services discovery  we briey comment on the relationship
between concept dierence and concept abduction at the end of section    an initial dlbased approach  adopting penalty functions ranking  has been proposed by cal  calvanese 
colucci  di noia  and donini         in the framework of dating systems  an extended
matchmaking approach  with negotiable and strict constraints in a dl framework has been
proposed by colucci  di noia  di sciascio  donini  and mongiello         using both concept contraction and concept abduction  matchmaking in dls with locally closed world

fisemantic matchmaking as non monotonic reasoning  a description logic approach

assumption applying autoepistemic dls has been proposed by grimm  motik  and preist
       
the need to work in someway with approximation and ranking in dl based approaches
to matchmaking has also recently led to adopting fuzzy dls  as in smart  agarwal  
lamparter        or hybrid approaches  as in the owls mx matchmaker  klusch  fries 
khalid    sycara         such approaches  anyway  relaxing the logical constraints  do not
allow any explanation or automated revision service 
finally  it should be pointed out that matching in dls  widely treated by baader 
kusters  borgida  and mc guinness        has no relation to matchmaking  in fact  in that
work expressions denoting concepts are considered  with variables in expressions  then
a match is a substitution of variables with expressions that makes a concept expression
equivalent to another  also the more general setting of concept rewriting in dls has no
direct relation with matchmakingsee the discussion in remark   

   description logics basics
in this section we summarize the basic notions and denitions about description logics
 dls   and about classic  the knowledge representation system our application is inspired
by  we provide hereafter a brief guided tour of dls main characteristics  while the interested
reader can refer to the comprehensive handbook by baader et al         
    description logics
description logicsa k a  terminological logicsare a family of logic formalisms for knowledge representation  all dls are endowed of a syntax  and a semantics  which is usually
model theoretic  the basic syntax elements of dls are 
 concept names  e g   computer  cpu  device  software 
 role names  like hassoftware  hasdevice
 individuals  that are used for special named elements belonging to concepts 
intuitively  concepts stand for sets of objects  and roles link objects in dierent concepts 
as the role hassoftware that links computers to software  we are not using individuals in
our formalization  hence from now on we skip the parts regarding individuals 
formally  a semantic interpretation is a pair i      i    which consists of the domain
 and the interpretation function i   which maps every concept to a subset of   and every
role to a subset of    
basic elements can be combined using constructors to form concept and role expressions 
and each dl has its distinguished set of constructors  every dl allows one to form a
conjunction of concepts  usually denoted as   some dl include also disjunction  and
complement  to close concept expressions under boolean operations 
roles can be combined with concepts using
 existential role quantication 
e g   computer  hassoftware wordprocessor
which describes the set of computers whose software include a word processor  and
   

fidi noia  di sciascio   donini

 universal role quantication
e g   server  hascpu intel
which describes servers with only intel processors on board 
other constructs may involve counting  as
 number restrictions 
e g   computer      hascpu 
expresses computers with at most one cpu  and
e g   computer      hascpu 
describes computers equipped with at least four cpus 
many other constructs can be dened  increasing the expressive power of the dl  up to
n ary relations  calvanese  de giacomo    lenzerini        
in what follows  we call atomic concepts the union of concept names  negated concept
names  and unqualied number restrictions  we dene length of a concept c as the number
of atomic concepts appearing in c  we denote the length of c as  c   observe that we
consider   and  to have zero length  we dene the quantication nesting  qn  of a
concept as the following positive integer  the qn of an atomic concept is    the qn of a
universal role quantication r f is   plus the qn of f   and the qn of a conjunction
c   c  is the maximum between the qns of conjoined concepts c  and c   
expressions are given a semantics by dening the interpretation function over each
construct  for example  concept conjunction is interpreted as set intersection   c  d i  
c i  di   and also the other boolean connectives  and   when present  are given the usual
set theoretic interpretation of union and complement  the interpretation of constructs
involving quantication on roles needs to make domain elements explicit  for example 
 r c i    d      d       d    d     ri  d   c i  
    tboxes
concept expressions can be used in axiomsthat can be either inclusions  symbol     or
denitions  symbol   which impose restrictions on possible interpretations according
to the knowledge elicited for a given domain  for example  we could impose that monitors
can be divided into crt and lcd using the two inclusions  monitor  lcdmonitor 
crtmonitor and crtmonitor  lcdmonitor  or  that computers for a domestic use have
only one operating system as homepc      hasos   denitions are useful to give a
meaningful name to particular combinations  as in server  computer      hascpu  
historically  sets of such axioms are called a tbox  terminological box   there are
several possible types of tboxes  general tboxes are made by general concept inclusions
 gci  of the form c  d  where both c and dem can be any concept of the dl  for
general tboxes  the distinction between inclusions and denitions disappears  since any
denition c  d can be expressed by two gcis c  d  d  c  on the contrary  in
simple tboxesalso called schemas by calvanese         and by buchheit  donini  nutt 
and schaerf       only a concept name can appear on the left hand side  l h s   of an
axiom  and a concept name can appear on the l h s  of at most one axiom  schemas can be
   

fisemantic matchmaking as non monotonic reasoning  a description logic approach

cyclic or acyclic  where cyclicity refers to the dependency graph gt between concept names 
dened as follows  every concept name is a node in gt   and there is an arc from concept
name a to concept name b if a appears on the l h s  of an axiom  and b appears  at any
level  in the concept on the right hand side  t is acyclic if gt is  and it is cyclic otherwise 
we call an acyclic schema a simple tbox  baader et al         ch     the depth of a simple
tbox t is the length of the longest path in gt   only for simple tboxes  unfolding has
been dened as the following process  see appendix a for a denition   for every denition
a  c  replace a with c in every concept  for every inclusion a  c  replace a with a  c
in every concept  clearly  such a process trasforms every concept into an equivalent one 
where the tbox can be forgotten  however  for some tboxes  unfolding can yield concepts
of exponential size w r t  the initial concepts  when such an exponential blow up does not
happen  we call the tbox bushy but not deep  nebel        
the semantics of axioms is based on set containment and equality  an interpretation i
satises an inclusion c  d if c i  di   and it satises a denition c  d when c i   di  
a model of a tbox t is an interpretation satisfying all axioms of t  
observe that we make a distinction between equivalence   used in axioms  and equality
  symbols  we use equality to instantiate generic concept symbols with the concepts they
stand for  e g   when we write     where c   a  r b    we mean that the concept
symbol c stands for the concept expression a  r b in the text 
    reasoning services
dl based systems usually provide two basic reasoning services 
   concept satisability  given a tbox t and a concept c  does there exist at least one
model of t assigning a non empty extension to c  we abbreviate satisability of a
concept c w r t  a tbox t as c t  
   subsumption  given a tbox t and two concepts c and d  is c i always contained in
d i for every model iof t   we abbreviate subsumption between c and d w r t  t
as c t d 
since c is satisable i c is not subsumed by   complexity lower bounds for satisability
carry over  for the complement class  to subsumption  and upper bounds for subsumption
carry over to satisability  on the other hand  since c is subsumed by d i c  d is
unsatisable  subsumption is reducible to satisability in dls admitting general concept
negation  but not in those dls in which d is outside the languageas in the dls of the
next section 
    the system classic
the system classic  borgida  brachman  mcguinness    a  resnick        borgida  
patel schneider        has been originally developed as a general knowledge representation
system  and has been successfully applied to conguration  wright  weixelbaum  vesonder 
brown  palmer  berman    moore        and program repositories management  devambu 
brachman  selfridge    ballard        
its language has been designed to be as expressive as possible while still admitting
polynomial time inferences for bushy but not deep tboxes  so it provides intersection of

to make reasoning np hard  donini  lenzerini  nardi    nutt        donini        
for simplicity  we only consider a subset of the constructs  namely  conjunction  number
restrictions  and universal role quantications  summarized in table    we abbreviate the
conjunction   n r     n r  as    n r   we omit constructs one of    fills   
that refer to individuals  and construct same as    equating llers in functional roles 
the subset of classic we refer to is known as aln  attributive language with unqualied
number restrictions   donini  lenzerini  nardi    nutt      b   when number restrictions
are not present  the resulting dl is known as al  schmidt schau   smolka         aln
provides a minimal set of constructs that allow one to represent a concept taxonomy  disjoint
groups  role restrictions  al   and number restrictions  n   to represent restriction son the
number of llers of a role 
regarding axioms in a tbox  classic allows one to state a simple tbox of assertions
of the form summarized in table    where a  a           ak are all concept names  axioms
in the tbox are subject to the constraints that every concept name can appear at most
once as the l h s  in a tbox  and every concept name cannot appear both on the l h s  of a
denition and in a disjointness assertion 
every classic concept can be given a normal form  here we consider the normal form
only for the constructs of aln that we used in the ontologies and applications  intuitively 
the normal form pre computes all implications of a concept  includingpossiblyits unsatisability  the normal form can be reached  up to commutativity of the operator  
using well known normalization rules  that we report in appendix a to make the paper
   

fisemantic matchmaking as non monotonic reasoning  a description logic approach

self contained  the normal form of an unsatisable concept is simply   every satisable
concept c can be divided into three components  cnames c call   the component cnames
is the conjunction of all concept names a           ah   the component c is the conjunction
of all number restrictions  no more than two for every role  the maximum at least and the
minimum at most for each role   including for every conjunct of c of the form r   the
number restriction     r  in c   the component call conjoins all concepts of the form
r d  one for each role r  where d is again in normal form  we call such form conjunctive normal formcnf  in analogy with propositional logicand we observe that cnf
is unique  also said canonical   up to commutativity of conjunction 
moreover  the tbox in classic can be embedded into the concepts  by expanding
denitions  and adding the right hand side concepts of inclusions  and adding the negation
of disjoint concept namessee appendix a for more details  for instance  suppose that a
tbox contains 
   the denition server  computer      hascpu  
   the inclusion computer      hasstoragedevice  
   and the disjointness assertion disj amd  intel  
then  the concept serverhascpu intel can be rewritten into computer    hascpu 
    hasstoragedevice hascpu  intelamd   which is equivalent to the former w r t 
models of the tbox  observe that the concept name computer is kept in the rewriting 
since the inclusion gives only a necessary condition     hasstoragedevice   the latter
concept can be safely conjoined to computermaking the inclusion unnecessarybut cannot replace it since     hasstoragedevice  is not a sucient condition for computer 
instead  computer      hascpu  replaces server since it is a necessary and sucient
condition for it  the disjoint assertion generates intel  amd as the range for hascpu  
once this rewriting has been carried over all concepts  the tbox can be safely ignored when
computing subsumption  and satisability   in general  this unfolding may lead to an exponential blow up of the tbox  making the entire computation  unfolding subsumption  take
exponential time  and space  in the size of the initial concepts and tbox  yet exponentialtime computation for subsumption is likely to be unavoidable  since even without rewriting 
taking the tbox into account makes subsumption np hard  nebel        
the normal form of concepts can take the tbox embedding into account  see appendix a     in this case  the component cnames of a classic concept c contains concept
names cnames  and negations of concept names cnames   in the following  we denote the
cnf of a concept c w r t  a simple tbox t as cnf  c  t    again  in general  the size
of cnf  c  t   may be exponential w r t  the size of c and t   however  when t is xed 
cnf  c  t   has polynomial size w r t  the size of c i e   the exponential increase comes only
from the tbox unfolding  in fact  if k is the maximum size of an unfolded concept name
 a constant if t is xed   the size of cnf  c  t   can be at most k times the size of c  we
use this argument later in the paper  to decouple the complexity analysis of our reasoning
methods for matchmaking from the complexity raised by the tbox 
to ease presentation of what follows in the next sections  we adopt a simple reference
ontology  pictured in figure    which is used throughout the paper  to keep the representation within aln   we modeled memory quantities with number restriction  e g     gb as

   semantic matchmaking using description logics
matchmaking is a widely used term in a variety of frameworks  comprising severalquite
dierentapproaches  we begin this section trying to provide a generic and sound denition of matchmaking 
matchmaking is an information retrieval task whereby queries  a k a  demands  and resources  a k a  supplies  are expressed using semi structured data
in the form of advertisements  and task results are ordered  ranked  lists of those
resources best fullling the query 
this simple denition implies thatdierently from classical unstructured text information
retrieval systemssome structure in the advertisements is expected in a matchmaking
   

fisemantic matchmaking as non monotonic reasoning  a description logic approach

system  and matchmaking does not consider a xed database oriented relational structure 
furthermore  usually database systems provide answers to queries that do not include a
relevance ranking  which should be instead considered in a matchmaking process 
semantic matchmaking is a matchmaking task whereby queries and resources
advertisements are expressed with reference to a shared specication of a conceptualization for the knowledge domain at hand  i e   an ontology 
from now on  we concentrate on semantic matchmaking in marketplaces  adopting specic
terminology  to ease presentation of the approach  nevertheless our approach applies to
generic matchmaking of semantically annotated resources 
we note that all denitions in this section apply to every dl that can be used to
describe a marketplace  supplies  demands  background knowledge   we denote by l such
a generic dl  we suppose that a common ontology for supplies and demands is established 
as a tbox t in l  now a match between a supply and a demand could be evaluated
according to t  
first of all  we remark that a logic based representation of supplies and demands calls
for generally open world descriptions  that is  the absence of a characteristic in the description of a supply or demand should not be interpreted as a constraint of absence  instead 
it should be considered as a characteristic that could be either rened later  or left open
if it is irrelevant for a user  note that by generally open we mean that some specic
characteristic might be declared to be closed  however  such a closure should be made
piecewise  using some known declarative tool devised in knowledge representation for nonmonotonic reasoning  such as defaults in dls  baader   hollunder         autoepistemic

      etc 
an analysis of recent literature allows to categorize the semantic matchmaking process
between a supply sup and a demand dem w r t  a tbox t in ve distinct classes 
 exact match  sup t dem  i e   sup t dem and dem t sup  which amounts
to a perfect match  regardlessin a semantic based environmentof syntactic dierences  i e   sup and dem are equivalent concepts  di sciascio et al         gonzalescastillo et al         
 full match  sup t dem  which amounts to the demand being completely fullled
by the available supply  i e   sup has at least all features required by dem  but not
necessarily vice versa  being the matchmaking process not symmetric  di noia et al  
    c   this kind of match is also named subsume match by li and horrocks        
 plug in match  dem t sup  it corresponds to demand dem being sub concept of
supply sup i e   dem is more specic than sup  sycara et al         li   horrocks 
      
 potential match  demsup t   which corresponds to supply and demand having
something in common and no conicting characteristics  di noia et al       c   this
relation is also named intersection satisable by li and horrocks        
   

fidi noia  di sciascio   donini

 partial match  dem  sup t   which amounts to the presence of conict between
the demand and the available supply  di noia et al       c   this relation is also
named disjoint by li and horrocks          
we stress that demands could be classied in the same way w r t  a given supply  when
its the suppliers turn to look into the marketplace to nd potential buyers  hence  in the
rest of the paper we use the term oer denoted by the symbol dto mean either a supply
sup or a demand dem  and the term counteroer denoted by cto mean  respectively 
the demand dem or the supply sup that could match d 
such a classication is still a coarse one  relying directly on known logical relations
between formulae  in fact  the result of matchmaking should be a rank of counteroers 
according to some criteriapossibly explicitso that a user trusting the system would
know whom to contact rst  and in case of failure  whom next  and so on  such a ranking
process should satisfy some criteria that a knowledge representation approach suggests 
we formulate ranking requirements by referring to properties of penalty functions 
definition   given a dl l  two concepts c  d  l  and a tbox t in l  a penalty
function is a three arguments function p c  d  t    that returns a null or positive integer 
we use penalty functions to rank counteroers c for a given demand  or supply  d w r t  a
tbox t   intuitively  for two given counteroers c    c  in the marketplace  if p c    d  t    
p c    d  t   then the issuer of oer d should rank c  better than c  when deciding whom to
contact rst  clearly  a   penalty should be ranked best  and counteroers with the same
penalties should be ranked breaking ties  the rst property we recall is non symmetric
evaluation of proposals 
definition   a penalty function p       is non symmetric if there exist concepts c  d and
a tbox t such that p c  d  t     p d  c  t   
this property is evident when all constraints of d are fullled by c but not vice versa 
hence  c should be among the top ranked counteroers in the list of potential partners of
d  while d should not necessarily appear at the top in the list of potential partners of c 
so  a penalty function p       should not be expected to be a metric distance function 
secondly  if logic is used to give some meaning to descriptions of supplies and demands 
then proposals with the same meaning should be equally penalized  independently of their
syntactic descriptions 
definition   a penalty function p       is syntax independent if for every triple of concepts c    c    d  and tbox t   when t    c   c  then p c    d  t     p c    d  t    and the
same holds also for the second argument   i e   p d  c    t     p d  c    t  
   we note that preferring the term partial match instead of disjoint  we stress that the match may
still be recoverable  while disjoint is usually meant as a hopeless situation  moreover  disjoint and
intersection satisable refer to the set theoretic semantics of concepts in description logics  which
is quite hidden and far from the original problems of matchmaking  in a word  they are technologyoriented and not problem oriented  for instance  if one used propositional logic  or three valued logic
for modeling matchmaking  those terms would make no sense 

   

fisemantic matchmaking as non monotonic reasoning  a description logic approach

clearly  when the logic admits a normal form of expressionsas cnf or dnf for propositional logic  or the normal form of concepts for dls dened in the previous sectionusing
such a normal form in the computation of p       ensures by itself syntax independence 
penalties should enjoy some desirable properties w r t  subsumption  for reasons explained below  we divide penalty functions for ranking potential matches from those for
ranking partial  conicting  matches 
definition   a penalty function for potential matches is monotonic over subsumption
whenever for every issued oer d  for every pair of counteroers c  and c    and tbox t  
if c  and c  are both potential matches for d w r t  t   and  c  t c     then p c    d  t   
p c    d  t  
intuitively  the above denition could be read of as  if c  t c  then c  should be penalized
 and then ranked  either the same  or better than c    in a phrase  a ranking of potential
matches is monotonic over subsumption if more specic means better  a dual property
could be stated for the second argument  if d  t d  then a counteroer c is less likely to
fulll all characteristics required by d  than d    however  since our scenario is  given an
issuer of a proposal d looking for a match in the marketplace  rank all possible counteroers
c    c            from the best one to the worst  we do not deal here with this duality between
rst and second argument of p       
when turning to partial matches  in which some properties are already in conict between supply and demand  the picture reverses  now  adding another characteristic to an
unsatisfactory proposal may only worsen this ranking  when another characteristic is violated  or keep it the same  when the new characteristic is not in conict   note that this
ranking should be kept dierent from the ranking for potential matches  after all  accepting
to discard one or more characteristics that we required is much worse than deciding which
proposal try rst among some potential ones 
definition   a penalty function for partial matches is antimonotonic over subsumption
whenever for every issued oer d  for every pair of counteroers c  and c    and tbox t  
if c  and c  are both partial matches for d w r t  t   and  c  t c     then p c    d  t   
p c    d  t  
intuitively  if c  t c  then c  should be penalized  and then ranked  either the same 
or worse than c    in other words  a ranking of partial matches is antimonotonic over
subsumption if more specic means worse  the same property should hold also for the
second argument  since concept conjunction is commutative 
when we need to distinguish between a penalty function for potential matches and one
for partial matches  we put a subscript  in the former  as p   and a subscript  for the
latter  as in q   
clearly  the above requirements are very general  and leave ample room for the denition
of penalty functions  a more subtle requirement would be that penalties should not change
when irrelevant details are added  e g   if a second hand computer is requested in a demand
dem  with no specication for the brand of the cpu  then a supply sup should be penalized
the same as another oer sup hascpu intel  however  instead of delving into irrelevance
and other logic related issues directly from penalties  we now borrow well known logical

reasoning frameworks in propositional knowledge representation  such a detour will give us
a sound and declarative way of dening penalties  dealing with irrelevance as a byproduct 
and more generally bring well studied non standard reasoning techniques into matchmaking 

   concept abduction
abduction  peirce        is a well known form of commonsense reasoning  usually aimed at
nding an explanation for some given symptoms or manifestations  here we introduce concept abduction in dls  showing how it can model potential matchmaking in a dl setting 
following the notation proposed by eiter and gottlob         we recall that a propositional
abduction problem is a triple h  m  t  where h  hypotheses  and m  manifestations 
are sets of literals  and t  theory  is a set of formulae  a solution for h  m  t  is an explanation e  h such that t  e is consistent  and t  e    m   we adapt this framework
to dls as follows 
definition   let l be a dl  c  d  be two concepts in l  and t be a set of axioms in
l  where both c and d are satisable in t   the concept abduction problem  cap  for
a given l  c  d  t   is nding  if possible  a concept h  l such that c  h t   and
c  h t d 
we use p as a symbol for a generic cap  and we denote with sol p  the set of all
solutions to a cap p  observe that in the denition  we limit the inputs of a cap to
satisable concepts c and d  since c unsatisable implies that the cap has no solution
at all  while d unsatisable leads to counterintuitive results  e g   c would be a solution
in that case   as propositional abduction extends implication  concept abduction extends concept subsumption  but dierently from propositional abduction  we do not make
any distinction between manifestations and hypotheses  which is usual when abduction is
used for diagnosis  in fact  when making hypotheses about e g   properties of goods in
e marketplaces  there is no point in making such a distinction  this uniformity implies that
there is always the trivial solution d to a non trivial cap l  c  d  t   as stated more
formally as follows 
proposition   let l be a dl  let c  d be concepts in l  and t an l tbox  then cd t
 if and only if d  sol l  c  d  t   
proof  if c  d is satisable in t   then d fullls both requirements of def     the rst
one by hypothesis and the second one because c  d t d is a tautology  on the other
hand  if d  sol l  c  d  t   then c  d t  by denition 
a simple interpretation of this property in our application domain  i e   matchmaking 
is that if we hypothesize for the counteroer c exactly all specications in d  then the
counteroer trivially meets given specicationsif it was compatible anyway  however  not
all solutions to a cap are equivalent when using concept abduction for matchmaking  to
make a simple example  suppose that already c t d  then  both h    d and h     
 among others  are solutions of l  c  d  t   yet  the solution h      tells the issuer of
d that c already meets all of ds specications  while the solution h    d is the least
   

fisemantic matchmaking as non monotonic reasoning  a description logic approach

informative solution from this point of view  hence  if we want to use abduction to highlight
most promising counteroers  minimal hypotheses must be dened 
definition   let p  l  c  d  t  be a cap  the set sol  p  is the subset of sol p 
whose concepts are maximal under t   the set sol  p  is the subset of sol p  whose
concepts have minimum length 
clearly  being maximal w r t  t is still a minimality criterion  since it means that no
unnecessary hypothesis is assumed  it can be proved that the two measures are incomparable 
proposition   there exists a cap p such that the two sets sol  p  and sol  p  are
incomparable 
proof  it is sucient to consider d   a   a   a    c   a    and t    b  a   a     the
logic is even propositional  then a   a   sol  l  c  d  t    b  sol  l  c  d  t   
and neither solution is in the other set 
the proof highlights that  although  minimality could be preferable for conciseness  it
is heavily dependent on t   in fact  for every concept h  sol p   it is sucient to add the
axiom a  h to get a  minimal solution a  on the other hand  also t  maximality has
some drawbacks  if concept disjunction  is present in l  then there is a single t  maximal
solution of p  that is equivalent to the disjunction of all solutions in sol p not a very
useful solution  making an analogy with abduction based diagnosis  console  dupre   
torasso         we could say that the disjunction of all possible explanations is not a very
informative explanation itselfalthough it is maximal w r t  implication  we note that
nding a  minimal solution is np hard for a tbox of depth    by a simple reduction from
set covering  colucci  di noia  di sciascio  donini    mongiello        
remark   it is interesting to analyze whether concept minimal rewriting techniquesas
dened by baader  kusters  and molitor       could be employed for computing some
minimal concept abduction  trying to rewrite c  d  the answer is denitely negative for
minimal length abduction  the length minimal solution b in the proof of proposition  
could not be obtained by rewriting c  d   a   a   a   a    in fact  a   b is not
an equivalent rewriting of the former concept  regarding t  maximality the answer is
more indirect  in fact  present rewriting techniques do not keep a subconcept xed in the
rewriting process  so consider a cap in which d   a    c   a    and t    b  a   a    
the only equivalent minimal rewriting of c  d is then b  in which a solution cannot be
identied since b cannot be separated into a concept cthe original oneand a concept
h that is a solution of the cap  it is open whether future extensions of rewriting might
keep a concept xed  and cope with this problem 
a third minimality criterion is possible for dls which admit cnf  as for l   aln  
definition   let p  l  c  d  t  be a cap in which l admits cnf  and assume that
concepts in sol p  are in cnf  the set sol  p  is the subset of sol p  whose concepts
are minimal conjunctions  i e   if c  sol  p  then no sub conjunction of c  at any level
of nesting  is in sol p   we call such solutions irreducible 
   

fidi noia  di sciascio   donini

it turns out that  minimality includes both t  maximality and  minimality 
proposition   for every cap p in which l admits a cnf  both sol  p  and sol  p 
are included in sol  p  
proof  by contraposition  if a concept h is not  minimal then there is another concept
h  a sub conjunction of hwhich is an  minimal solution  but  h       h   hence h is
not length minimal  the same for t  maximality  since every sub conjunction of a concept
h in cnf subsumes h  if h is not  minimal it is not t  maximal either 
the proof of proposition   can be modied to show that minimum length abduced
concepts are not unique  it is sucient to add another axiom b   a   a  to obtain
another minimum length solution b    a less obvious result is that also subsumptionmaximal solutions are not unique  at least in non simple tboxes  let p   l  c  d  t 
with t    a   a   a     c   a    d   a    then both a  and a  are t  maximal
solutions 
    irreducible solutions in aln  simple tboxes
we assume here that the tbox t of a cap p   l  c  d  t  is always a simple one  finding
an irreducible solution is easier than nding a  minimal or a t  maximal solution  since a
greedy approach can be used to minimize the set of conjuncts in the solution  for example 
starting from c  d  we could delete one redundant conjunct at a time  at any level of
role quantication nesting  from d  using  d  calls to a subsumption check procedure 
however  such an algorithm would be interesting only for theoretical purposes  instead  we
adapt a structural subsumption algorithm  borgida   patel schneider        that collects
all concepts h that should be conjoined to c in order for c  h to be subsumed by d 
the algorithm operates on concepts in cnf  in the following algorithm  we abbreviate the
fact that a concept a appears as a conjunct of a concept c with a  c  thus extending the
meaning of  to conjunctions of concepts  
algorithm ndirred  p  
input  a cap p   l  c  d  t   with l  aln   simple t   c and d in cnf w r t  t
output  concept h  sol  p   where h     means that c  d 
variables  concept h
begin
h      
   if d  c t 
return  
   for every concept name a in d
   
if a  c
then h    h  a 
   for every concept   n r   d
   
such that there is no concept   m r   c with m  n
h    h    n r  
   for every concept   n r   d
   

fisemantic matchmaking as non monotonic reasoning  a description logic approach

such that there is no concept   m r   c with m  n
h    h    n r  
   for every concept r e  d
   
if there exists r f  c
     
then h    h  r ndirred  aln   f  e  t   
     
else h    h  r e 
   now h  sol p   but it might be reducible   
   for every concept hi  h
if h without hi is in sol p 
then delete hi from h 
   return h 
end 
   

theorem   given a cap p  if ndirred  p  returns the concept h  with h    then h
is an irreducible solution of p 
proof  we rst prove that before step    the computed concept h is in sol p   that is 
both c  h t  and c  h t d hold  in fact  observe that cnf  d  t    h  since all
conjuncts of h come from some conjunct of cnf  d  t    hence  d t h since cnf  d  t  
is equivalent to d in the models of t   adding c to both sides of the subsumption yields
c  d t c  h  and since we assume that c  d t   also c  h t   this proves the
rst condition for h  sol p   regarding the condition c  h t d  suppose it does not
hold  then  at least one conjunct of cnf  d  t   should not appear in cnf  c  h  t    but
this is not possible by construction  since h contains every conjunct which is in cnf  d  t  
and not in cnf  c  t    therefore  we conclude that h  sol p   once we proved that
the h computed before step   is a solution of p  we just note that step   deletes enough
conjuncts to make h an irreducible solution 
the rst part of algorithm  before step    easily follows well known structural subsumption algorithms  borgida   patel schneider         step   applies a greedy approach  hence
the computed solution  although irreducible  might not be minimal 
we explain the need for the reducibility check in step   with the help of the following
example 
example   let t    a   a    a   a     and let c   a    d   a   a    then l is the
propositional part of al  the normal form for c is c    a   a    while d   a   a   a   
then before step   the algorithm computes h   a   a    which must still be reduced to
a    it is worth noticing that h is already subsumption maximal since h t a    however 
 minimality is a syntactic property  which requires removal of redundant conjuncts 
as for complexity  we aim at proving that nding an irreducible solution is not more
complex than subsumption in aln   a polynomial algorithm  w r t  the sizes of c  d
and t   cannot be expected anyway  since subsumption in al  the sublanguage of aln
without number restrictions  with a simple t is conp hard  nebel        calvanese        
however  nebel        argues that the unfolding of the tbox is exponential in the depth of
   

fidi noia  di sciascio   donini

the hierarchy t   if the depth of t grows as o log  t    as the size of t increasesa bushy
but not deep tboxthen its unfolding is polynomial  and so is the above algorithm 
more generally  suppose that t is xed  this is not an unrealistic hypothesis for our
marketplace application  since t represents the ontology of the domain  that we do not
expect to vary while supplies and demands enter and exit the marketplace  in that case  we
can analyze the complexity of ndirred considering only c and d for the size of the input
of the problem 
theorem   let p   l  c  d  t  be a cap  with l  aln   and t a simple tbox  then
nding an irreducible solution to p is a problem solvable in time polynomial in the size of
c and d 
we note that the problem of the exponential size unfolding might be mitigated by lazy
unfolding  horrocks   tobies         using this technique  concept names in the tbox are
unfolded only when needed 
    abduction based ranking of potential matches
we dene a penalty function p for potential matches based on the following intuition  the
ranking of potential matches should depend on how many hypotheses have to be made on
counteroers in order to transform them into full matches 
definition   given a simple tbox t in aln   we dene a penalty function for the potential match of a counteroer c given an oer d  where both c and d are concepts in
aln   as follows 
 
p  c  d  t      ndirred  aln   cnf  c  t    cnf  d  t      

   

note that  when computing p   a concept h is actually computed by ndirred as an
intermediate step  this makes it easy to devise an explanation facility  so that the actual
obtained ranking can be immediately enriched with its logical explanation  thus improving
users trust and interaction with the matchmaking system 
we now prove that p is in accordance with properties higlighted in the previous section 
since the computation of formula     starts by putting concepts c  d in normal form  we
recall that the normal form of c can be summarized as cnames  c  call   and similarly for
d  without ambiguity  we use the three components also as sets of the conjoined concepts 
theorem   the penalty function p is  i  non symmetric   ii  syntax independent  and
 iii  monotonic over subsumption 
proof 
 i  non symmetricity is easily proved by providing an example  p  a        
p     a     in fact  ndirred  aln   a       nds h      as a solution  a    without
further hypothesis  while ndirred  aln      a    nds h    a  recalling that         
while  a       we get the rst claim 
 ii  syntax independence follows from the fact that normal forms are used in formula     
and as already said normal forms are unique up to commutativity of conjunction 
   

fisemantic matchmaking as non monotonic reasoning  a description logic approach

 iii  monotonicity over subsumption is proved by analyzing the conditions for subsumption in aln   a concept c  is subsumed by a concept c whenever all conditions below
hold  for each condition  we analyze the changes in the behavior of ndirred   proving that
the provided solution h just adds other conjuncts  recall that monotonicity over subsumption is applied only to potential matches  hence we assume that both c and c  are
consistent with d  since ndirred is recursive  the proof is also by induction on the quantication nesting  qn  of c    for c  having qn equal to    c  can only be a conjunction
of atomic conceptsnames  negated names  number restrictions  then the conditions for
subsumption are the following 
 the rst condition is that cnames   c  names    hence  in step     of ndirred   the
number of concept names that are added to h  with respect to names added to h
can only decrease  and so  h      h  considering names  regarding negated names 
observe that they do not contribute to the solution of ndirred   since they come from
a disjointness axiom and a positive name  that contributes  
 the second condition is that for every number restriction in c   either the same
number restriction appears in c     or it is strengthened  an at least increases  an atmost decreases  in c     hence  number restrictions added by steps     and     to h 
can be either as many as those added to h  or less  again  also considering number
restrictions  h      h  
the above two cases prove the basis of the induction  c  with qn equal to     suppose now
the claim holds for concepts c  with qn n or less  and let c  have a qn of n      clearly 
in this case c  has at least one universal role quanticationcall it r f    the condition
for subsumption between c  and c is the following 
 either for every universal role quantication r f in c over the same role r  it must
hold f  t f   or there is no universal role quantication on r in c  in the former
case  observe that ndirred is recursively called  in step       with arguments f   e 
and f    e  we call i and i    respectively  the solutions returned by ndirred   observe
that the qn of f  is n or less  hence by inductive hypothesis  i      i   since step      
adds r i  and r i to h  and h  again  h      h   if instead there is no universal
role quantication on r in c  step       adds r e to h  if also c  does not contain
any role quantication on r  then step       adds r e also to h    then h  cannot
be longer than h in this case  if a role quantication r f  is in c    then step      
makes a recursive call with arguments f    e  in this case  the solution returned i 
has length less than or equal to  e   hence the length of h  cannot be longer than the
length of h also in this case 
in summary  if c  t c then in no case the length of h  increases with respect to the
length of h  this proves the monotonicity over subsumption of p  
intuitively  we could say that monotonicity over subsumption for potential matches means
the more specic c is  the lower its penalty  the better its ranking w r t  d  more
   findirred is called only once  because concepts in cnf have at most one universal role quantication
over any role r 

   

fidi noia  di sciascio   donini

preciselybut less intuitivelywe should say that the rank of c w r t  d cannot worsen
when c is made more specic  hence  given an oer d  a tbox t   a sequence of increasingly specic counteroers c  t c  t c  t    are assigned to a sequence of
non increasing penalties p  c    d  t    p  c    d  t    p  c    d  t          we now prove
that such sequences are well founded  with bottom element zero  reached in case of subsumption 
proposition   p  c  d  t       if and only if c t d 
proof 
recall from section     that   and  are the only concepts of length zero  and
ndirred returns  if and only if c and d are not in a potential match  step   in ndirred   
hence  p  c  d  t       if and only if the concept whose length is computed in formula    
is    by construction of ndirred     is returned by the call
ndirred  aln   cnf  c  t    cnf  d  t      if and only if cnf  c  t    cnf  d  t    which
holds  see borgida   patel schneider        if and only if c t d 
moreover  we could also prove that adding to c details that are irrelevant for d leaves the
penalty unaected  while adding to c details that are relevant for d lowers cs penalty 
note also that in formula     we take t into account in the normal form of c  d  but
then we forget itwe use an empty tboxwhen calling ndirred   we explain such a choice
with the aid of an example 
example   given t    a  a   a     let d   a be a demand with the two following
supplies  c    a    c       observe that cnf  d  t     a  a   a    cnf  c    t    
a    cnf  c    t        if we used the following formula to compute the penalty
 
p  c  d  t      ndirred  aln   c  d    

   

and ran the algorithm ndirred  aln   c    d  t   and ndirred  aln   c    d  t    before
step   we would get  respectively 
h    a   a
h    a   a   a
and after step   ndirred would return h    h    a  hence c  and c  would receive
the same penalty  however  we argue that c  is closer to d than c  is  because it contains a characteristic  a    implicitly required by d  while c  does not  if instead we call
ndirred  aln   cnf  c    t    cnf  d  t      and
ndirred  aln   cnf  c    t    cnf  d  t       we get the solutions h  and h  aboveand
step   does not delete any conjunct  since t     therefore  c  gets penalty    while c 
gets penalty    highlighting what is more specied in c  w r t  c   
more generally  we can say that the reducibility step  step   in ndirred   attens a solution
to its most specic conjuncts  leaving to the tbox the implicit representation of other
characteristics  both the ones already present in the supply and those not present  therefore 
making an empirical decision  we consider the tbox in the normal form of c and d  but
we exclude it from further reductions in step   of ndirred

remark   although the denition of concept abduction could appear similar to concept
dierence  it is not so  we note that generically speaking  the name concept abduction
appeals to logic  while concept dierence appeals to algebra  although dierence has
multiple solutions when l includes universal role quantication   more precisely  we recall
 teege        that dierence is dened as  c  d   max  e  l    e  d   c  provided
that c  d  a more specialized denition of dierence  brandt  kusters    turhan       
refers only to dls alc and ale  it is dened as  c  d   min  e  l    e  d  
 c  d  where c  e  alc  d  ale  and minimality is w r t  a preorder  on a specic
normal form which extends cnf to alc  no tbox is taken into account 
instead  the solution of a cap l  c  d  t  does not require that c t d  but only that
c  d t   in general  when d t c if we let h   d  c in a cap p   l  c  d  t 
we get those solutions for which c  h  dwhich obviously are not all solutions to p 
hence d  c  sol p   but not vice versa  see the proof of proposition   for an example  
when c t d this comparison is not even possible  since d  c is undened  however  in
a generic setting  e g   in an e commerce scenario  subsumption between demand and supply
is quite uncommon  most of oers are such that neither subsumes the other  because of this
greater generality  for our specic application to matchmaking  concept abduction seems
more suited than concept dierence to make a basis for a penalty function 

   concept contraction
if d  c is unsatisable in t   but the demander accepts to retract some of ds constraints 
partially matching supplies may be reconsidered  however  other logic based approaches
to matchmaking by trastour et al          sycara et al          li and horrocks       
usually exclude the case in which the concept expressing a demand is inconsistent with the
concept expressing a supply  assuming that all requirements are strict ones  in contrast 
we believe that inconsistent matches can still be useful  especially in e marketplaces  in
fact  partial  a k a  disjoint  matches can be the basis for a negotiation process  allowing
a user to specify negotiable requirementssome of which could be bargained in favor of
other  such a negotiation process can be carried out in various ways adopting approaches
to matchmaking not based on logic  e g   strobel   stolze         but also  as shown in
practice by colucci et al          using belief revision  in fact  the logical formalization
of conicting matches  aimed at nding still interesting inconsistent matches without
having to revert to text based or hybrid approaches  can be obtained exploiting denitions
typical of belief revision  in accordance with gardenfors        formalization  revision of
a knowledge base k with a new piece of knowledge a is a contraction operation  which


such that ka
   a  followed by the addition of a
results in a new knowledge base ka

to ka usually modeled by conjunction  we call concept contraction our adaptation of
belief revision to dls 
starting with c  d unsatisable in a tbox t   we model with concept contraction
how  retracting requirements in c  we may still obtain a concept k  for keep  such that
k  d is satisable in t   clearly  a user is interested in what he she must negotiate on to
start the transactiona concept g  for give up  such that c  g  k 
   

fidi noia  di sciascio   donini

for instance  with reference to the ontology in figure    if a user demands dem and a
supplier oers sup  where dem and sup are described as follows 
dem   homepc  hasmonitor lcdmonitor
sup   homepc  hasmonitor crtmonitor
it is possible to check that sup  dem is unsatisable  this is a partial match  yet  in this
case  if the demander gives up the concept g   hasmonitor lcdmonitor and keeps the
concept k   homepc  k  sup is satisable  hence k now potentially matches sup 
more formally we model a concept contraction problem as follows 
definition     concept contraction  let l be a dl  c  d  be two concepts in l  and
t be a set of axioms in l  where both c and d are satisable in t   a concept contraction
problem  ccp   denoted as l  c  d  t   is nding a pair of concepts g  k  l  l such
that t    c  gk  and k d is satisable in t   we call k a contraction of c according
to d and t  
we use q as a symbol for a ccp  and we denote with solccp  q  the set of all
solutions to a ccp q  observe that as for concept abduction  we rule out cases where
either c or d are unsatisable  as they correspond to counterintuitive situations  we note
that there is always the trivial solution g  k   c    to a ccp  this solution corresponds
to the most drastic contraction  that gives up everything of c  on the other hand  when
c  d is satisable in t   the best possible solution is    c  that is  give up nothing 
as concept abduction extends subsumption  concept contraction extends satisability
in particular  satisability of a conjunction c  d  hence  results about the complexity of
deciding satisability of a given concept carry over to contraction 
proposition   let l be a dl containing al  and let concept satisability w r t  a tbox
in l be a problem c hard for a complexity class c  then deciding whether a given pair of
concepts g  k is a solution of a ccp q  l  c  d  t  is c hard 
proof  a concept e  l is satisable w r t  a tbox t if and only if the ccp l  c  d  t 
has the solution    c  where c   r e and d   r    then  l should contain at least
universal role quantication  to express r e   unqualied existential role quantication
 to express r     conjunction  to express that c  g  k  and at least the unsatisable
concept   otherwise every concept is satisable  and the problem trivializes   the minimal  known dl containing all such constructs is the dl al 
this gives a lower bound on the complexity of concept contraction  for all dls that
include al  for dls not including al  note that if the proof showing c hardness of
satisability involves a concept with a topmost  symbol  the same proof could be adapted
for concept contraction 
obviously  a user in a marketplace is likely to be willing to give up as few things as
possible  so some minimality in the contraction g must be dened  we skip for conciseness
the denitions of a minimal length contraction and subsumption maximal contraction  and
dene straightforwardly conjunction minimal contraction for dls that admit a normal form
made up of conjunctions 
   

fisemantic matchmaking as non monotonic reasoning  a description logic approach

definition    let q  l  c  d  t  be a ccp in which l admits a cnf  the set solccp  q 
is the subset of solccp  q  with the following property  if g  k  solccp  q  then
for no sub conjunction g of g it holds g   k  solccp  q   we call such solutions
irreducible 
    number restriction minimal contractions
in what follows we focus on a specic class of irreducible solutions for a ccp aln   c  d  t 
exposing interesting characteristics from a user oriented point of view in a matchmaking
scenario  before dening such a class we explain the rationale behind its investigation using
the following example 
example   suppose we have the following situation 
demand dem   homepc  hasmonitor lcdmonitor
supply sup   server  hasmonitor crtmonitor
as t    dem  sup   the demander can contract dem in order to regain the satisability
with sup  two solutions for the ccp q   aln   dem  sup  t  are 


 g

  homepc
k   pc      hassoftware        hasos 


 hasmonitor lcdmonitor



g   hasmonitor lcdmonitor
k   homepc

in g   k  the demander should give up the specication on homepc  in g   k  the
demander should give up only some specications on the monitor type while keeping the
rest 
observe that both solutions are in the previously dened class solccp  q   but from
a user oriented point of view  g   k  seems the most reasonable solution to q  giving
up the homepc concept in demand then     hasmonitor  because of the axiom on
homepcthe demander keeps all the specications on requested components  but they are
vacuously true  since k  sup implies hasmonitor  i e   no component is admitted 
in order to make our intuition more precise  we introduce the number restriction minimal
solutions for q  whose set we denote solccpn  q   intuitively  a solution g  k for q is
in solccpn  q  when an at least restriction   n r  is in g only if it directly conicts
with an at most restriction   m r   with m   n  in d  solutions in which the atleast restriction is given up because of conicting universal role quanticationse g   r a
and r aare not in solccpn  q   since this characteristic of number restrictionminimal solutions should be enforced at any level of nesting  we rst introduce the role
path of a concept in aln   here we need to distinguish between a concept a and its
 dierent  occurrences in another concept  e g   b   a  r a  in theory  we should mark
each occurrence with a number  e g   a   r a    however  since we need to focus on one
occurrence at a time  we just mark it as a

definition    given a concept b in aln   and an occurrence a of an atomic  sub concept
a in b  a role path for a in b  a  b  is a string such that 
 a  a      where  denotes the empty string
 a  b   b      a  bi    where bi   i          is the concept in which the occurrence
of a appears
 a  r b    r  a  b   where  denotes string concatenation
the role path a  b  represents the role nesting of a concept a occurrence into a concept
b  note that a  b  is the same for any commutation of conjunctions in b  and for any
rearrangement of universal role quanticationsif a was not atomic  this would not be
true    using the previous denition we can now dene solccpn  q  
definition    let q   aln   c  d  t  be a ccp  the set solccpn  q  is the subset
of solutions g  k in solccp  q  such that if   n r  occurs in g then there exists
  m r   with m   n  occurring in cnf  d  t   and   n r   g      m r   cnf  d  t    
we now illustrate an algorithm ndcontract that returns a solution g  k  solccpn  q

or   x r   d with x     
then let g   k   be the result of ndcontract  f  e  in
g    g  r g  
replace r f in k with r k   
   return g  k 
end 
let us comment on the algorithm 
   the case in step   cannot occur at the top level  since we assumed c and d be satisable in the denition of ccp  however   may occur inside a universal quantication
e g   c   r hence  the case of step   may apply in a recursive call of ndcontract  
issued from step   of an outer call 
   in step    the conjunction    c is assigned to k in order to leave   in k if every
other concept is removed by the subsequent steps 
we denote by g   k  solutions for the ccp q   aln   cnf  c  t    cnf  d  t      in
this simplied ccp q   we completely unfold t in both c and d and then forget it 
theorem   the pair g  k computed by ndcontract  c  d  is a number restrictionminimal contraction for q   aln   cnf  c  t    cnf  d  t     
proof 
we rst prove that g  k is a solution for q   namely  that  i  g  k  c 
and that  ii  k  d is satisable  we prove  i  by induction  for the base cases  observe
that the claim is true in step   by construction  and that in steps    when a conjunct
is deleted from k  it is also added to g  hence the claim holds when no recursive call is
made  for the inductive case  assume the claim holds for each recursive call in step    that
is  g  k   f for every concept r f  kall   let gn   kn be the values of variables g  k
before the execution of step    and let kn be the concept kn without r f   then  after
step   it is 
g  k    by assigment 


gn  r g  kn  r k    by denition of  
gn  kn  r  g  k      by inductive hypothesis 
gn  kn  r f   by denition of kn  
gn  kn   since the base case holds before step   
c
regarding  ii   the proof is again by induction  where the inductive hypothesis is that
k   e is satisable  basically  we construct an interpretation    i   with an element x
such that x   k  d i   and show that we can keep constructing i without contradictions 
since contradicting concepts have been deleted from k  in the inductive case  we assume
the existence of an interpretation     j   for k   e such that y     k   e j   and then
ff


build a joint interpretation     i   by letting        i    i  j   x  y  ri   
we now prove that g  k is a number restriction minimal solution for q   the proof
is by induction on the quantication nesting  qn  of c  dened in section      observe
that an at least restriction is deleted from k only in step   of ndcontract   for the base
caseqn  c       no recursive callobserve that the role path of a retracted concept
   

fidi noia  di sciascio   donini

  n r  in g is   same as the role path of the concept   m r  in d causing step   to
be executed  hence  the claim holds in the base case  for the inductive case  assume that
the claim holds for all concepts with qns smaller than qn  c   observe that the concept
f in step   is such a concept  since its qn is smaller by at least    hence  if an  occurrence
of an  at least restriction   x r   with role path   x r   f   is deleted in f   there exists
a conicting at most restriction in e with the same role path  since both f and e occur
inside the scope of a concept r f   r e respectively  the claim still holds with role path
  x r   c    r    x r   f   

    contraction based ranking of partial matches
we now dene a penalty function p for partial matches based on the following intuition 
the partial matches should be ranked based on how many characteristics should be retracted
from each c to make them potential matches 
algorithm penaltypartial  c  d  
input aln concepts c  d  both already in cnf
output a penalty for the partial match between c and d
where zero means that c  d is satisable
variables integer n
begin
   if c   
then return  d      see comment     
   n     
   for each concept name a  cnames 
if there exists a concept a  dnames
then n    n     
   for each concept   x r   c
such that there is a concept   y r   d with y   x
n    n     
   for each concept   x r   c
such that there is a concept   y r   d with y   x
n    n     
   for each concept r f  call
if there exist r e  dall and  
either    x r   c and   y r   d with x  y     see comment     
or   x r   d with x     
then n    n   penaltypartial  f  e  
   return n 
end 
the above algorithm has a structure very similar to ndcontract   whenever ndcontract
removes concepts from k  penaltypartial adds penalties to n  the two dierences are
explained in the following comments 
   

fisemantic matchmaking as non monotonic reasoning  a description logic approach

   step   adds the whole length of d when c     this addition ensures antimonotonicity in the presence of   as explained in example   below 
   step   has in penaltypartial the additional condition and   y r   d with x  y 
this condition is necessary because penaltypartial does not actually remove concepts 
but just counts them  if an at least restriction in c is in contrast with an at most
restriction in d   then ndcontract removes it from k  while penaltypartial just adds
  to n  yet  when the condition in step   is evaluated  ndcontract nds it false just
because the at least restriction has been removed  while penaltypartial would nd it
true  were it not for the additional condition 
we now use the outcome of penaltypartial to dene a penalty function for partial matches 
definition    given a simple tbox t in aln   let the penalty function p for the partial
match of a counteroer c given an oer d  where both c and d are concepts in aln   be
as follows 
 
   
p  c  d  t     penaltypartial  cnf  c  t    cnf  d  t   
note that since penaltypartial closely follows ndcontract and ndirred   in fact formula    
is more similar to formula     in denition   than it might appear  implicitly  we solve
q   aln   cnf  c  t    cnf  d  t      and then use the result in the computation of the
penalty function  with a main dierence in step    though  we explain such a dierence
with the help of an example 
example   let dem   and dem   be two demands  where dem   t dem     and let sup be
a supply  all modeled using the ontology t in figure   as in the following 
dem     pc  hasmonitor crtmonitor
dem     pc  hasmonitor 
sup   homepc  hasmonitor lcdmonitor
computing ndcontract and penaltypartial for both cnf  dem     t   and cnf  dem     t  
w r t  cnf  sup  t   we obtain 
ndcontract  cnf  dem     t    cnf  sup  t      hasmonitor crtmonitor 
pc  hasmonitor monitor
penaltypartial  cnf  dem     t    cnf  sup  t       
ndcontract  cnf  dem     t    cnf  sup  t      hasmonitor   pc
penaltypartial  cnf  dem     t    cnf  sup  t       
in summary  the concept  conicts with every other concept  yet when a concept
r  is given up  its length is zero  or any other constant   hence the length of g cannot
be directly used as an antimonotonic penalty function  this explains the importance of
step   in the above algorithm 
we can show the following formal correspondence between p and the concept contraction
dened in the previous section 
   

fidi noia  di sciascio   donini

theorem   let q   aln   c  d  t  be a ccp  and let g   k  the solution to q returned by ndcontract  cnf  c  t    cnf  d  t     if g does not contain any occurrence of
the concept   then
p  c  d  t      g  
proof  the function p is based on penaltypartial   and by inspection  whenever penaltypartial
increments n  ndcontract adds an atomic concept to g   the only exception is in step  
of penaltypartial   which adds  d  while ndcontract adds  to g   however  this case is
explicitly outside the claim 
we now prove that p is in accordance with properties highlighted in the previous section 
theorem   the penalty function p is  i  non symmetric   ii  syntax independent  and
 iii  antimonotonic over subsumption 
proof 
 i  non symmetry is proven by example  let c       r   r a  d  
    r   r a  for simplicity  t     and observe that both c and d are already in
cnf  we now show that p  c  d      p  d  c     in fact  in the former case  observe that
c must give up everything  the at most restriction because it is in contrast with the at least
restriction  and a inside universal quantication because it is in contrast with r a in
d  hence  penaltypartial returns        from step         from step   of the recursive
call   hence  p  c  d         in the latter case  instead  once the at least restriction is
given up  and penaltypartial adds   to n in step     since role llers are no more imposed 
the universal quantication is now compatible  the condition of the if in step   is false  
hence p  d  c        
 ii  syntax independency is an immediate consequence of the fact that formula    
uses normal forms for concepts  since normal forms are unique up to commutativity of
conjunctionthat can be xed by imposing some order to conjunctions  e g   lexicographic
the claim holds 
 iii  antimonotonicity can be proved by induction on the qn of a generic concept c 
subsumed by c  we go through all conditions for subsumption  analyzing the changes in
the behavior of the algorithm from c to c    recall that our goal is now to prove that
p  c    d  t    p  c  d  t    in order to make a clear distinction between the two computations  we let n be the  instance of the  variable used in the call to penaltypartial  c    d  
while n is used in the call to penaltypartial  c  d   to ease notation  we assume that c  c 
are already in cnf 
 first of all  it could be the case that c      in this case  n    d  from step   of
penaltypartial   on the other hand  observe that penaltypartial  c  d    d  because
either c    too  or every increase in n corresponds to an atomic concept in dby
inspection of steps     and this recursively in step    therefore  the claim holds for
this base case 
 cnames  c  names   for this case  it is obvious that step   in penaltypartial can only
make more increments to n w r t  n  since for c  the number of iterations of the for
each increases 
   

fisemantic matchmaking as non monotonic reasoning  a description logic approach

 for every number restriction in c   either the same number restriction appears in c    
or it is strengthened  an at least increases  an at most decreases  in c     note that
strengthening a number restriction in c  can only turn from false to true the condition
for the increment of n in steps     for instance  passing from   x r   c to
  x r   c   with x  x  if there is   y r   d then y   x implies y   x   a
similar argument holds for the at most  moreover  number restrictions that appear
only in c   can only increase the number of iterations of steps     hence n can only
increase w r t  n and the claim holds 
the above three cases prove the basis of the induction  c  with qn equal to     we now
prove the case for universal role quantication  assuming that the claim holds for qns less
than qn  c    
 for every r f   c  all   either r is not universally quantied in call   or there is
r f  call such that f  is subsumed by f  with f    f as a special case of subsumption   roles which are not universally quantied in call but are quantied in c  all  
can only increase the number of iterations of step    hence n can only increase due to
their presence  for roles that have a more specic restriction f    the inductive hypothesis is assumed to hold  since qn  f      qn  c     hence p  f    e  t    p  f  e  t   
this is equivalent to penaltypartial  f    e   penaltypartial  f  e   moreover  if the
condition in step   is true in the call penaltypartial  c  d   then it is also true in
   and   x r   c    hence if the recursive
penaltypartial  c    d   since r f   call

call penaltypartial  f  e  is issued  then also penaltypartial  f    e  is issued  increasing
n at least as much as n is increased  by inductive hypothesis  hence the claim holds
also in the inductive case

owner is authorized to submit tells statements and change the kb as well as to submit
asks  in this case  requests from ip addresses dierent from the owners one can be
only asks  if the shared attribute is set to true  then no restriction is set on both
tells and asks statements  true is the default value 
 permanent  the only values to be used are true and false  in mamas  if a kb is
not used for more than     seconds  the kb is automatically released  if a user wants
to maintain the kb indenitely  the permanent attribute must be set to true  false
is the default value 
it should also be pointed out that mamas only supports simple tbox  that is  concept
axioms have a concept name on the left side   
we have been using mamas as matching engine in various applications  including emarketplaces   see e g   colucci  di noia  di sciascio  donini  ragone    rizzi       
colucci et al         and semantic web services discovery  ragone  di noia  di sciascio

    experimental evaluation
the hypothesis we seek to conrm in this section is that our approach performs eectively
in a wide range of matchmaking scenarios  i e   it is able to model commonsense human
behavior in analyzing and ranking  given a request  available oers  hence the experimental
framework relies on comparison of system behavior versus the judgement of human users 
furthermore  although our system may allow the use of weights to increase the relevance of
concepts  in the following results refer to the basic unweighted version of the system  to
avoid biasing of results due to weights introduction 
the scenarios we tested our approach on were three  apartments rental  date partner
nding  skill management for recruiting agencies  several ontology design methodologies
have been proposed  jones  bench capon    visser         we adopted the one proposed
by n f  noy and d l  mcguinness        
   notice that since mamas supports aln   only atomic negation can be expressed and then  disjoint  
groups must contain only concepts specialized by an  impliesc  axiom  sub concept axiom   dened
concepts  equalc    same class  are not admitted in a disjoint group 

   

fisemantic matchmaking as non monotonic reasoning  a description logic approach

for all three scenarios we carried out a thorough domain analysis  starting with a large
set of advertisements taken from newspapers or from descriptions of on line agencies  and
designed ontologies describing the domain  in particular 
 apartments rental ontology is made up of     concepts  primitive   dened  and   
roles 
 date partner matching ontology is made up of     concepts  primitive   dened 
and    roles 
 skill matching ontology is made up of     concepts  primitive   dened  and    roles 
for each scenario we selected several announcements  the total number used in the experiments with human users is          oers     requests  for the apartments rental     
     oers     requests  for the skill matching      advertisements for the date matching
scenario were also selected  yet for these we did not actually distinguish among requests
and oers as announcements were in the form of proles  although they included preferences
for dating partner  all announcements were in natural language and they were manually
translated in dl syntax  we then created  for each domain     sets of questionnaires 
questionnaires were in the form of one request  a demand or a supply  and    oering advertisements  three groups of ten randomly selected volunteers  were then asked to order 
according to their judgement advertisements  with respect to the given requests  having
obtained average users rankings  we run the same sets of advertisements with our system 
which gave us a set of system provided rankings  system rankings that included partial
matching advertisements were simply ordered below worst potential matching advertisement  we adopted  as reference  a standard vector space model  vsm   salton   gill 
      system  we used terms in our ontologies attening the ontology descriptions  as dimensions of three separate vector spaces  and determined weights using classical t f  idf
measure  similarity results were computed using the well known cosine similarity measure
 salton   gill        
to summarize results we adopted the rnorm  bollmann  jochum  reiner  weissmann 
  zuse        as quality measure of our system eectiveness  rnorm is dened as follows 
given sup  a nite set of descriptions with a user dened preference relation  that is
complete and transitive  let usr be the rank ordering of sup induced by users preference
relation  and let sys be the system provided ranking  rnorm is then dened as 
rnorm  sys    

s   s
 
     
 
 
 
smax

where s   is the number of descriptions pairs where a better description is ranked by the
system ahead of a worse one  s  is the number of pairs where a worse description is ranked
 
is the maximum possible number of s     it should be noticed
ahead of a better one and smax
 

that the calculation of s   s   and smax is based on the ranking of descriptions pairs in
sys relative to the ranking of corresponding descriptions pairs in usr   rnorm values are
in the range        a value of   corresponds to a system provided ordering of the available
descriptions that is either identical to the one provided by the human users or has a higher
degree of resolution  lower values correspond to a proportional disagreement between the
two  for the three scenarios considered  results are presented in table

although they present a variability  which we believe is partly due to the ability to
capture the domain in the ontologies design  they show that our approach provides rankings
that are close to human commonsense behavior and are far better than those obtained with
unstructured text retrieval tools 

   conclusion
we have addressed the matchmaking problem between descriptions from a dl perspective 
we have analyzed semantic based matchmaking process and devised general commonsense
properties a matchmaker should have  we have also pointed out that classical inference
services of dls  such as satisability and subsumption  are needed and useful  but may be
not sucient to cope with challenges posed by matchmaking in an open environment 
motivated by this we have studied concept abduction and contraction as novel nonmonotonic inferences in dls suitable for modeling semantic based matchmaking scenarios 
we analyzed minimality criteria  and proved simple complexity results  we also presented
reasonable algorithms for classifying and ranking matches based on the devised inferences
in terms of penalty functions  and proved that they obey to properties individuated 
although several other measures may be determined to compute a score for most
promising matches our proposal has logical foundations and we have empyrically shown it
is able to well simulate commonsense human reasoning  obviously  as any other semanticbased approach  also our own has to rely on well designed ontologies able to model the
application domain being considered 
based on the theoretical work we have implemented a fully functional matchmaking
facilitator  oriented to both generic e marketplace advertisements and to semantic based
web service discovery  which exploits state of art technologies and protocols  and it is  to
the best of our knowledge  the only running system able to cope with concept abduction
and concept contraction problems 
with specic reference to earlier work of the authors on the subject  di sciascio et al 
       dened matchmaking as satisability of concept conjunction  denitions of potential
match and near miss i e   partial match  in terms of abduction and belief revision were outlined  and the need for ranking of matches motivated  in the work of di sciascio  donini  and
mongiello         di noia et al       b      c  proposed a semantic based categorization of
matches  logic based ranking of matches within categories  and properties ranking functions
should have  in the framework of e marketplaces  an extended and revised version of such
works is in  di noia  di sciascio  donini    mongiello         di noia et al       a  intro   

fisemantic matchmaking as non monotonic reasoning  a description logic approach

duced concept abduction in dls and presented algorithms to solve a concept abduction
problem in aln   colucci et al         proposed both concept abduction and concept
contraction as inferences suitable for semantic matchmaking and explanation services  cal
et al         proposed a basic approach adopting penalty functions ranking  in the framework of dating systems  colucci et al         proposed initial results and algorithms based
on truth prexed tableau to solve concept abduction and contraction problems in aln  
colucci et al         showed that such services can be usefully adopted both for semanticmatchmaking and for nding negotiation spaces in an e commerce setting  the use of the
proposed inference services for renement purposes in the semantic matchmaking process
has been outlined in the work of colucci et al         
our current research is oriented to the investigation of algorithms for more expressive
dls and the development of a tableaux based system for the proposed inference services

appendix a  rules for normal form
the normal form of a concept can be obtained by repeatedly applying the rules of the two
following sections  until no rule is applicable at any level of nesting of concepts inside r c 
a   rules involving subconcepts
in the following rules  the  symbol on the l h s  should be considered as an associative and
commutative operator  hence  for instance  when writing   n r     m r  in the second
rule  this should be read as the concepts   n r  and   m r  appear in any order inside
a conjunction of two or more concepts 

c   
  n r     m r    if n   m
a  a  
  n r     m r     n r  if n   m
  n r     m r     n r  if n   m
r d   r d   r  d   d

a   rules involving the concept and the tbox

a  a  c if a  c  t
a  c if a  c  t
a  a  b       bk if disj  a  b            bk    t
usually the concept resulting from the application of the above rules is referred to as an
expansion  or unfolding of a tbox 
a   properties of the normal form
let c be a concept in classic  and let c  be any concept obtained from c by repeatedly
appying the above rules  let  c    c    denote the size of c  c  respectively  it can be proved
 borgida   patel schneider        that 
   if  c    is polynomially bounded in  c   then c  can be computed in time o  c     
   every concept resulting from the application of the rules is equivalent to c  w r t 
models of the tbox 
as a consequence of the latter property  c is unsatisable i its normal form is   then 
as a consequence of the former property  unsatisability can be decided in polynomial time
 borgida   patel schneider         the fact that  c    is polynomially bounded in  c  has
been intuitively related by nebel        to the form of tboxes  that should be bushy but
not deep  a more precise denition has been given by colucci et al
