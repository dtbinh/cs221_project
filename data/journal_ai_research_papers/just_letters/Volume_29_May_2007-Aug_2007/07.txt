abstract
reputation mechanisms offer an effective alternative to verification authorities for building trust in electronic markets with moral hazard  future clients guide their business decisions by considering the feedback from past transactions  if truthfully exposed  cheating
behavior is sanctioned and thus becomes irrational 
it therefore becomes important to ensure that rational clients have the right incentives
to report honestly  as an alternative to side payment schemes that explicitly reward truthful reports  we show that honesty can emerge as a rational behavior when clients have a
repeated presence in the market  to this end we describe a mechanism that supports an
equilibrium where truthful feedback is obtained  then we characterize the set of paretooptimal equilibria of the mechanism  and derive an upper bound on the percentage of false
reports that can be recorded by the mechanism  an important role in the existence of this
bound is played by the fact that rational clients can establish a reputation for reporting
honestly 

   introduction
the availability of ubiquitous communication through the internet is driving the migration of business transactions from direct contact between people to electronically mediated
interactions  people interact electronically either through human computer interfaces or
through programs representing humans  so called agents  in either case  no physical interactions among entities occur  and the systems are much more susceptible to fraud and
deception 
traditional methods to avoid cheating involve cryptographic schemes and trusted third
parties  ttps  that overlook every transaction  such systems are very costly  introduce
potential bottlenecks  and may be difficult to deploy due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the environment  e g   agents in different geographical locations may be subject to
different legislation  or different interaction protocols 
reputation mechanisms offer a novel and effective way of ensuring the necessary level
of trust which is essential to the functioning of any market  they are based on the observation that agent strategies change when we consider that interactions are repeated  the other
party remembers past cheating  and changes its terms of business accordingly in the future 
therefore  the expected gains due to future transactions in which the agent has a higher
reputation can offset the loss incurred by not cheating in the present  this effect can be amc

plified considerably when such reputation information is shared among a large population 
and thus multiplies the expected future gains made accessible by honest behavior 
existing reputation mechanisms enjoy huge success  systems such as ebay  or amazon 
implement reputation mechanisms which are partly credited for the businesses success 
studies show that human users seriously take into account the reputation of the seller when
placing bids in online auctions  houser   wooders         and that despite the incentive
to free ride  feedback is provided in more than half of the transactions on ebay  resnick  
zeckhauser        
one important challenge associated with designing reputation mechanisms is to ensure
that truthful feedback is obtained about the actual interactions  a property called incentivecompatibility  rational users can regard the private information they have observed as a
valuable asset  not to be freely shared  worse even  agents can have external incentives
to misreport and thus manipulate the reputation information available to other agents
 harmon         without proper measures  the reputation mechanism will obtain unreliable
information  biased by the strategic interests of the reporters 
honest reporting incentives should be addressed differently depending on the predominant role of the reputation mechanisms  the signaling role is useful in environments where
the service offered by different providers may have different quality  but all clients interacting with the same provider are treated equally  markets with adverse selection   this
is the case  for example  in a market of web services  different providers possess different
hardware resources and employ different algorithms  this makes certain web services better
than others  nevertheless  all requests issued to the same web service are treated by the
same program  some clients might experience worse service than others  but these differences are random  and not determined by the provider  the feedback from previous clients
statistically estimates the quality delivered by a provider in the future  and hence signals
to future clients which provider should be selected 
the sanctioning role  on the other hand  is present in settings where service requests
issued by clients must be individually addressed by the provider  think of a barber  who
must skillfully shave every client that walks in his shop  the problem here is that providers
must exert care  and costly effort  for satisfying every service request  good quality can
result only when enough effort was exerted  but the provider is better off by exerting less
effort  e g   clients will anyway pay for the shave  so the barber is better off by doing a sloppy
job as fast as possible in order to have time for more customers  this moral hazard situation
can be eliminated by a reputation mechanism that punishes providers for not exerting effort 
low effort results in negative feedback that decreases the reputation  and hence the future
business opportunities of the provider  the future loss due to a bad reputation offsets the
momentary gain obtained by cheating  and makes cooperative behavior profitable 
there are well known solutions for providing honest reporting incentives for signaling
reputation mechanisms  since all clients interacting with a service receive the same quality
 in a statistical sense   a clients private observation influences her belief regarding the
experience of other clients  in the web services market mentioned before  the fact that one
client had a bad experience with a certain web service makes her more likely to believe
that other clients will also encounter problems with that same web service  this correlation

fiobtaining reliable feedback for sanctioning reputation mechanisms

between the clients private belief and the feedback reported by other clients can be used
to design feedback payments that make honesty a nash equilibrium  when submitting
feedback  clients get paid an amount that depends both on the the value they reported
and on the reports submitted by other clients  as long as others report truthfully  the
expected payment of every client is maximized by the honest report  thus the equilibrium 
miller  resnick  and zeckhauser        and jurca and faltings        show that incentivecompatible payments can be designed to offset both reporting costs and lying incentives 
for sanctioning reputation mechanisms the same payment schemes are not guaranteed to
be incentive compatible  different clients may experience different service quality because
the provider decided to exert different effort levels  the private beliefs of the reporter
may no longer be correlated to the feedback of other clients  and therefore  the statistical
properties exploited by miller et al         are no longer present 
as an alternative  we propose different incentives to motivate honest reporting based
on the repeated presence of the client in the market  game theoretic results  i e   the folk
theorems  show that repeated interactions support new equilibria where present deviations
are made unattractive by future penalties  even without a reputation mechanism  a client
can guide her future play depending on the experience of previous interactions  as a first
result of this paper  we describe a mechanism that indeed supports a cooperative equilibrium
where providers exert effort all the time  the reputation mechanism correctly records when
the client received low quality 
there are certainly some applications where clients repeatedly interact with the same
seller with a potential moral hazard problem  the barber shop mentioned above is one
example  as most people prefer going to the same barber  or hairdresser   another example
is a market of delivery services  every package must be scheduled for timely delivery 
and this involves a cost for the provider  some of this cost may be saved by occasionally
dropping a package  hence the moral hazard  moreover  business clients typically rely
on the same carrier to dispatch their documents or merchandise  as their own business
depends on the quality and timeliness of the delivery  they do have the incentive to form a
lasting relationship and get good service  yet another example is that of a business person
who repeatedly travels to an offshore client  the business person has a direct interest to
repeatedly obtain good service from the hotel which is closest to the clients offices 
we assume that the quality observed by the clients is also influenced by environmental
factors outside the control of  however observable by  the provider  despite the barbers
best effort  a sudden movement of the client can always generate an accidental cut that will
make the client unhappy  likewise  the delivery company may occasionally lose or damage
some packages due to transportation accidents  nevertheless  the delivery company  like
the barber  eventually learns with certainty about any delays  damages or losses that entitle
clients to complain about unsatisfactory service 
the mechanism we propose is quite simple  before asking feedback from the client  the
mechanism gives the provider the opportunity to acknowledge failure  and reimburse the
client  only when the provider claims good service does the reputation mechanism record
the feedback of the client  contradictory reports  the provider claims good service  but the
client submits negative feedback  may only appear when one of the parties is lying  and
therefore  both the client and the provider are sanctioned  the provider suffers a loss as a
consequence of the negative report  while the client is given a small fine 
   

fijurca   faltings

one equilibrium of the mechanism is when providers always do their best to deliver
the promised quality  and truthfully acknowledge the failures caused by the environmental
factors  their honest behavior is motivated by the threat that any mistake will drive
the unsatisfied client away from the market  when future transactions generate sufficient
revenue  the provider does not afford to risk losing a client  hence the equilibrium 
unfortunately  this socially desired equilibrium is not unique  clients can occasionally
accept bad service and keep returning to the same provider because they dont have better
alternatives  moreover  since complaining for bad service is sanctioned by the reputation
mechanism  clients might be reluctant to report negative feedback  penalties for negative
reports and the clients lack of choice drives the provider to occasionally cheat in order to
increase his revenue 
as a second result  we characterize the set of pareto optimal equilibria of our mechanism
and prove that the amount of unreported cheating that can occur is limited by two factors 
the first factor limits the amount of cheating in general  and is given by the quality of
the alternatives available to the clients  better alternatives increase the expectations of the
clients  therefore the provider must cheat less in order to keep his customers 
the second factor limits the amount of unreported cheating  and represents the cost
incurred by clients to establish a reputation for reporting the truth  by stubbornly exposing
bad service when it happens  despite the fine imposed by the reputation mechanism  the
client signals to the provider that she is committed to always report the truth  such signals
will eventually change the strategy of the provider to full cooperation  who will avoid the
punishment for negative feedback  having a reputation for reporting truthfully is of course 
valuable to the client  therefore  a rational client accepts to lie  and give up the reputation 
only when the cost of building a reputation for reporting honestly is greater than the
occasional loss created by tolerated cheating  this cost is given by the ease with which
the provider switches to cooperative play  and by the magnitude of the fine imposed for
negative feedback 
concretely  this paper proceeds as follows  in section   we describe related work  followed by a more detailed description of our setting in section    section   presents a game
theoretic model of our mechanism and an analysis of reporting incentives and equilibria 
here we establish the existence of the cooperative equilibrium  and derive un upper bound
on the amount of cheating that can occur in any pareto optimal equilibrium 
in section   we establish the cost of building a reputation for reporting honestly  and
hence compute an upper bound on the percentage of false reports recorded by the reputation
mechanism in any equilibrium 
we continue in section   by analyzing the impact of malicious buyers that explicitly
try to destroy the reputation of the provider  we give some initial approximations on the
worst case damage such buyers can cause to providers  further discussions  open issues and
directions for future work are discussed in section    finally  section   concludes our work 

   related work
the notion of reputation is often used in game theory to signal the commitment of a player
towards a fixed strategy  this is what we mean by saying that clients establish a reputation
for reporting the truth  they commit to always report the truth  building a reputation
   

fiobtaining reliable feedback for sanctioning reputation mechanisms

usually requires some incomplete information repeated game  and can significantly impact
the set of equilibrium points of the game  this is commonly referred to as the reputation
effect  first characterized by the seminal papers of kreps  milgrom  roberts  and wilson
        kreps and wilson        and milgrom and roberts        
the reputation effect can be extended to all games where a player  a  could benefit
from committing to a certain strategy  that is not credible in a complete information
game  e g   a monopolist seller would like to commit to fight all potential entrants in a
chain store game  selten         however  this commitment is not credible due to the cost
of fighting  in an incomplete information game where the commitment type has positive
probability  as opponent  b  can at some point become convinced that a is playing as if
she were the commitment type  at that point  b will play a best response against   which
gives a the desired payoff  establishing a reputation for the commitment strategy requires
time and cost  when the higher future payoffs offset the cost of building reputation  the
reputation effect prescribes minimum payoffs any equilibrium strategy should give to player
a  otherwise  a can profitably deviate by playing as if she were a commitment type  
fudenberg and levine        study the class of all repeated games in which a long run
player faces a sequence of single shot opponents who can observe all previous games  if the
long run player is sufficiently patient and the single shot players have a positive prior belief
that the long run player might be a commitment type  the authors derive a lower bound on
the payoff received by the long run player in any nash equilibrium of the repeated game 
this result holds for both finitely and infinitely repeated games  and is robust against further
perturbations of the information structure  i e   it is independent of what other types have
positive probability  
schmidt        provides a generalization of the above result for the two long run player
case in a special class of games called of conflicting interests  when one of the players is
sufficiently more patient than the opponent  a game is of conflicting interests when the
commitment strategy of one player  a  holds the opponent  b  to his minimax payoff  the
author derives an upper limit on the number of rounds b will not play a best response to
as commitment type  which in turn generates a lower bound on as equilibrium payoff  for
a detailed treatment of the reputation effect  the reader is directed to the work of mailath
and samuelson        
in computer science and information systems research  reputation information defines
some aggregate of feedback reports about past transactions  this is the semantics we are
using when referring to the reputation of the provider  reputation information encompasses
a unitary appreciation of the personal attributes of the provider  and influences the trusting
decisions of clients  depending on the environment  reputation has two main roles  to signal
the capabilities of the provider  and to sanction cheating behavior  kuwabara        
signaling reputation mechanisms allow clients to learn which providers are the most
capable of providing good service  such systems have been widely used in computational
trust mechanisms  birk        and biswas  sen  and debnath        describe systems
where agents use their direct past experience to recognize trustworthy partners  the global
efficiency of the market is clearly increased  however  the time needed to build the reputation
information prohibits the use of this kind of mechanisms in a large scale online market 
a number of signaling reputation mechanisms also take into consideration indirect reputation information  i e   information reported by peers  schillo  funk  and rovatsos

and yu and singh              use social networks in order to obtain the reputation of an
unknown agent  agents ask acquaintances several hops away about the trustworthiness of
an unknown agent  recommendations are afterwards aggregated into a single measure of
the agents reputation  this class of mechanisms  however intuitive  does not provide any
rational participation incentives for the agents  moreover  there is little protection against
untruthful reporting  and no guarantee that the mechanism cannot be manipulated by a
malicious provider in order to obtain higher payoffs 
truthful reporting incentives for signaling reputation mechanisms are described by
miller et al          honest reports are explicitly rewarded by payments that take into
account the value of the submitted report  and the value of a report submitted by another
client  called the reference reporter    the payment schemes are designed based on proper
scoring rules  mathematical functions that make possible the revelation of private beliefs
 cooke         the essence behind honest reporting incentives is the observation that the
private information a client obtains from interacting with a provider changes her belief regarding the reports of other clients  this change in beliefs can be exploited to make honesty
an ex ante nash equilibrium strategy 
jurca and faltings        extend the above result by taking a computational approach
to designing incentive compatible payment schemes  instead of using closed form scoring
rules  they compute the payments using an optimization problem that minimizes the total
budget required to reward the reporters  by also using several reference reports and filtering
mechanisms  they render the payment mechanisms cheaper and more practical 
dellarocas        presents a comprehensive investigation of binary sanctioning reputation mechanisms  as in our setting  providers are equally capable of providing high quality 
however  doing so requires costly effort  the role of the reputation mechanism is to encourage cooperative behavior by punishing cheating  negative feedback reduces future revenues
either by excluding the provider from the market  or by decreasing the price the provider
can charge in future transactions  dellarocas shows that simple information structures and
decision rules can lead to efficient equilibria  given that clients report honestly 
our paper builds upon such mechanisms by addressing reporting incentives  we will abstract away the details of the underlying reputation mechanism through an explicit penalty
associated with a negative feedback  given that such high enough penalties exist  any reputation mechanism  i e   feedback aggregation and trusting decision rules  can be plugged
in our scheme 
in the same group of work that addresses reporting incentives  we mention the work of
braynov and sandholm         dellarocas        and papaioannou and stamoulis        
braynov and sandholm consider exchanges of goods for money and prove that a market
in which agents are trusted to the degree they deserve to be trusted is equally efficient as
a market with complete trustworthiness  by scaling the amount of the traded product 
the authors prove that it is possible to make it rational for sellers to truthfully declare
their trustworthiness  truthful declaration of ones trustworthiness eliminates the need of
reputation mechanisms and significantly reduces the cost of trust management  however 
the assumptions made about the trading environment  i e  the form of the cost function and
the selling price which is supposed to be smaller than the marginal cost  are not common
in most electronic markets 
   

fiobtaining reliable feedback for sanctioning reputation mechanisms

for e bay like auctions  the goodwill hunting mechanism  dellarocas        provides a
way to make sellers indifferent between lying or truthfully declaring the quality of the good
offered for sale  momentary gains or losses obtained from misrepresenting the goods quality
are later compensated by the mechanism which has the power to modify the announcement
of the seller 
papaioannou and stamoulis        describe an incentive compatible reputation mechanism that is particularly suited for peer to peer applications  their mechanism is similar to
ours  in the sense that both the provider and the client are punished for submitting conflicting reports  the authors experimentally show that a class of common lying strategies are
successfully deterred by their scheme  unlike their results  our paper considers all possible
equilibrium strategies and sets bounds on the amount of untruthful information recorded
by the reputation mechanism 

   the setting
we assume an online market  where rational clients  she  repeatedly request the same service from one provider  he   every client repeatedly interacts with the service provider 
however  successive requests from the same client are always interleaved with enough requests generated by other clients  transactions are assumed sequential  the provider does
not have capacity constraints  and accepts all requests 
the price of service is p monetary units  and the service can have either high  q    or
low  q    quality  only high quality is valuable to the clients  and has utility u q      u 
low quality has utility    and can be precisely distinguished from high quality  before each
round  the client can decide to request the service from the provider  or quit the market and
resort to an outside provider that is completely trustworthy  the outside provider always
delivers high quality service  but for a higher price p       
if the client decides to interact with the online provider  she issues a request to the
provider  and pays for the service  the provider can now decide to exert low  e    or high
 e    effort when treating the request  low effort has a normalized cost of    but generates
only low quality  high effort is expensive  normalized cost equals c e      c  and generates
high quality with probability        is fixed  and depends on the environmental factors
outside the control of the provider  p   c  so that it is individually rational for providers
to exert effort 
after exerting effort  the provider can observe the quality of the resulting service  he
can then decide to deliver the service as it is  or to acknowledge failure and roll back the
transaction by fully reimbursing  the client  we assume perfect delivery channels  such
that the client perceives exactly the same quality as the provider  after delivery  the client
inspects the quality of service  and can accuse low quality by submitting a negative report
to the reputation mechanism 
the reputation mechanism  rm  is unique in the market  and trusted by all participants 
it can oversee monetary transactions  i e   payments made between clients and the provider 
and can impose fines on all parties  however  the rm does not observe the effort level
exerted by the provider  nor does it know the quality of the delivered service 
   in reality  the provider might also pay a penalty for rolling back the transaction  as long as this penalty
is small  the qualitative results we present in this paper remain valid 

   

fijurca   faltings

the rm asks feedback from the client only if she chose to transact with the provider in
the current round  i e   paid the price of service to the provider  and the provider delivered
the service  i e   provider did not reimburse the client   when the client submits negative
feedback  the rm punishes both the client and the provider  the client must pay a fine  
and the provider accumulates a negative reputation report 
    examples
although simplistic  this model retains the main characteristics of several interesting applications  a delivery service for perishable goods  goods that lose value past a certain
deadline  is one of them  pizza  for example  must be delivered within    minutes  otherwise it gets cold and loses its taste  hungry clients can order at home  or drive to a
more expensive local restaurant  where theyre sure to get a hot pizza  the price of a home
delivered pizza is p      while at the restaurant  the same pizza would cost p             
in both cases  the utility of a warm meal is u     
the pizza delivery provider must exert costly effort to deliver orders within the deadline 
a courier must be dispatched immediately  high effort   for an estimated cost of c       
while such action usually results in good service  the probability of a timely delivery is
         traffic conditions and unexpected accidents  e g   the address is not easily found 
may still delay some deliveries past the deadline 
once at the destination  the delivery person  as well as the client  know if the delivery
was late or not  as it is common practice  the provider can acknowledge being late  and
reimburse the client  clients may provide feedback to a reputation mechanism  but their
feedback counts only if they were not reimbursed  the clients fine for submitting a negative
report can be set for example at          the future loss to the provider caused by the
negative report  and quantified through   depends on the reputation mechanism 
a simplified market of car garagists or plumbers could fit the same model  the provider
is commissioned to repair a car  respectively the plumbing  and the quality of the work
depends on the exerted effort  high effort is more costly but ensures a lasting result with
high probability  low effort is cheap  but the resulting fix is only temporary  in both
cases  however  the warranty convention may specify the right of the client to ask for a
reimbursement if problems reoccur within the warranty period  reputation feedback may
be submitted at the end of the warranty period  and is accepted only if reimbursements
didnt occur 
an interesting emerging application comes with a new generation of web services that
can optimally decide how to treat every request  for some service types  a high quality
response requires the exclusive use of costly resources  for example  computation jobs
require cpu time  storage requests need disk space  information requests need queries to
databases  sufficient resources  is a prerequisite  but not a guarantee for good service 
software and hardware failures may occur  however  these failures are properly signaled
to the provider  once monetary incentives become sufficiently important in such markets 
intelligent providers will identify the moral hazard problem  and may act strategically as
identified in our model

   behavior and reporting incentives
from game theoretic point of view  one interaction between the client and the provider can
be modeled by the extensive form game  g  with imperfect public information  shown in
figure    the client moves first and decides  at node    whether to play in and interact
with the provider  or to play out and resort to the trusted outside option 
once the client plays in  the provider can chose at node   whether to exert high or
low effort  i e   plays e  or e  respectively   when the provider plays e  the generated
quality is low  when the provider plays e    nature chooses between high quality  q    with
probability   and low quality  q    with probability      the constant  is assumed
common knowledge in the market  having seen the resulting quality  the provider delivers
 i e   plays d  the service  or acknowledges low quality and rolls back the transaction  i e  
plays l  by fully reimbursing the client  if the service is delivered  the client can report
positive     or negative     feedback 
a pure strategy is a deterministic mapping describing an action for each of the players
information sets  the client has three information sets in the game g  the first information
set is singleton and contains the node   at the beginning of game when the client must
decide between playing in or out  the second information set contains the nodes   and  
 the dotted oval in figure    where the client must decide between reporting   or    given
that she has received low quality  q    the third information set is singleton and contains the
node   where the client must decide between reporting   or    given that she received high
quality  q    the strategy in q   q    for example  is the honest reporting strategy  specifying
that the client enters the game  reports   when she receives low quality  and reports   when
she receives high quality  the set of pure strategies of the client is 
ac    out q   q    out q   q    out q   q    out q   q    in q   q    in q   q    in q   q    in q   q    
similarly  the set of pure strategies of the provider is 
ap    e  l  e  d  e  lq  lq    e  lq  dq    e  dq  lq    e  dq  dq    
where e  lq  dq    for example  is the socially desired strategy  the provider exerts effort at
node    acknowledges low quality at node    and delivers high quality at node    a pure
strategy profile s is a pair  sc   sp   where sc  ac and sp  ap   if  a  denotes the set of
probability distributions over the elements of a  c   ac   and p   ap   are mixed
strategies for the client  respectively the provider  and     c   p   is a mixed strategy
profile 
the payoffs to the players
depend on the chosen strategy profile  and on the move

of nature  let g     gc     gp    denote the pair of expected payoffs received by
the client  respectively by the provider when playing strategy profile   the function g  
 ac     ap    r  is characterized in table   and also describs the normal form
transformation of g  besides the corresponding payments made between the client and
the provider  table   also reflects the influence of the reputation mechanism  as further
explained in section      the four strategies of the client that involve playing out at node  
generate the same outcomes  and therefore  have been collapsed for simplicity into a single
row of table

    the reputation mechanism
for every interaction  the reputation mechanism records one of the three different signals it
may receive  positive feedback when the client reports    negative feedback when the client
reports    and neutral feedback when the provider rolls back the transaction and reimburses
the client  in figure    and table    positive and neutral feedback do not influence the
payoff of the provider  while negative feedback imposes a punishment equivalent to  
two considerations made us choose this representation  first  we associate neutral and
positive feedback with the same reward    in this case  because intuitively  the acknowledgement of failure may also be regarded as honest behavior on behalf of the provider 
failures occur despite best effort  and by acknowledging them  the provider shouldnt suffer 
however  neutral feedback may also result because the provider did not exert effort  the
lack of punishment for these instances contradicts the goal of the reputation mechanism to

table    normal transformation of the extensive form game  g
encourage exertion of effort  fortunately  the action e  l can be the result of rational behavior
only in two circumstances  both excusable  one  when the provider defends himself against
a malicious client that is expected to falsely report negative feedback  details in section
    and two  when the environmental noise is too big   is too small  to justify exertion of
effort  neutral feedback can be used to estimate the parameter   or to detect coalitions
of malicious clients  and indirectly  may influence the revenue of the provider  however 
for the simplified model presented above  positive and neutral feedback are considered the
same in terms of generated payoffs 
the second argument relates to the role of the rm to constrain the revenue of the
provider depending on the feedback of the client  there are several ways of doing that 
dellarocas        describes two principles  and two mechanisms that punish the provider
when the clients submit negative reports  the first  works by exclusion  after each negative
report the reputation mechanism bans the provider from the market with probability  
this probability can be tuned such that the provider has the incentive to cooperate almost
all the time  and the market stays efficient  the second works by changing the conditions
of future trade  every negative report triggers the decrease of the price the next n clients
will pay for the service  for lower values of n the price decrease is higher  nonetheless  n
can take any value in an efficient market 
both mechanisms work because the future losses offset the momentary gain the provider
would have had by intentionally cheating on the client  note that these penalties are given
endogenously by lost future opportunities  and require some minimum premiums for trusted
providers  when margins are not high enough  providers do not care enough about future
transactions  and will use the present opportunity of cheating 
another option is to use exogenous penalties for cheating  for example  the provider
may be required to buy a licence for operating in the market    the licence is partially
destroyed by every negative feedback  totaly destroyed licences must be restored through
a new payment  and remaining parts can be sold if the provider quits the market  the
price of the licence and the amount that is destroyed by a negative feedback can be scaled
   the reputation mechanism can buy and sell market licences

such that rational providers have the incentive to cooperate  unlike the previous solutions 
this mechanism does not require minimum transaction margins as punishments for negative
feedback are directly subtracted from the upfront deposit 
one way or another  all reputation mechanisms foster cooperation because the provider
associates value to client feedback  let v  r    and v  r   be the value of a positive  respectively a negative report  in the game in figure    v  r    is normalized to    and v  r  
is   by using this notation  we abstract away the details of the reputation mechanism 
and retain only the essential punishment associated with negative feedback  any reputation mechanism can be plugged in our scheme  as long as the particular constraints  e g  
minimum margins for transactions  are satisfied 
one last aspect to be considered is the influence of the reputation mechanism on the
future transactions of the client  if negative reports attract lower prices  rational long run
clients might be tempted to falsely report in order to purchase cheaper services in the future 
fortunately  some of the mechanisms designed for single run clients  do not influence the
reporting strategy of long run clients  the reputation mechanism that only keeps the last
n reports  dellarocas        is one of them  a false negative report only influences the
next n transactions of the provider  given that more than n other requests are interleaved
between any two successive requests of the same client  a dishonest reporter cannot decrease
the price for her future transactions 
the licence based mechanism we have described above is another example  the price
of service remains unchanged  therefore reporting incentives are unaffected  on the other
hand  when negative feedback is punished by exclusion  clients may be more reluctant to
report negatively  since they also lose a trading partner 
    analysis of equilibria
the one time game presented in figure   has only one subgame equilibrium where the client
opts out  when asked to report feedback  the client always prefers to report    reporting
  attracts the penalty    knowing this  the best strategy for the provider is to exert low
effort and deliver the service  knowing the provider will play e  d  it is strictly better for
the client to play out 
the repeated game between the same client and provider may  however  have other
equilibria  before analyzing the repeated game  let us note that every interaction between a
provider and a particular client can be strategically isolated and considered independently 
as the provider accepts all clients and views them identically  he will maximize his expected
revenue in each of the isolated repeated games 
from now on  we will only consider the repeated interaction between the provider and
one client  this can be modeled by a t  fold repetition of the stage game g  denoted gt  
where t is finite or infinite  in this paper we will deal with the infinite horizon case  however 
the results obtained can also be applied with minor modifications to finitely repeated games
where t is large enough 
if  is the per period discount factor reflecting the probability that the market ceases
to exist after each round   or the present value of future revenues   let us denote by  the
expected discount factor in the game gt   if our client interacts with the provider on the
average every n rounds      n

while completely characterizing the set of ppe payoffs for discount factors strictly
smaller than   is outside the scope of this paper  let us note the following results 
first  if the discount factor is high enough  but strictly less than    with respect to the
profit margin obtained by the provider from one interaction  there is at least one ppe such
that the reputation mechanism records only honest reports  moreover  this equilibrium is
pareto optimal 
proposition   when

the strategy profile 

 the provider always exerts high effort  and delivers only high quality  if the client
deviates from the equilibrium   the provider switches to e  d for the rest of the rounds 
   

fiobtaining reliable feedback for sanctioning reputation mechanisms

 the client always reports   when asked to submit feedback  if the provider deviates 
 i e   she receives low quality   the client switches to out for the rest of the rounds 
is a pareto optimal ppe 
proof  it is not profitable for the client to deviate from the equilibrium path  reporting
  attracts the penalty  in the present round  and the termination of the interaction with
the provider  the provider stops exerting effort from that round onwards  
the provider  on the other hand  can momentarily gain by deviating to e  dq  dq  or e  d 
a deviation to e  dq  dq  gives an expected momentary gain of p      and an expected
continuation loss of       p  c   a deviation to e  d brings an expected momentary
gain equal to      p   c and an expected continuation loss of p  c  for the discount
factor satisfying our hypothesis  both deviations are not profitable  the discount factor
is low enough with respect to profit margins  such that the future revenues given by the
equilibrium strategy offset the momentary gains obtained by deviating 
the equilibrium payoff profile is  vc   vp       u  p   p  c   which is pareto optimal
and socially efficient 

second  we can prove that the client never reports negative feedback in any paretooptimal ppe  regardless the value of the discount factor  the restriction to pareto optimal
is justifiable by practical reasons  assuming that the client and the provider can somehow
negotiate the equilibrium they are going to play  it makes most sense to choose one of the
pareto optimal equilibria 
proposition   the probability that the client reports negative feedback on the equilibrium
path of any pareto optimal ppe strategy is zero 
sketch of proof  the full proof presented in appendix a follows the following steps 
step    all equilibrium payoffs can be expressed by adding the present round payoff to the
discounted continuation payoff from the next round onward  step    take the ppe payoff
profile v    vc   vp    such that there is no other ppe payoff profile v      vc    vp   with
vc   vc    the client never reports negative feedback in the first round of the equilibrium
that gives v   step    the equilibrium continuation payoff after the first round also satisfies
the conditions set for v   hence  the probability that the client reports negative feedback on
the equilibrium path that gives v is    pareto optimal ppe payoff profiles clearly satisfy
the definition of v   hence the result of the proposition 

the third result we want to mention here  is that there is an upper bound on the
percentage of false reports recorded by the reputation mechanism in any of the paretooptimal equilibria 
proposition   the upper bound on the percentage of false reports recorded by the reputation mechanism in any ppe equilibrium is

fijurca   faltings

sketch of proof  the full proof presented in appendix b builds directly on the result of
proposition    since clients never report negative feedback along pareto optimal equilibria 
the only false reports recorded by the reputation mechanism appear when the provider
delivers low quality  and the client reports positive feedback  however  any ppe profile
must give the client at least vc   u  p        otherwise the client is better off by resorting
to the outside option  every round in which the provider deliberatively delivers low quality
gives the client a payoff strictly smaller than u  p        an equilibrium payoff greater
than vc is therefore possible only when the percentage of rounds where the provider delivers
low quality is bounded  the same bound limits the percentage of false reports recorded by
the reputation mechanism 

for a more intuitive understanding of the results presented in this section  let us refer
to the pizza delivery example detailed in section      the price of a home delivered pizza is
p      while at the local restaurant the same pizza would cost p              the utility of
a warm pizza to the client is u      the cost of delivery is c       and the probability that
unexpected traffic conditions delay the delivery beyond the    minutes deadline  despite
the best effort of the provider  is            
the client can secure a minimax payoff of vc   u  p             by always going
out to the restaurant  however  the socially desired equilibrium happens when the client
orders pizza at home  and the pizza service exerts effort to deliver pizza in time  in this
case the payoff of the client is vc    u  p          while the payoff of the provider is
vp   p  c        
proposition   gives a lower bound on the discount factor of the pizza delivery service
such that repeated clients can expect the socially desired equilibrium  this bound is   
p
p    c         assuming that the daily discount factor of the pizza service is          
the same client must order pizza at home at least once every   weeks  the values of the
discount factors can also be interpreted in terms of the minimum number of rounds the
client  and the provider  will likely play the game  for example  the discount factor can be
viewed as the probability that the client  respectively the provider  will live for another
interaction in the market  it follows that the average lifetime of the provider is at least
              interactions  with all clients   while the average lifetime of the client is at
least             interactions  with the same pizza delivery service   these are clearly
realistic numbers 
proposition   gives an upper bound on the percentage of false reports that our mechanism may record in equilibrium from the clients  as u                     p  this limit
is 
 

p
      
u

it follows that at least     of the reports recorded by our mechanism  in any equilibrium 
are correct  the false reports  false positive reports  result from rare cases where the pizza
delivery is intentionally delayed to save some cost but clients do not complain  the false
report can be justified  for example  by the providers threat to refuse future orders from
clients that complain  given that late deliveries are still rare enough  clients are better off
with the home delivery than with the restaurant  hence they accept the threat  as other
options become available to the clients  e g   competing delivery services  the bound  will
decrease 
   

fiobtaining reliable feedback for sanctioning reputation mechanisms

please note that the upper bound defined by proposition   only depends on the outside
alternative available to the provider  and is not influenced by the punishment  introduced
by the reputation mechanism  this happens because the revenue of a client is independent
of the interactions of other clients  and therefore  on the reputation information as reported
by other clients  equilibrium strategies are exclusively based on the direct experience of
the client  in the following section  however  we will refine this bound by considering that
clients can build a reputation for reporting honestly  there  the punishment  plays an
important role 

   building a reputation for truthful reporting
an immediate consequence of propositions   and   is that the provider can extract all of the
surplus created by the transactions by occasionally delivering low quality  and convincing
the clients not to report negative feedback  providers can do so by promising sufficiently high
continuation payoffs that prevent the client to resort to the outside provider   assuming
that the provider has more power in the market  he could influence the choice of the
equilibrium strategy to one that gives him the most revenue  and holds the clients close to
the minimax payoff vc   u  p       given by the outside option  
however  a client who could commit to report honestly   i e   commit to play the strategy
sc   in q   q    would benefit from cooperative trade  the providers best response against
sc is to play e  lq  dq  repeatedly  which leads the game to the socially efficient outcome 
unfortunately the commitment to sc is not credible in the complete information game  for
the reasons explained in section     
following the results of kreps et al          fudenberg and levine        and schmidt
       we know that such honest reporting commitments may become credible in a game
with incomplete information  suppose that the provider has incomplete information in g  
and believes with non negative probability that he is facing a committed client that always
reports the truth  a rational client can then fake the committed client  and build a
reputation for reporting honestly  when the reputation becomes credible  the provider
will play e  lq  dq   the best response against sc    which is better for the client than the
payoff she would obtain if the provider knew she was the rational type 
as an effect of reputation building  the set of equilibrium points is reduced to a set
where the payoff to the client is higher than the payoff obtained by a client committed to
report honestly  as anticipated from proposition    a smaller set of equilibrium points also
reduces the bound of false reports recorded by the reputation mechanism  in certain cases 
this bound can be reduced to almost zero 
formally  incomplete information can be modeled by a perturbation of the complete
information repeated game g such that in period    before the first round of the game is
played  the type of the client is drawn by nature out of a countable set  according to
the probability measure   the clients payoff now additionally depends on her type  we
   all pareto optimal ppe payoff profiles are also renegotiation proof  bernheim   ray        farrell  
maskin         this follows from the proof of proposition    the continuation payoffs enforcing a paretooptimal ppe payoff profile are also pareto optimal  therefore  clients falsely report positive feedback
even under the more restrictive notion of negotiation proof equilibrium

say that in the perturbed game g    the provider has incomplete information because he
is not sure about the true type of the client 
two types from  have particular importance 
 the normal type of the client  denoted by     is the rational client who has the
payoffs presented in figure   
 the commitment type of the client  denoted by    always prefers to play the commitment strategy sc   from a rational perspective  the commitment type client obtains
an arbitrarily high supplementary reward for reporting the truth  this external reward makes the strategy sc the dominant strategy  and therefore  no commitment
type client will play anything else than sc  
in theorem   we give an upper bound kp on the number of times the provider delivers
low quality in g     given that he always observes the client reporting honestly 
the intuition behind this result is the following  the providers best response to a
honest reporter is e  lq  dq    always exert high effort  and deliver only when the quality is
high  this gives the commitment type client her maximum attainable payoff in g    
corresponding to the socially efficient outcome  the provider  however  would be better off
by playing against the normal type client  against whom he can obtain an expected payoff
greater than p  c 
the normal type client may be distinguished from a commitment type client only in
the rounds when the provider delivers low quality  the commitment type always reports
negative feedback  while the normal type might decide to report positive feedback in order
to avoid the penalty   the provider can therefore decide to deliver low quality to the client
in order to test her real type  the question is  how many times should the provider test
the true type of the client 
every failed test  i e   the provider delivers low quality and the client reports negative
feedback  generates a loss of  to the provider  and slightly enforces the belief that the
client reports honestly  since the provider cannot wait infinitely for future payoffs  there
must be a time when the provider will stop testing the type of the provider  and accepts to
play the socially efficient strategy  e  lq  dq   
the switch to the socially efficient strategy is not triggered by a revelation of the clients
type  the provider believes that the client behaves as if she were a commitment type  not
that the client is a commitment type  the client may very well be a normal type who
chooses to mimic the commitment type  in the hope that she will obtain better service from
the provider  however  further trying to determine the true type of the client is too costly
for the provider  therefore  the provider chooses to play e  lq  dq    which is the best response
to the commitment strategy sc  
theorem   if the provider has incomplete information in g   and assigns positive probability to the normal and commitment type of the client                          there
is a finite upper bound  kp   on the number of times the provider delivers low quality in any
equilibrium of g     this upper bound is

fiobtaining reliable feedback for sanctioning reputation mechanisms

proof  first  we use an important result obtained by fudenberg and levine        about
statistical inference  lemma     if every previously delivered low quality service was sanctioned by a negative report  the provider must expect with increasing probability that his
next low quality delivery will also be sanctioned by negative feedback  technically  for any
      the provider can deliver at most n   low quality services  sanctioned by negative
feedback  before expecting that the n       low quality delivery will also be sanctioned by
negative feedback with probability greater then   this number equals to

n

as stated earlier  this lemma does not prove that the provider will become convinced
that he is facing a commitment type client  it simply proves that after a finite number of
rounds the provider becomes convinced that the client is playing as if she were a commitment
type

second  if    v     
but is strictly smaller than    the rational provider does
p
not deliver low quality  it is easy to verify that the maximum discounted future gain does
not compensate for the risk of getting a negative feedback in the present round   by the
previously mentioned lemma  it must be that in any equilibrium  the provider delivers low
quality a finite number of times 
third  let us analyze the round  t  when the provider is about to deliver a low quality
service  play dq    for the last time  if  is the belief of the provider that the client reports
honestly in round t  his expected payoff  just before deciding to deliver the low quality
service  can be computed as follows 
 with probability  the client reports    her reputation for reporting honestly becomes
credible  so the provider plays e  lq  dq  in all subsequent rounds  the provider gains
p   in the current round  and expects p  c for the subsequent rounds 
 with probability    the client reports   and deviates from the commitment strategy 
the provider knows he is facing a rational client  and can choose a continuation ppe
strategy from the complete information game  he gains p in the current round  and
expects at most vp in the subsequent rounds 
vp        p         p  c         vp  

on the other hand  had the provider acknowledged the low quality and rolled back the
transaction  i e   play lq     his expected payoff would have been at least 
vp             p  c 

since the provider chooses nonetheless to play dq  it must be that vp  vp  which is
equivalent to 
 

 vp  p   c         p
 vp  p   c         

   

   

fijurca   faltings

finally  by replacing equation     in the definition of n   we obtain the upper bound
on the number of times the provider delivers low quality service to a client committed to
report honestly 

the existence of kp further reduces the possible equilibrium payoffs a client can get in
g     consider a rational client who receives for the first time low quality  she has the
following options 
 report negative feedback and attempt to build a reputation for reporting honestly 
her payoff for the current round is p    moreover  her worst case expectation for
the future is that the next kp    rounds will also give her p    followed by the
commitment payoff equal to  u  p  
vc            p           kp     p       kp  u  p  

   

 on the other hand  by reporting positive feedback she reveals to be a normal type 
loses only p in the current round  and expects a continuation payoff equal to vc given
by a ppe strategy profile of the complete information game g  
vc            p     vc  

   

the reputation mechanism records false reports only when clients do not have the incentive to build a reputation for reporting honestly  and vc      vc     this is true for 
vc    kp    u  p        kp     p     

 
 


following the argument of proposition   we can obtain a bound on the percentage of
false reports recorded by the reputation mechanism in a pareto optimal ppe that gives the
client at least vc

so the probability of recording a false report  after the first one  can be arbitrarily close to
  as     
for the pizza delivery example introduced in section      figure   plots the bound  kp  
defined in theorem    as a function of the prior belief      of the provider that the client
is an honest reporter  we have used a value of the discount factor equal to          such
that on average  every client interacts              times with the same provider  the
penalty for negative feedback was taken         when the provider believes that     of

figure    the upper bound kp as a function of the prior belief    
the clients always report honestly  he will deliver at most   times low quality  when the
belief goes up to         no rational provider will deliver low quality more than once 
in figure   we plot the values of the bounds   equation      and   equation      as
a function of the prior belief     the bounds simultaneously hold  therefore the maximum
percentage of false reports recorded by the reputation mechanism is the minimum of the
two  when   is less       kp         and the reputation effect does not significantly
reduce the worst case percentage of false reports recorded by the mechanism  however  when
               the reputation mechanism records  in the worst case  only half as many false
reports  and as          the percentage of false reports drops to        this probability
can be further decreased by decreasing the penalty   in the limit  as  approaches    the
reputation mechanism will register a false report with vanishing probability 
the result of theorem   has to be interpreted as a worst case scenario  in real markets 
providers that already have a small predisposition to cooperate will defect fewer times 
moreover  the mechanism is self enforcing  in the sense that the more clients act as commitment types  the higher will be the prior beliefs of the providers that new  unknown clients
will report truthfully  and therefore the easier it will be for the new clients to act as truthful
reporters 
as mentioned at the end of section      the bound  strongly depends on the punishment
 imposed by the reputation mechanism for a negative feedback  the higher   the easier it
is for clients to build a reputation  and therefore  the lower the amount of false information
recorded by the reputation mechanism 

   the threat of malicious clients
the mechanism described so far encourages service providers to do their best and deliver
good service  the clients were assumed rational  or committed to report honestly  and

in either case  they never report negative feedback unfairly  in this section  we investigate
what happens when clients explicitly try to hurt the providers by submitting fake negative
ratings to the reputation mechanism 
an immediate consequence of fake negative reports is that clients lose money  however 
the costs  of a negative report would probably be too small to deter clients with separate agendas from hurting the provider  fortunately  the mechanism we propose naturally
protects service providers from consistent attacks initiated by malicious clients 
formally  a malicious type client      obtains a supplementary  external  payoff 
for reporting negative feedback  obviously   has to be greater than the penalty   otherwise
the results of proposition   would apply  in the incomplete information game g     the
provider now assigns non zero initial probability to the belief that the client is malicious 
when only the normal type      the honest reporter type  and the malicious type
 have non zero initial probability  the mechanism we describe is robust against unfair
negative reports  the first false negative report exposes the client as being malicious  since
neither the normal  nor the commitment type report   after receiving high quality  by
bayes law  the providers updated belief following a false negative report must assign
probability   to the malicious type  although providers are not allowed to refuse service
requests  they can protect themselves against malicious clients by playing e  l  i e   exert
low effort and reimburse the client afterwards  the rm records neutral feedback in this
case  and does not sanction the provider  against e  l  malicious clients are better off by
quitting the market  opt out   thus stopping the attack  the rm records at most one false
negative report for every malicious client  and assuming that identity changes are difficult 
providers are not vulnerable to unfair punishments 
   

fiobtaining reliable feedback for sanctioning reputation mechanisms

when other types  besides      and    have non zero initial probability  malicious
clients are harder to detect  they could masquerade client types that are normal  but
accidentally misreport  it is not rational for the provider to immediately exclude  by playing
e  l  normal clients that rarely misreport  the majority of the cooperative transactions
rewarded by positive feedback still generate positive payoffs  let us now consider the
client type        that behaves exactly like the normal type  but misreports   instead
of   independently with probability   when interacting with the client type       the
provider receives the maximum number of unfair negative reports when playing the efficient
equilibrium  i e   e  lq  dq    in this case  the providers expected payoff is 
vp   p  c    

since vp has to be positive  the minimax payoff of the provider is    given by e  l   it must
be that   pc
  
the maximum value of  is also a good approximation for the maximum percentage
of false negative reports the malicious type can submit to the reputation mechanism  any
significantly higher number of harmful reports exposes the malicious type and allows the
provider to defend himself 
note  however  that the malicious type can submit a fraction  of false reports only
when the type      has positive prior probability  when the provider does not believe that
a normal client can make so many mistakes  even if the percentage of false reports is still
low enough to generate positive revenues  he attributes the false reports to a malicious type 
and disengages from cooperative behavior  therefore  one method to reduce the impact of
malicious clients is to make sure that normal clients make few or no mistakes  technical
means  for example by providing automated tools for formatting and submitting feedback  
or improved user interfaces  that make it easier for human users to spot reporting mistakes 
will greatly limit the percentage of mistakes made by normal clients  and therefore  also
reduce the amount of harm done by malicious clients 
one concrete method for reducing mistakes is to solicit only negative feedback from the
clients  the principle that no news is good news  also applied by dellarocas          as
reporting involves some conscious decision  mistakes will be less frequent  on the other
hand  the reporting effort will add to the penalty for a negative report  and makes it harder
for normal clients to establish a reputation for honest reporters  alternative methods for
reducing the harm done by malicious clients  like filtering mechanisms  etc     as well as
tighter bounds on the percentage of false reports introduced by such clients will be further
addressed in future work 

   discussion and future work
further benefits can be obtained if the clients reputation for reporting honestly is shared
within the market  the reports submitted by a client while interacting with other providers
will change the initial beliefs of a new provider  as we have seen in section    providers
cheat less if they a priory expect with higher probability to encounter honest reporting
clients  a client that has once built a reputation for truthfully reporting the providers
behavior will benefit from cooperative trade during her entire lifetime  without having to
convince each provider separately  therefore the upper bound on the loss a client has to
withstand in order to convince a provider that she is a commitment type  becomes an upper

bound on the total loss a client has to withstand during her entire lifetime in the market 
how to effectively share the reputation of clients within the market remains an open issue 
correlated with this idea is the observation that clients that use our mechanism are
motivated to keep their identity  in generalized markets where agents are encouraged to
play both roles  e g  a peer   peer file sharing market where the fact that an agent acts
only as provider can be interpreted as a strong indication of double identity with the
intention of cheating  our mechanism also solves the problem signaled by friedman and
resnick        related to cheap online pseudonyms  the price to pay for the new identity
is the loss due to building a reputation as truthful reporter when acting as a client 
unlike incentive compatible mechanism that pay reporters depending on the feedback
provided by peers  the mechanism described here is less vulnerable to collusion  the only
reason individual clients would collude is to badmouth  i e   artificially decrease the reputation of  a provider  however  as long as the punishment for negative feedback is not
super linear in the number of reports  this is usually the case   coordinating within a coalition brings no benefits for the colluders  individual actions are just as effective as the actions
when part of a coalition  the collusion between the provider and client can only accelerate the synchronization of strategies on one of the ppe profiles  collusion on a non ppe
strategy profile is not stable   which is rather desirable  the only profitable collusion can
happen when competitor providers incentivize normal clients to unfairly downrate their
current provider  colluding clients become malicious in this case  and the limits on the
harm they can do are presented in section   
the mechanism we describe here is not a general solution for all online markets  in
general retail e commerce  clients dont usually interact with the same service provider more
than once  as we have showed along this paper  the assumption of a repeated interaction
is crucial for our results  nevertheless  we believe there are several scenarios of practical
importance that do meet our requirements  e g   interactions that are part of a supply chain  
for these  our mechanism can be used in conjunction with other reputation mechanisms to
guarantee reliable feedback and improve the overall efficiency of the market 
our mechanism can be further criticized for being centralized  the reputation mechanism acts as a central authority by supervising monetary transactions  collecting feedback
and imposing penalties on the participants  however  we see no problem in implementing
the reputation mechanism as a distributed system  different providers can use different
reputation mechanisms  or  can even switch mechanisms given that some safeguarding measures are in place  concrete implementations remain to be addressed by future work 
although we present a setting where the service always costs the same amount  our
results can be easily extended to scenarios where the provider may deliver different kinds
of services  having different prices  as long as the provider believes that requests are
randomly drawn from some distribution  the bounds presented above can be computed
using the average values of u  p and c  the constraint on the providers belief is necessary
in order to exclude some unlikely situations where the provider cheats on a one time high
value transaction  knowing that the following interactions carry little revenue  and therefore 
cannot impose effective punishments 
in this paper  we systematically overestimate the bounds on the worst case percentage
of false reports recorded by the mechanism  the computation of tight bounds requires a
precise quantitative description of the actual set of ppe payoffs the client and the provider
   

fiobtaining reliable feedback for sanctioning reputation mechanisms

can have in g   fudenberg et al         and abreu  pearce  and stacchetti        pose
the theoretical grounds for computing the set of ppe payoffs in an infinitely repeated game
with discount factors strictly smaller than    however  efficient algorithms that allow us to
find this set are still an open question  as research in this domain progresses  we expect to
be able to significantly lower the upper bounds described in sections   and   
one direction of future research is to study the behavior of the above mechanism when
there is two sided incomplete information  i e  the client is also uncertain about the type
of the provider  a provider type of particular importance is the greedy type who always
likes to keep the client to a continuation payoff arbitrarily close to the minimal one  in this
situation we expect to be able to find an upper bound kc on the number of rounds in which a
rational client would be willing to test the true type of the provider  the condition kp   kc
describes the constraints on the parameters of the system for which the reputation effect
will work in the favor of the client  i e  the provider will give up first the psychological
war and revert to a cooperative equilibrium 
the problem of involuntary reporting mistakes briefly mentioned in section   needs
further addressing  besides false negative mistakes  reporting   instead of     normal clients
can also make false positive mistakes  report   instead of the intended     in our present
framework  one such mistake is enough ro ruin the reputation of a normal type client to
report honestly  this is one of the reasons why we chose a sequential model where the
feedback of the client is not required if the provider acknowledges low quality  once the
reputation of the client becomes credible  the provider always rolls back the transactions that
generate  accidentally or not  low quality  so the client is not required to continuously defend
her reputation  nevertheless  the consequences of reporting mistakes in the reputation
building phase must be considered in more detail  similarly  mistakes made by the provider 
monitoring and communication errors will also influence the results presented here 
last  but not the least  practical implementations of the mechanism we propose must
address the problem of persistent online identities  one possible attack created by easy
identity changes has been mentioned in section    malicious buyers can continuously change
identity in order to discredit the provider  in another attack  the provider can use fake
identities to increase his revenue  when punishments for negative feedback are generated
endogenously by decreased prices in a fixed number of future transactions  e g   dellarocas 
       the provider can adopt the following strategy  he cheats on all real customers  but
generates a sufficient number of fake transactions in between two real transactions  such
that the effect created by the real negative report disappears  an easy fix to this latter
attack is to charge transaction or entrance fees  however  these measures also affect the
overall efficiency of the market  and therefore  different applications will most likely need
individual solutions 

   conclusions
effective reputation mechanisms must provide appropriate incentives in order to obtain
honest feedback from self interested clients  for environments characterized by adverse
selection  direct payments can explicitly reward honest information by conditioning the
amount to be paid on the information reported by other peers  the same technique unfortunately does not work when service providers have moral hazard  and can individually

decide which requests to satisfy  sanctioning reputation mechanisms must therefore use
other mechanisms to obtain reliable feedback 
in this paper we describe an incentive compatible reputation mechanism when the clients
also have a repeated presence in the market  before asking feedback from the clients  we
allow the provider to acknowledge failures and reimburse the price paid for service  when
future transactions generate sufficient profit  we prove that there is an equilibrium where
the provider behaves as socially desired  he always exerts effort  and reimburses clients that
occasionally receive bad service due to uncontrollable factors  moreover  we analyze the
set of pareto optimal equilibria of the mechanism  and establish a limit on the maximum
amount of false information recorded by the mechanism  the bound depends both on the
external alternatives available to clients and on the ease with which they can commit to
reporting the truth

by continuing the recursion  we obtain that the client never reports   on the equilibrium
path that enforces a payoff profile as defined in step    pareto optimal payoff profiles clearly
enter this category  hence the result of the proposition
