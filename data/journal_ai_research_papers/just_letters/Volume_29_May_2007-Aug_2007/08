formulate ranking requirements referring properties penalty functions

use penalty functions rank counteroers c given demand  or supply  w r t

p c    d    issuer oer rank c  better c  deciding

hence  c among top ranked counteroers list potential partners

so  penalty function p       expected metric distance function 
secondly  logic used give meaning descriptions supplies demands 
proposals meaning equally penalized  independently
syntactic descriptions
