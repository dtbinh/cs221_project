   introduction
availability ubiquitous communication internet driving migration business transactions direct contact people electronically mediated
interactions  people interact electronically either human computer interfaces
programs representing humans  so called agents  either case  physical interactions among entities occur  systems much susceptible fraud
deception 
traditional methods avoid cheating involve cryptographic schemes trusted third
parties  ttps  overlook every transaction  systems costly  introduce
potential bottlenecks  may difficult deploy due complexity heterogeneity environment  e g   agents different geographical locations may subject
different legislation  different interaction protocols 
reputation mechanisms offer novel effective way ensuring necessary level
trust essential functioning market  based observation agent strategies change consider interactions repeated 
party remembers past cheating  changes terms business accordingly future 
therefore  expected gains due future transactions agent higher

plified considerably reputation information shared among large population 
thus multiplies expected future gains made accessible honest behavior 
existing reputation mechanisms enjoy huge success  systems ebay  amazon 
implement reputation mechanisms partly credited businesses success 
studies show human users seriously take account reputation seller

one important challenge associated designing reputation mechanisms ensure
truthful feedback obtained actual interactions  property called incentivecompatibility  rational users regard private information observed
valuable asset  freely shared  worse even  agents external incentives
misreport thus manipulate reputation information available agents
 harmon         without proper measures  reputation mechanism obtain unreliable
information  biased strategic interests reporters 
honest reporting incentives addressed differently depending predominant role reputation mechanisms  signaling role useful environments
service offered different providers may different quality  clients interacting provider treated equally  markets adverse selection  
case  example  market web services  different providers possess different
hardware resources employ different algorithms  makes certain web services better
others  nevertheless  requests issued web service treated
program  clients might experience worse service others  differences random  determined provider  feedback previous clients
statistically estimates quality delivered provider future  hence signals
future clients provider selected 
sanctioning role  hand  present settings service requests
issued clients must individually addressed provider  think barber 
must skillfully shave every client walks shop  problem providers
must exert care  and costly effort  satisfying every service request  good quality
result enough effort exerted  provider better exerting less
effort  e g   clients anyway pay shave  barber better sloppy
job fast possible order time customers  moral hazard situation
eliminated reputation mechanism punishes providers exerting effort 
low effort results negative feedback decreases reputation  hence future
business opportunities provider  future loss due bad reputation offsets
momentary gain obtained cheating  makes cooperative behavior profitable 
well known solutions providing honest reporting incentives signaling
reputation mechanisms  since clients interacting service receive quality
 in statistical sense   clients private observation influences belief regarding
experience clients  web services market mentioned before  fact one
client bad experience certain web service makes likely believe
clients encounter problems web service  correlation

clients private belief feedback reported clients used
design feedback payments make honesty nash equilibrium  submitting
feedback  clients get paid amount depends value reported
reports submitted clients  long others report truthfully 
expected payment every client maximized honest report thus equilibrium 
miller  resnick  zeckhauser        jurca faltings        show incentivecompatible payments designed offset reporting costs lying incentives 
sanctioning reputation mechanisms payment schemes guaranteed
incentive compatible  different clients may experience different service quality
provider decided exert different effort levels  private beliefs reporter
may longer correlated feedback clients  therefore  statistical
properties exploited miller et al         longer present 
alternative  propose different incentives motivate honest reporting based
repeated presence client market  game theoretic results  i e   folk
theorems  show repeated interactions support new equilibria present deviations
made unattractive future penalties  even without reputation mechanism  client
guide future play depending experience previous interactions  first
result paper  describe mechanism indeed supports cooperative equilibrium
providers exert effort time  reputation mechanism correctly records
client received low quality 
certainly applications clients repeatedly interact
seller potential moral hazard problem  barber shop mentioned one
example  people prefer going barber  or hairdresser   another example
market delivery services  every package must scheduled timely delivery 
involves cost provider  cost may saved occasionally
dropping package  hence moral hazard  moreover  business clients typically rely
carrier dispatch documents merchandise  business
depends quality timeliness delivery  incentive form
lasting relationship get good service  yet another example business person
repeatedly travels offshore client  business person direct interest
repeatedly obtain good service hotel closest clients offices 
assume quality observed clients influenced environmental
factors outside control of  however observable by  provider  despite barbers
best effort  sudden movement client always generate accidental cut
make client unhappy  likewise  delivery company may occasionally lose damage
packages due transportation accidents  nevertheless  delivery company  like
barber  eventually learns certainty delays  damages losses entitle
clients complain unsatisfactory service 
mechanism propose quite simple  asking feedback client 
mechanism gives provider opportunity acknowledge failure  reimburse
client  provider claims good service reputation mechanism record
feedback client  contradictory reports  the provider claims good service 
client submits negative feedback  may appear one parties lying 
therefore  client provider sanctioned  provider suffers loss
consequence negative report  client given small fine

one equilibrium mechanism providers always best deliver
promised quality  truthfully acknowledge failures caused environmental
factors  honest behavior motivated threat mistake drive
unsatisfied client away market  future transactions generate sufficient
revenue  provider afford risk losing client  hence equilibrium 
unfortunately  socially desired equilibrium unique  clients occasionally
accept bad service keep returning provider dont better
alternatives  moreover  since complaining bad service sanctioned reputation
mechanism  clients might reluctant report negative feedback  penalties negative
reports clients lack choice drives provider occasionally cheat order
increase revenue 
second result  characterize set pareto optimal equilibria mechanism
prove amount unreported cheating occur limited two factors 
first factor limits amount cheating general  given quality
alternatives available clients  better alternatives increase expectations
clients  therefore provider must cheat less order keep customers 
second factor limits amount unreported cheating  represents cost
incurred clients establish reputation reporting truth  stubbornly exposing
bad service happens  despite fine imposed reputation mechanism 
client signals provider committed always report truth  signals
eventually change strategy provider full cooperation  avoid
punishment negative feedback  reputation reporting truthfully course 
valuable client  therefore  rational client accepts lie  and give reputation 
cost building reputation reporting honestly greater
occasional loss created tolerated cheating  cost given ease
provider switches cooperative play  magnitude fine imposed
