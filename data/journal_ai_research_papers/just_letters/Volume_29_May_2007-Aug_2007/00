   introduction
last decade seen growth interest phase transition boolean satisfiability
 sat   clausal version problem shows sharp transition sense that 
density clauses increased  formulas abruptly change satisfiable
unsatisfiable critical threshold point  numerous experimental studies
performed investigation phase transition different variants sat problems 
thus giving strong evidence location transition coincides instances
hard solve  meantime  theoretical studies conducted order
better understand transitions  determining nature phase transition  sharp
coarse     locating it  determining precise scaling window better understanding
structure space solutions turn challenging tasks 
aroused lot interest different communities  namely mathematics  computer science
statistical physics  see e g   dubois  monasson  selman    zecchina

therefore  according

since know property e xor sat exhibits sharp threshold l  n
