abstract
the qxor sat problem is the quantified version of the satisfiability problem xor sat
in which the connective exclusive or is used instead of the usual or  we study the phase
transition associated with random qxor sat instances  we give a description of this
phase transition in the case of one alternation of quantifiers  thus performing an advanced
practical and theoretical study on the phase transition of a quantified problem 

   introduction
the last decade has seen a growth of interest in the phase transition for boolean satisfiability
 sat   the clausal version of this problem shows a sharp transition in the sense that 
as the density of clauses is increased  formulas abruptly change from being satisfiable to
being unsatisfiable at a critical threshold point  numerous experimental studies have been
performed in the investigation of phase transition for different variants of sat problems 
thus giving strong evidence that the location of the transition coincides with such instances
that are hard to solve  in the meantime  theoretical studies have been conducted in order to
better understand such transitions  determining the nature of the phase transition  sharp
or coarse     locating it  determining a precise scaling window and better understanding
the structure of the space of solutions turn out to be very challenging tasks  which have
aroused a lot of interest in different communities  namely mathematics  computer science
and statistical physics  see e g   dubois  monasson  selman    zecchina         from a
computer science point of view  the success of the sat problem is due to two features  the
problem sat provides a framework in which problems within the complexity class np can
   definitions of sharp and coarse phase transitions can be found on p     in  janson  luczak    rucinski

be adequately expressed  and moreover practically efficient and highly optimized solvers are
available 
in order to obtain even stronger systems  many researchers have turned to a powerful
generalization of boolean satisfiability  qsat  where both universal and existential quantifiers over boolean variables are permitted  the qsat problem permits the adequate
representation and modeling of problems having higher complexitywithin the complexity
class pspaceand coming from various fields of computer science such as knowledge representation  verification and logic  recently  random instances of these quantified problems
have started to attract some attention  see gent   walsh        chen   interian        
models for generating random instances have been developed  and experimental studies
have shown that in these models the qsat property undergoes a phase transition that is
qualitatively similar to the one that appears for the ordinary sat property  as stated by
chen and interian         the hope is that research on developing competitive solvers for
quantified boolean formulas could benefit from a better understanding of the typical behavior of random instances  our study follows the pioneering work from chen and interian
       who have made precise a promising model for generating random instances of the
qsat problem  we use their model and apply it to the satisfiability problem qxor sat
that we present below 
the difficulty of identifying transition factors and of performing theoretical explorations
of the sat transition has incited many researchers to turn to a variant of the sat problem 
the e xor sat problem  this satisfiability problem deals with boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form with e variables per clause  in which the usual or is replaced by the
exclusive or  we call clauses with exclusive or as the only connective xor clauses   this
problem has contributed to develop or validate techniques  thus revealing typical behaviors
of both random instances and their space of solutions for sat type problems  see  e g  
cocco  dubois  mandler    monasson        creignou   daude        dubois  boufkhad 
  mandler        dubois   mandler        franz  leone  ricci tersenghi    zecchina 
       therefore  in order to understand how phase transitions evolve for satisfiability
when introducing quantified variables  it is quite natural to consider this problem 
although the phase transition of random k sat is not yet well understood  generalization to the quantified version has started for some years  the hope is that a generalization
of the problem can help in understanding the original one  another way of gaining insight
into a hard problem is to look at some tractable variants  for these reasons in this paper
we embark on a theoretical study of the phase transition for the qxor sat problem  which
is the quantified version of the xor sat problem  let us emphasize that this quantified
problem is  as the usual xor sat problem  in p  and hence will permit us to provide experiments at a large scale  thus giving useful intuition on the asymptotical behavior of random
instances  in order to efficiently solve an instance of the xor sat problem  the clause set
is rewritten to a set of equations with coefficients from the finite field gf     and gaussian
elimination is performed on the resulting set of equations  gaussian elimination followed by
an examination of the quantifier structure provides an algorithm for the quantified version
of the xor sat problem  for details  see creignou  khanna    sudan        chap       
following the previous studies conducted by gent and walsh        as well as chen
and interian         we focus on formulas in conjunctive normal form having two quantifier

blocks  namely on formulas of the type xy  x  y    where x and y denote distinct sets of
variables  and  x  y   is a conjunction of xor clauses  moreover  any variable occurring in
 x  y   occurs in x or y   i e   the formula xy  x  y   is closed  the model has several
parameters  first we consider  a e  qxor formulas  which are such that each clause in 
has exactly  a   e  variables  a from x and e from y   the  a e  qxor sat property is the
property for such a formula to be true  the second parameter is a pair  m  n  specifying the
number of variables in each quantifier block  i e   in x and y   the third parameter is l 
the number of clauses  to sum up  the generated formulas are of the form xy  x  y   
where x has m variables  y has n variables  each clause in  has a variables from x and e
from y and there is a total number of l clauses in   we are interested in the probability
that a formula drawn at random uniformly out of this set of formulas is true as n tends to
infinity  section     we prove that the nature of the phase transition  coarse or sharp  for
 a e  qxor sat is governed by the number of existential variables occurring in each clause 
for e     and any a     we prove in section   that the  a    qxor sat has a coarse phase
transition  moreover we give an expression of the distribution function of the threshold for
 a    qxor sat and we show how it is influenced by the different parameters of the model 
for e     we prove in section   that  a e  qxor sat has a sharp phase transitionthus
getting the first proof of a sharp threshold for a natural quantified satisfiability problem 

   qxor  xor and the maximal rank property
in this section  we relate qxor and xor to the maximal rank property  we start with some
definitions and notations 
    notation
an e xor clause  c  is a linear equation over the finite field gf     using exactly e distinct
variables  c     x          xe       where      or   
an e xor formula    is a conjunction of not necessarily distinct e xor clauses  a
truth assignment i is a mapping that assigns   or   to each variable in its domain  it satisfies
e
x
i xi   mod      and it
an xor clause c     x          xe       if and only if i c    
i  

satisfies a formula  if and only if it satisfies every clause in  
we will denote by e xor sat the property for an e xor formula of being satisfiable 
an  a e  qxor formula is a closed quantified formula of the following type
xy  x  y   

where x and y denote distinct set of variables   x  y   is an  a   e  xor formula such
that each clause contains exactly a variables from x and exactly e variables from y   such
a formula is true if  for every assignment to the variables x  there exists an assignment to
the variables y   such that  is true  observe that  for closed formulas  the notions of truth
and satisfiability coincide  for this reason  we will use the two notions synonymously in the
following  we denote by  a e  qxor sat the property for an  a e  qxor formula of being
true 
throughout the paper  we reserve m for the number of universal variables  resp  n for
the number of existential variables   and  x            xm    resp   y            yn    denotes the set
 

ficreignou  daude    egly

of such variables  note that there are
   
m
n
n 

 
a
e

   

 a e  xor clauses  we consider random formulas xy  x  y   obtained by choosing uniformly independently and with replacement l clauses from all the possible n  a e  xorclauses  using the terminology of chen and interian         these formulas correspond
to  a e  qxor  m n  l  formulas  we are interested in estimating the probability that
a randomly chosen  a e  qxor  m n  l  formula is true  we denote this probability by
pr m n l    a e  qxor sat   or shortly pr  a e  qxor sat  when no confusion can arise 
when restricted to the non quantified case  e xor sat  i e   when a    we omit the first
component in the subscript  thus discussing prn l  e xor sat   or shortly pr e xor sat  
we will show that the behavior of the  a e  qxor sat property is bounded from
above and below by two monotone properties  namely the e xor sat property and the
maximal rank property  experiments will suggest that the right parameter in order to study
these properties is c  the ratio of the number of clauses over the number of existential variables  moreover  according to the results obtained for e xor sat by creignou  daude  and
dubois         we know that the transition occurs when c      therefore  in the sequel we
will always suppose without loss of generality that l  n 
    upper and lower bounds for the qxor sat property
note that a random  a e  qxor  m n  l  formula can also be considered as the quantified
linear system
xy  ax   ey   c 
   
with coefficient arithmetic in gf      where a  respectively e  is a matrix chosen uniformly
from the set of boolean l  m  resp  l  n  matrices with exactly a  respectively e  units
in each row  and c is a boolean column vector of dimension l chosen uniformly from the
set of all such vectors  moreover  a  e and c are chosen independently 
observe that the quantified linear system
xy  ax   ey   c 
is consistent if and only if
x  c  ax   im e  
where im e  represents the image of the linear application whose matrix representation is
e  that is im e     ey   y        n    hence the quantified linear system is consistent if
and only if c  im e  and im a   im e   therefore  we get 
pr  a e  qxor sat    pr xy  ax   ey   c  is consistent 
  pr c  im e  and im a   im e   
thus  on the one hand
pr  a e  qxor sat   pr c  im e     pr e xor sat 
 

fiphase transition for random quantified xor formulas

holds  and on the other hand  the inequality
pr  a e  qxor sat   pr im e          l  
holds  therefore  if prn l  e max rank  denotes the probability that a random matrix from
the set of l  n boolean matrices with e units per row is of maximal rank  then for every
m  a  all n and all l  n  we get the following inequalities 
prn l  e max rank   pr m n l    a e  qxor sat   prn l  e xor sat  

   

a natural question at this stage is to estimate the probability that a random matrix is
of maximal rank  in the following we will provide some experiments and theoretical results
comparing the behavior of the three properties  maximal rank  qxor sat and xor sat 
thus making precise the behavior of the  a e  qxor sat property according to the value
of e 

   the case e    
in this section  we restrict our attention to the case where all problems have two existential
variables in each clause  and the number of all variables is allowed to vary  
    experimental results
in order to illustrate the inequalities     and to compare empirically the three properties 
we discuss experiments that we have performed  in the experiments  all formulas are closed

us describe it in detail for figure    one experiment consisted in generating at random  in
 

ficreignou  daude    egly

drawing uniformly and independently        qxor formulas over        existential variables and        universal variables with a ratio number of clauses number of existential
variables varying from     to   in steps of      or      for each of the chosen values of
ratio  a sample of      formulas were studied using the algorithm described in the work of
creignou et al         chap        thus deciding their truth  or satisfiability  as quantified
formulas  the proportion of true instances for each considered value of ratio has been plotted in figure    the same has been done for the other  a    qxor sat properties  hence 
the different curves are independent from each other  for the   xor sat experiment  we
used the same selection procedure over        existential variables  again  gaussian elimination together with an examination of the quantifier structure were used to determine
the logical status  true or false  of every formula  additionally  it has been computed
whether the matrix e has full rank or not  the curve   max rank shows the proportion
of systems with full rank and it corresponds to the   xor sat curve in the same figure 
a close look at figure   reveals that some points from the  a    qxor sat curves are
slightly below the  theoretical  lower bound given by the curve for   max rank  the reason
for this phenomenon is the independence of all the satisfiability curves from each other and
the noise induced by the finite sampling of problems  if we had chosen corresponding
problems with exactly the same existential part  and only the universal part varies   then
we would have got all satisfiability curves above the curve for   max rank 
the experimental results shown in figure   suggest first that the two bounding properties  namely   max rank and   xor sat are distinguishable  second that  when m   n  the
 a    qxor sat property coincides asymptotically with the   max rank property independently of a     the number of universal variables per clause

at another scale for m  for instance when m is constant  the experimental results reported in figure   suggest that the  a    qxor sat property is in between the two properties   max rank and   xor sat 
in the following  we will validate the conjectures suggested by these experiments and
prove that the property  a    qxor sat coincides asymptotically with the   max rank
property as soon as m is tending to infinity with n  and that it is in between the   max rank
property and the   xor property when m is a fixed constant  in particular  we will make
clear the connection between random  a    qxor formulas and random labelled graphs 
    bad cycles and the  a    qxor sat property
we are interested in the satisfiability of quantified systems of the form
s    xy ax   ey   c  
where e  respectively a  is a matrix chosen uniformly in the set of boolean l  n  respectively l  m  matrices with exactly    respectively a  units in each row  and c is a random
column vector of dimension l  in which   and   occur with the same probability  the satisfiability of such a system is strongly related to the existence of cycles in graphs  indeed  we
construct a graph ga  s  with n vertices and l weighted edges  for each existential variable
yi we have a vertex in ga  s   for each equation yi  yj   xi          xia    we add the
edge  yi   yj   to ga  s  with the label xi          xia    a cycle is given by a sequence of
vertices  yi            yis   such that for    j  s      yij   yij     is an edge in the graph  and
so is  yis   yi     the cycle is said to be elementary if all the vertices in the sequence are
distinct  the weight of a cycle is the sum modulo   of the labels of its edges 
example     let x    x    x    x    and let y    y            y     the formula xy  x  y  
with  x  y   being a conjunction of the following equations

can be represented by the graph in figure   
in the following  we call a cycle bad when it has a nonzero weight  and good otherwise 
example     in the graph associated with the formula described in the previous example 
there is a good cycle   y    y    y    y     whose weight is    and a bad one   y    y    y     whose
weight is x    for the latter cycle  the corresponding equations are y   y    x      y   y   
x    and y   y    x      adding these three equations yields the equation     x  which
cannot be satisfied because x   x is universally quantified 
for systems containing only existential variables  i e   a      it has been observed by
creignou and daude        that a   xor formula is satisfiable if and only if the graph
g   s  has no bad cycle  that is  
pr   xor sat    pr g   s  has no bad cycle  
using similar arguments  we get the following proposition

figure    the graph ga  s  from example      addition is performed mod   
proposition     the system s is satisfiable if and only if ga  s  does not contain any
elementary bad cycle  i e  
pr  a    qxor sat    pr ga  s  has no bad cycle  
proof  suppose we have an elementary cycle with nonzero weight in ga  s   clearly  to
such a cycle corresponds a subsystem in s  for which there exists an assignment to x such
that no assignment to y will satisfy it  see example     for an illustration   hence  s is
unsatisfiable 
conversely  suppose there is no  elementary  cycle with nonzero weight in ga  s   take
an arbitrary truth assignment i for the  universal  variables in x and apply it to ga  s  
since i x          for all x  x  the weight at each edge can be reduced to a constant
from        by addition modulo    moreover  since each cycle in ga  s  has zero weight  the
corresponding cycle in the reduced version  ga  s   of ga  s  has also zero weight  the
graph ga  s  corresponds to a system with existential quantifiers only 
in order to obtain a satisfying truth assignment for the existential variables  it suffices to
apply the following procedure to each connected component of ga  s   consider an arbitrary
root vertex y and assign an arbitrary truth value v to it  we obtain a truth value for each
vertex in ga  s  by performing a depth first search starting from y  during the search  if
there is an edge  y    y    labelled with  and y  has no truth value yet  then we set the value
for y  to the value of y     the assignment obtained in this way satisfies all the equations
since ga  s  does not contain any cycle with nonzero weight 
remark  observe that
pr   max rank    pr ga  s  has no cycle 
holds

    the distribution functions for   xor sat and   max rank
in this section  we will give the exact asymptotical value of the bounds obtained in     in
terms of the order parameter c  where c  n is the number of clauses  for this we will use
well known results from random graph theory 
let us recall that we consider the classical probabilistic model where each clause edge
is chosen uniformly and independently among the

e
possible ones  according to proposition      in  janson et al          if we choose l   c  n
clauses  then this model is asymptotically equivalent to the one where each clause is drawn
independently with probability p  where

the corresponding probability is usually denoted by p   however  for simplicity we will
keep the notation pr 
in the light of proposition     and of      it appears that we have to study
pr ga  s  has no  bad  cycle  
the asymptotic behavior of the number of cycles in random graphs has been first investigated by erdos and renyi         and made precise by janson        and takacs        
this number converges in distribution to a poisson law of parameter   where  is the limit
of the average number of cycles as n  the number of vertices  tends to infinity 
this result can be easily extended to our model of labelled graphs  in particular 
pr ga  s  has no  bad  cycle   exp   
where  is the limit of the the average number of  bad  cycles  a challenging task is now
to get a simple expression of lambda 
let y be the random variable that counts the number of cycles  let c be the set
of all possible cycles  for any cycle c  we introduce the random variable xc such that
xc  ga  s       holds  if and only if ga  s  contains the cycle c  the average number of

proof  the proof is based on proposition     and  as discussed in the previous section  on
an estimation of the number of bad cycles in the labelled graphs associated with random
formulas 
let m a be the limit of the average number of bad cycles  we will give a closed
expression of m a   observe that each label on the edges of the graph associated with a
 a    qxor  m n  cn  formula is formed with a constant 
  or    and a variable label made
m
of a universal variables  there are exactly a such variable labels  which are numbered
from   to m
a   one can decide whether a cycle is good or bad according to the number
of    even or odd  and the number of occurrences of each variable label  therefore it is
quite natural to associate to every cycle its length l  the sequence  n            n m    of the
a
numbers of occurrences of each variable label  and the parity      or   of the number of
occurrences of the constant    the limit of the average number of cycles whose parameter
 l   n            n m       is fixed is
a

moreover  from such a parameter  l   n            n m        one can decide whether a cycle is
a
bad or not

for a better readability  let us focus on the case a      in this particular case  the label
of an edge is of the form xi    where      or   and    i  m  on the one hand  all cycles
of odd length are bad  for in the weight of such a cycle at least one of the coefficients of the
xi s will be nonzero   on the other hand  there are two kinds of cycles of even length that
are bad  the ones in which the constant   appears an odd number of times  and the ones
in which one of the universal variables appears an odd number of times  since  for m    
we have

first  observe that m   is a function of c  thus we deduce the last part of the theorem

second  from the above expression of m   and using the following inequality

in addition  when m   a      we get the equation

   the case e   
it can be observed from the experimental results shown in figure   that  contrary to what
has been observed in the previous section  the three smooth lines connecting the consecutive points and corresponding to the transition of the three properties   max rank 
 a    qxor sat and   xor sat are difficult to distinguish  moreover  when n increases
 see figure     the curves straighten and come closer one to each other  showing thus strong
empirical evidence that the transitions of the three properties coincide asymptotically  with
a sharp phase transition at the critical value c          which is the critical ratio for
  xor sat  see dubois   mandler         we will show that  for e     the introduction
of universal variables in xor formulas does not influence the sharp transition 
theorem     for every e    and any integer a  the  a e  qxor sat property has a
sharp threshold which coincides with the one of the e xor sat property

we get

prn l  e xor sat  
 
therefore  according to      we have
   prn l  e xor sat      prn l   a e  qxor sat   prn l  e xor sat  
since we know that the property e xor sat exhibits a sharp threshold when l is  n 
 creignou   daude         this shows that  a e  qxor sat also does  the same holds for
the property e max rank  since prn l  e max rank    p l     in particular  for e      we have
shown that  a e  qxor sat as well as   max rank have a sharp threshold with a critical
value c          which is the critical ratio for   xor sat  dubois   mandler        

   conclusion
we have  experimentally and theoretically  analyzed the phase transition for the quantified
problems  a e  qxor sat  our analysis has been conducted at the same level of sophistication as the one made for the e xor sat problem  thus showing that the model proposed

  

fiphase transition for random quantified xor formulas

by chen and interian        is mathematically tangible and provides the good parameters
in order to perform a mathematical analysis of the phase transition for quantified problems 
on the one hand  as observed for qsat  gent   walsh        chen   interian        
we have proved that the nature of the transition is not influenced by the introduction
of universal variables  on the other hand  in contrast with qsat  we have proved that
the location of the phase transitionthe critical ratiois the same for the two properties
xor sat and qxor sat  and that the difference of behavior between these two properties
occurs at the level of the distribution function
