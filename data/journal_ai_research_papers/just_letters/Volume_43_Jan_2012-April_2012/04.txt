abstract
traffic congestion in urban road networks is a costly problem that affects all major
cities in developed countries  to tackle this problem  it is possible  i  to act on the supply
side  increasing the number of roads or lanes in a network   ii  to reduce the demand  restricting the access to urban areas at specific hours or to specific vehicles  or  iii  to improve
the efficiency of the existing network  by means of a widespread use of so called intelligent
transportation systems  its   in line with the recent advances in smart transportation
management infrastructures  its has turned out to be a promising field of application for
artificial intelligence techniques  in particular  multiagent systems seem to be the ideal
candidates for the design and implementation of its  in fact  drivers can be naturally
modelled as autonomous agents that interact with the transportation management infrastructure  thereby generating a large scale  open  agent based system  to regulate such a
system and maintain a smooth and efficient flow of traffic  decentralised mechanisms for
the management of the transportation infrastructure are needed 
in this article we propose a distributed  market inspired  mechanism for the management of a future urban road network  where intelligent autonomous vehicles  operated by
software agents on behalf of their human owners  interact with the infrastructure in order
to travel safely and efficiently through the road network  building on the reservationbased intersection control model proposed by dresner and stone  we consider two different
scenarios  one with a single intersection and one with a network of intersections  in the
former  we analyse the performance of a novel policy based on combinatorial auctions for
the allocation of reservations  in the latter  we analyse the impact that a traffic assignment strategy inspired by competitive markets has on the drivers route choices  finally
we propose an adaptive management mechanism that integrates the auction based traffic
control policy with the competitive traffic assignment strategy 

   introduction
removing the human driver from the control loop through the use of autonomous vehicles integrated with an intelligent road infrastructure can be considered as the ultimate 
long term goal of the set of systems and technologies grouped under the name of intelligent
transportation systems  its   autonomous vehicles are already a reality  for instance 
three darpa grand challenges   have been held so far  the teams participating in the
latest event  the darpa urban challenge  competed to build the best autonomous vehi   http   archive darpa mil grandchallenge

cles  capable of driving in traffic  performing complex manoeuvres such as merging  passing 
parking and negotiating with intersections  the results have shown for the first time that
autonomous vehicles can successfully interact with both manned and unmanned vehicular
traffic in an urban environment  several car makers expect the technology to be affordable
 and less obtrusive  in about a decade    another initiative that fosters this vision is connected vehicle     which promotes research and development of technologies that link road
vehicles directly to their physical surroundings  i e   by vehicle to infrastructure wireless
communications  the advantages of such an integration span from improved road safety
to a more efficient operational use of the transportation network  for instance  vehicles
can exchange critical safety information with the infrastructure  so as to recognise high risk
situations in advance and therefore to alert drivers  furthermore  traffic signal systems can
communicate signal phase and timing information to vehicles to enhance the use of the
transportation network 
in this regard  some authors have recently paid attention to the potential of a tighter
integration of autonomous vehicles with the road infrastructure for future urban traffic management  in the reservation based control system  dresner   stone         an intersection
is regulated by a software agent  called intersection manager agent  which assigns reservations of space and time to each autonomous vehicle intending to cross the intersection 
each vehicle is operated by another software agent  called driver agent  when a vehicle
is approaching an intersection  the driver requests that the intersection manager reserve
the necessary space time slots to safely cross the intersection  the intersection manager 
provided with data such as vehicle id  vehicle size  arrival time  arrival speed  type of turn 
etc   simulates the vehicles trajectory inside the intersection and informs the driver whether
its request is in conflict with the already confirmed reservations  if such a conflict does not
exist  the driver stores the reservation details and tries to meet them  otherwise it may try
again at a later time  the authors show through simulations that in situations of balanced
traffic  if all vehicles are autonomous  their delays at the intersection are drastically reduced
compared to traditional traffic lights 
in this article we explore how different lines of research in artificial intelligence and agent
technology can further improve the effectiveness and applicability of dresner and stones
approach  assuming that all vehicles are autonomous and capable of interacting with the
regulating traffic infrastructure  we extend the reservation based model for intersection
control at two different levels 
    single intersection
for a single intersection  our objective is to elaborate a new policy for the allocation of
reservations to vehicles that takes into account the drivers different attitudes regarding their
travel times  instead of granting the disputed resources  intersection space and time  to the
first agent that requests them  we intend to allocate them to the agents that value them
the most  while maintaining an adequate level of efficiency and fairness of the system  our
main contribution in this regard is the definition of an auction based allocation policy for

fia market inspired approach for intersection management

assigning reservations  this policy models incoming requests as bids over an intersections
available space time slots and tries to maximise the overall value of the accepted bids  due
to the combinatorial nature of the auction and the restrictions of our scenario  mainly realtime execution and safety   we define a specific auction protocol  adapt an algorithm for
winner determination for our purposes  and evaluate the behaviour of the approach 
    network of intersections 
to extend dresner and stones approach to a network of intersections  we focus on the
problem of traffic assignment  conceived as a distributed choice problem where intersection
managers try to affect the decision making of the driver agents  in particular  we use markets
as mediators for our distributed choice and allocation problem  gerding  mcburney   
yao         our contribution to the attainment of the above objective is twofold  first 
we build a computational market where drivers must acquire the right to pass through
the intersections of the urban road network  implementing the intersection managers as
competitive suppliers of reservations which selfishly adapt the prices to match the actual
demand  second  we combine the competitive strategy for traffic assignment with the
auction based control policy at the intersection level into an adaptive  market inspired 
mechanism for traffic management of reservation based intersections 
the article is structured as follows  section   provides an overview of the use of artificial
intelligence and agent technology in the field of its  in section   we briefly review the key
elements of the reservation based intersection control model that our work sets out from 
in section   we present our policy for the allocation of reservations at a single intersection 
inspired by combinatorial auction theory  in section   we extend the reservation based
model to network of intersections  finally  we conclude in section   

   related work
to achieve the goals pursued by the its vision there is an increasing need to understand 
model  and govern such systems at both the individual  micro  and the societal  macro 
level  transportation systems may contain thousands of autonomous entities that need
to be governed  which raises significant technical problems concerning both efficiency and
scalability  the inherent distribution of traffic management and control problems  their
high degree of complexity  and the fact that the actors in traffic and transportation systems
 driver  pedestrians  infrastructure managers  etc   fit the concept of autonomous agent
very well  allow for modelling its in terms of agents that interact so as to achieve their
goals  selfishly as well as cooperatively  therefore  traffic and transportation scenarios are
extraordinarily appealing for multiagent technology  bazzan   klugl         in this section 
we outline some key dimensions of its and briefly review relevant literature on the use of
artificial intelligence and multiagent techniques in the field 
    traffic control and traffic assignment
traffic control refers to the regulation of the access to a disputed road transport resource 
traffic control systems manage traffic along arterial roadways  employing traffic detectors 
traffic signals  and various means of communicating information to drivers  freeway control
   

fivasirani   ossowski

systems manage traffic along highways  employing traffic surveillance systems  traffic control
measures on freeway entrance ramps  ramp metering   and lane management 
traffic control at intersections  based on traffic lights  is the major control measure in
urban road networks  this type of control typically applies off line optimisation on the basis
of historical data  transyt  robertson        is a well known and frequently applied
signal control strategy  but it cannot adapt dynamically to changing demand patterns 
other control techniques  such as scoot  hunt  robertson  bretherton    winton        
use real time traffic volume rather than historical data to run optimisation algorithms and
compute the optimal signal plan 
traffic assignment refers to the problem of the distribution of traffic in a network  considering demands between several locations  and the capacity of the network  in general 
demand may change in a non predictable way  due to changing environmental conditions 
exceptional events  or accidents  this  in turn  leads to under utilisation of the overall network capacity  whereby some links are heavily congested while capacity reserves are available
on alternative routes  to address this problem  different traffic management techniques  involving information broadcast as well as control and optimisation  can be employed  for
example  route guidance and driver information systems  rgdis  may be employed to improve the network efficiency via direct or indirect recommendation of alternative routes  papageorgiou  diakaki  dinopoulou  kotsialos    wang         these communication devices
may be consulted by a potential road user to make a rational decision regarding whether
or not to carry out  or postpone  the intended trip  the choice of transport mode  car  bus 
underground  etc    the departure time selection and the route choice 
traffic control and assignment have different focuses and can therefore be combined
into a single management policy that takes explicitly into account the mutual interactions
between signal control policies and user route choices  meneguzzer        
    isolated and coordinated traffic control
most traffic control strategies use control devices  e g   traffic lights  variable message signs 
ramp meters  and surveillance devices  e g   loop detectors  cameras  to manage a physical
traffic network  in isolated control  only a small portion of the network  e g  a single
intersection  is modelled  and techniques from control theory are employed to determine
signal cycles so as to minimise the vehicles total delay  for instance  da silva et al  proposed
a reinforcement learning system for traffic lights that copes with the dynamism of the
environment by incrementally building new models of the environmental state transitions
and rewards  da silva  basso  bazzan    engel         when the traffic pattern changes 
an additional model is created and a new traffic signal plan is learned  the creation of new
models is controlled by a continuous evaluation of the prediction errors generated by each
partial model 
in coordinated control  the settings of several control devices are adapted to each other 
so as to achieve a smooth traffic flow at the network level  i e   green waves  rather
than at a single intersection  by allowing the individual devices to coordinate their actions
based on the information they receive from sensors and from each other  coherent traffic
control plans are often generated faster and more accurately compared to a human traffic
operator  van katwijk  schutter    hellendoorn         for instance  distributed constraint
   

fia market inspired approach for intersection management

optimisation  dcop  techniques have recently been applied to the coordination of control
devices  junges   bazzan         each traffic signal agent is assigned to one or several
variables of the dcop  which have inter dependencies and conflicts  e g   two neighbouring
intersections giving preference to different directions of traffic    a mediator agent is in
charge of resolving these conflicts when they occur  recommending values for the variables
associated to the agents involved in the mediation 
    time perspective
the time perspective refers to the stage in which the decision making process of an its
application takes place  operational decision making in its refers to short term issues  such
as controlling traffic at an intersection  tactical decision making deals with medium term
issues  such as anticipating congestion by diverting traffic on different routes or influencing
demand patterns  finally  strategic decision making typically involves long term decisions 
e g  planning the construction of new roads  highways or parking hubs 
many ai based its partially automate the operational part of road traffic control tasks 
tactical and strategic decision making is still mainly a human activity  e g   carried on by
city planners   some more recent decision support systems address tactical questions as
well  int ry s  hernandez  ossowski    garca serrano         for instance  is a multiagent
system aimed at assisting operators in a traffic control centre to manage an urban motorway
network  the system is capable of engaging in dialogues with the operators  e g  to diagnose
the causes of detected traffic problems  to construct coherent sets of driver information
messages  and to simulate the expected effects of such control plans 
    information to drivers
cooperative systems can improve dynamic routing and traffic management  adler  satapathy  manikonda  bowles    blue         using information services aimed at giving advice to
drivers and efficiently assigning traffic among the network  this is a difficult problem as collective route choice performed by selfish agents often leads to equilibrium strategies that are
far from social welfare optima  roughgarden         providing information about the congestion of links or sharing partial views of vehicle choices  as in context aware routing  zutt 
van gemund  de weerdt    witteveen         may improve the systems efficiency 
    domain knowledge
domain and topological knowledge can be exploited to structure both the architecture
and the reasoning models of its  for instance  choy et al  propose a cooperative  hierarchical  multiagent system for real time traffic signal control  choy  srinivasan    cheu 
       the control problem is divided into various sub problems  each of them handled
by an intelligent agent that applies fuzzy neural decision making  the multiagent system
is hierarchical  since decisions made by lower level agents are mediated by their respective
higher level agents  the int ry s system  hernandez et al         conceives the traffic
dynamics in terms of so called problem areas  which are defined based on the expertise of
traffic engineers  each problem area is controlled by a separate traffic control  software 
agent  knowledge modelling and reasoning techniques are applied to integrate local control
   

fivasirani   ossowski

strategies  proposed by the different traffic control agents  into a coherent global plan for
the whole traffic network 
    learning and adaptation
its often rely on learning techniques to adapt to changing or unknown traffic conditions 
for instance  traffic light agents may use reinforcement learning to minimise the overall
waiting time of vehicles  steingrover  schouten  peelen  nijhuis    bakker        wiering 
       the control objective is global  although actions are local to the agents  the state of
the learning task is represented as an aggregation of the waiting times of individual vehicles
at the intersection  traffic light agents learn a value function that estimates expected
waiting times of vehicles given different settings of traffic lights 
several authors focus on self organising and self adapting mechanisms for traffic control  gershenson        lammer   helbing         where traffic lights self organise with
no direct communication between them  the local interactions between neighbouring traffic lights lead to emergent coordination patterns such as green waves  in this way  an
efficient  decentralised traffic light control is achieved  as a combination of two rules  one
that aims at optimising the flow and one that aims at stabilising it  in the t ry sa 
system  hernandez et al          traffic agents use a mechanism called structural cooperation  ossowski   garca serrano        to locally coordinate their signal plan proposals
without the need to rely on dedicated domain  coordination  knowledge 
    market based coordination
being a complex system  traffic is well suited for the application of market based coordination mechanisms at different levels  these mechanisms replicate the functioning of real
markets  i e   auctions  bargaining  etc   in order to coordinate the activities and goals
pursued by a set of agents  the agents that regulate the infrastructure can be built to
act as a team  i e   they may share a global objective function that represents the system
designers preferences over all possible solutions  as it occurs in multi robot domains  dias 
zlot  kalra    stentz         in line with this perspective  vasirani and ossowski      b 
proposed a market based policy for traffic assignment  the authors put forward a cooperative learning model so as to coordinate the prices of several intersections  the experimental
results showed that  in general  an increase in the profit raised by a team of intersections is
aligned with reduced average travel times  a limitation of this work is the number of interactions with the environment that are required in order for the price vector that maximises
overall profit to be learned 
if we extend the focus to include selfish driver agents and their interaction with the
infrastructure agents  a non cooperative scenario arises  for instance  an auction based
policy for intersection control is proposed in the work of schepperle and bohm         in
this work  an intersection controlled by an intelligent agent starts an auction for the earliest
time slot among the vehicles that are approaching the intersection on each lane  the authors
assume that the agent that controls an intersection can detect if an approaching vehicle has
another vehicle in front of it  in this case  the former is not allowed to participate in
the auction  i e   its bids are not processed   so as to ensure that only vehicles that do not
have physical impediments to cross the intersection are allowed to participate in the auction 
   

fia market inspired approach for intersection management

furthermore  since a non combinatorial auction is run to allocate the earliest time slot  only
one bidder  i e   driver  is entitled to get a specific time slot  which can lead to inefficiencies
in the assignments 
the field of transport economics also studies the allocation of resources used to move
road users from place to place  small   verhoef         however  it follows a more static
and analytical approach that requires extensive knowledge of supply and demand functions 
such information is often hard to obtain and extract  so usually findings from the field are
hard to transfer directly to its 
    discussion
in this work  we mainly focus on the operational time perspective  since our aim is to
manage an advanced traffic infrastructure that regulates the route choices of autonomous
vehicles  while tactical and strategic decisions are left to the human users  in order to make
the proposed mechanisms broadly adoptable  we minimise the domain knowledge necessary
to set up our models  while the software agents that reside in the traffic management
infrastructure need to be aware of the remaining infrastructure agents  they do not require
expert knowledge related to the underlying traffic system  we focus on local adaptation
mechanisms  rather than learning techniques  to enforce emergent coordination among the
software agents that reside in the traffic management infrastructure  furthermore  we
put forward a market based coordination framework that involves both the infrastructure
and the drivers  the infrastructure agents coordinate their actions in an indirect way
as competitive market participants that aim to match supply with demand  the driver
agents participate in the allocation of the road network capacity through an auction based
mechanism that regulates the assignment of the right to cross an intersection  finally  we
recognise the importance of providing information to drivers in order to influence their
decision making  in particular  we assume the existence of propagation mechanisms  so
that the market price information is available to the drivers  thus potentially influencing
their collective behaviour   

   reservation based intersection control
the applications of ai techniques and multiagent technology in the traffic domains that were
detailed in the previous section conceive that the its lies in the infrastructure and its components  traffic lights  message signs  sensors  etc    while the vehicles are usually treated as
particles of a traffic flow that a control policy cannot individually address  nevertheless  the
continuous advances in software and hardware technologies will make a tighter integration
between vehicles and infrastructure possible  even today  vehicles can be equipped with
features such as cruise control  ioannou   chien        and autonomous steering  krogh
  thorpe         small scale systems of autonomous guided vehicles  agv  already exist 
for example in factory transport systems  if this trend continues  one day fully autonomous
vehicles will populate our road networks  in this case  given that the system will comprise a
variable  and possibly huge  number of vehicles  an open infrastructure is needed to control
   setting up such price index boards is technically feasible already today  for instance  the nyse indexes
approximately      stocks  whose price variations are spread worldwide almost immediately

figure    reservation based protocol with fcfs policy
and schedule the transit of agvs  in fact  nowadays centralised agv control systems know
the number of the vehicles  their origins and destinations  before the route planning takes
place  in the case of an urban road traffic scenario  such an approach is certainly unfeasible 
in this section we present some details of the reservation based system for intersection
control  dresner   stone        that are relevant for this work    in particular we outline the
policy executed by intersection managers to process reservations requests  section      and
analyse the impact that the distance at which the reservation is sent has on the performance
of the control mechanism  section      
    protocol
the reservation based control system proposed by dresner and stone assumes the existence
of two different kinds of software agents  intersection manager agents and driver agents  the
intersection manager agent controls the space of an intersection and schedules the crossing
of each vehicle  the driver agent is the entity that autonomously operates the vehicle  in
the following we will use the terms intersection manager and driver for short  to refer to
the software agents that control an intersection and a vehicle respectively   the protocol 
using the first come first served policy  fcfs   is summarised in figure    each driver 
   we remark that in this work we engineered the basic aspects of the reservation based system  we did
not consider more advanced features  such as acceleration within the intersections  safety buffers or edge
tiles  the basic functioning of the reservation based intersection that we assume in this work is the same
in every experimental scenario that we compare  in this way a fair comparison between different policies
for the allocation of reservations is guaranteed

figure    example of a request message
when approaching the intersection  contacts the intersection manager by sending a request
message      the message contains the vehicles id  the arrival time  the arrival speed  the
lane occupied by the vehicle in the road segment that approaches the intersection and the
intended type of turn  see figure   for an example of request message   the intersection
manager calculates the distance d r  from which the driver is sending the reservation request
r      if the distance is greater than the maximum reservation distance di of the lane that
the driver is occupying      the request is rejected without processing it      otherwise 
the intersection manager proceeds to evaluate whether it can be accommodated or not 
first  the drivers id is parsed      and if the driver already has a prior reservation      this
reservation is removed      then  with the information contained in the request message 
the intersection manager simulates the vehicle trajectory  calculating the space needed by
the vehicle over time in order to check if there are potential conflicts      if so      the
intersection manager updates the maximum reservation distance di      and replies with a
rejection message       otherwise  the maximum reservation distance di is updated to
infinite      and the intersection manager replies with a confirmation message       which
implies that the drivers request is accepted 
the fcfs policy implies that if two drivers send requests that require the same spacetime slots inside the intersection  the driver that sends the request first will obtain the
reservation  in extreme cases this policy is clearly inefficient  consider the case of a set of
n vehicles  v    v            vn   such that v  s request has conflicts with every other vehicle  but
that v            vn do not have conflicts with one another  if v  sends its request first  it will
be granted and all other vehicles requests will be rejected  on the other hand  if it sends
its request last  the other n    vehicles will have their requests confirmed  whilst only v 
will have to wait  nevertheless  fcfs has the advantage of being a simple policy  which
only needs the minimum amount of information necessary to implement a reservation based
intersection control 
    reservation distance
the protocol detailed above would be prone to deadlock situations  if it did not make use
of the reservation distance filter  consider two vehicles  a and b  with a moving in front of
b  see figure     suppose also that b cannot safely overtake a  if a and b send a request
   

fivasirani   ossowski

b sends the request
rst and gets the
reservation

b

a s request is
rejected  thus a
must stop at the
intersection

a
given that a cannot
cross  also b must
stop at the
intersection

figure    potential deadlock situation 

for the same space time slots inside the intersection  the first request that the intersection
manager receives will be accepted  and the second one will be rejected  if vehicle b  which
is behind vehicle a  obtains the reservation  the result will be that vehicle a is not able
to cross because it does not hold a confirmed reservation  this in turn prevents vehicle b
making use of its reservation  if vehicle b always sends its request first  then a deadlock
situation arises  with vehicle a physically blocking vehicle b  and vehicle b blocking vehicle
a by getting the disputed reservation 
to avoid the occurrence of these deadlock situations  dresner and stone proposed the
use of the reservation distance as a heuristic criterion for filtering out reservation requests
that could generate deadlock situations  since the drivers communicate the time at which
they plan to arrive at the intersection  as well as what their speed will be when they get
there  quantities which the drivers have no incentive to misrepresent   it is possible to
approximate a vehicles distance from the intersection  given a reservation request by that
vehicle  this heuristic approximation  called the reservation distance d r   is calculated as
d r    va   ta  t   where va is the proposed arrival speed of the vehicle  ta is the proposed
arrival time of the vehicle  and t is the current time 
this approximation assumes that the vehicle is maintaining a constant speed  the
reservation processing policy uses it as follows  for each lane i  the policy has a variable di  
initialised to infinity  that represents the maximum distance from which a driver can send
a reservation request  for each reservation request r from lane i  the policy computes the
reservation distance  d r   if d r    di   r is rejected  if  on the other hand  d r   di   r is
processed as normal  if r is rejected after being processed as normal  di  min di   d r   
otherwise  di    while the use of the reservation distance does not guarantee that

mutually blocking situations never occur  it does prevent these situations from degenerating
into deadlocks 

   single intersection
for a single reservation based intersection  the problem that the intersection manager has to
solve is allocating the reservations among a set of drivers in a way that a specific objective is
maximised  this objective can be  for instance  minimising the average delay caused by the
presence of the regulated intersection  in this case  the simplest policy to adopt is allocating
a reservation to the first agent that requests it  as occurs with the fcfs policy proposed
by dresner and stone in their original work  another work in line with this objective takes
inspiration from adversarial queuing theory for the definition of several alternative control
policies that aim at minimising the average delay  vasirani   ossowski      a 
however  these policies ignore the fact that in the real world  depending on the context
and their personal situation  people value the importance of travel times and delays quite
differently  since processing the incoming requests to grant the associated reservations can
be considered as the process of assigning resources to agents that request them  one may
be interested in an intersection manager that aims to allocate the disputed resources to
the agents that value them the most  in line with approaches from mechanism design  we
assume that the more a human driver is willing to pay for the desired set of space time slots 
the more they value the good  therefore  we rely on combinatorial auction theory  krishna 
      for the definition of an auction based policy for the allocation of resources 
    auction based policy
to formalise an auction based policy for processing incoming reservation requests  it is
necessary to specify the auction design space  this includes the definition of the disputed
resources  the rules that regulate the bidding and the clearing policy 
      auctioned resources
the first step for the design of any auction is the definition of the resources  or items 
to be allocated  the nature of items determines which type of auction can be employed
to allocate them  in our scenario  the auctioned good is the use of the space inside the
intersection at a given time  we model an intersection as a discrete matrix of space slots 
let s be the set of the intersection space slots  s    s    s            sm    let tnow be the current
time  and t    tnow       n  the set of future time steps  the set of items that a
bidder can bid for is the set i   s  t   due to the nature of the problem  a bidder is
only interested in bundles of items over the set i  in the absence of acceleration in the
intersection  a reservation request  figure    implicitly defines which space slots at which
time the driver needs in order to pass through the intersection    thus  the items must
necessarily be allocated through a combinatorial auction 
   this computation is easily done by the intersection manager  which knows the geometry of the intersection  if the vehicles were to calculate the trajectory  they would need to know the geometry of every
intersection they pass through

      bidding rules
the bidding rules define the form of a valid bid accepted by the auctioneer  wurman 
wellman    walsh         in our scenario  a bid over a bundle of items is implicitly defined
by the reservation request  given the parameters arrival time  arrival speed  lane and type
of turn  the auctioneer  i e   the intersection manager  is able to determine which space slots
are needed at which time  thus  the additional parameter that a driver must include in its
reservation request is the value of its bid  i e   the amount of money that it is willing to pay
for the requested reservation 
a bidder is allowed to withdraw its bid and to submit a new one  this may happen 
for instance  when a driver that submitted a bid b  estimating to be at the intersection
at time t  realises that  due to changing traffic conditions  it will more likely to be at the
intersection at time t   t  thus making the submitted bid b useless for the driver  in this
case the driver has no guarantees of safety regarding its crossing of the intersection  thus 
the rational thing to do in this case  as the driver would not want to risk being involved in
a car accident  is resubmitting the bid with the updated arrival time  however  the new bid
must be greater than or equal to the value of the previous one  this constraint avoids the
situation whereby a bidder blocks one or several slots for itself  by acquiring them early
and with overpriced bids  even though this would oblige others to try to reserve alternative
slots  and thus make the desired slot less disputed  the bidder cannot take advantage of
this  as it cannot withdraw its initial bid and resubmit lower bids in order to obtain the
same reservation at a lower price

      auction policy
the auction policy  see figure    starts with the auctioneer waiting for bids for a certain amount of time t  once the new bids are collected  they constitute the bid set 
then  the auctioneer executes the algorithm for the winner determination problem  wdp  
and the winner set is built  containing the bids whose reservation requests have been accepted  during the wdp algorithm execution  the auctioneer still accepts incoming bids 
but they will only be included in the bid set of the next round  then the auctioneer sends a
confirmation message to all bidders that submitted the bids contained in the winner set 
while a rejection message is sent to the bidders that submitted the remaining bids  then
a new round begins  and the auctioneer collects new incoming bids for a certain amount of
time   
      winner determination algorithm
since the auction must be performed in real time  both the bid collection and the winner
determination phase must be time bounded  that is  they must occur within a specific time
window  this implies that optimal and complete algorithms for the wdp  leyton brown 
shoham    tennenholtz        sandholm        are not suited for this kind of auction  an
algorithm with anytime properties is needed  hoos   boutilier         so that the longer
the algorithm keeps executing  the better the solution it finds 
   for safety reasons the auctioneer cannot spend too much time collecting bids  nor can it deallocate
previously granted reservations  therefore it is possible that a low valued bid  in the winner set at round
k  impedes the allocation of the disputed reservation to some high valued bids  submitted at round k   n 
in this case  the second bidder should slow down and resubmit a new  possibly winning  bid  although
in theory the bid delay relation  figure    could be worsened by the unrelated sequence of auctions  in
practice the effect is negligible

    simulation environment
the simulator we use for the evaluation of our auction based policy is a custom  microscopic 
time and space discrete simulator  with simple rules for acceleration and deceleration  the
simulated area is modelled as a grid  and subdivided in lanes  see figure     each lane is
 m wide  and subdivided in    squared tiles of     m each  each vehicle is modelled as a
rectangle of     tiles  or equivalently  as a rectangle of  m m  and has a preferred speed
in the interval         km h  the simulation environment generates the origin destination
pair randomly  when a vehicle is spawned inside the simulation  it is inserted at the
beginning of one of the   incoming links  randomly selected  and a destination is randomly
assigned to it  the destination implies the type of turn  left  right or straight  that the
vehicle will perform at the intersection as well as the lane it will use to travel  the leftmost lane in case of left turn  the right most lane in case of right turn  any lane for going
straight   the preferred speed is assigned using a normal distribution with mean   km h
and variance  km h  while being limited by the interval          
   the probability of adding to the candidate winner set the second highest bid rather then the greedy
bid  i e   the highest in value 

   

fivasirani   ossowski

since the link used to approach the intersection is relatively short  we assume that each
vehicle will travel in its pre assigned lane  without changing it  therefore  we only need
a car following model to simulate the vehicle dynamics  and no lane changing model is
needed  the car following model we use is the intelligent driver model  treiber  hennecke 
  helbing         in this model  the decision of any driver to accelerate or to brake depends
only on its own speed  and on the speed of the vehicle immediately ahead of it  specifically 
the acceleration dv dt of a given vehicle depends on its speed v  on the distance s to the
front vehicle  and on the speed difference v  positive when approaching

and a is the acceleration  g is the deceleration     v is the actual speed  vp is the preferred
speed  s  is the minimum gap  t is the time headway 
the acceleration is divided into an acceleration towards the preferred speed on a free
road  and braking decelerations induced by the front vehicle  the acceleration on a free
road decreases from the initial acceleration a to   when approaching the preferred speed vp  
the braking term is based on a comparison between the preferred distance s   and
the current gap s with respect to the front vehicle  if the current gap is approximately
equal to s   then the braking deceleration essentially compensates the free acceleration
part  so the resulting acceleration is nearly zero  this means that s corresponds to the
gap when following other vehicles in steady traffic conditions  in addition  s increases
dynamically when approaching slower vehicles and decreases when the front vehicle is faster 
as a consequence  the imposed deceleration increases with decreasing distance to the front
vehicle  increasing its own speed  and increasing speed difference to the front vehicle  the
aforementioned parameters were set to vp     km h  t      s  s     m  a      m s   
b    m s    the speed of a vehicle is updated every second  and its position  since the space

    experimental results
we create different traffic demands by varying the expected number of vehicles    that 
for every o d pair  are spawned in an interval of    seconds  using a poisson distribution 
we spawned vehicles for a total time of    minutes  table   shows the number of vehicles
that have been generated for different values of  
the main goal of this set of experiments is to test whether the policy based on combinatorial auction  ca  enforces an inverse relation between money spent by the bidders
and their delay  the delay measures the increase in travel time due to the presence of the
intersection  it is computed as the difference between the travel time when the intersection
    a and g are different parameters with different values  since usually a vehicle decelerates  i e   brakes 
more strongly than it accelerates

table    traffic demands for a single intersection
is regulated by the intersection manager  and the travel time that would arise if the vehicle
could travel unhindered through the intersection  the bid that a driver is willing to submit
is drawn from a normal distribution with mean     cents and variance    cents  since the
willingness of human drivers to pay is usually normally  or log normally  distributed  hensher   sullivan         thus  the agents are not homogeneous in the sense that the amount
of money that they are offering differs from one to another  in this population  we track
the delay of a subset of drivers  which are endowed with                                   
     and       cents  this endowment is entirely allocated as a bid  we also evaluate the
auction based policy with respect to the average delay of the entire population of drivers 
for the wdp algorithm  we set the walk probability wp        and the novelty probability np        as these values produced the best results in auctions of similar type and
size  hoos   boutilier         in all the experiments  we give the intersection manager one
second to execute the wdp algorithm and return a solution  to give more time to bidders to submit their bids  before starting another auction  the intersection manager waits
another second to collect incoming bids     to determine if one second is enough for the
winner determination algorithm to produce acceptable results  we performed the following experimental analysis  according to the results reported by hoos and boutilier  given
an auction with     bids  the winner determination algorithm is able to find the optimal
solution with a probability of      which tends to   if the algorithm is allowed to run for
more than    seconds  this is encouraging  but in order to justify the adequacy of the
stochastic algorithm for our particular problem  we need to show that  in the context of
the auction based policy for reservation based intersection control  it produces results that
are reasonably close to the optimum  despite the relatively short time    second in the experiments  that the algorithm has to return a solution  given that the average number of
submitted bids for a single auction is between   for low traffic demand        and    for
high traffic demand          we performed several experiments to compare the solution
provided by the algorithm with   second of run time with the solution provided by the algorithm with     seconds  the solution provided by the second execution of the algorithm
is assumed to be the best approximation of the optimal solution  the result was that the
winner determination algorithm is able to find a solution whose value is at least     of the
optimal solution value with a probability between       for high traffic demand        
and       for low traffic demand        
figure   plots  in logarithmic scale  the relation between travel time and bid value
for different values of   all the error bars denote     confidence intervals  there is a
sensible decrease of the delay experienced by the drivers that bid from     to     cents 
which represent       of drivers whose bid is greater than the mean bid  still  such delay
reduction tends to settle for drivers that bid more than      cents 
    nevertheless  the intersection manager runs a separate thread that receives incoming bids also during
the wdp algorithm execution

we remark that the auction based policy also uses the reservation distance as preprocessing step  which guarantees that a drivers bid cannot be rejected indefinitely  in
fact  a vehicle is allowed to approach the intersection and slow down until it reaches the
intersection edge  at that point  if its request is rejected because another driver submitted
a higher value bid  the reservation distance is updated to the stopped vehicles distance 
therefore  in the following time step  only this driver will be allowed to submit a bid with its
preferred value  the result is  of course  that this driver will suffer greater delays compared
to other drivers that are willing to pay more    
the auction based allocation policy has proven to be effective regarding its main goal 
that is  rewarding lower delays to those drivers that value their disputed reservations the
most  however  it is worth analysing the impact that such a policy has on the intersections
average delay  figure  a plots the average delay for different traffic demands             
again  the error bars denote     confidence intervals  when traffic demand is low  the performance of the ca policy and the fcfs is approximately the same  however  when traffic
demand increases  there is a noticeable increase of the average delay when the intersection
manager applies ca  this was somewhat expected  because the ca policy aims to grant
a reservation to the driver that values it the most  rather than maximising the number of
granted requests  thus  a bid b  whose value is greater than the sum of n bids that share
some items with b  is likely to be selected in the winner set  if so  only   vehicle will be
allowed to transit  while n other vehicles will have to slow down and try again  this fact
is highlighted also by the average rejected requests  figure  b   since all the non winning
bids are rejected  the number of rejected requests with the ca policy is up to four times
greater than with the fcfs policy 
    although we focus on technical problems and not social or political ones  one may wonder whether it is
fair that rich drivers can travel faster than poor drivers using a road infrastructure that is a public
good  nevertheless  we could argue that through the money raised by the auction based policy rich
drivers contribute much more to the maintenance and extension of the public road infrastructure than
poor drivers

    discussion
the principle of optimising the use of the available resources is not the unique guiding
principle of a traffic controller  in the real world  depending on the context and their
personal situation  drivers value the importance of travel times and delays quite differently 
thus  it makes sense to elaborate control policies that are aware of these different valuations
and that reward the drivers that value the disputed resources the most  in this respect 
we evaluated a control policy for reservation based intersections that relies on an auction
mechanism  with such a policy  drivers that submit high value bids usually experience
significant reductions in their individual delays  about     less compared to drivers that
submit low value bids  
however  since the objective of this policy is not maximising the number of granted
reservations  it pays a social cost  in the form of greater average travel times  this fact
might limit the applicability of the ca policy in high load situations  in this case  additional
mechanisms to reduce the number of vehicles that approach a single intersection are needed 
it is also worth noting how it is possible that a driver  even with a theoretically infinite
amount of money  cannot experience zero delay when approaching an intersection  this
is because an auction carried on in a realistic traffic scenario is quite different from a
synthetic auction that has been set up for benchmarking purposes  hoos   boutilier        
the auctions that arise in the traffic scenario are affected by the high level of dynamism 
uncertainty and noise  intrinsic to the domain  for example  in high load situations  the
reservation distance plays an important role  since it filters out many potentially winning
bids coming from a greater distance     figure   plots how the reservation distance decreases
over time for different traffic demands  in high load situations  the reservation distance
tends to be small  therefore a wealthy driver must reach this reservation distance in order
to participate in the auction and acquire a reservation  thus increasing its travel time  the
estimation of the arrival time also greatly affects the performance of the auction  in fact  in
    as outlined in section      the reservation distance is the maximum distance at which a driver is allowed
to request a reservation

time  min 

figure    reservation distance

high load situations  such an estimation is much more noisy and uncertain  and it is likely
that a driver must resubmit a reservation request with the updated arrival time  in this
way  it is possible that an agent wins an auction at time t and then  due to a new estimation
of the arrival time  must resubmit its bid at time t   t  the bidders that participate in
the auction at time t   t are obviously different from those that participated at time t  so
there is no guarantee that the agent might win the auction again 
furthermore  a real world scenario such as urban traffic limits the auction design space
and the applicable solution methods for winner determination and payments calculation 
in fact  we gave priority to the winner determination problem  adapting a local search algorithm to our needs  while for the payments calculation we did not adopt any sophisticated
method  i e   a winner pays a price that is exactly the bid that was submitted  this  as
with any first price payment mechanism  could in principle lead to malicious behaviours 
with drivers that try to acquire reservations by submitting bids that are lower than the
real valuations they have  in single item auctions it is computationally easy to set up an
incentive compatible payment mechanism  such as the second price  vickrey  mechanism 
unfortunately  extending this mechanism to combinatorial auctions in not  computationally  straightforward  since the equivalent truth revealing mechanism in the combinatorial
world  the vickrey clarke groves  vcg  payment mechanism  clarke        groves       
vickrey         is np complete  therefore  although a driver agent could potentially acquire
a reservation by submitting a bid  b that is lower than its real valuation b  from a practical
point of view this exclusively affects the revenues that the auctioneer should gain if every
bidder were truth telling  which is not our primary concern  another possible weakness is
the fact that a bidder could start bidding lower than their real valuation and then raising their bid if they are not able to acquire it  thus leading to a communication overhead
between bidders and auctioneer  nevertheless  only the bidders within the reservation distance are able to submit a bid  thus the number of bids that the intersection manager may
receive simultaneously is necessarily bounded 
   

fia market inspired approach for intersection management

   network of intersections
in the single intersection scenario we analysed the performance of an auction based policy
for the allocation of reservations  in that context  the driver was modelled as a simple agent
that selects the preferred value for the bid that will be submitted to the auctioneer  if we
focus on an urban road network with multiple intersections  it is interesting to notice that
the decision space of a driver is much broader  in fact  drivers are involved in complex and
mutually dependent decisions such as route choice and departure time selection  at the same
time  this scenario opens new possibilities for intersection managers to affect the behaviour
of drivers  for example  an intersection manager may be interested in influencing the
collective route choice performed by the drivers  using variable message signs  information
broadcast  or individual route guidance systems  so as to evenly distribute the traffic over
the network  this problem is called traffic assignment 
in section     we evaluate how market inspired methods  gerding et al         can be
applied as traffic assignment strategies for networks of reservation based intersections  the
idea is that  if there is a market where drivers acquire the necessary reservations to pass
through the intersections of the urban network  this market  and the intersection managers
that operate in it from the supply side  can be designed to work as a traffic assignment
system  in particular  we model the intersection managers so that they apply a competitive
pricing strategy to compete among themselves for the supply of the reservations that are
traded  finally  in section     we combine this traffic assignment strategy with the auctionbased control policy into an integrated mechanism for traffic management of urban road
networks 
    competitive traffic assignment  cta 
traffic assignment strategies aim at influencing the collective route choice of drivers in order
to use the road network capacity efficiently  therefore  we can see the traffic assignment
problem as a distributed choice and allocation problem  since a set of resources  i e   the
links capacity  must be allocated to a set of agents  i e   the drivers   to this regard 
markets as mediators for distributed resource allocation problems have been applied to
several socio technical systems  gerding et al         
setting out from the approach outlined in the work by vasirani and ossowski         we
follow this metaphor and model each intersection manager as a provider of the resources  in
this case  the reservations of the intersection it manages  thus  each intersection manager
is free to establish a price for the reservations it provides  on the other side of the market 
each driver is modelled as a buyer of these resources  provided with the current prices of
the reservations  it chooses the route  according to its personal preferences about travel
times and monetary costs  each intersection manager is modelled so as to compete with
all others for the supply of the reservations that are traded  therefore  our goal as market
designers is making the intersection managers adapt their prices towards a price vector that
accounts for an efficient allocation of the resources

      cta pricing strategy
let l be the set of incoming links of a generic intersection  for each incoming link l  l 
the intersection manager defines the following variables 
 current price pt  l   is the price applied by the intersection manager to the reservations
sold to the drivers that come from the incoming link l 
 total demand dt  l   pt  l    represents the total demand of reservations from the
incoming link l that the intersection manager observes at time t  given the current
price pt  l   it is given by the number of vehicles that want to cross the intersection
coming from link l at time t 
 supply s l   defines the reservations supplied by the intersection manager for the
incoming link l  it is a constant and represents the number of vehicles that cross the
intersection coming from link l that the intersection manager is willing to serve 
 excess demand z t  l   pt  l    is the difference between the total demand at time t and
the supply  z t  l   pt  l     dt  l   pt  l    s l  
given the set of all the intersection managers that are operating in the market  j   we
define the price vector pt as the vector of the prices applied by each intersection manager
to each of its controlled links 
pt     pt   l    pt   l          pt j    lh    

   

where p   l    is the price applied by intersection manager   to its controlled link l    p   l   
is the price applied by the same intersection manager to another link l  of its intersection 
and p j    lh   is the price applied by the  j  th intersection manager to its last controlled link
lh  
in particular  we say that a price vector pt maps the supply with the demand if the excess
demand z t  l   pt  l   is   for all links of the network  this price vector  which corresponds
to the market equilibrium price  can be computed through a walrasian auction  codenotti 
pemmaraju    varadarajan         where each buyer  i e   driver  communicates to the
suppliers  i e   intersection managers  the route that it is willing to choose  given the current
price vector pt   with this information  each intersection manager computes the demand
dt  l   pt  l   as well as the excess demand z t  l   pt  l   for each of its controlled links  then 
each intersection manager adjusts the prices pt  l  for all the incoming links  lowering them
if there is excess supply   z t  l   pt  l         and raising them if there is excess demand
  z t  l   pt  l          the new price vector pt   is communicated to the drivers that
iteratively choose their new desired route  on the basis of the new price vector pt     once
the equilibrium price is computed  the trading transactions take place and each driver buys
the required reservations at the intersections that lay on its route 
the walrasian auction relies on quite strict assumptions  which make a direct implementation in the traffic domain hard  for instance  the set of buyers is assumed to be fixed
during the auction  which means for the traffic domain that new drivers may not join an
auction until it terminates  also the fact that no transactions can take place at disequilibrium prices is a strict assumption for the traffic domain  it is unreasonable for all the

the driver multi attribute utility of route  is then defined as

where wt is the weight of the estimated travel time attribute and wk is the weight of the
cost of reservations attribute  basically  if wt     the driver utility only considers the
attribute related to the estimated travel time  i e   it prefers the shortest route  no matter
the price of the reservations   if wk     the driver utility only considers the attribute
related to the cost of reservations  i e   it prefers the cheapest route  no matter the travel
time   while for every other combination of the weights wt and wk the driver considers
the trade off between estimated travel time and cost of reservations  in the experiments we
draw wt from a uniform distribution over the interval         and we set wk      wt  
once the utility of the routes that form the choice set c has been computed  the driver
must choose one of these alternatives  in this work  we model the driver as a deterministic
utility maximiser that always selects the route with the highest utility value  since the
price of the incoming links of an intersection is changing dynamically  the term uk    in
eq     may change during the journey  for this reason  the driver continuously evaluates
the utility of the route it is following and  in case that a different route becomes more
attractive  it may react and change on the fly how to reach its destination  selecting a route
different from the original one 
      simulation environment
the experimental evaluation is performed on a hybrid mesoscopic microscopic simulator 
where the traffic flow on the roads is modelled at mesoscopic level  schwerdtfeger        
while the traffic flow inside the intersections is modelled at microscopic level  nagel  
schreckenberg        
in a mesoscopic model vehicle dynamics is governed by the average traffic density on the
link it traverses rather than the behaviour of other vehicles in the immediate neighbourhood
as in microscopic models  a road network is modelled as a graph  where the nodes represent
intersections and the edges represent the lanes of a road  an edge  also called stretch  is
subdivided into sections  of typically    m length  for which a constant traffic condition is
assumed  a vehicle i that at time t is driving on a link lk is characterised by its position
   

fivasirani   ossowski

xti        lk     and its speed vit   at each time step  a new target speed for each vehicle is
computed  using the formula 
v it t

where y lk   is the reference speed of link lk and y lk     is the reference speed of link lk    
such reference speeds are calculated by taking into consideration the mean speed of the link
and the vehicles desired speed  the mean speed of the link is calculated with a speed density
function that for a given links density  lk   returns the links mean speed  schwerdtfeger 
      
the equation above takes into consideration the fact that the closer the vehicle is to
the next link lk     the higher is the effect of the link reference speed on the vehicle target
speed  if the new target speed v it t is higher  lower  than the current speed vit   the vehicle
accelerates  decelerates  with a vehicle type specific maximum acceleration  deceleration  
the new speed is then denoted by vit t   finally  the vehicle position is updated using the
formula

if xt t
   lk    the vehicle is placed in the next link of its route  the densities for link lk

and lk   are updated accordingly  and the position is reset to xt t

the mesoscopic model described above does not offer the necessary level of detail to
model a reservation based intersection  for this reason  when a vehicle enters an intersection  its dynamics switches into a microscopic  cellular based  simulator  nagel   schreckenberg         similar to the simulation environment used in section      still  the cells that
compose the intersections area are more coarse grained    meters   and for simplicity we
assume that the vehicles cross the intersection at a constant speed  so that any additional
tuning of parameters  such as slowdown probability or acceleration deceleration factors  is
not necessary

      experimental results
although our work does not depend on the underlying road network  we chose a  simplified 
topology of the entire urban road network of the city of madrid for our empirical evaluation
 see figure      the network is characterised by several freeways that connect the city
centre with the surroundings and a ring road  each large dark vertex in figure      if it
connects three or more links   is modelled as a reservation based intersection  we aim to
recreate a typical high load situation  i e   the central  worst part of a morning peak   with
more than        vehicles departing within a time window of    minutes  see table     the
vehicles that travel to and from   destinations outside the city  marked with o  up to o 
in figure     form the traffic under evaluation 
the market inspired traffic assignment strategy is compared with a network of fcfs
reservation based intersections  in the latter  the drivers route choice only takes into consideration the expected travel time at free flow  since there is no notion of price 
we focus on two different types of metrics  one related to the vehicles and one related
to the network  the network related metric is the density variation over time at   critical

competitive traffic assignment  cta  and when they are granted with the usual fcfs
policy  using cta we observe a net reduction of the average travel time for    of    origindestination pairs  such reduction is generally noteworthy for the busiest   routes  such as
o   o    o   o  and o   o    along the some of the less demanded o d pairs  fcfs is the
best performing policy  this happens when on the most preferred route from o to d the
traffic density is already low enough to assure free flow  but there exist alternative routes
with even lower demand  and cta keeps diverting traffic along these potentially longer and
thus slower routes 
to evaluate the effects of the trading activity between drivers and intersection managers
it is worth observing the density variation over time at the critical intersections c  to c   
plotted in figure     in general  density tends to be lower with cta compared with the
system regulated by fcfs intersection managers  at the least demanded intersections c   
c  and c    that is  those intersections whose density is below the density that maximises
traffic flow  see figure      there is no substantial difference between cta and fcfs  these
critical intersections are less demanded due to the topology of the network  in fact  fewer
origins are located in the northern part  o    o  and o    
at the critical intersections c    c  and c    the vehicle density with cta is always below
the density that results from the use of fcfs  especially in the case of intersections c  and
c  where with cta the density exceeds the optimal one by only a small extent and for a
limited period of time 
at intersection c    the density has a higher peak around       but the density starts to
exceed the optimal density later and begins to fall below the optimal density earlier  we
calculated the integral of the density curves  measured in the interval when the curve is
above the optimal density  eq

the reservations are allocated through the competitive market        veh  h km versus
       veh  h km  
the result of the application of the market inspired traffic assignment strategy is a
more balanced urban network  since the price fluctuations force demand to change towards
less expensive intersections  such fluctuations contribute to creating a system in dynamic
equilibrium  where unused intersections became cheaper while congested ones became more
expensive  the effect is that average travel time decreases  although there are no guarantees
that those drivers that pay more are rewarded with lower travel times 

    we empirically noticed in the experiments that the southern part of the network tends to be more
congested during the simulation  this is due to the fact that   of   origins destinations  o    o    o

fia market inspired approach for intersection management

    an integrated mechanism for traffic management  ca cta 
in section      we introduced an auction based policy for the control of a single intersection 
the experimental results showed that this policy was quite effective in allocating the reservations to the drivers that value them the most  drivers that bid high usually experience
a great reduction in delay  about       compared to those drivers that submit low value
bids  however  this policy on its own showed a couple of drawbacks  first  it fosters the
attainment of a user optimum rather than a global one  it therefore pays a social price  in
the form of greater average delay for the entire population of drivers  furthermore  it is
possible that even wealthy drivers  in high load situations  could not get a reservation  for
example due to the decreasing reservation distance 
on the other hand  one of the results of the experimental evaluation of section     was
that a traffic assignment strategy can make the task of traffic controllers easier  enforcing
a better distribution of traffic demand  therefore  it seems reasonable to combine the
auction based policy with the competitive traffic assignment strategy into an integrated 
market inspired  mechanism for traffic management 
      ca cta mechanism
we adapt the competitive traffic assignment strategy  cta  to combine it with the auctionbased policy  ca  into an integrated mechanism for traffic management  ca cta   since
the intersection manager is the supplier of the reservations that are allocated through the
combinatorial auction  it may control the reserve price of the auctioned reservations  i e  
the minimum price at which the intersection manager is willing to sell  we model the
intersection managers in such a way that they compete for the provision of reservations
to the drivers  raising the reserve price in case of increasing demand or lowering it in case
of decreasing demand  the reservations are allocated through the ca policy defined in
section      however  only bids whose value is above the reserve price are accepted in the
bid set 
for each incoming link l of a generic intersection  the intersection manager independently
computes the excess demand z t  l   ptr  l   and updates the reserve price ptr  l  using the
formula 
 
 
z t  l   ptr  l  
t  
t
t
pr  l   max r   pr  l    pr  l  
    
s l 

where r is the minimum reserve price  and s l  is the number of vehicles that the intersection
manager is willing to serve  as in section      we choose r     and s l         opt    l  
where   l  is the length of link l  and opt is the density that maximises the traffic flow on
link l  see figure     
      driver model

to empirically evaluate ca cta we need to define a driver route choice model that takes
into consideration the fact that reservations are now allocated through a combinatorial
auction with a reserve price  we assume that each driver holds a private valuation of the
bids that it is willing to submit to pass through the intersections of its chosen route  defined
by the variable b  given the monetary constraint  the driver selects the most preferred route
   

fivasirani   ossowski

  taking into consideration the estimated travel time associated with the route  a route 
is modelled again as an ordered list of links      l        ln    each of them characterised by
two attributes  namely estimated travel time and reserve price 
the travel time estimation is based  as before  on the travel time at free flow  equation     the reserve price of a link is defined as 
  t
pr  l 
if lk   l  l
    
k lk    
 
otherwise
the price of link lk is always    unless the link lk is one of the incoming link of an intersection
 lk   l   in which case the price is equal to the reserve price ptr  l  established by the
intersection manager  the summatory of the travel time over all the links of  gives the
estimated travel time at free flow of the entire route

      experimental results
we again recreate a typical high load situation  using the same network topology and od
matrix of figure    and table    we are interested in two different types of properties  from
one side we must evaluate whether or not the integrated management mechanism  traffic
control traffic assignment  guarantees lower delays to the drivers that submit higher bids
 user optimum   for this purpose  we calculate the average  percentage  increase of the
travel times d  calculated according to equation     where t  i   is the observed travel
time for vehicle i from its origin to its destination along route i   and mt is the travel time
from the same origin to the same destination along the shortest route if the vehicle could
cross each intersection unhindered     for simplicity  we refer to the percentage increase of
the travel time as normalised delay 
d 

t  i    mt

on the other hand  we would like to set up a system that is fair to the entire population
of drivers  guaranteeing lower average delays  global optimum   thus  we compare our
integrated mechanism with a network of intersections governed by intersection managers
that apply the fcfs control policy  we assume that in this case the drivers choose the
shortest route from their origin to their destination  since there are no other incentives to
    this ratio enables us to aggregate the results of drivers even though they have different origins and or
destinations

diverge from that route  the aim is to evaluate the global performance  in terms of average
travel time  of our integrated mechanism compared to the straightforward application of the
fcfs policy to a network of intersections  and to detect any potential social cost similar
to that reported in section      the metrics we use to assess the performance are the
average delay for every o d pair  and the moving average of the travel time  the latter
is intended to measure how the average travel time evolves during the simulation  this
metric is initialised to   and calculated as follows  once a driver i concludes its trip  the
travel time t  i   is computed and the moving average travel time t is updated according
to equation     where n is the number of drivers that have completed their trips so far

in the following tables and figures we refer to the two configurations with the abbreviations
ca cta  which stands for combinatorial auction competitive traffic assignment  and
fcfs 
figure   a plots the relation between bid value and normalised delay of the population
of drivers     it is still possible to appreciate an inverse relation between these two quantities  the drivers that submit bids between     and     cents reduce the delay by about
    compared to those which bid less than    cents  also at the network level  granting
reservations with a combinatorial auction  the ca component of the ca cta policy 
ensures that those drivers that submit higher bids experience lower delays  user optimum  
to assess the social cost incurred by ca cta at the global level  we measure the moving
average of the travel time  that is  how the average travel time of the entire population of
drivers  computed over all the o d pairs  evolves during the simulation  we compare cacta with fcfs and  for completeness  with cta     the results  with     confidence

interval error bars  are plotted in figure   b  in the beginning  the average travel time
is similar for all the scenarios  but as the number of drivers that populate the network
 i e   its load  increases  it grows significantly faster with fcfs than with the ca cta
policy  in terms of average travel times cta is the best performing policy  ca cta has a
slightly inferior performance  but it does enforce an inverse relationship between bid value
and delay  see figure   a   the fact that both ca cta and cta outperforms fcfs
is an indication that  in general  a traffic assignment strategy  the cta component of
both policies  improves travel time  in fact  with fcfs drivers always select the shortest

through an auction  the ca component of the ca cta policy  ensures that bid value
and delay reduction are correlated 
table   shows the average travel time of the drivers  according to their o d pairs  when
the intersection managers use the ca cta mechanism  compared to the fcfs policy 
with ca cta  there is a net reduction of the average travel time for more than     of the
o d pairs if compared to fcfs  furthermore  at the    intersections at which ca cta
outperforms fcfs  the relative improvement     is usually more substantial than the
relative losses at the remaining    intersections  the travel time reduction is particularly
noteworthy for the busy routes o   o    o   o  and o   o  with gains that exceed      on
the o d pairs on which ca cta performs worst  especially o   o  and o   o    with losses

the intersection  thus considerably increasing the travel time due to the social cost of the
combinatorial auction 

   conclusions
in this article we studied a distributed mechanism for the control and management of a
future urban road network  where intelligent autonomous vehicles  controlled by drivers 
interact with the infrastructure in order to travel on the links of the network  in this last
section we summarise and discuss the main contributions  and we propose some future lines
of work 
the first objective was the extension of the reservation based intersection control system  dresner   stone         we focused on modelling a policy that relied on the theory of
combinatorial auctions  krishna        to allocate reservations to the drivers  from empirical experimentation  we discovered that the combinatorial auction based policy guarantees
reduced delay to those drivers that value their time the most  i e   those that submit higher
bids  however  this new policy showed that it paid a social cost  in term of greater average
delays  especially when traffic demand was high 
the second objective of this work was to go beyond the single intersection setting  and
extending the reservation based model to a network of intersections  building on the findings
reported by vasirani and ossowski         we realised that a traffic assignment strategy
could make the task of a traffic control policy easier  by better distributing the traffic flow
in the network  we studied a market inspired traffic assignment strategy that tackled the
problem from the adaptation perspective  in this model  the intersection managers behaved
selfishly  competing with all the others for the supply of the reservations at the intersections 
the experimental evaluation showed that in this way the available resources were efficiently
allocated to the drivers  generating a more balanced network 
finally  we combined the competitive strategy for traffic assignment with the auctionbased policy for traffic control  in order to develop an adaptive  market inspired  mechanism
for traffic management  the demand response pricing policy acted on the distribution of
vehicles in the network  adapting the reserve price  i e   the minimum price at which the
intersection manager is willing to sell  and generating a system in dynamic equilibrium 
where unused intersections became cheaper while highly demanded ones became more expensive  if demand at particularly disputed intersections was lowered by the reserve price

fluctuations  the social cost of the auction based control policy was lowered too  at intersection level   therefore  a more homogeneous distribution of vehicles over the network led to
a better use of network resources  and thus to lower average travel times  in this way  the
entire population of drivers was rewarded with lower average travel times and  at the same
time  the traffic control policy enforced an inverse relation between bid value and delay 
rewarding the drivers that valued the reservations the most with reduced delays 
for future work  other economic models can be implemented  such as continuous double
auctions  furthermore  this work assumed a driver decision making model that exclusively
took into consideration the route choice  which was modelled as a utility maximisation
problem  in order to capture the inherent complexity of urban traffic systems  it is important
to extend and enrich the driver behavioural model  for example  the driver could be
implemented as a two layer decision maker  where a reactive  rule based layer provides
short term decisions about car following and lane changing  and a cognitive  bdi style 
layer is in charge of making the more complex decisions such as route choice and departure
time selection  rossetti  bampi  liu  vliet    cybis        
finally  in this article only interactions between the vehicles and the infrastructure take
place  thus  no collaboration at all is possible between vehicles  nevertheless  vehicle tovehicle communication is receiving great attention from the scientific and engineering community  biswas  tatchikou    dion         in particular  vehicle to vehicle communication
could be used to enrich the action space of a driver  e g  through the option of dynamically
joining or abandoning coalitions of vehicles  based on the idea of platoons  varaiya
