remark auction based policy uses reservation distance preprocessing step  guarantees drivers bid cannot rejected indefinitely 
fact  vehicle allowed approach intersection slow reaches
intersection edge  point  request rejected another driver submitted
higher value bid  reservation distance updated stopped vehicles distance 
therefore  following time step  driver allowed submit bid
preferred value  result is  course  driver suffer greater delays compared
drivers willing pay more    
auction based allocation policy proven effective regarding main goal 
is  rewarding lower delays drivers value disputed reservations
most  however  worth analysing impact policy intersections
average delay  figure  a plots average delay different traffic demands            
again  error bars denote     confidence intervals  traffic demand low  performance ca policy fcfs approximately same  however  traffic
demand increases  noticeable increase average delay intersection
manager applies ca  somewhat expected  ca policy aims grant
reservation driver values most  rather maximising number
granted requests  thus  bid b  whose value greater sum n bids share
items b  likely selected winner set  so    vehicle
allowed transit  n vehicles slow try again  fact
highlighted average rejected requests  figure  b   since non winning
bids rejected  number rejected requests ca policy four times

    although focus technical problems social political ones  one may wonder whether
fair rich drivers travel faster poor drivers using road infrastructure public

personal situation  drivers value importance travel times delays quite differently 
thus  makes sense elaborate control policies aware different valuations
reward drivers value disputed resources most  respect 
evaluated control policy reservation based intersections relies auction
mechanism  policy  drivers submit high value bids usually experience
significant reductions individual delays  about     less compared drivers
submit low value bids  
however  since objective policy maximising number granted
reservations  pays social cost  form greater average travel times  fact
might limit applicability ca policy high load situations  case  additional
mechanisms reduce number vehicles approach single intersection needed 
worth noting possible driver  even theoretically infinite
amount money  cannot experience zero delay approaching intersection 
auction carried realistic traffic scenario quite different

auctions arise traffic scenario affected high level dynamism 
uncertainty noise  intrinsic domain  example  high load situations 
reservation distance plays important role  since filters many potentially winning
bids coming greater distance     figure   plots reservation distance decreases

tends small  therefore wealthy driver must reach reservation distance order
