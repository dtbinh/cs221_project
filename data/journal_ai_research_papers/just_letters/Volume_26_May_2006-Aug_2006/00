introduce logic reasoning evidence essentially views evidence
function prior beliefs  before making observation  posterior beliefs  after
making observation   provide sound complete axiomatization logic 
consider complexity decision problem  although reasoning logic
mainly propositional  allow variables representing numbers quantification
them  expressive power seems necessary capture important properties evidence 

   introduction
consider following situation  essentially taken halpern tuttle       
fagin halpern         coin tossed  either fair double headed  coin
lands heads  likely coin double headed  coin tossed
   times lands heads time  intuitively  much likely coin
double headed latter case former  likelihood
measured  cannot simply compute probability coin double headed 
assigning probability event requires prior probability coin
double headed  example  coin chosen random barrel
one billion fair coins one double headed coin  still overwhelmingly likely
coin fair  sequence    heads unlucky  however  problem
statement  prior probability given  show given prior probability
coin double headed increases significantly result seeing    heads  but 
intuitively  seems able say seeing    heads row provides
great deal evidence favor coin double headed without invoking prior 
great deal work trying make intuition precise 
review 
main feature coin example involves combination probabilistic outcomes  e g   coin tosses  nonprobabilistic outcomes  e g   choice
