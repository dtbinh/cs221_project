   introduction
the ability to rationally change ones knowledge base in the face of new information which
possibly contradicts the currently held beliefs is a basic characteristic of intelligent behaviour  thus the question of belief revision is of crucial importance in artificial intelligence 
in the last twenty years this question has received considerable attention  starting from the
work of alchourron  gardenfors  and makinson         usually abbreviated to just agm 
who proposed a set of rationality postulates which any reasonable revision operator should
satisfy  a semantic construction of revision operators was later provided by katsuno and
mendelzon         according to which an agent has in its mind a plausibility ordering  a
total preorder  over the set of possible worlds  with the knowledge base associated to this
ordering being identified with the set of sentences true in all the most plausible worlds  this
approach dates back to the work of lewis        on counterfactuals  it was introduced into
the belief revision literature by grove        and spohn         given a new sentence  or
epistemic input    the revised knowledge base is set as the set of sentences true in all the
most plausible worlds in which  holds  as was shown by katsuno and mendelzon        
the family of operators defined by this construction coincides exactly with the family of opc

erators satisfying the agm postulates  due to its intuitive appeal  this construction came
to be widely used in the area  however  researchers soon began to notice a deficiency with
it  although it prescribes how to obtain a new knowledge base  it remains silent on how to
obtain a new plausibility ordering which can then serve as a target for the next epistemic
input  thus it is not rich enough to deal adequately with the problem of iterated belief
revision  this paper is a contribution to the study of this problem 
most iterated revision schemes are sensitive to the history of belief changes    based on
a version of the most recent is best argument  where the newest information is of higher
priority than anything else in the knowledge base  arguably the most extreme case of this is
nayaks lexicographic revision  nayak        nayak  pagnucco    peppas         however 
there are operators where  once admitted to the knowledge base  it rapidly becomes as
much of a candidate for removal as anything else in the set when another  newer  piece of
information comes along  boutiliers natural revision              being a case in point 
a dual to this is what rott        terms radical revision where the new information is
accepted with maximal  irremediable entrenchment  see also segerberg         another
issue to consider is the problem termed temporal incoherence  rott        
the comparative recency of information should translate systematically into comparative importance  strength or entrenchment
in an influential paper darwiche and pearl        proposed a framework for iterated
revision  their proposal is characterised in terms of sets of syntactic and semantic postulates  but can also be viewed from the perspective of conditional beliefs  it is an extension
of the formulation by katsuno and mendelzon        of agm revision  alchourron et al  
       to justify their proposal darwiche and pearl mount a comprehensive argument  the
argument includes a critique of natural revision  which is shown to admit too few changes 
in addition  they provide a concrete revision operator which is shown to satisfy their postulates  in many ways this can be seen as the prototypical darwiche pearl operator  it
is instructive to observe that the two best known operators satisfying the darwiche pearl
postulates  natural revision and lexicographic revision  form the opposite extremes of the
darwiche pearl framework  natural revision is the most conservative darwiche pearl operator  in the sense that it effects as few changes as possible  while lexicographic revision is
the least conservative 
in this paper we show that the darwiche pearl arguments lead naturally to the acceptance of a smaller class of operators which we refer to as admissible  we provide characterisations of admissible revision  in terms of syntactic as well as semantic postulates 
admissible revision ensures that the penultimate input is not ignored completely  a consequence of this is that natural revision is eliminated  on the other hand  admissible revision
includes the prototypical darwiche pearl operator as well as lexicographic revision  the latter result also showing that lexicographic revision is the least conservative of the admissible
operators  the removal of natural revision from the scene leaves a gap which is filled by the
introduction of a new operator we refer to as restrained revision  it is the most conservative
of admissible revision operators  and can thus be seen as an appropriate replacement of
natural revision  we give a syntactic and a semantic characterisation of restrained revision 
   an external revision scheme like that of areces and becher        and freund and lehmann        is
not 

   

fiadmissible and restrained revision

and demonstrate that it satisfies desirable properties  in particular  and unlike lexicographic
revision  it ensures that older information is not discarded unnecessarily  and it shows that
the problem of temporal incoherence can be dealt with 
although natural revision does not feature in the class of admissible revision operators 
we show that it still has a role to play in iterated revision  provided it is first tempered
appropriately  we show that restrained revision can also be viewed as a composite operator 
consisting of natural revision preceded by an application of a backwards revision operator
previously studied by papini        
the paper is organised as follows  after outlining some notation  we review the darwichepearl framework in section    this is followed by a discussion of admissible revision in
section    in section   we introduce restrained revision  and in section   we show how
it can be defined as a composite operator  section   discusses the possibility of enriching
epistemic states as a way of determining the appropriate admissible revision operator in a
particular context  in this section we also conclude and briefly discuss some future work 
    notation
we assume a finitely generated propositional language l which includes the constants  
and   is closed under the usual propositional connectives  and is equipped with a classical
model theoretic semantics  v is the set of valuations of l and     or  b   is the set of
models of   l  or b  l   classical entailment is denoted by  and logical equivalence
by   we also use cn to denote the operation of closure under classical entailment  greek
letters           stand for arbitrary sentences  in our examples we sometimes use the lower
case letters p  q  and r as propositional atoms  and sequences of  s and  s to denote the
valuations of the language  for example     denotes the valuation  in a language generated
by p and q  in which p is assigned the value   and q the value    while     denotes the
valuation  in a language generated by p  q and r  in which p is assigned the value   and
both q and r the value    whenever we use the term knowledge base we will always mean
a set of sentences x which is deductively closed  i e   x   cn x  

   darwiche pearl revision
darwiche and pearl        reformulated the agm postulates  alchourron et al         to
be compatible with their suggested approach to iterated revision  this necessitated a move
from knowledge bases to epistemic states  an epistemic state contains  in addition to a
knowledge base  all the information needed for coherent reasoning including  in particular 
the strategy for belief revision which the agent wishes to employ at a given time  darwiche
and pearl consider epistemic states as abstract entities  and do not provide a single formal
representation  it is thus possible to talk about two epistemic states e and f being identical
 denoted by e   f    but yet syntactically different   this has to be borne in mind below 
particularly when considering postulate  e      in darwiche and pearls reformulated
postulates  is a belief change operator on epistemic states  not knowledge bases  we
denote by b e  the knowledge base extracted from an epistemic state e 
 e   b e      cn b e

 e   b e         b e      
 e   if  
  b e    then b e        b e       
darwiche and pearl then show  via a representation result similar to that of katsuno and
mendelzon         that revision on epistemic states can be represented in terms of plausibility orderings associated with epistemic states   more specifically  every epistemic state
e has associated with it a total preorder e on all valuations  with elements lower down
in the ordering deemed more plausible  moreover  for any two epistemic states e and f
which are identical  but may be syntactically different   it has to be the case that e  f  
let min   e   denote the minimal models of  under e   the knowledge base associated with the epistemic state is obtained by considering the minimal models in e i e  
 b e     min    e    observe that this means that b e  has to be consistent  this
requirement enables us to obtain a unique knowledge base from the total preorder e  
preservation of the results in this paper when this requirement is relaxed is possible  but
technically messy 
the observant reader will note that our assumption of a consistent b e  is incompatible
with a successful revision by   this requires that we jettison  e   and insist on consistent
epistemic inputs only   the left to right direction of  e   is rendered superfluous by  e  
and the assumption that knowledge bases extracted from all epistemic states have to be
consistent   the other difference between the original agm postulates and the darwichepearl reformulation  first inspired by a critical observation by freund and lehmann       
 occurs in  e    which states that revising by logically equivalent sentences results in
epistemic states with identical associated knowledge bases  this is a weakening of the
original agm postulate  phrased in our notation as follows 
 b   if b e    b f  and    then b e      b f   
 b   states that two epistemic states with identical associated knowledge bases will  after
having been revised by equivalent inputs  produce two epistemic states with identical associated knowledge bases  this is stronger than  e   which requires equivalent associated
knowledge bases only if the original epistemic states were identical  we shall refer to the
reformulated agm postulates  with  e   removed  as dp agm 
dp agm guarantees a unique extracted knowledge base when revision by  is performed  it sets  b e     equal to min   e   and thereby fixes the most plausible valuations in e   however  it places no restriction on the rest of the ordering  the purpose
   alternative frameworks for studying iterated revision  both based on using sequences of sentences rather
than plausibility orderings  are those of lehmann        and konieczny and pino perez        

   

fiadmissible and restrained revision

of the darwiche pearl framework is to constrain this remaining part of the new ordering 
it is done by way of a set of postulates for iterated revision  darwiche   pearl        
 throughout the paper we follow the convention that  is left associative  
 c   if    then b e        b e   
 c   if    then b e        b e   
 c   if   b e    then   b e     
 c   if  
  b e    then  
  b e     
the postulate  c   states that when two pieces of informationone more specific than
the otherarrive  the first is made redundant by the second   c   says that when two
contradictory epistemic inputs arrive  the second one prevails  the second evidence alone
yields the same knowledge base   c   says that a piece of evidence  should be retained
after accommodating more recent evidence  that entails  given the current knowledge
base   c   simply says that no epistemic input can act as its own defeater  we shall refer to
the class of belief revision operators satisfying dp agm and  c   to  c   as dp revision 
the following are the corresponding semantic versions  with v  w  v   
 cr   if v      w     then v e w iff v e w
 cr   if v      w     then v e w iff v e w
 cr   if v      w     then v e w only if v e w
 cr   if v      w     then v e w only if v e w
 cr   states that the relative ordering between  worlds remain unchanged following an revision  while  cr   requires the same for  worlds   cr   requires that  for an  world
strictly more plausible than a  world  this relationship be retained after an  revision 
and  cr   requires the same for weak plausibility  darwiche and pearl showed that  given
dp agm  a precise correspondence obtains between  ci  and  cri  above  i               
one of the guiding principles of belief revision is the principle of minimal change  changes
to a belief state ought to be kept to a minimum  what is not always clear is what ought to be
minimised  in agm theory the prevailing wisdom is that minimal change refers to the sets
of sentences corresponding to knowledge bases  but there are other interpretations  with
the move from knowledge bases to epistemic states  minimal change can be defined in terms
of the fewest possible changes to the associated plausibility ordering e   in what follows we
will frequently have the opportunity to refer to the latter interpretation of minimal change 
see also the discussion of this principle by rott        

   admissible revision
in this section we consider two of the best known dp operators  and propose three postulates to be added to the darwiche pearl framework  the first is more of a correction
than a strengthening  we show that the darwiche pearl representation of the principle of
the irrelevance of syntax is too weak and suggest an appropriate strengthened postulate 
   

fibooth   meyer

the second is suggested by some of the arguments advanced by darwiche and pearl themselves  it eliminates one of the operators they criticise  and is satisfied by the sole operator
they provide as an instance of their framework  the addition of these two postulates to
the darwiche pearl framework leads to the definition of the class of admissible revision
operators  finally  we point out a problem with nayaks well known lexicographic revision
operator and propose a third postulate to be added  the consequences of insisting on the
addition of this third postulate are discussed in detail in section   
as mentioned in section    darwiche and pearl replaced the original agm postulate
 b     with  e      both are attempts at an appropriate formulation of the principle
of the irrelevance of syntax  popularised by dalal         but whereas  b     has been
shown to be too strong  as shown by darwiche and pearl         closer inspection reveals
that  e     is too weak  to be more precise  it fails as an adequate formulation of syntax
irrelevance for iterated revision  it specifies that revision by two equivalent sentences should
produce epistemic states with identical associated knowledge bases  but does not require
that these epistemic states  after another revision by two equivalent sentences  also have
to produce epistemic states with identical associated knowledge bases  so  as can be seen
from the following example  under dp agm  and indeed  even if  c   to  c   are added 
it is possible for b e      to differ from b e      even if  is equivalent to  and 
is equivalent to  
example   consider a propositional language generated by the two atoms p and q and let
e be an epistemic state such that b e    cn p  q   now consider the two epistemic states
e  and e   such that b e      b e       cn p      e     and    e       observe that
this gives complete descriptions of e  and e     it is tedious  but not difficult  to verify
that setting ep  e  and ep  e   is compatible with dp agm  but observe then that
b e  p  p    cn p  q   while b e  p  p    cn p  q  
as a consequence of this  we propose that  e   be replaced by the following postulate 
 e     if e   f     and    then b e        b f     
the semantic equivalent of  e     looks like this 
 er     if e   f and    then e  f
 er     states that the revision of two identical epistemic states by two equivalent sentences has to result in epistemic states with identical associated total preorders  not just in
epistemic states with identical associated knowledge bases 
proposition    e     and  er     are equivalent  given dp agm 
proof  the proof that  e     follows from  er     is straightfoward  for the converse  suppose that  er     does not hold  i e     and f   e for some  and   this means
there exist x  y  v such that x e y but y f x  now let  be such that       x  y  
then x   b e        but  b f          y   and so b e         b f       a
violation of  e     


   

fiadmissible and restrained revision

from this it should already be clear that  e     is a desirable property  this view is bolstered
further by observing that all the well known iterated revision operators satisfy it  natural
revision  the darwiche pearl operator   and nayaks lexicographic revision  the first and
third of which are to be discussed in detail below  in fact  we conjecture that darwiche and
pearls intention was to replace  b   with  e      not with  e   and propose this as a
permanent replacement 
definition   the set of postulates obtained by replacing  e   with  e     in dp agm is
defined as ragm 
observe that ragm  like dp agm  guarantees that  b e       min   e   
rule  e     is the first of the new postulates we want to add to the darwiche pearl
framework  we now lead up to the second  one of the oldest known dp operators is
natural revision  usually credited to boutilier               although the idea can also be
found in  spohn         its main feature is the application of the principle of minimal
change to epistemic states  it is characterised by dp agm plus the following postulate 
 cb  if   b e    then b e        b e   
 cb  requires that  whenever b e    is inconsistent with   revising e   with  will
completely ignore the revision by   its semantic counterpart is as follows 
 cbr  for v  w 
   b e      v e w iff v e w
as shown by darwiche and pearl         natural revision minimises changes in conditional
beliefs  with     being a conditional belief of an epistemic state e iff   b e     in
fact  darwiche and pearl show  lemma    p      that keeping e and e as similar as
possible has the effect of minimising the changes in conditional beliefs to a revision  so 
from  cbr  it is clear that natural revision is an application of minimal change to epistemic
states  it requires that  barring the changes mandated by dp agm  the relative ordering of
valuations remains unchanged  thus keeping e as similar as possible to e   in that sense
then  natural revision is the most conservative of all dp operators  such a strict adherence
to minimal change is inadvisable and needs to be tempered appropriately  an issue that will
be addressed in section    darwiche and pearl have shown that  cb  is too strong  and
that natural revision is not all that natural  sometimes yielding counterintuitive results 
example    darwiche   pearl        we encounter a strange animal and it appears to be
a bird  so we believe it is one  as it comes closer  we see clearly that the animal is red  so
we believe it is a red bird  to remove further doubts we call in a bird expert who examines
it and concludes that it is not a bird  but some sort of animal  should we still believe the
animal is red   cb  tells us we should no longer believe it is red  this can be seen by
substituting b e    cn     cn bird  and   red in  cb   instructing us to totally
ignore the observation  as if it had never taken place 
given example    it is perhaps surprising that darwiche and pearl never considered postulate  p  below  in this example  the argument for retaining the belief that the creature is
red hinges upon the assumption that being red is not in conflict with the newly obtained
information that it is a kind of animal  that is  because learning that the creature is an
   

fibooth   meyer

animal will not automatically disqualify it from being red  it is reasonable to retain the
belief that it is red  more generally then  whenever  is consistent with a revision by   it
should be retained if an  revision is inserted just before the  revision 
 p  if  
  b e    then   b e     
applying  p  to example   we see that  if red is consistent with b e  bird   we have
red  b e  red  bird   put differently   p  requires that you retain your belief in the
animals redness  provided this would not have been precluded if the observation about it
being red had never occurred   p  was also proposed independently of the present paper
by jin and thielscher        where it is named independence  the semantic counterpart of
 p  looks like this 
 pr  for v     and w      if v e w then v e w
 pr  requires an  world v that is at least as plausible as a  world w to be strictly more
plausible than w after an  revision  the following result was also proved independently
by jin and thielscher        
proposition   if  satisfies dp agm  then it satisfies  p  iff it also satisfies  pr  
proof  for  p  pr   let v      w      v e w  and let  be such that       v  w  
this means that  
  b e     since  b e     is either equal to  v  or to  v  w    and so 
by  p     b e       and therefore v e w  for if not  we would have that w e v 
from which it follows that w   b e        and so  
  b e       
for  p  pr   suppose that  
  b e     this means there is a v       b e     
that is  v e w for every w      and this means that   b e       for if not  it
means there is an x in      b e        now  since x   b e        it follows from
dp agm that x e w for every w      and so x e v  since v   b e          
but it also follows from dp agm that x      and therefore that v e x  and by  pr  it
then follows that v e x  a contradiction 

rule  pr  enforces certain changes in the ordering e after receipt of   in fact as soon
as there exist an  world v and a  world w on the same plausibility level somewhere
in e  in that both v e w and w e v    pr  implies e   e   furthermore these
changes must also occur even when  is already believed in e to begin with  i e     b e  
 although of course if   b e  then b e      b e   i e   the knowledge base associated
to e will remain unchanged  this follows from dp agm   the rules  p   pr  ensure input
 is believed with a certain minimal strength of belief  enough to help it survive the next
revision  the point that being informed of  can lead to an increase in the strength of an
agents belief in   even in cases where the agent already believes  to begin with  has been
made before  e g   by friedman and halpern        p       note that  p  has the antecedent
of  c   and the consequent of  c    in fact   p  is stronger than  c   and  c   combined 
this is easily seen from the semantic counterparts of these postulates  it also follows that
the only concrete example of an iterated revision operator provided by darwiche and pearl 
the operator they refer to as  and which employs a form of spohnian conditioning  spohn 
       satisfies  pr   and therefore  p  as well  furthermore  by adopting  p  we explicitly
   

fiadmissible and restrained revision

exclude natural revision as a permissible operator  so accepting  p  is a move towards
the viewpoint that information obtained before the latest input ought not to be discarded
unnecessarily 
based on the analysis of this section we propose a strengthening of the darwiche pearl
framework in which  e   is replaced by  e     and  c   and  c   are replaced by  p  
definition   a revision operator is admissible iff it satisfies ragm   c     c    and  p  
inasmuch as the darwiche pearl framework can be visualised as one in which  worlds
slide downwards relative to  worlds  admissible revision ensures  via  pr   that this
downwards slide is a strict one 
we now pave the way for the third postulate we would like to add in this paper to the
darwiche pearl framework  to begin with  note that another view of  p  is that it is a
significant weakening of the following property  first introduced by nayak et al         
 recalcitrance  if  
  cn   then   b e     
semantically   recalcitrance  corresponds to the following property  as was pointed out by
booth        and implicitly contained in the work of nayak et al         
 r  for v      w      v e w
 recalcitrance  is a property of the lexicographic revision operator  the second of the wellknown dp operators we consider  and one that is just as old as natural revision  it was
first introduced by nayak        and has been studied most notably by nayak et al        
       although  as with natural revision  the idea actually dates back to spohn         in
fact  lexicographic revision is characterised by dp agm  and also ragm  together with
 c     c   and  recalcitrance   a result that is easily proved from the semantic counterparts
of these properties and nayak et al s semantic characterisation of lexicographic revision in
        informally  lexicographic revision takes the assumption of most recent is best 
on which the success postulate  e     is based  and adds to it the assumption of temporal
coherence  in combination  this leads to the stronger assumption that more recent is
better 
an analysis of the semantic characterisation of lexicographic revision shows that it is
the least conservative of the dp operators  in the sense that it effects the most changes in
the relative ordering of valuations permitted by dp agm  or ragm for that matter  and
the darwiche pearl postulates  since it is also an admissible revision operator  it follows
that it is also the least conservative admissible operator 
the problem with  recalcitrance  is that the decision of whether to accept  after a
subsequent revision by  is completely determined by the logical relationship between 
and   the epistemic state e is robbed of all influence  the replacement of  recalcitrance 
by the weaker  p  already gives e more influence in the outcome  what we will do shortly
is constrain matters further by giving e as much influence as allowed by the postulates for
admissible revision  such a move ensures greater sensitivity to the agents epistemic record
in making further changes 
note that lexicographic revision assumes that more recent information takes complete
precedence over information obtained previously  thus  when applied to example    it
   

fibooth   meyer

requires us to believe that the animal  previously assumed to be a bird  is indeed red 
because red is a recent input which does not conflict with the most recently obtained input 
while this is a reasonable approach in many circumstances  a dogmatic adherence to it can
be problematic  as the following example shows 
example   while holidaying in a wildlife park we observe a creature which is clearly red 
but we are too far away to determine whether it is a bird or a land animal  so we adopt the
knowledge base b e    cn red   next to us is a person with knowledge of the local area
who declares that  since the creature is red  it is a a bird  we have no reason to doubt him 
and so we adopt the belief red  bird  now the creature moves closer and it becomes clear
that it is not a bird  the question is  should we continue believing that it is red  under
the circumstances described above we want our initial observation to take precedence  and
believe that the animal is red  but lexicographic revision does not allow us to do so 
other examples along similar lines speaking against a rigid acceptance of  recalcitrance 
are those of glaister        p     and jin and thielscher        p      
while  p  allows for the possibility of retaining the belief that the animal is red  it does
not enforce this belief  the rest of this section is devoted to the discussion of a property
which does so  to help us express this property  we introduce an extra piece of terminology
and notation 
definition    and  counteract with respect to an epistemic state e  written   e  
iff   b e    and   b e    
the use of the term counteract to describe this relation is taken from nayak et al         
  e  means that  from the viewpoint of e   and  tend to exclude each other  we
will now discuss a few properties of this relation  first note that  e depends only on the
total preorder e obtained from e  indeed we have   e  iff both min   e       and
min   e        this in turn can be reformulated in the following way  which provides
a useful aid to visualise a counteracts relation 
proposition     e  iff there exist v      w     such that both v e x and w e x
for all x  min     e   
proof  first note that  since obviously min   e        min   e       may be rewritten as min   e            using the fact that e is a total preorder  it is easy to see
that this can hold iff there exists v     such that v e x for all x  min     e    in
the same way we may rewrite min   e       as min   e            which is then
equivalent to saying there exists w     such that w e x for all x  min     e    
in other words  proposition   says   e  iff there exist both an  world and a  world
which are strictly more plausible than the most plausible      worlds  other immediate
things to note about  e are that it is symmetric  and that it is syntax independent  i e   if
  e  and      then   e      furthermore if  and  are logically inconsistent with
each other then   e   but the converse need not hold  see the short example after the
next proposition for confirmation   thus  e can be seen as a weak form of inconsistency 
the next result gives two more properties of  e  
   

fiadmissible and restrained revision

proposition   given ragm  the following properties hold for  e  
 i  if   e  and   e  then       e 
 ii  if    e  and    e  then        e 
proof   i  suppose   e  and   e   to show       e  we need to show
both   b e        and       b e     for the former we already have both
  b e    and   b e    from   e  and   e  respectively  since it follows
from ragm that b e     b e     b e        for any     l  we can conclude
from this   b e         for the latter we already have both   b e    and
  b e    from   e  and   e  respectively  and from this we can conclude
      b e     again using ragm  specifically  e      
 ii  suppose    e  and    e   firstly  if either    b e    or    b e   
then we must have        b e    by ragm and so        e  as required  so
suppose both   b e    and   b e     then  since    e  and    e  
this means we have both    b e    and    b e     since it follows from ragm
that b e         b e     b e    for any     l  it follows from these two that
   b e        and so also in this case        e  as required 

the first property above says that if  counteracts with two sentences separately  then it
counteracts with their disjunction  while the second says that it cannot counteract with
a disjunction without counteracting with at least one of the disjuncts  obviously these
properties also hold for the binary relation of logical inconsistency  however one departure
from the inconsistency relation is that it is possible to have both    e  and     e  
to see this assume for the moment l is generated by just three propositional atoms  p  q  r 
and take    p     q and    r  then take e to be such that its lowest plausibility
level contains only the two valuations     and      and the next plausibility level only the
valuation     
we are now ready to introduce our third postulate  it is the following 
 d  if   e  then   b e     
 d  requires that  whenever  and  counteract with respect to e   should be disallowed
when an  revision is followed by a  revision  that is  when the  revision of e   takes
place  the information encoded in e takes precedence over the information contained in
e    darwiche and pearl        considered this property  it is their rule  c    but argued
against it  citing the following example 
example    darwiche   pearl        we believe that exactly one of john and mary committed a murder  now we get persuasive evidence indicating that john is the murderer  this
is followed by persuasive information indicating that mary is the murderer  let  represent
that john committed the murder and  that mary committed the murder  then  d  forces
us to conclude that mary  but not john  was involved in the murder  this  according to
darwiche and pearl  is counterintuitive  since we should conclude that both were involved
in committing the murder 
darwiche and pearls argument against  d  rests upon the assumption that more recent
information ought to take precedence over information previously obtained  but as we have
   

fibooth   meyer

seen in example    this is not always a valid assumption  in fact  the application of  d  to
example    with    red  bird and    bird  produces the intuitively correct result
of a belief in the observed animal being red  red  b e   red  bird   bird  
another way to gain insight into the significance of  d  is to consider its semantic
counterpart 
 dr  for v      w      and w 
   b e      if v e w then v e w
 dr  curtails the rise in plausiblity of  worlds after an  revision  it ensures that  with
the exception of the most plausible  worlds  the relative ordering between an  world and
the  worlds more plausible than it remains unchanged 
proposition   whenever a revision operator  satisfies ragm  then  satisfies  d  iff it
satisfies  dr  
proof  for  d  dr   suppose that v      w      w 
   b e      v e w  and let
 be such that       v  w   then   b e    and   b e     and so  by  d  
  b e       from this it follows that v e w  for if not  we would have that
w e v  which means that w   b e        and therefore that  
  b e       a
contradiction 
for  d  dr   suppose that   b e    and that   b e     but assume that
 
  b e       this means there is a w     that is also in  b e        now
observe that w 
   b e     since w is an  model  also  since w   b e        it
follows from ragm that w is a  model  and therefore w 
   b e      our supposition of
  b e    means that min   e        since w         it thus follows that there
is a v         such that v e w  by  dr  it then follows that v e w  but then w
cannot be a model of b e       a contradiction 


   restrained revision
we now strengthen the requirements on admissible revision  those operators satisfying
ragm   c     c   and  p   by insisting that  d  is satisfied as well  to do so  let us
first consider the semantic definition of an interesting admissible revision operator  recall
that ragm fixes the set of  e   minimal models  setting them equal to min   e    but
places no restriction on how the remaining valuations should be ordered  the following
property provides a unique relative ordering of the remaining valuations 

v e w or 
 rr  v  w 
   b e      v e w iff
v e w and  v     or w     
 rr  says that the relative ordering of the valuations that are not  e   minimal remains
unchanged  except for  worlds and  worlds on the same plausibility level  those are split
into two levels with the  worlds more plausible than the  worlds  so ragm combined
with  rr  fixes a unique ordering of valuations 
definition   the revision operator satisfying ragm and  rr  is called restrained revision 
   

fiadmissible and restrained revision

it turns out that within the framework provided by admissible revision  it is only restrained
revision that satisfies  d   we prove this with the help of the following lemma  asserting
the equivalence of  rr  to  cr     cr     pr  and  dr  in the presence of ragm 
lemma   whenever a revision operator  satisfies ragm  then  satisfies  rr  iff it
satisfies  cr     cr     pr   and  dr  
proof  for  cr   rr   pick v  w      if v   b e     then  cr   follows from
ragm  if not  it follows from ragm that w 
   b e      and then  cr   follows from
a direct application of  rr   for  cr   rr   pick v  w      from ragm it follows
that v  w 
   b e      and then we obtain  cr   from a direct application of  rr  
observe that  rr  can be rewritten as

v e w and 
 
 rr   v  w 
   b e      v e w iff
v e w or  v     and w     
now  for  pr  rr   pick v     and w      if v   b e     then  pr  follows
from ragm  if not  it follows from a direct application of  rr     for  dr  rr   pick
v      w      and w 
   b e      then  pr  follows from a direct application of
 
 rr   
for  cr     cr     pr    dr  rr   let v  w 
   b e     and suppose that v e w
and v  e w  i e  w e v   we have to show that v e w and either v     or w     
assume this is not the case  then w e v or both v     and w      now  the second
case is impossible because  together with w e v and  pr  it implies that w e v  a
contradiction  but the first case is also impossible  to see why  observe that by  cr   it
implies that v and w cannot both be  models  by  cr   v and w cannot both be models  by  dr  it cannot be the case that w     and v      and by  pr  it cannot
be the case that w     and v      this concludes the first part of the proof of  cr   
 cr     pr    dr  rr   for the second part  let v  w 
   b e     and suppose first that
v e w  if v  w     then v e w follows from  cr    if v  w     then v e w
follows from  cr    if v     and w     then v e w follows from  pr   if v    
and w     then v e w follows from  dr   now suppose that v e w and either v    
or w      if v     then v e w follows either from  cr   or  pr   depending on
whether w     or w      and similarly  if w     then v e w follows either from
 cr   or  pr   depending on whether v     or v     


theorem   ragm   c     c     p  and  d  provide an exact characterisation of restrained revision 
proof  the proof follows from lemma    proposition    proposition    and the correspondence between  c   and  cr    and  c   and  cr   

another interpretation of  rr  is that it maintains the relative ordering of the valuations
that are not  e   minimal  except for the changes mandated by  pr   from this it can
be seen that restrained revision is the most conservative of all admissible revision operators 
in the sense that effects the least changes in the relative ordering of valuations permitted
   

fibooth   meyer

by admissible revision  so  in the context of admissible revision  restrained revision takes
on the role played by natural revision in the darwiche pearl framework 
in the rest of this section we examine some further properties of restrained revision 
firstly  examples   and   share some interesting structural properties  in both  the initial
knowledge base b e  is pairwise consistent with each of the subsequent sentences in the
revision sequence  while the sentences in each revision sequence are pairwise inconsistent 
and in both examples the information contained in the initial knowledge base b e  is
retained after the revision sequence  these commonalities are instances of an important
general result  let  denote the non empty sequence of inputs             n   and let e  
denote the revision sequence e            n   furthermore we shall refer to an epistemic
state e as  compatible provided that i 
  b e  for every i in             n  
 o  if e is  compatible then b e   b e   
 o  says that as long as b e  is not in direct conflict with any of the inputs in the sequence
            n   the entire b e  has to be propagated to the knowledge base obtained from
the revision sequence e            n   this is a preservation property that is satisfied by
restrained revision 
proposition   restrained revision satisfies  o  
proof  we denote by e  i   for i              n  the revision sequence e              i  with
e      e   we give an inductive proof that  for v   b e   and w 
   b e    v ei w
for i              n  in other words  every b e  world is always strictly below every non b e world  from this the result follows immediately  for i     this amounts to showing that
v e w which follows immediately from the definition of e and b e   now pick any
i              n and assume that v ei  w  we consider four cases  if v  w   i   then it
follows by  cr   that v ei w  if v  w   i   then it follows by  cr   that v ei w 
if v   i   and w   i   then it follows by  pr  that v ei w  and finally  suppose
v   i   and w   i    by i  compatibility there is an x   b e     i    and by the
inductive hypothesis  x ei  w  so w 
   b e  i     and then it follows by  dr  that
v ei w 

although restrained revision preserves information which has not been directly contradicted 
it is not dogmatically wedded to older information  if neither of two successive  but incompatible  epistemic states are in conflict with any of the inputs of a sequence                n  
it prefers the latter epistemic state when revising by  
proposition   restrained revision satisfies the following property 
 q  if e and e are both  compatible but b e b e     then b e   b e 
and b e    b e     
proof  it follows immediately from proposition   that b e     b e       and
b e    b e      then follows from the consistency of b e      

next we consider another preservation property  but this time  unlike the case for  o  and
 q   we look at circumstances where b e  is incompatible with some of the inputs in a
revision sequence 
   

fiadmissible and restrained revision

 s  if   b e    and   b e    then b e          b e     
note that  given ragm  the antecedent of  s  implies that   b e   thus  s  states
that if  is believed initially  and that a subsequent commitment to either  or its negation
would not change this fact  then after the sequence of inputs in which  is preceded by  and
  the second input concerning  is nullified  and the older input regarding  is retained 
proposition   restrained revision satisfies  s  
proof  suppose the antecedent holds  if   e  then the consequent holds  in fact
this can be seen from the property  t  in proposition    below  so suppose    e  
then either    b e      or    b e       this latter doesnt hold by one of
the assumptions together with  c    so the former must hold  this implies   b e   
by  p   combining this with the other assumption we get   e   in this case we get
b e        b e     again using  t    while  since    e   b e         
b e            t  once more   which in turn equals b e        by  c    since
  b e    this is in turn equal to b e    by ragm as required 

we now provide a more compact syntactic representation of restrained revision  first we
show that  c   and  p  can be combined into a single property  and so can  c   and  d  
proposition   given ragm 
    c   and  p  are together equivalent to the single rule
 c p  if    b e    then b e        b e       
    c   and  d  are together equivalent to the single rule
 c d  if   e  then b e        b e    
proof  for  c    p  c p   suppose    b e   by  p  it follows that   b e 
which means  by ragm  that b e        b e           by  c   it follows that
b e      b e     and thus that b e    b e     for  c   c p  
suppose that     then    b e    by ragm  and so b e        b e       
by  c p   but since      it follows that b e        b e     for  p  c p  
suppose that    b e     then b e        b e        by  c p  which means 
by ragm  that   b e      
for  c    d  c d   suppose that   e   by  d     b e       by
ragm this means that b e        b e           now  by  c   it follows
that b e            b e         so b e        b e         but since
  b e   we get by ragm that b e       b e   from which it follows that
b e        b e     for  c   c d   suppose that     then   e  for any e
and by b e        b e    by  c d   for  d  c d   suppose that   e   then
b e    b e  by  c d  and since   b e   it follows that   b e   
both  c p  and  c d  provide conditions for the reduction of the two step revision sequence
e     to a single step revision  if only as regards the resulting knowledge base    c p 
   

fibooth   meyer

reduces it to an      revision when  is consistent with a  revision   c d  reduces it
to a  revision  ignoring  completely  when  and  counteract with respect to e  now 
it follows from ragm that the consequent of  c p  also obtains when    b e    
putting this together we get a most succinct characterisation of restrained revision 
proposition    only restrained revision satisfies ragm and 

b e   
if   e 
 t  b e       
b e        otherwise 
proof  from theorem   and proposition   it is sufficient to show that ragm   c p  and
 c d  hold iff ragm and  t  hold  so  suppose that  satisfies ragm and  t    c p 
follows from the bottom part of  t   while  c d  follows from the top part  conversely 
suppose that  satisfies ragm   c p  and  c d   if   e  it follows from  c d  that
b e        b e     if not  we consider two cases  if  
  b e    it follows from
 c p  that b e    b e     otherwise it has to be the case that  
  b e  
but then it follows from ragm that b e        b e        

if we were to replace   e  in the first clause in  t  by the stronger  and 
are logically inconsistent  we would obtain instead the characterisation of lexicographic
revision given by nayak et al         
proposition    allows us to see clearly another significant property of restrained revision 
for if   e  then we know   b e      directly from  d   while if    e  then
proposition    tells us b e        b e        and so   b e      by ragm 
thus we see in the state e     the epistemic status of   either accepted or rejected  is
always completely determined  i e   we have proved 
proposition    restrained revision satisfies the following property 
 u  if    b e      then   b e     
 given its similar characterisation just mentioned above  it is easy to see lexicographic
revision satisfies  u  too   like  p   property  u  can be read as providing conditions
under which the penultimate revision input  should be believed  its antecedent is simply
saying b e      is consistent with   thus  u  is saying the penultimate input should be
believed as long as it is consistent to do so  by chaining  u  together with  c    we easily
see that  u  actually implies  p  in the presence of  c    as a consequence  we obtain the
following alternative axiomatic characterisation of restrained revision 
theorem   ragm   c     c     c     u  and  d  provide an exact characterisation of
restrained revision 
for  u   we are also able to provide a simple semantic counterpart property  it corresponds
to a separating of all the  worlds from all the  worlds in the total preorder e following
an  revision  in that each plausibility level in e either contains only  worlds or contains
only  worlds 
proposition    whenever a revision operator  satisfies ragm  then  satisfies  u  iff
it satisfies the following property 
   

fiadmissible and restrained revision

 ur  for v     and w      either v e w or w e v
proof  for  u  ur  suppose  ur  doesnt hold  i e   there exist   v     and w    
such that both v e w and w e v  letting  be such that       v  w  we get
 b e          v  w  from ragm and thus both      b e       because of
v  w   b e       respectively   hence  u  doesnt hold 
for  u  ur  suppose  u  doesnt hold  i e   there exist    such that both     
b e       then there exist v     and w     such that v  w   b e        
 by ragm  min   e    since both v and w are  e   minimal  worlds we must have
both v e w and w e v  hence   v  w give a counterexample to  ur  

finally in this section we turn to two properties first mentioned  as far as we know  by
schlecta et al          see also the work of lehmann et al          
 disj   b e       b e       b e         
 disj   b e           b e       b e     
 disj   says that if a sentence is believed after any one of two sequences of revisions that
differ only at step i  step i being  in one case and  in the other   then the sentence
should also be believed after that sequence which differs from both only in that step i is
a revision by the disjunction     similarly   disj   says that every sentence believed
after an       revision should be believed after at least one of     and      both
conditions are reasonable properties to expect of revision operators 
proposition    restrained revision satisfies  disj   and  disj   
to prove this result we will make use of the properties of the counteracts relation given
in proposition    along with the following lemma 
lemma   if   e  and        e  then b e              b e       
proof  suppose   e  and        e   we will first show that this implies
  b e       we will then be able to conclude the required b e       
b e        using ragm  so suppose on the contrary    b e             then
there exists some  world w  min         e    then also w  min     e    since
  e  we know from proposition   there exist an  world w  and a  world w  such
that wi e w for i         clearly w  is also a      world  so we infer        e  
contradiction  hence   b e            as required 

proof  of proposition     we prove both properties simultaneously by looking at two cases 
case  i         e   in this case b e            b e    by property  t  in
proposition     meanwhile we know from proposition   ii  that either   e  or   e  
and so using  t  again we know at least one of b e      and b e      must also be
equal to b e     hence we see both  disj   and  disj   hold in this case 
case  ii          e   in this case  t  tells us b e            b e             
b e                meanwhile proposition   i  tells us at least one of    e 
and    e  holds  we now consider two subcases according to which either both these
   

fibooth   meyer

hold  or only one holds  if both these hold then b e        b e        and
b e        b e         so  disj   and  disj   reduce to
 disj     b e         b e         b e               
 disj     b e                 b e         b e       
respectively  now it is a consequence of ragm that for any sentences    we have both
    b e     b e     b e        and     b e         b e     b e    
substituting    for  and    for  here gives us the required  disj      from      and
 disj      from      
now lets consider the subcase where   e  and    e    a symmetric argument
will work for the other subcase    e  and   e    then from    e  we get
b e        b e         while from   e  together with        e  we get also
b e      b e    using lemma    so in this case b e      b e  
from which both  disj   and  disj   follow immediately 

we end this section by remarking that it can be shown that lexicographic revision also
satisfies  disj   and  disj   

   restrained revision as a composite operator
as we saw in section    boutiliers natural revision operator  let us denote it in this section
by   is vulnerable to damaging counterexamples such as the red bird example    and
fails to satisfy the very reasonable postulate  p   although a new input  is accepted in the
very next epistemic state e     does not in any way provide for the preservation of 
after subsequent revisions  as hans rott        p      describes it   t he most recent input
sentence is always embraced without reservation  the last but one input sentence  however 
is treated with utter disrespect  thus  there seem to be convincing reasons to reject  as a
viable operator for performing iterated revision  however  the literature on epistemic state
change constantly reminds us that keeping changes minimal should be a major concern  and
when judged from a purely minimal change viewpoint  it is clear that  cant be beaten 
how can we find our way out of this apparent quandary  in this section we show that the
use of  can be retained  provided its application is preceded by an intermediate operation
in which  rather than revising e by new input   essentially  is revised by e 
given an epistemic state e and sentence   let us denote by e    the result of this
intermediate operation  e    is an epistemic state  the idea is that when forming e    
the information in e should be maintained  that is  the total preorder e  should satisfy
v e w implies v e  w 

   

but rather than leaving behind  entirely in favour of e  as much of the informational
content of  should be preserved in e    as possible  this is formalised by saying that for
any v      w      we should take v e  w as long as this does not conflict with    
above  it is this second requirement which will guarantee  enough of a presence in the
revised epistemic state e   to help it survive subsequent revisions and allow  p  to be
   

fiadmissible and restrained revision

captured  taken together  the above two requirements are enough to specify e  uniquely 

v e w  or
v e  w iff
   
v e w and  v     or w      
thus  e  is just the lexicographic refinement of e by the two level total preorder 
defined by v  w iff v     or w      this backwards revision operator is not new 
it has been studied by papini         it can also be viewed as just a backwards version
of nayaks lexicographic revision operator  we do not necessarily have   b e      this
will hold only if    b e    and so   does not satisfy ragm 
given    we can define the composite revision operator   by setting
e       e      

   

this is reminiscent of the levi identity  gardenfors         used in agm theory as a recipe
for reducing the operation of revision on knowledge bases to a composite operation consisting
of contraction plus expansion  in       is playing the role of expansion  the operator  
does satisfy ragm  in fact  as can easily be seen by comparing     above with condition
 rr  at the start of section      coincides with restrained revision 
proposition    let r denote the restrained revision operator  then r      
thus we have proved that restrained revision can be viewed as a combination of two existing
operators 

   how to choose a revision operator
the contribution of this paper so far can be summarised as follows  we have argued for
the replacement of the darwiche pearl framework by the class of admissible revision operators  arguing that the former needs to be strengthened  in doing so we have eliminated
natural revision  but retained lexicographic revision and the  operator of darwiche and
pearl as admissible operators  we have also introduced a new admissible revision operator 
restrained revision  and argued for its plausibility  but this is not an argument that restrained revision is somehow unique  or more preferred than other revision operators  the
contention is merely that  for epistemic state revision  the darwiche pearl framework is
too weak and should be replaced by admissible revision  and restrained revision  being an
admissible revision operator  is therefore only one of many revision operators deemed to be
rational  the question of which admissible revision operator to use in a particular situation
is one which depends on a number of issues  such as context  the strength with which certain
beliefs are held  the source of the information  and so on  this point has essentially also
been made by friedman and halpern         for example  example   formed part of an
argument for the use of restrained revision  and against the use of lexicographic revision 
in effect we used the example to argue that red ought to be in b  e  red  bird  bird  
where b e    cn red   but if we change the context slightly  it becomes an example in
favour of the use of lexicographic revision  and against restrained revision 
example   we observe a creature which seems to be red  but we are too far away to
determine whether it is a bird or a land animal  so we adopt the knowledge base b e   
   

fibooth   meyer

cn red   next to us is an expert on birds who remarks that  if the creature is indeed red  it
must be a bird  so we adopt the belief red  bird  then we get information from someone
standing closer to the creature that it is not a bird  given this context  that is  the reliability
of the expert combined with the statement that the creature initially seemed to be red  it is
reasonable to adopt the lexicographic approach of more recent is best and conclude that
the bird is not red  formally  red  b  e  red  bird  bird   where b e    cn red  
for a case where the source of the information dramatically affects the outcome  consider
the following example 
example   consider the sequence of inputs where p is followed by a finite number  say n 
of instances of the pair p  q  q   to make this more concrete  the reader might wish to
substitute p with red and q with bird   since p is not in direct conflict with any sentences in
the sequence succeeding it  any revision operator satisfying the property o  and this includes
restrained revision  will require that p be contained in the knowledge base obtained from this
revision sequence  now  if each pair p  q and q is obtained from a different source  such
a conclusion is clearly unreasonable  after all  such a sequence amounts to being told that
p is the case  followed by n different sources essentially telling you that p is the case  on
the other hand  if the pairs p  q and q all come from the same source  the case is not so
clear cut anymore  in fact  in this case one would expect the result to be the same as that
obtained from the sequence p  p  q  q  a sequence with the same formal structure as that
employed in example    where restrained revision was seen to be a reasonable approach 
another example in which restrained revision fares less well is the following  
example   suppose we are teaching a class of students consisting of n boys and m girls 
and suppose the class takes part in a mathematics competition  for each i              n and
j              m let the propositional variables pi and qj stand for boy i won the competition
and girl j won the competition respectively  and suppose initially
w we believe one of the
boys won the competition  i e   b e    cn     where    i pi and  is just some
sentence expressing the uniqueness of the competition winner  now suppose we interview
each of the boys one after the other  and each of them tells us that either one of the girls
or he himself won  i e   we obtain the sequence of inputs    pi  i   suppose we are willing
to accept the boys testimony  using a revision operator which satisfies o will lead us to
believe boy n won the competition  which seems implausible  lexicographic revision gives
the desired result that one of the girls won the competition 
from these examples it is clear that an agent need not  and in most cases  ought not
to stick to the same revision operator every time that it has to perform a revision  this
means that the agent will keep on switching from one revision operator to another during the
process of iterated revision  of course  this leads to the question of how to choose among the
available  admissible  revision operators at any particular point  a comprehensive answer
to this question is beyond the scope of this paper  but we do provide some clues on how to
address the problem  in brief  we contend that epistemic states have to be enriched  with a
more detailed specification of their internal structure  looking back at the history of belief
revision  we can see that this is exactly how the field has progressed  in the initial papers 
   we are grateful to one of the anonymous referees for suggesting this example 

   

fiadmissible and restrained revision

such as those on agm revision  an epistemic state was taken to contain nothing more than
a knowledge base  so  for example  basic agm revision as characterised by the first six
agm postulates imposes no structure on epistemic states at all  we shall refer to these as
simple epistemic states  with full agm belief revision as characterised by all eight agm
postulates  the view is still one of the revision of knowledge bases  but now every revision
operator for knowledge base b is uniquely associated with a b faithful total preorder  i e  
a total preorder on valuations with the models of b as its minimal elements  from here
it is a small step to define epistemic states to include such an ordering  i e  to include the
total preorder e associated with an epistemic state e as part of the definition of e  we
shall refer to these as complex epistemic states 
this leads to two different views of the same revision process  if we view revision
as an operator on simple epistemic states we have many different revision operators  one
corresponding to each of the b faithful total preorders  but with no way to distinguish
between them when having to choose a revision operator  viewed as such  iterated revision
is a process in which a  possibly  different revision operator is employed at every revision
step  this is the principal view adopted by nayak et al          however  if we view
revision as an operator on complex epistemic states  every epistemic state contains enough
information to determine uniquely the knowledge base  but not the faithful total preorder 
resulting from the revision  in other words  we now have enough information encoded in
an epistemic state to uniquely determine the knowledge base resulting from a revision  but
we lack the information to uniquely determine the full epistemic state  the darwichepearl framework  and now also admissible revision  place some constraints on the resulting
epistemic state  but do not impose any additional structure on the complex epistemic state 
in our view admissible revision for complex epistemic states is analogous to basic agm
revision for simple epistemic states  the next step would thus be to impose additional
structure on complex epistemic states  this could possibly involve the addition of a second
ordering on valuations as was done  for example  by booth et al          in the case of
simple epistemic states the effect of adding the two supplementary postulates is to constrain
basic revision to the extent that each revision operator can be uniquely associated with a bfaithful total preorder  in that sense  the addition of the supplementary postulates allowed
for the imposition of additional structure on simple epistemic states  recall that one way of
interpreting the two supplementary postulates is that they explain the interaction between
revision by two sentences and revision by their conjunction  something the basic postulates
do not address 
so  as we have seen  the addition of the supplementary postulates leads to the definition
of revision as operators on complex epistemic states  we conjecture that giving additional
structure to complex epistemic states might involve the provision of postulates analogous to
the two agm supplementary postulates  in particular  we conjecture that such postulates
might be such that they explain the interaction between two sentences and their conjunction 
or disjunction  for iterated revision  observe that none of the darwiche pearl postulates 
or the additional postulates for admissible revision for that matter  address this issue  in
fact the only postulates to have been suggested  of which we are aware  which so far do
address it are  disj   and  disj    we speculate that the appropriate set of supplementary
postulates for iterated revision  which may or may not include the two just mentioned  will
lead to the definition of extra structure on complex epistemic states  which can then be
   

fibooth   meyer

incorporated into an enriched version of complex epistemic states  with revision then being
seen as operators on these enriched entities  let us refer to them as enriched epistemic
states  enriched epistemic states will enable us to determine uniquely the complex epistemic
state resulting from a revision  thereby solving the question we started off with  that of
determining which revision on complex epistemic states to use at every particular point
during a process of iterated revision  below we shall briefly discuss a possible way of
enriching complex epistemic states  but note also that a recent proposal for doing so is
that of booth et al          it is instructive to observe that  disj   and  disj   both hold
in their framework 
the proposed outline above is not without its pitfalls  the most obvious problem with
such an approach is that it leaves us with a meta version of the dilemma that we started off
with  using enriched epistemic states we are now able to uniquely determine the complex
epistemic states resulting from a revision  but not the resulting enriched epistemic state  we
can lessen the problem by constraining the permissible resulting enriched epistemic states in
the same way that admissible revision constrains the permissible complex epistemic states 
but chances are that this whittling down will not produce a single permissible enriched
epistemic state  and  of course  this is bound to occur over and over again  that is 
whenever we solve the problem of uniquely determining an epistemic state with a certain
structure by a process of further enrichment  we will be saddled with the question of how
to uniquely determine the further enriched epistemic state resulting from a revision  our
conjecture is that at some level a point will be reached where constraining further enriched
epistemic states  a la admissible revision  will eventually lead to a unique further enriched
epistemic state associated with every revision  only further research will determine whether
our conjecture holds water 
in conclusion  we have shown that the darwiche pearl arguments lead to the acceptance
of the admissible revision operators as a class worthy of study  the restrained revision
operator  in particular  exhibits quite desirable properties  besides taking the place of
natural revision as the operator adhering most closely to the principle of minimal change 
its satisfaction of the properties  o    q  and  u  shows that it does not unnecessarily
remove previously obtained information 
for future work we would also like to explore more thoroughly the class of admissible
revision operators  in this paper we saw that restrained revision and lexicographic revision
lie at opposite ends of the spectrum of admissible operators  they represent respectively
the most conservative and the least conservative admissible operators in the sense that
they effect the most changes and the least changes  respectively  in the relative ordering
of valuations permitted by admissible revision  a natural question is whether there exists
an axiomatisable class of admissible operators which represents the middle ground  one
clue for finding such a class can be found in the counteracts relation  e which can be
derived from an epistemic state e  as we said  this relation depends only on the preorder
e associated to e  in fact  given any total preorder  over v we can define the relation
  by
    iff min         and min         
then clearly  e   e   furthermore if  is the full relation v  v then   reduces to
logical inconsistency  a counteracts relation stronger than  e   but still weaker than logical
inconsistency can be found by setting        where   lies somewhere in between e
   

fiadmissible and restrained revision

and v  v   hence one avenue worth exploring might be to assume that from each epistemic
state e we can extract not one but two preorders e and  e such that e  e   then 
instead of only requiring   e  to deduce   b e       as is done with restrained
revision  the postulate  d    we could require the stronger condition    e  for this
to hold  we are currently experimenting with strategies for using the second preorder to
guide the manipulation of e to enable this property to be satisfied  the use of a second
preorder can be seen as a way of enriching the epistemic state  and might thus contribute
to the solution of the choice of revision operators discussed in section   
some more future work relates also to the two extreme cases revision  but looked at
from a different angle  as mentioned earlier  lexicographic revision is a formalisation of
the most recent is best approach to revision taken to its logical extreme  this approach
is exemplified by the  e   postulate  also known as success  which requires a revision to
be successful  in the sense that the epistemic input provided always has to be contained
in the resulting knowledge base  given that  e   is one of the postulates for admissible
revision  this requirement carries over even to restrained revision  which is on the opposite
end of the spectrum for admissible revision  but this means that the admissible revision
operator which differs the most from lexicographic revision still adheres to the dictum of
most recent is best  which raises the question of why the most recent input is given
such prominence  the relaxation of this requirement would imply giving up  e   and
venturing into the area known as non prioritised revision  booth        chopra  ghose   
meyer        hansson         we speculate that an appropriate relaxation of admissible
revision  with  e   removed as a requirement  will lead to a class of  non prioritised 
revision operators strictly containing admissible revision  and with lexicographic revision
still at one end of the spectrum  but with the other end of the spectrum occupied by the
operator studied by papini        which was used as a sub operation of restrained revision
in section    this operator is formalised by the extreme version of most recent is worst 
in other words  the older the better
