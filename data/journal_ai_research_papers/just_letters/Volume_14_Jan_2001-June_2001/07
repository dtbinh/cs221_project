   conditional plausibility

    unconditional plausibility measures

getting conditional plausibility measures  perhaps best consider unconditional plausibility measures  basic idea behind plausibility measures straightforward 
probability measure maps subsets set w         domain may consist
subsets w   however  required algebra   recall algebra f
w set subsets w containing w closed union complementation 
u  v   f   u   v u    plausibility measure general 
maps elements algebra f arbitrary partially ordered set  pl plausibility
measure  read pl u    the plausibility set u    pl u   pl v    v
least plausible u   ordering partial  could plausibility
two different sets incomparable  agent may prepared say two sets
one likely another equal likelihood 
formally  plausibility space tuple    w  f   pl   w set worlds  f
algebra w   pl maps sets f set plausibility values partially
ordered relation  so exive  transitive  anti symmetric 
contains two special elements  d  d  d  d   d 
intended analogues     probability  usual  ordering defined

three requirements plausibility measures  first two obvious analogues requirements hold notions uncertainty  whole space gets
maximum plausibility empty set gets minimum plausibility  third

 in pl   implicitly assuming u  u     f   similar assumptions made throughout  
standard representations uncertainty literature represented
plausibility measures  brie describe representations uncertainty
relevance paper 
sets probabilities  one common way representing uncertainty set probability measures  set often assumed convex  see  example   campos   moral 
      cousa  moral    walley        gilboa   schmeidler        levi        walley       
discussion references   however  convex sets seem appropriate representing independence assumptions  make restriction here  example 
coin unknown probability heads tossed twice  tosses known
independent  seems reasonable representation given set p  consisting
measures    hh    ff     ht     th    ff     ff    tt         ff    
unfortunately  p  convex  moreover  convex hull includes many measures
coin tosses independent  argued  cousa et al         set
probability measures behaviorally equivalent convex hull  however  even
accept argument  follow set convex hull equivalent insofar
determination independencies goes 
number ways viewing set p probability measures plausibility
measure  one uses lower probability p   defined p  u     inf f u       pg  clearly
p satisfies pl     corresponding upper probability p   defined p  u     supf    
pg       p  u    clearly plausibility measure 
p p give way comparing likelihood two subsets u v w  
two ways incomparable  easy find set p probability measures w
subsets u v w p  u     p  v   p  u     p  v    rather
choosing p p   associate different plausibility measure p
captures both  let dp  p   f a  b      b  g define  a  b   a    b    iff b a   
puts partial order dp  p   clearly  dp p           dp p           define
plp  p  u      p  u    p  u     thus  plp  p associates set u two numbers
thought defining interval terms lower upper probability u  
easy check plp  p  u   plp  p  v   upper probability u less
equal lower probability v   plp  p satisfies pl     indeed plausibility
measure  one puts partial order events
