abstract
description logics  dls  are suitable  well known  logics for managing structured
knowledge  they allow reasoning about individuals and well defined concepts  i e  set
of individuals with common properties  the experience in using dls in applications has
shown that in many cases we would like to extend their capabilities  in particular  their
use in the context of multimedia information retrieval  mir  leads to the convincement
that such dls should allow the treatment of the inherent imprecision in multimedia object
content representation and retrieval 
in this paper we will present a fuzzy extension of alc  combining zadehs fuzzy logic
with a classical dl  in particular  concepts becomes fuzzy and  thus  reasoning about
imprecise concepts is supported  we will define its syntax  its semantics  describe its
properties and present a constraint propagation calculus for reasoning in it 

   introduction
the representation of uncertainty and imprecision has received a considerable attention in
the artificial intelligence community in an attempt to extend existing knowledge representation systems to deal with the imperfect nature of real world information  which is likely
the rule rather than an exception   an impressive work has been carried out in the last
decades  resulting in a number of concepts being investigated  a number of problems being
identified and a number of solutions being developed  bacchus        dubois   prade       
kruse  schwecke    heinsohn        pearl        
for most knowledge representation formalisms  first order logic  fol  has been the
basis  its basic units individuals  their properties  and the relationship between them
naturally capture the way in which people encode their knowledge  unfortunately  it is
severely limited both  i  by its ability to represent our uncertainty about the world due
to lack of knowledge about the real world a fact can only estimated to be true to e g 
a probability degree  and  ii  by its ability to represent inherently imprecise knowledge
indeed  there are concepts  like hot  for which no exact definition exists and  thus  a fact
like    celsius is hot  rather being true or false  has a truth value in between true and
false 
in the last decade a substantial amount of work has been carried out in the context of
description logics  dls    dls are a logical reconstruction of the so called frame based
knowledge representation languages  with the aim of providing a simple well established
tarski style declarative semantics to capture the meaning of the most popular features of
structured representation of knowledge  a main point is that dls are considered as to be
   description logics have also been referred to as terminological logics  concept logics  kl one like

attractive logics in knowledge based applications as they are a good compromise between
expressive power and computational complexity 
nowadays  a whole family of knowledge representation systems has been build using dls 
which differ with respect to their expressiveness  their complexity and the completeness of
their algorithms  and they have been used for building a variety of applications  peltason 
      brachman        baader   hollunder      a  horrocks        
experience in using dls in applications has also shown that in many cases we would
like to extend the representational and reasoning capabilities of them  in particular  the use
of dls in the context of multimedia information retrieval  mir  points out the necessity
of extending dls with capabilities which allow the treatment of the inherent imprecision
in multimedia object representation and retrieval  meghini   straccia        meghini  sebastiani    straccia               in fact  classical dls are insufficient for describing real
multimedia retrieval situations  as the retrieval is usually not only a yes no question   i  the
representations of multimedia objects content and queries which the system  and the logic 
have access to are inherently imperfect  and  ii  the relevance of a multimedia object to a
query can thus be established only up to a limited degree  because of this  we need a logic
in which  rather than deciding tout court whether a multimedia object satisfies a query or
not  we are able to rank the retrieved objects according to how strongly the system believes
in their relevance to a query 
to this end  we will extend dls with fuzzy capabilities  the choice of fuzzy set theory
as a way of endowing a dl with the capability to deal with imprecision is not uncommon
 da silva  pereira    netto        tresp   molitor        yen        and can be motivated
 from a semantics point of view  as fuzzy logics capture the notion of imprecise concept 
i e  a concept for which a clear and precise definition is not possible  fuzzy concepts
play a key role in e g  content descriptions of multimedia objects  most of humans
concepts are imprecise   for instance  in the context of images  the  semantic  content
of an image region r may be described by means of a fuzzy statement like r is about
a ferrari and establish that this sentence has truth value      i e  r is likely about a
ferrari 
 from a proof theoretical point of view  as there exist well known techniques for reasoning in fuzzy logics  chen   kundu        lee        xiachun  yunfei    xuhua 
      
in the following we will present a quite general fuzzy dl  in the sense that it is based on
the dl alc  a significant and expressive representative of the various dls  this allows
us to adapt it easily to the different dls presented in the literature  another important
point is that we will show that the additional expressive power has no impact from a
computational complexity point of view  this is certainly important as the nice tradeoff between computational complexity and expressive power of dls contributes to their
popularity 
note that our fuzzy extension for the management of imprecise knowledge is complementary to other dl extensions for the management of uncertainty  e g  probabilistic extension
 heinsohn        jager        koller  levy    pfeffer        sebastiani        with some exceptions like shown by hollunder        where a possibilistic dl has been considered  even
   

fireasoning within fuzzy dls

though these probabilistic extensions enlarge the applicability of dls they do not address
the issue of reasoning about individuals and imprecise concepts  as imprecise knowledge and
uncertain knowledge are orthogonal  dubois   prade         moreover  reasoning in a
probabilistic framework is generally a harder task  from a computational point of view  than
the relative non probabilistic case and in most cases a complete axiomatization is missing
 halpern        roth         as a consequence  the computational problems have to be
addressed carefully  koller et al         
we will proceed as follows  in the following section we first introduce alc  in section  
we extend alc to the fuzzy case and discuss some properties in section    while in section  
we will present a constraint propagation calculus for reasoning in it  section   concludes
and presents some topics for further research 

   a quick look to alc
the specific dl we will extend with fuzzy capabilities is alc  a significant representative
of dls  at first  we will introduce classical alc  while in section   our fuzzy extension of
alc will be presented 
we assume three alphabets of symbols  called primitive concepts  denoted by a   primitive roles  denoted by r  and individuals  denoted by a and b   
    concept and role
concepts are expressions that collect the properties  described by means of roles  of a set of
individuals  from a fol point of view  concepts can be seen as unary predicates  whereas
roles are interpreted as binary predicates 
a concept  denoted by c or d  of the language alc is build out of primitive concepts
according to the following syntax rules 
c  d 

  
 
a 
c u d 
c t d 
c 
r c 
r c

 top concept 
 bottom concept 
 primitive concept 
 concept conjunction 
 concept disjunction 
 concept negation 
 universal quantification 
 existential quantification  

    interpretation
dls have a clean  model theoretic semantics  based on the notion of interpretation  an
interpretation i is a pair i    i   i   consisting of a non empty set i  called the domain 
and of an interpretation function i mapping different individuals into different elements of
i  called unique name assumption   primitive concepts into subsets of i and primitive
roles into subsets of i  i   the interpretation of complex concepts is defined as usual 
   through this work we assume that every metavariable has an optional subscript or superscript

note that each concept c and role r can be mapped into an equivalent open first order
formula fc  x  and fr  x  y   respectively

f  x    f

fr c  x    y fr  x  y   fc  y

where t and f are two formulae representing the truth value true and false  respectively
 e g  t   p  p and f   p  p  for some letter p  
two concepts c and d are said to be equivalent  denoted by c  d  when c i   di
for all interpretations i  note that  e g        c u d   c t d   and  r c  
 r c  
    assertion
an assertion  denoted by   is an expression of type a c  a is c  also a is an instance of
c   or an expression of type  a  b  r   a  b  is r  also  a  b  is an instance of r   for
instance  tom tall u student asserts that tom is a tall student  whereas  tim  tom  friend
asserts that tom is a friend of tim  a primitive assertion is either an assertion of the
form a a  where a is a primitive concept  or an assertion of the form  a  b  r  from a
semantics point of view  an interpretation i satisfies a c  resp   a  b  r  iff ai  c i  resp 
 ai   bi    ri   
    terminological axiom
a terminological axiom  denoted by    is either a concept specialisation or a concept definition  a concept specialisation is an expression of the form a c  where a is a primitive
concept and c is a concept  a specialisation allows stating the existence of a specialisation  more specific than  relation between concepts  for instance  ferrari sportcar u
   

fireasoning within fuzzy dls

ownedby carfanatic states that a ferrari is a sport car that is owned by a car fanatic 
on the other hand  a concept definition is an expression of the form a    c  where
a is a primitive concept and c is a concept  a concept definition allows stating the
equivalence between concepts  for instance  tennis    sportkind u  hassporttool    u
 hassporttool tennisracket  states that tennis is identified by a kind of sport having a
tennis racket as a sport tool  from a semantics point of view  an interpretation i satisfies a
concept specialisation a c iff ai  c i   similarly  an interpretation i satisfies a concept
definition a    c iff ai   c i  
    knowledge base  entailment and subsumption
a finite set k of assertions and terminological axioms will be called a knowledge base  kb  
with ka we will denote the set of assertions in k  whereas with kt we will denote the set
of terminological axioms in k  also called a terminology  a kb k is purely assertional if
kt     further  we will assume that a terminology kt is such that no concept a appears
more than once on the left hand side of a terminological axiom   kt and that no cyclic
definitions are present in kt   
we will say that an interpretation i satisfies  is a model of   a kb k iff i satisfies each
element in k  a kb k entails an assertion   denoted by k      iff every model of k
also satisfies   furthermore  let kt be a terminology and let c  d be two concepts  we
will say that d subsumes c with respect to  w r t   kt  denoted by c vkt d  iff for every
model i of kt   c i  di holds 
the problem of determining whether k     is called entailment problem  the problem of determining whether c vkt d is called subsumption problem  and the problem of
determining whether k is satisfiable is called satisfiability problem 
it is well known  buchheit  donini    schaerf      a  donini  lenzerini  nardi   
schaerf        nebel        that in alc
k     a  b  r iff  a  b  r  k
k    a c iff k   a c  is not satisfiable
c v d iff a c    a d  for a new a
 

c vkt d iff c v d

 

    
    
    
    

where c   and d  are build from c and d by expanding the terminology kt to kt   and
substituting every primitive concept occurring in c or d  which is defined in kt     with its
defining term in kt     the expansion of a kb k works as follows  nebel        
   elimination of concept specialisation  each concept specialisation a c  kt is replaced with a concept definition a    c u a   where a is a new primitive concept 
a stands for the absent part of the definition of a  let kt  be the terminology  which
is obtained by replacing all concept specialisation by concept definitions 
   we will say that a directly uses primitive concept b in kt   if there is   kt such that a is on the left
hand side of  and b occurs in the right hand side of    let uses be the transitive closure of the relation
directly uses in kt   kt is cyclic iff there is a such that a uses a in kt

   expansion of kt    every defined concept  i e  the first argument of a concept definition 
which occurs in the defining term of a concept definition  i e  the second argument of
a concept definition  is substituted by its defining term  this process is iterated until
there remain only undefined concepts in the second arguments of concept definitions 
this yields a terminology kt    
   expansion of ka   every primitive concept occurring in ka which is defined in kt   is
   
substituted by its defining term in kt     this yields ka
         where   is obtained by
the transformation has the nice property that k     iff ka
replacing every primitive concept occurring in   which is defined in kt     with its defining
term in kt     while this allows us to restrict our attention to purely assertional kbs only 
it is worth noting that the expansion process can be exponential  nebel        
from           it follows that the above problems can be reduced to the satisfiability
problem  there exists a well known technique based on constraint propagation solving this
problem  schmidt schau   smolka        buchheit  donini    schaerf      b  donini
et al         
we conclude with an example 

example   consider the following terminology kt  
sportkind
 
sporttool
 
individualsport  
teamsport
 
basketball
 
tennisracket
 
basket
  

tennis

 
 
sportkind

 kindofsport teamsport u
 hassporttool   u
 hassporttool basketball 
    sportkindu
 kindofsport   u
 kindofsport individualsport u
 hassporttool   u
 hassporttool tennisracket 

suppose that there are two video sequences v   v   which are about basket and tennis  respectively  we may represent the semantic content of them through
kv     v  video u about basket 
kv     v  video u about tennis  
consider k   kt  kv   kv    if we are interested in retrieving videos about sport  we may
query k through the query concept q   video u about sportkind and the answer will be
the list containing both v  and v   as k    v  q and k    v  q hold 
   

fireasoning within fuzzy dls

on the other hand  if we are looking for individual sport videos  then  given the query
concept q    video u about kindofsport individualsport  it follows that only video v  will
be retrieved  in fact  k  
  v  q  and k    v  q  hold 
 

   a fuzzy dl
our fuzzy extension directly relates to zadehs work on fuzzy sets  zadeh         a fuzzy set
s with respect to an universe u is characterised by a membership function s   u         
assigning an s membership degree  s  u   to each element u in u   s  u  gives us an
estimation of the belonging of u to s  typically  if s  u      then u definitely belongs to
s  while s  u        means that u is likely to be an element of s  moreover  according to
zadeh  the membership function has to satisfy three well known restrictions  for all u  u
and for all fuzzy sets s    s  with respect to u
s  s   u    min s   u   s   u  
s  s   u    max s   u   s   u  
s   u 
     s   u   
where s  is the complement of s  in u   alternative restrictions on membership functions
have been proposed in the literature  but it is not our aim to investigate them here  the
interested reader may consult e g  dubois   prade        
a justification of the choice of the min and the max was given by bellman and giertz
        which have shown that under certain reasonable conditions min and max are the
unique possible choice for set intersection and set union  respectively 
when we switch to fuzzy logics  the notion of degree of membership s  u  of an element
u  u w r t  the fuzzy set s over u is regarded as the truth value of the statement u is
s  accordingly  in our fuzzy dl   i  a concept c  rather than being interpreted as a
classical set  will be interpreted as a fuzzy set and  thus  concepts become imprecise  and 
consequently   ii  the statement a is c  i e  a c  will have a truth value in        given by
the degree of membership of being the individual a a member of the fuzzy set c 
    fuzzy interpretation
a fuzzy interpretation is now a pair i    i   i    where i is  as for the crisp case  the
domain  whereas i is an interpretation function mapping
   individuals as for the crisp case  i e  ai    bi   if a    b 
   a concept c into a membership function c i   i         
   a role r into a membership function ri   i  i         
if c is a concept then c i will naturally be interpreted as the membership degree function
of the fuzzy concept  set  c w r t  i  i e  if d  i is an object of the domain i then
c i  d  gives us the degree of being the object d an element of the fuzzy concept c under
the interpretation i  similarly for roles  additionally  the interpretation function i has to
satisfy the following equations  for all d  i  
   

fistraccia

 i  d 
i  d 
 c u d i  d 
 c t d i  d 
 c i  d 
 r c i  d 
 r c i  d 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
min c i  d   di  d  
max c i  d   di  d  
   c i  d 
inf d  i  max    ri  d  d     c i  d     
supd  i  min ri  d  d     c i  d      

these equations are the standard interpretation of conjunction  disjunction  negation and
quantification  respectively  see lee        tresp   molitor        
note that the semantics of r c
 r c i  d    supd  i  min ri  d  d     c i  d     

    

is the result of viewing r c as the open first order formula y fr  x  y   fc  y   see     
and the existential quantifier  is viewed as a disjunction over the elements of the domain 
similarly 
 r c i  d    inf d  i  max    ri  d  d     c i  d     

    

is related to the open first order formula y fr  x  y   fc  y   see       where the universal
quantifier  is viewed as a conjunction over the elements of the domain 
we will say that two concepts c and d are said to be equivalent  denoted by c 
  d 
when c i   di for all interpretations i  as for the crisp non fuzzy case  dual relationships
between concepts hold  e g    
      c u d  
   c t d  and  r c  
   r c  
    fuzzy assertion
a fuzzy assertion  denoted by   is an expression having one of the following form h  ni
or h  mi  where  is an alc assertion  n         and m          from a semantics point
of view  a fuzzy assertion h  ni constrains the truth value of  to be less or equal to n
 similarly for    consequently  e g  hv  video u about basket     i states that video v  is
likely about basket  formally  an interpretation i satisfies a fuzzy assertion ha c  ni  resp 
h a  b  r  ni  iff c i  ai    n  resp  ri  ai   bi    n   similarly  an interpretation i satisfies
a fuzzy assertion ha c  ni  resp  h a  b  r  ni  iff c i  ai    n  resp  ri  ai   bi    n  
two fuzzy assertions    and    are said to be equivalent  denoted by    
       iff they are
satisfied by the same set of interpretations  notice that the combination of both ha c  mi
and ha c  ni  with m  n  restricts the truth value of a c in between  m  n   moreover 
ha c  ni 
  ha c     ni  a primitive fuzzy assertion is a fuzzy assertion involving a
primitive assertion 
one might wonder why we do not allow expressions of the form h   ni or the form
h   ni  the reason simply relies on the observation that it is quite hard to imagine
situations in which we are able to assert such strict      relations  so we will leave them
out for ease  
   of course  the whole can easily be extended in case we would like to consider these two types of assertions
too 

   

fireasoning within fuzzy dls

note that in the work of straccia         no fuzzy assertion of the form h  ni is
allowed 
    fuzzy terminological axiom
fuzzy terminological axioms we will consider are a natural extension of classical terminological axioms to the fuzzy case  from a syntax point of view  a fuzzy terminological axiom
 denoted by    is either a fuzzy concept specialisation or a fuzzy concept definition  a fuzzy
concept specialisation is an expression of the form ac  where a is a primitive concept
and c is a concept  on the other hand  a fuzzy concept definition is an expression of the
form a  c  where a is a primitive concept and c is a concept  from a semantics point of
view  we consider the natural extension of classical set inclusion to the fuzzy case  zadeh 
       a fuzzy interpretation i satisfies a fuzzy concept specialisation ac iff
d  i   ai  d   c i  d  

    

whereas i satisfies a fuzzy concept definition a  c iff
d  i   ai  d    c i  d  

    

note that in the work of straccia        a fuzzy specialisation is non standard  indeed  straccia        considered fuzzy specialisations of the form ha  c  ni where
 a  c i   mindi  max    ai  d   c i  d     a drawback of this formulation is that
it is not clear where the n in ha  c  ni comes from  i e  who defines the value n and
how it is determined  we prefer to rely here on the standard interpretation of fuzzy subsets 
    fuzzy knowledge base  fuzzy entailment and fuzzy subsumption
a fuzzy knowledge base is a finite set of fuzzy assertions and fuzzy terminological axioms 
as for the crisp case  with a we will denote the set of fuzzy assertions in   with t we
will denote the set of fuzzy terminological axioms in   the terminology   if t    then 
is purely assertional  and we will assume that a terminology t is such that no concept a
appears more than once on the left hand side of a fuzzy terminological axiom   t and
that no cyclic definitions are present in t  
an interpretation i satisfies  is a model of   a set of fuzzy  iff i satisfies each element
of   a fuzzy kb  fuzzy entails a fuzzy assertion   denoted by    iff every model of
 also satisfies  
furthermore  let t be a terminology and let c  d be two concepts  we will say
that d fuzzy subsumes c w r t  t  denoted by c t d  iff for every model i of t  
d  i   c i  d   di  d  holds 
finally  given a fuzzy kb  and an assertion   it is of interest to compute s best
lower and upper truth value bounds  to this end we define the greatest lower bound of
 w r t    denoted by glb      to be sup n    h  ni   similarly  we define the
least upper bound of  with respect to   denoted by lub      to be inf n    h  ni 
 sup       inf        determining the lub and the glb is called the best truth value bound

   some properties
in this section we discuss some properties of our fuzzy logic  several properties described
by straccia      b  for the propositional case are easily extended to our first order case too 
    concept equivalence

the first ones are straightforward      




c   c   c ud    c td   c td    c ud  c  u c  tc       c  uc   t c  uc   
and c  t  c  u c    
   c  t c    u  c  t c     for concepts involving roles  we have r c 
 



r c  r        r    and  r c  u  r d    r  c u d   please  note that we
and
do not have c u c 
 
 
   nor we have c t c 
    and  thus   r c  u  r c  
i
 r c  t  r c   
    hold  in general we can only say that  c u c   d        for any
interpretation i and d  i and  similarly   c t c i  d        i e  lub   a c u c       
and glb   a c t c         respectively 
    entailment relation
of course   h  ni iff glb      n  and similarly  h  ni iff lub      n hold 
concerning roles  note that  h a  b  r  ni iff h a  b  r  mi   with m  n  therefore 
glb   r a  b     max n   hr a  b   ni   

    

while the same is not true for the  case  while h a  b  r  mi   and m  n imply
 h a  b  r  ni  the converse is false  e g   ha r a   i  hb a   i  h a  b  r   i   
furthermore  from  ha c  ni iff  ha c     ni 
   lub   c a    
 
 
 
 

   inf n    ha c  ni 
sup    n    ha c  ni 
sup n    ha c     ni 
sup n    ha c  ni 
glb   a c  

follows  therefore 
lub   a c       glb   a c  

    

i e  lub can be determined through glb  and vice versa   the same reduction to glb does
not hold for lub    a  b  r  as  a  b  r is not an expression of our language  
modus ponens on concepts is supported  if m    n then  ha c  mi  ha c t d  ni  
ha d  ni holds 
modus ponens on roles is supported  if m      n then  h a  b  r  mi  ha r d  ni 
 ha d  ni and  ha r c  mi  ha r d  ni   ha r  c u d   min n  m i hold  moreover   ha r c  mi  ha r d  ni   ha r  c u d   min n  m i holds 
modus ponens on specialisation is supported  the following degree bounds propagation
through a taxonomy is supported  if c  d then  i     ha c  ni  ha d  ni  and

note that  according to straccia       
if m      n then  ha a  mi  ha  c  ni  ha c  ni 
a drawback of the above property is that whatever the degree m is  as long as m      n  
from ha a  mi and ha  c  ni we infer ha c  ni  where n is a priori fixed value 
    soundness of the semantics
our fuzzy semantics is sound w r t  crisp semantics  in fact  let  be a fuzzy kb in which
no h a  b  r  ni occurs  we leave these fuzzy assertions out  as role negation is not present
in crisp alc  let us consider the following transformation     of fuzzy assertions into
assertions  where     takes the crisp assertional part of a fuzzy assertion 
 h  ni   
 ha c  ni   a c 
we extend     to fuzzy terminological axioms as follows         finally            
          t   
it is quite easily to verify that
proposition   let  be a fuzzy kb in which no h a  b  r  ni occurs and let  be a fuzzy
assertion h  ni  if  h  ni then         i e  there cannot be fuzzy entailment
without entailment in alc  
a
proof  consider a classical interpretation i satisfying    i is also a fuzzy interpretation
such that c i  d           ri  d  d            hold  by induction on the structure of a
concept c it can be shown that i  classically  satisfies a c iff c i  ai        similarly for
roles  therefore  i is a fuzzy interpretation satisfying   by hypothesis  i satisfies h  ni
and n      therefore  the truth value of  under i is    i e  i satisfies    
for the general case   has to be satisfiable as h a  b  r  ni may introduce an inconsistency 
e g   h a  b  r     i  h a  b  r     i  ha a   i  but   a  b  r      a a  
the converse of proposition   does not hold in general 
example   let  be the set     ha a t b     i  ha a     i   it follows that    
 a  a t b   a a  which is unsatisfiable  therefore  it can easily be verified that      a b 
but   
  ha b  ni  for all n     
 
once we restrict the attention to normalised fuzzy assertions  a converse relation follows
immediately  lee        straccia      b  
indeed  we say that a fuzzy assertion  is kb normalised iff
   if  is h  ni then n       
   if  is h  ni then n       
we say that a fuzzy assertion  is query normalised iff
   

fistraccia

   if  is h  ni then n      
   if  is h  ni then n      
note that the definitions for kb normalisation and query normalisation are dual  the
following proposition follows from  lee        straccia      b  and relies on the fact that
h  ni and h  mi are together inconsistent  if n       and m        in particular 
straccia      b  shows that if  and  are a normalised fuzzy propositional kb and a
query normalised fuzzy proposition  then then   iff         the proof is given
by showing that from a deduction proving   a deduction proving        can be
build and vice versa  the extension to our case is straightforward as e g  for n  m       
ha r c  ni h a  b  r  mi hb c  ni iff a r c   a  b  r    b c holds  the other firstorder cases involving  and  are similar  
proposition   let  be a fuzzy kb in which no h a  b  r  ni occurs and each    is
kb normalised  let  be a query normalised fuzzy assertion  then   iff         a
example   let  be the set     ha a u b     i  ha a     i   let  be ha b     i 
each fuzzy assertion in  is kb normalised and  is query normalised  it follows that
     a  a u b   a a  and     a b  it is easily verified that   and that        
thereby confirming proposition   
 
    subsumption
at first  as for the classical case and with the same method seen before  subsumption
between two concepts c and d w r t  a terminology t   i e  c t d  can be reduced to
the case of an empty terminology  i e  c    d   
example   suppose we have two images i  and i  each being a snapshot of the car traffic
on a major street of an european city  an underlying image analysis tool recognizes  among
all the recognised objects  that in image i  there is a ferrari  while in image i  there is a
porsche  furthermore  a semantic image indexing tool establishes that  to some degree n
image i  is about a ferrari  whereas to some degree m image i  is about a porsche  please
note that  as a weight of a keyword in text is a quantitative description of the aboutness of
the text w r t  the keyword  a truth degree gives a quantitative description of the aboutness
of an images w r t  an object  i e  the aboutness is handled as an imprecise concept  so  let
us consider
    hi  about ferrari     i  hi  about porsche     i 
ferraricar  porschecar  
where the axioms specify that both a ferrari and a porsche are a car  according to the
expansion process   will be replaced by
     hi  about ferrari     i  hi  about porsche     i 
ferrari  car u ferrari   porsche  car u porsche   
which will be simplified to
   

fireasoning within fuzzy dls

      hi  about  car u ferrari       i 
hi  about  car u porsche       i  
now  if we are looking for images which are about cars  then from  we may infer that   
hi  about car     i and  hi  about car     i  furthermore  it is easily verified that
     hi  about car     i and     hi  about car     i hold as well  indeed  for any
fuzzy assertion     iff      holds 
 
we conclude this section with the analogue of example   for the fuzzy case  
example   consider the terminology kt and the query concept q in example    let
us define t as the fuzzy kb derived from kt in which each terminological axiom  has
been replaced with the fuzzy terminological axiom    moreover  let us suppose that an
underlying semantic video indexing tool furnishes the following semantic descriptions of the
two videos v  and v  
v     hv  video   i  hv  about basket     i 
v     hv  video   i  hv  about tennis     i  
i e  video v  is about basket with degree      whereas video v  is about tennis with degree
     let us consider    t  v   v    it is easily verified that glb   v  q        
whereas glb   v  q        hold  therefore  video v  will be ranked before video v  after
the retrieval process 
 

   decision algorithms in fuzzy alc
deciding whether  h  ni or  h  mi requires a calculus  without loss of generality
we will consider purely assertional fuzzy kbs only 
we will develop a calculus in the style of the constraint propagation method  as this
method is usually proposed in the context of dls  buchheit et al       a   the calculus
extends the fuzzy propositional calculus described by chen and kundu        and by
straccia      b  to our fuzzy dl case  we first address the entailment problem  then the
subsumption problem and finally the btvb problem  both the subsumption problem and
the btvb problem will be reduced to the entailment problem 
    a decision procedure for the entailment problem
consider a new alphabet of alc variables  an interpretation is extended to variables by
mapping these into elements of the interpretation domain  an alc object  denoted by w 
is either an individual or a variable  
a constraint  denoted by   is an expression of the form w c or  w  w    r  where w  w 
are objects  c is an alc concept and r is a role  a fuzzy constraint  denoted by   is an
expression having one of the following four forms  h  ni  h   ni  h  ni  h   ni  note
that assertions and fuzzy assertions are constraints and fuzzy constraints  respectively 
   in the following  if there is no ambiguity  alc variables and alc objects are called variables and objects

the definitions of satisfiability of a constraint  a fuzzy constraint  a set of constraints 
a set of fuzzy constraints  primitive constraint and primitive fuzzy constraint are obvious

our calculus  determining whether a finite set s of fuzzy constraints is satisfiable or not  is
based on a set of constraint propagation rules transforming a set s of fuzzy constraints into
simpler satisfiability preserving sets si until either all si contain a clash  indicating that
from all the si no model of s can be build  or some si is completed and clash free  that is 
no rule can be further be applied to si and si contains no clash  indicating that from si a
model of s can be build  
a set of fuzzy constraints s contains a clash iff it contains either one of the constraints in
table   or s contains a conjugated pair of fuzzy constraints  each entry in table   says us

a set of fuzzy constraints s is said to be complete if no rule is applicable to it  any complete
set of fuzzy constraints s  obtained from a set of fuzzy constraints s  by applying the above
rules      is called a completion of s    due to the rules  t     t      u   and  u     more
than one completion can be obtained  these rules are called nondeterministic rules  all
other rules are called deterministic rules 
it is easily verified that the above calculus has the termination property  i e  any completion of a finite set of fuzzy constraints s can be obtained after a finite number of rule

proposition   a finite set of fuzzy constraints s is satisfiable iff there exists a clash free
completion of s 
a
proof 
    given the termination property  it is easily verified  by case analysis  that the
above rules are sound  i e  if s  is satisfiable then there is a satisfiable completion s 
of s  and  thus  s  contains no clash  for instance  let us show that the     rule is
sound  assume i is an interpretation satisfying hw   r c  ni and h w    w    r  mi 
where m      n  let us show that i satisfies hw   c  ni  since i satisfies hw   r c  ni
it follows that max    ri  w  i   w  i    c i  w  i     n  but  ri  w  i   w  i    m and  thus 
   ri  w  i   w  i       m   n  as a consequence  c i  w  i    n follows  i e  i satisfies
hw   c  ni 
    suppose that there exists a clash free completion s   of s  we build from s   an
interpretation i satisfying s   and  as s  s     i satisfies s  i is called canonical model 
for any primitive constraint   s     we collect its lower and upper bound restrictions
in s   as follows  let
n        n   h  ni  s    
n         n   h   ni  s

we have to define i such that for each constraint   i satisfies the constraints collected

min n     and min n       respectively  in each table we distinguish between the four cases
where the sets are empty  no constraints  or not  for instance  if for a constraint w a  only
hw a     i  hw a      i  hw a     i and hw a      i are in s     then according to the first
table bellow  row     for a       glb w a              whereas lub w a          
we will define i such that ai  wi     glb w a     to make sure that glb w a    
i
a  wi    lub w a     we have to choose an      small enough such that glb w a    
lub w a     i e               the existence of such an      is guaranteed by the fact that
s   is clash free  an additional condition that the choice of such an  has to satisfy concerns
the case of a constraint  of type  w  w    r  let us show the problem with an example 
suppose s   is  h w  w    r      i  hw r b     i  hw   b     i   therefore  according to
the above tables  glb  w  w    r                  lub  w  w    r           glb w   b         
and lub w   b             so  it seems that it is sufficient to choose an       such that
            which is indeed not the case  in fact  hw r b     i and hw   b     i
introduces an upper bound on  w  w    r  i e  the truth value of  w  w    r under i has to be
less or equal to               that is  we have to choose an       such that              
otherwise  the truth value of w   b under i has to be greater or equal to      contradicting
lub w   b             again  the existence of such an  is guaranteed as s   is clash free 
summing up  since s   is clash free  it follows that for each primitive constraint   there
is        such that

the cases involving c and c t d can be shown similarly 
case hw r c  ni  let  be  w  w    r and consider hw   c  ni  it follows that  either  i

n  i e  i satisfies hw r c  ni 
the cases hw r c   ni  hw r c  ni and hw r c   ni can be shown similarly 
case hw r c  ni  since s   is complete  both h w  w    r  ni and hw   c  ni are in
s     by induction  i satisfies both h w  w    r  ni and hw   c  ni  as a consequence 
min ri  w  w     c i  w      n follows and  thus  supw  i min ri  w  w     c i  w      n  i e 
i satisfies hw r c  ni 
the cases hw r c   ni  hw r c  ni and hw r c   ni can be shown similarly   
the following example shows how such an interpretation is build 
example   let us consider example   and the fuzzy assertion      we have shown that

we show that s  is satisfiable by building an interpretation as described in the proof of

therefore  we can freely choose       and     whereas   and   have to be such that

from a computational complexity point of view  the fuzzy entailment problem can be proven
to be a pspace complete problem  as is the classical entailment problem 
proposition   let  be a fuzzy kb and let  be a fuzzy assertion  determining whether
  is a pspace complete problem 
a
proof  we have seen that termination of the above algorithm is guaranteed  additionally 
for a crisp kb k  define k    h   i     k   by definition  each   k is kbnormalised and h     i is query normalised  then from proposition   it follows that
k     iff k  h     i  from the pspace completeness of the entailment problem in
crisp alc  schmidt schau   smolka         pspace hardness of the fuzzy entailment
problem follows  unfortunately  our algorithm  as it is  requires exponential space due a
well know problem inherited from the crisp case  indeed  it easily verified that a completion
of s    x c   where c is the concept
 r a     u  r a     u r   r a     u  r a     u       r   r an    u  r an           
contains at least  n     variables  in order to require polynomial space  schmidt schau
and smolka        introduced the so called trace rule  t   for the  operator  the  t  
rule modifies the    rule as shown below 
   

fireasoning within fuzzy dls

  

 t  

w r c   w  x  r  x c
if x new variable and there is no w  such that both  w  w    r and w   c
are already in the actual constraint set
w r c   w  x  r  x c
if x new variable and no  w  w    r  is already in the actual set of constraints 

the difference between the    rule and the  t   is that the latter is applied only once
for an object w  we are thus compelled to make a nondeterministic choice amongst the
constraints of the form w r c  furthermore  it is convenient to apply a trace rule only if
none of the other  u    t      and    rules are applicable 
we say that a set of constraints s   is a trace of a set s if s   obtained from s by
application of the rules where the    has been replaced by  t    schmidt schau and
smolka        have shown that a set of constraints s    x c  is satisfiable iff no trace s  
of s contains a clash  as the size of a trace s   of s is bounded polynomially by the size of
s  polynomial space is sufficient to prove satisfiability 
the above trace rule works if we start from a constraint set of the form  x c   in
the general case  we have to rely on so called pre completions  baader   hollunder      b 
donini et al          a set of constraints s   is said to be a pre completion of a given set
of constraints s  if it is obtained from s by the application of the  u    t      and   
rules  and none of these rules is applicable to s    the size of s   is polynomially bounded
by the size of s   as a consequence of this pre processing step  all role relationships
 w  w    r  s   can be ignored  i e  removed from s     because they no longer carry any
additional information  now  in a second step we can apply the method above by checking
whether no trace from s   contains a clash  in summary  a set of constraints s is satisfiable
iff there is a pre completion s   of s such that no trace s    of s   contains a clash 
in the fuzzy case  similar trace rules can easily be defined  for instance  the correspondent trace rule of the     rule is
 t   

hw r c  ni  h w  x  r  ni  hx c  ni
if x new variable and no h w  w    r   mi is already in
the actual set of fuzzy constraints 

the trace rules correspondent to the rules           and      are defined similarly  by
proceeding as for the crisp case  it can be shown that  i  a set of fuzzy constraints s
is satisfiable iff there is a pre completion s   of s such that no trace s    of s   contains a
clash  and  ii  the size of a trace s    of s is bounded polynomially by the size of s  as a
consequence  the satisfiability problem is in pspace  which completes the proof   
this result establishes an important property about our fuzzy dl  in effect  it says that no
additional computational cost has to be paid for the major expressive power 
    a decision procedure for the subsumption problem
in this section we address the subsumption problem  i e  deciding whether c t d  where
c and d are two concepts and  is a fuzzy terminology  as we have seen  see example    
   

fistraccia

c t d can be reduced to the case of an empty terminology by applying the kb expansion
process  so  without loss of generality  we can limit our attention to the case c  d 
at first  an analogue to relation      holds  in fact  it can easily be shown that
proposition   let c and d be two concepts  it follows that c  d iff for all n    
ha c  ni ha d  ni  where a is a new individual 
a
proof 
    assume that c  d holds  suppose to the contrary that n     such that
ha c  ni  
  ha d  ni  therefore  there is an interpretation i and an n     such that
c i  ai    n and di  ai     n  but  from the hypothesis n  c i  ai    di  ai     n follows 
absurd 
    assume that for all n      ha c  ni ha d  ni holds  suppose to the contrary
that c   d holds  therefore  there is an interpretation i and d  i such that c i  d   
di  d      let us extent i to a such that ai   d and consider n   c i  d       of course 
i satisfies ha c  ni  therefore  from the hypothesis it follows that i satisfies ha d  ni 
i e  di  d   n   c i  d    di  d   absurd   
how can we check whether for all n     ha c  ni ha d  ni holds  a solution to this
problem  restricted to the propositional case  is given by straccia      a   indeed  it is
shown that
proposition    straccia      a  let p and q be two propositions      n       and
   n         it follows that for all n      hp  ni hq  ni iff for both m   n    n    
hp  mi hq  mi holds 
a
the above proposition establishes that  at the propositional level  in order to check whether
hp  ni hq  ni holds for all n  it is sufficient to check the entailment relation with respect
to two values n    n    the first being less or equal than      while the second being greater
than      respectively  this is due to the fact that for given values n  n        any proof of
hp  ni hq  ni can be converted into a proof for hp  n  i hq  n  i and vice versa  the
case where n  n        is similar 
the above proposition can be extended to our fuzzy dl as well 
lemma   let c and d be two concepts      n  n       and let a be an individual  it
follows that ha c  ni ha d  ni iff ha c  n  i ha d  n  i 
a
proof 
it is enough to show that s    ha c  ni  ha d   ni  is satisfiable iff s    
 ha c  n  i  ha d   n  i  is satisfiable 
    assume that s is satisfiable  so  there is a clash free completion s of s  with
s n n    we indicate the set of fuzzy constraints obtained from s  by replacing any value n
in s with n  and any value    n in s with    n    respectively  we will show that s n n   
is a clash free completion of s   and  thus  s   is satisfiable 
let r            rk   k    be the sequence of inference rule applications  which applied to s
get s  let s    s  let sk   s and for    i  k let si be the set of fuzzy constraints
obtained from si  by the application of the ri rule to si   
by induction on k  we show that  i  the sequence of inference rules r            rk can be
applied to s   as well   ii  for s       s     s   k   s   and s   i the set of fuzzy constraints obtained
   

fireasoning within fuzzy dls

from s   i  by the application of the ri rule to s   i    we have that s   i   si  n n    and  thus 
s     s   k   sk  n n      s n n     and  iii  if sk is a clash free completion of s then s   k is a
clash free completion of s   as well 
case k      no rule is applicable to s and s    s is a completion of s  by case analysis   i  it is easily verified that no rule is applicable to s   and  ii  s     s      
s   n n      s n n      iii  so  s     is a completion of s     we show that s     is clashfree  assume to the contrary that s       i e  s   contains a clash  as a consequence 
s      ha c  n  i  ha c   n  i   but then  s is  ha c  ni  ha c   ni   contrary to the
assumption that s is clash free 
induction step  by case analysis on the rule rk   we limit our presentation to the    
rule as for the other the proof is similar 
if rk is     then it can be verified that there are hw r c    ni and h w  w    r      ni
in sk  such that hw   c    ni   sk  and hw   c    ni  sk   by induction  sk   n n     
s   k  and  thus  both hw r c    n  i and h w  w    r      n  i are in s   k    while
hw   c    n  i   s   k    therefore   i  rule rk is applicable to s   k  and hw   c    n  i 
s   k    ii  so  s   k   sk  n n      iii  from s   k   sk  n n    and  as sk is a completion
of s  by case analysis  it is easily verified that no rule is further applicable to s   k  
therefore  s   k is a completion of s     let us show that s   k is clash free  assume to
the contrary that s   k contains a clash  if one of the cases in table   holds  then from
s   k   sk  n n    it follows easily that there is a clash in sk as well  which is contrary to
assumption that sk is clash free  on the other hand  if there is a conjugated pair of
fuzzy constraints in s   k  see table     then one of the following three pairs is in s   k  
 a  h  n  i and h   n  i   b  h     n  i and h      n  i  and  c  h   n  i and
h      n  i  note that n  n         again  as s   k   sk  n n     it follows that there is
a conjugated pair in sk as well  which is contrary to assumption that sk is clash free 
    can be proven similarly to       
by proceeding as for lemma   it can be shown that
lemma   let c and d be two concepts     n  n        and let a be an individual  it
follows that ha c  ni ha d  ni iff ha c  n  i ha d  n  i 
a
from lemma   and lemma   it follows that
proposition   let c and d be two concepts      n           n        and let a be
an individual  it follows that for all n     ha c  ni ha d  ni iff for both m   n    n    
ha c  mi ha d  mi holds 
a
as a consequence  the subsumption problem can be reduced to the entailment problem for
which we have a decision algorithm 
   

fistraccia

    a decision procedure for the btvb problem
we address now the problem of determining glb     and lub      this is important  as
computing  e g  glb      is in fact the way to answer a query of type to which degree is
  at least  true  given the  imprecise  facts in   
without loss of generality  we will assume that all concepts are in nnf  negation normal
form   straccia      b  has shown that  in case of fuzzy propositional logic  from a set  of
fuzzy propositions of the form hp  ni and hp  ni  where p is a proposition  it is possible
to determine a finite set n           where  n    is o      such that glb   q   n   
i e  the greatest lower bound of a proposition q w r t   has to be an element of n   
therefore  glb   q  can be determined by computing the greatest value n  n  such that
 hq  ni  an easy way to search for this n is to order the elements of n  and then
to perform a binary search among these values by successive entailment tests  dually 
as lub   q       glb   q  holds  the lub can either be computed from the glb or  as
lub   q      n    where    n        n   n  n     we can compute it by determining
the smallest value in    n   

proposition    straccia      b  let  be a set of fuzzy propositions in nnf and let q
be a proposition  then glb   q   n  and lub   q      n    where

 n   hp  ni    
    n   hp  ni   

   n        n   n  n    
a
the above proposition   can easily be extended our fuzzy description logic case  essentially 
the quantifiers do not change the possible values of glb   f   and lub   f   
proposition   let  be a set of fuzzy assertions in nnf and let  be an assertion  then
glb      n  and lub         n    where

proof  let us show that glb      n    let m be glb      by definition  if m     then
s      h   ni  is satisfiable for any n     and    n    otherwise  m     is the largest
value such that s      h   mi  is not satisfiable  let us mark each sub expression in 
with a    so that we can trace the components of the query assertion  during a deduction 
   

fireasoning within fuzzy dls

consider a completion s   of s  starting from h   mi  by applying the rules of inference 
only  marked expressions of type h    mi or h       mi can appear in s     furthermore 
as s is not satisfiable  s   contains a clash  i e  the value m is the largest value such that all
completions s   of s contain a clash  let us analyse s     as s   contains a clash  then either
 i  there is a clash according to table    or  ii  there is a clash according to table    if
 i  is the case  i e  there is   s   which is a clash  then we have to distinguish between
two cases   a   is not marked with  and  b   is marked with    in the former case  s  
contains a clash independently of the value m and  thus  the largest possible value m for
which s   contains a clash is    in the latter case  as m      either    hw       mi or
   hw     mi which are both clashes for any value of m  as a consequence  the largest
possible value m for which s   contains a clash according to table   is    assume  ii  is the
case  i e  a conjugated pair of fuzzy constraints  and    is in s     similarly to the previous
case  we have to distinguish the cases for which  and    are marked with    there are four
cases 
 a     h  ki and      h   k   i are in s     none is marked with  and k   k    
therefore  s   contains a clash for any value of m and  thus  the largest choice is   
 b     h  ki and      h    mi are in s     only    is marked with  and k  m 
therefore  s   contains a clash for any value of m  k and  thus  the largest choice for m is
k  it is easily verified by case analysis on the rules that from   s     k  n  follows 
 c     h  ki and      h       mi are in s     only    is marked with  and k   m 
therefore  s   contains a clash for any value of m     k and  thus  the largest choice for
m is    k  it is easily verified by case analysis on the rules that from   s        k  n 
follows 
 d     h   mi and      h       mi are in s     both are marked with  and m   m 
therefore  s   contains a clash for any value of m      and  thus  the largest choice for m
is     
summing up  we have proved that the largest possible value for m is such that m 
 

n  

the algorithms computing glb     and lub     are described in table    for instance 
by a binary search on n    the value of glb     can be determined in at most log  n   
fuzzy entailment tests 

   conclusions and future work
in this work  we have presented a quite general fuzzy extension of the dl alc  a significant
and expressive representative of the various dls  our fuzzy dl enables us to reason in
presence of imprecise alc concepts  i e  fuzzy alc concepts  from a semantics point of
view  fuzzy concepts are interpreted as fuzzy sets i e  given a concept c and an individual
a  c a  is interpreted as the truth value of the sentence a is c  from a syntax point of
view  we allow to specify lower and upper bounds of the truth value of c a   complete
algorithms for reasoning in it have been presented  that is  we have devised algorithms for
solving the entailment problem  the subsumption problem as well as the best truth value
bound problem

an important point concerns computational complexity  the complexity result shows
that the additional expressive power has no impact from a computational complexity point
of view 
the extension of dls to the management of vagueness is not new  tresp   molitor 
      yen         yen was the first  to the best of my knowledge  introducing vagueness
into a simple dl  his language has two interesting points not included into our language 
firstly  it allows the definition of vague concepts by means of explicit membership functions
over a domain  e g  lowpressure  domain airpressure   membershipf x p low p    here
the domain over p ranges is given by airpressure  p low p  determines the membership
degree of being a pressure p low  secondly  the language allows concept modifiers  like very
or slightly  by means of which concepts like very low pressure can be defined through
verylowpressure  very lowpressure   this last idea has been generalised to alc by tresp
and molitor        where a certain type of concept modifiers are allowed  strictly speaking  the language defined by tresp and molitor is more expressive  as we do not consider
concept modifiers  from a semantics point of view  the extension to tresp and molitors
language is quite straightforward  but  the cost that we have to pay for this increasing
expressive power is that  from a computational complexity and algorithms point of view 
things changes radically  indeed  according to tresp and molitor for each completion a
linear optimisation problem is generated  set of inequations of the form op   t   rop   t    or
op   t   rf  op   t      where ti is a truth value variable  r          opi   id  mi    with
id t  the identity and mi  t  is a modifier function over truth value variables  respectively 
and f   min  max  derived from the semantics of the connectors u  t  and then solved for
the best value  then  the minimum among all computed solutions is taken  the solutions
can be computed by relying on methods from the domain of linear programming  e g  the

simplex method  papadimitriou   steiglitz         while it is possible to devise a similar
approach for our fuzzy dl as well  we have seen that this is not necessary 
both aspects considered by tresp and molitor and by yen  although interesting  are
not crucial w r t  how we model logic based multimedia information retrieval  where underlaying text  image and video analysis tools provide us fuzzy assertions e g  of the form
ha about c  ni from which we may infer ha about d  mi 
this work can be used as a basis both for extending existing dl based systems and for
further research  in this latter case  there are several open points  for instance  it is not clear
yet how to reason both in case of fuzzy specialisation of the general form cd and in the
case cycles are allowed in a fuzzy kb  another interesting topic for further research concerns
the semantics of fuzzy connectives  of course several other choices for the semantics of the
connectives u  t       can be considered  while for a huge number of proposals given in
the literature their impact from a semantics point of view is well understood  the question
how they impact from a computational complexity and algorithms point of view remains
still open
