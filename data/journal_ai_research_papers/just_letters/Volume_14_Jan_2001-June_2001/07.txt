abstract

a general notion of algebraic conditional plausibility measures is defined  probability
measures  ranking functions  possibility measures  and  under the appropriate definitions 
sets of probability measures can all be viewed as defining algebraic conditional plausibility
measures  it is shown that algebraic conditional plausibility measures can be represented
using bayesian networks 

   introduction
pearl        among others has long argued that bayesian networks  that is  the dags without the conditional probability tables  represent important qualitative information about
uncertainty regarding conditional dependencies and independencies  to the extent that this
is true  bayesian networks should make perfect sense for non probabilistic representations
of uncertainty  and  indeed  bayesian networks have been used with  rankings  spohn 
      by darwiche and goldszmidt         it follows from results of wilson        that
possibility measures  dubois   prade        can be represented using bayesian networks 
the question i address in this paper is  what properties of a representation of uncertainty are required to be able to represent the uncertainty using a bayesian network   this
question too has been addressed in earlier work  see  darwiche        darwiche   ginsberg 
      friedman   halpern        wilson         although the characterization given here
is somewhat different  shenoy and shafer        consider a related question essentially 
what is required of a representation of uncertainty so that marginals can be computed using
 local computations  of the type used in bayesian networks and provide axioms sucient
to guarantee that this is possible 
here i represent uncertainty using plausibility measures  as in  friedman   halpern 
       to answer the question  i must examine general properties of conditional plausibility
as well as defining a notion of plausibilistic independence  unlike earlier papers  i enforce a
symmetry condition in the definition of conditional independence  so that  for example  a is
independent of b iff b is independent of a  while this property holds for probability  under
the asymmetric definition of independence used in earlier work it does not necessarily hold
for other formalisms  there are also subtle but important differences between this paper
and  friedman   halpern        in the notion of conditional plausibility  the definitions
here are simpler but more general  particular attention is paid here to conditions on when
the conditional plausibility must be defined 
the major results here are a general condition  simpler than that given in  friedman  
halpern        wilson         under which a conditional plausibility measure satisfies the

semi graphoid properties  which means it can be represented using a bayesian network  
conditions are also given that suce for a bayesian network to be able to quantitatively
represent a plausibility measure  more precisely  conditions are given so that a plausibility
measure can be uniquely reconstructed given conditional plausibility tables for each node in
the bayesian network  conditions for quantitative representation by bayesian networks do
not seem to have been presented in the literature for representations of uncertainty other
than probability  for which the conditions are trivial   a minor additional condition also
suces to guarantee that d separation in the network characterizes conditional independence  all these conditions clearly apply to  rankings and possibility measures  perhaps
more interestingly  they also apply to sets of probabilities under a novel representation of
such sets as a plausibility measure  this novel representation  and the associated notion of
conditioning  is shown to have some natural properties not shared by other representations 
the rest of the paper is organized as follows  in section    i discuss conditional plausibility measures  section   introduces algebraic conditional plausibility measures  which
are ones where there is essentially an analogue to   and    putting such an algebraic
structure on uncertainty is not new  it was also done in  darwiche        darwiche   ginsberg        friedman   halpern        weydert          section   discusses independence
and conditional independence in conditional plausibility spaces  and shows that algebraic
conditional plausibility measures satisfy the semi graphoid properties  finally  in section   
bayesian networks based on  algebraic  plausibility measures are considered  combining
the fact that algebraic plausibility measures satisfy the semi graphoid properties with the
results of  geiger  verma    pearl         it follows that d separation in a bayesian network g implies conditional independence for all algebraic plausibility measures compatible
with g  a weak richness condition is shown to yield the converse  the paper concludes in
section    longer proofs are relegated to the appendix 

   conditional plausibility

    unconditional plausibility measures

before getting to conditional plausibility measures  it is perhaps best to consider unconditional plausibility measures  the basic idea behind plausibility measures is straightforward 
a probability measure maps subsets of a set w to         its domain may not consist of
all subsets of w   however  it is required to be an algebra   recall that an algebra f over
w is a set of subsets of w containing w and closed under union and complementation 
so that if u  v   f   then so are u   v and u    a plausibility measure is more general  it
maps elements in an algebra f to some arbitrary partially ordered set  if pl is a plausibility
measure  then we read pl u   as  the plausibility of set u    if pl u    pl v    then v is at
least as plausible as u   because the ordering is partial  it could be that the plausibility of
two different sets is incomparable  an agent may not be prepared to say of two sets that
one is more likely than another or that they are equal in likelihood 
formally  a plausibility space is a tuple s    w  f   pl   where w is a set of worlds  f
is an algebra over w   and pl maps sets in f to some set d of plausibility values partially
ordered by a relation d  so that d is reexive  transitive  and anti symmetric  that
contains two special elements  d and  d such that  d d d d  d for all d   d  these
are intended to be the analogues of   and   for probability  as usual  the ordering is defined
   

ficonditional plausibility measures and bayesian networks

 d by taking d   d d  if d  d d  and d     d    i omit the subscript d from d    d    d
and  d whenever it is clear from context 
there are three requirements on plausibility measures  the first two are obvious analogues of requirements that hold for other notions of uncertainty  the whole space gets
the maximum plausibility and the empty set gets the minimum plausibility  the third
requirement says that a set must be at least as plausible as any of its subsets 
pl   pl       d  
pl   pl w      d  
pl   if u  u     then pl u    pl u     
 in pl   i am implicitly assuming that u  u     f   similar assumptions are made throughout  
all the standard representations of uncertainty in the literature can be represented as
plausibility measures  i briey describe some other representations of uncertainty that will
be of relevance to this paper 
sets of probabilities  one common way of representing uncertainty is by a set of probability measures  this set is often assumed to be convex  see  for example   campos   moral 
      cousa  moral    walley        gilboa   schmeidler        levi        walley       
for discussion and further references   however  convex sets do not seem appropriate for representing independence assumptions  so i do not make this restriction here  for example 
if a coin with an unknown probability of heads is tossed twice  and the tosses are known to
be independent  it seems that a reasonable representation is given by the set p  consisting
of all measures ff   where ff  hh    ff    ff  ht    ff  th    ff     ff   ff  tt         ff    
unfortunately  p  is not convex  moreover  its convex hull includes many measures for
which the coin tosses are not independent  it is argued in  cousa et al         that a set
of probability measures is behaviorally equivalent to its convex hull  however  even if we
accept this argument  it does not follow that a set and its convex hull are equivalent insofar
as determination of independencies goes 
there are a number of ways of viewing a set p of probability measures as a plausibility
measure  one uses the lower probability p   defined as p  u     inf f u        pg  clearly
p satisfies pl     the corresponding upper probability p    defined as p   u     supf     
pg       p  u    is also clearly a plausibility measure 
both p and p  give a way of comparing the likelihood of two subsets u and v of w  
these two ways are incomparable  it is easy to find a set p of probability measures on w
and subsets u and v of w such that p  u     p  v   and p   u     p   v    rather than
choosing between p and p    we can associate a different plausibility measure with p that
captures both  let dp  p    f a  b       a  b   g and define  a  b    a    b    iff b  a   
this puts a partial order on dp  p    clearly  dp p           and  dp p            define
plp  p   u      p  u    p   u     thus  plp  p  associates with a set u two numbers that can
be thought of as defining an interval in terms of the lower and upper probability of u   it
is easy to check that plp  p   u    plp  p   v   if the upper probability of u is less than or
equal to the lower probability of v   plp  p  satisfies pl     so it is indeed a plausibility
measure  but one which puts only a partial order on events

the trouble with p   p    and even plp  p  is that they lose information  for example 
it is not hard to find a set p of probability measures and subsets u  v of w such that
 u     v   for all    p and  u      v   for some    p   but p  u     p  v   and
p   u     p   v    indeed  there exists an infinite set p of probability measures such that
 u      v   for all    p but p  u     p  v   and p   u     p   v    if all the probability
measures in p agree that u is less likely than v   it seems reasonable to conclude that u is
less likely than v   however  none of p   p    or plp  p  will necessarily draw this conclusion 
fortunately  it is not hard to associate yet another plausibility measure with p that
does not lose this important information  for technical convenience that will become clear
later  assume that there is some index set i such that p   fi   i   i g  thus  for example 
if p   f            n g  then i   f           ng  let di         i   that is  the functions from i to
        with the pointwise ordering  so that f  g iff f  i   g i  for all i   i    it is easy to
check that  d is the function f   i          such that f  i      for all i   i and  d is the
function g such that g i      for all i   i   for u  w   let fu be the function such that
fu  i    i  u   for all i   i   for example  for the set p  of measures representing the two
coin tosses  which is indexed by ir   the set w can be taken to be fhh  ht  tt  thg  then 
for example  ffhhg  ff    ff  hh    ff  and ffht ttg  ff        ff 
it is easy to see that f     d and fw    d   now define plp  u     fu   thus 
plp  u    plp  v   iff fu  i   fv  i  for all i   i iff  u     v   for all    p   clearly plp
satisfies pl     pl  and pl  follow since plp       f     d and plp  w     fw    d  
while pl  follows since if u  v then  u     v   for all    p   plp captures all the
information in p  unlike  say  p   which washes much of it away by taking infs  
this way of associating a plausibility measure with a set p of probability measures
generalizes  it provides a way of associating a single plausibility measure with any set of
plausibility measures  i leave the straightforward details to the reader 
possibility measures  a fuzzy measure  or a sugeno measure   f on w  wang   klir 
      is a function f    w            that satisfies pl      that is  it is less general than a
plausibility measure only in that it requires the range to be        rather than an arbitrary
partially ordered set   a possibility measure poss on w is a special case of a sugeno measure 
it is a function mapping subsets of w to        such that poss w        poss         and
poss u     supw u  poss fwg    so that poss u   v     max poss u    poss v     dubois  
prade         clearly a possibility measure is a plausibility measure 
ranking functions  an ordinal ranking  or  ranking or ranking function    on w  as
defined by  goldszmidt   pearl         based on ideas that go back to  spohn        
is a function mapping subsets of w to in    in   f g such that  w             
   and  u     minw u   fwg    so that  u   v     min  u     v     intuitively  a
ranking function assigns a degree of surprise to each subset of worlds in w   where   means
unsurprising and higher numbers denote greater surprise  it is easy to see that if  is a
ranking function on w   then  w   w     is a plausibility space  where x in  y if and only
if y  x under the usual ordering on the natural numbers  one standard view of a ranking

   in the conference version of this paper  halpern         d   the range of the plausibility measure  was
taken to be functions from to         not from the index set i to         the difference is mainly cosmetic 
but this representation makes the range independent of   so that the same plausibility values can be
used for any set of probability measures indexed by i

function  going back to spohn  is that a ranking of k can be associated with a probability
of k   for some fixed  possibly infinitesimal    note that this viewpoint justifies taking
 w                 and  u   v     min  u     v    

    conditional plausibility measures

since bayesian networks make such heavy use of conditioning  my interest here is not just
plausibility measures  but conditional plausibility measures  cpm s   given a set w of
worlds  a cpm maps pairs of subsets of w to some partially ordered set d  i write pl u jv  
rather than pl u  v    in keeping with standard notation for conditioning  in the case of
a probability measure   it is standard to take  u jv   to be undefined in  v        in
general  we must make precise what the allowable second arguments are  thus  i take
the domain of a cpm to have the form f  f   where  intuitively  f   consists of those sets
in f on which it makes sense to condition  for example  for a conditional probability
measure defined in the usual way from an unconditional probability measure   f   consists
of all sets v such that  v         note that f   is not an algebra it is not closed under
complementation   a popper algebra over w is a set f f   of subsets of w  w satisfying
the following properties 
acc   f is an algebra over w  
acc   f   is a nonempty subset of f  
acc   f   is closed under supersets in f   that is  if v   f     v  v     and v     f   then
v     f   
 popper algebras are named after karl popper  who was the first to consider formally
conditional probability as the basic notion  popper         de finetti        also did some
early work  apparently independently  taking conditional probabilities as primitive  indeed 
as renyi        points out  the idea seems to go back as far as keynes         
a conditional plausibility space  cps   is a tuple  w  f   f     pl   where f f   is a popper
algebra over w   pl   f  f     d  d is a partially ordered set of plausibility values  and pl
is a conditional plausibility measure  cpm  that satisfies the following conditions 
cpl   pl  jv      d  
cpl   pl w jv      d  
cpl   if u  u     then pl u jv    pl u   jv   
cpl  pl u jv     pl u   v jv   
cpl    are the obvious analogues to pl     cpl  is a minimal property that guarantees
that when conditioning on v   everything is relativized to v   it follows easily from cpl   
that pl jv   is a plausibility measure on v for each fixed v   a cps is acceptable if it satisfies
acc   if v   f     u   f   and pl u jv       d   then u   v   f    
   

fihalpern

acceptability is a generalization of the observation that if pr v         then conditioning on
v should be defined  it says that if pl u jv       d   then conditioning on v   u should be
defined 
cpl    are rather minimal requirements  for example  they do not place any constraints
on the relationship between pl u jv   and pl u jv     if v    v     one natural additional
condition is the following 
cpl   if v   v     f   and u  u     f   then pl u jv   v      pl u   jv   v     iff pl u   v jv     
pl u     v jv     
it is not hard to show that cpl  implies cpl  
lemma      cpl  implies cpl  
proof  since clearly pl u   v jv     pl u   v   v jv    by cpl  it follows that pl u jv   v    
pl u   v jv   v    and hence pl u jv     pl u   v jv   
cpl  does not follow from cpl     indeed  as shown below  the standard notion of
conditioning for lower probabilities satisfies cpl    but not cpl    a cps that satisfies
cpl  is said to be coherent  although i do not assume cpl  here  it in fact holds for all
plausibility measures to which one of the main results applies  see lemma      
in any case  cpl  is certainly not the only coherence that might be required  for
example  it may seem reasonable to require that if v and v   are disjoint  then it is not the
case that both pl u jv   v       pl u jv   and pl u jv   v       pl u jv      similarly  we may
want to require that it not be the case that pl u jv   v       pl u jv   and pl u jv   v      
pl u jv       coming up with a reasonable set of coherence conditions remains a topic for
future work  the only properties needed for the results of this paper are cpl    
the notion of cps considered here is closely related to that defined in  friedman  
halpern         there  a cps is taken to be a family fw  dv   plv     v  w  v     g of
plausibility spaces  where each plausibility measure plv satisfies pl    and has domain  w
and an analogue of cpl  holds  plv  v    u    plv  v    u     iff plv    u   v    plv    u     v    to
distinguish the definition of cps given in this paper from that given in  friedman   halpern 
       i call the latter an fh cps  there is no analogue to acc    in  friedman   halpern 
       f is implicitly taken to be  w   while f   is implicitly taken to be  w   f g  this is
an inessential difference between the definitions  more significantly  note that in an fh cps 
 w  dv   plv   is a plausibility space for each fixed v   and thus satisfies pl     however 
requiring cpl    is a priori stronger than requiring pl    for each separate plausibility
space  pl  requires that pl  jv      d   but the elements  d may be different for each
v   by way of contrast  cpl  requires that pl  jv   must be the same element   d   for all
v   similar remarks hold for pl   nevertheless  as is shown below  there is a construction
that converts an fh cps to a coherent cps 
i now consider some standard ways of getting a cps starting with an unconditional
representation of uncertainty 
definition      a cps  w  f   f     pl  extends an unconditional plausibility space  w  f   pl   
if pl u jw     pl   u     w  f   f     pl  is standard if f     fu   pl u       g 
all the constructions below result in standard cps s

   i think an anonymous referee of this paper for suggesting this condition 

   

ficonditional plausibility measures and bayesian networks

ranking functions  given an unconditional ranking function   there is a well known
way of extending it to a conditional ranking function 
 
 u   v      v   if  v        
 u jv     undefined
if  v       

this is consistent with the view that if  v     k  then  v     k   since then  u jv    
 u  v    v    it is easy to check that this definition results in a coherent cps 
possibility measures  there are two standard ways of defining a conditional possibility
measure from an unconditional possibility measure poss  to distinguish them  i write
poss u jv   for the first approach and poss u jjv   for the second approach  according to the
first approach 
 
 
  poss v   u   if poss v   u     poss v   
if poss v   u     poss v       
poss u jv        
  undefined if poss v       
the second approach looks more like conditioning in probability 
 
v   u   poss v   if poss v       
poss u jjv     poss 
undefined
if poss v       
it is easy to show that both definitions result in a coherent cps   many other notions of
conditioning for possibility measures can be defined  see  for example  fonck         i focus
on these two because they are the ones most often considered in the literature  
sets of probabilities  for a set p of probabilities  conditioning can be defined for all
the representations of p as a plausibility measure  but in each case there are subtle choices
involving when conditioning is undefined  for example  one definition of conditional lower
probability is that p  u jv   is inf f u jv      v       g if  v        for all    p   and is
undefined otherwise  i e   if  v       for some    p    it is easy to check that p defined
this way gives a coherent cpm  as does the corresponding definition of p    the problem
with this definition is that it may result in a rather small set f   for which conditioning
is defined  for example  if for each set v    w   there is some measure    p such that
 v        which can certainly happen in some nontrivial examples   then f     fw g  as
a consequence  the cps defined in this way is not acceptable  i e   does not satisfy acc   in
general 
the following definition gives a lower probability which is defined on more arguments 
 
inf f u jv      v       g if  v        for some    p  
p  u jv     undefined
if  v       for all    p  
it is easy to see that this definition agrees with the first one whenever the first is defined and
results  in general  in a larger set f     moreover  the resulting cps is acceptable  however 
the second definition does not satisfy cpl   for example  suppose that w   fa  b  cg and
p   f    g  where  a     b        c         a           b         and   c      
   

fihalpern

taking v   fa  bg  u   fag  and u     fbg  it is easy to see that according to the second
definition  p  u   v jw     p  u     v jw        but p  u jv     p  u   jv   
for plp   there are two analogous definitions  for the first  plp  u jv   is defined only if
 v       for all    p   in which case plp  u jv   is fu jv   where fu jv  i    i u jv    this
definition gives a coherent cps  but again  in general  not one that is acceptable  in this
paper  i focus on the following definition  which does result in an acceptable cps 
first extend di by allowing functions which have value   intuitively   denotes undefined   more precisely  let di  consist of all functions f from i to        fg such that f  i     
for at least one i   i   the idea is to define plp  u jv     fu jv   where fu jv  i    i  u jv  
if i  v       and  otherwise   note that this agrees with the previous definition  which
applies only to the situation where  v       for all    p    there is a problem though 
one to which i have already alluded  cpl  says that f jv must be   for all v   thus  it
must be the case that f jv    f jv  for all v    v   w   but if i   p and v    v   w are
such that i  v        and i v         then f jv   i      and f jv   i      so f jv     f jv    a
similar problem arises with cpl  
to deal with this problem di  must be slightly modified  say that f   di  is equivalent
to  d if f  i  is either   or   for all i   i   similarly  f is equivalent to  d if f  i  is
either   or   for all i   i    since  by definition  f  i      for at least one i   i   an
element cannot be equivalent to both  d and  d    let di be the same as di  except
that all elements equivalent to  d are identified  and viewed as one element  and all
elements equivalent to  d are identified  more precisely  let di   f d    d g   ff   d   
f is not equivalent to  d or  d g  define the ordering  on di by taking f  g if one of
the following three conditions holds 
 f    d  
 g    d  
 neither f nor g is  d or  d and for all i   i   either f  i    g i     or f  i      
g i       and f  i   g i  
now define
   
if  v        for some    p and
 
d
 
 
 v        implies  u jv       for all    p  
 
if     p   v         and     p   v           u jv        
plp  u jv        d
 
if  v       for all    p

to a cps  i demonstrate the idea by showing how to construct a conditional plausibility
measure from an unconditional plausibility measure  given an unconditional plausibility
space  w  f   pl  with range d  an fh cps is constructed in  friedman   halpern        by
defining pl u jv     pl u   v    thus  dv   fd   d   d  pl v  g and  d   pl v    this
is not a cps because cpl  is not satisfied  but it is an fh cps  since pl    is satisfied for
each fixed v   and so is cpl   as observed in  friedman   halpern         this is in fact

   algebraic conditional plausibility measures

to be able to carry out the type of reasoning used in bayesian networks  it does not suce to
just have conditional plausibility  we need to have analogues of addition and multiplication 
more precisely  there needs to be some way of computing the plausibility of the union of
two disjoint sets in terms of the plausibility of the individual sets and a way of computing
pl u   v jv     given pl u jv   v     and pl v jv     

definition      a cps  w  f   f     pl  where pl has range d is algebraic if it is acceptable
and there are functions    d  d   d and 
   d  d   d such that the following

properties hold 
alg   if u  u     f are disjoint and v   f   then pl u   u   jv     pl u jv    pl u   jv   
alg   if u   f   v   v     f     then pl u   v jv       pl u jv   v     
 pl v jv

i sometimes refer to the cpm pl as being algebraic as well 
it may seem more natural to consider a stronger version of alg  that applies to all pairs
in d  d  such as
alg     if a 
 c  b 
 c and c       then a  b 
however  as proposition     below shows  by requiring that alg  and alg  hold only for
tuples in dom   and dom 
  rather than on all tuples in d  d  some cps s of interest
become algebraic that would otherwise not be  intuitively  we care about 
 mainly to the
extent that alg  and alg  holds  and alg  and alg  apply only to tuples in dom   and
dom 
   respectively  thus  it does not seem unreasonable that alg  be required to hold
only for these tuples 

proposition      the constructions for extending an unconditional probability measure 
ranking function  possibility measure  using either poss u jv   or poss u jjv     and the plausibility measure plp defined by a set p of probability measures to a cps result in algebraic
cps s  
proof  it is easy to see that in each case the cps is acceptable  it is also easy to find
appropriate notions of 
 and  in the case of probability measures  ranking functions  and
possibility measures using poss u jjv    for probability  clearly  and 
 are essentially  
and   however  since the range of probability is         a  b must be defined as max    a   b  
and alg  holds only for dom     f a            ak     a         ak   g  there is no constraint on
dom    it is                 for ranking   and 
 are min and    there are no constraints
on dom min  and dom     for poss u jjv     is max and 
 is   again  there are no
constraints on dom max  and dom    i leave it to the reader to check that alg    hold

in all these cases 
for poss u jv     is again max and 
 is min  there are no constraints on dom max  
however  note that  a  b    dom min  iff either a   b or a      for suppose that  a  b   
 poss u jv   v      poss v jv      where u   f and v   v     f     if poss u   v   v      
poss v   v     then a   poss u jv   v          otherwise  poss u   v   v       poss v   v      in
which case a   poss u jv   v       poss u   v   v       poss v   v      poss v jv       b  it
is easy to check alg     while min does not satisfy alg    certainly min a  c    min b  c 
does not in general imply that a   b alg  does hold  for if min a  c   min b  c  and
a      then clearly b      alternatively  if a   c  then min a  c    a and the only way that
a  min b  c   given that b   c or b      is if a  b 
finally  for plp    and 
 are essentially pointwise addition and multiplication  but
there are a few subtleties  as in the case of probability  dom   consists of sequences
which sum to at most   for each index i  care must also be taken in dealing with  d and
 d   more precisely  dom   consists of all tuples  f           fn  such that either

   essentially the same result is proved in  friedman   halpern        for all cases but plp

lemma      a standard algebraic monotonic cps satisfies cpl

 pl v jv      pl u   jv   v     
 pl v jv       pl u     v jv     
for the opposite implication  suppose that pl u   v jv      pl u     v jv      then  by alg  
pl u jv   v     
 pl v jv      pl u   jv   v     
 pl v jv     
   
since v  v     f   and the cps is standard  it must be the case that pl v  v      
     hence  by
 
 
 
cpl    pl v    
     moreover  pl v jv         otherwise pl v   v     pl v jv    
 pl v      
    thus  by applying alg  to      it follows that pl u jv   v     pl u  jv   v    

   independence

how can we capture formally the notion that two events are independent  intuitively  it
means that they have nothing to do with each other they are totally unrelated  the occurrence of one has no inuence on the other  none of the representations of uncertainty
that we have been considering can express the notion of  unrelatedness   whatever it might
   

ficonditional plausibility measures and bayesian networks

mean  directly  the best we can do is to capture the  footprint  of independence on the
notion  for example  in the case of probability  if u and v are unrelated  it seems reasonable to expect that learning u should not affect the probability of v and symmetrically 
learning v should not affect the probability of u    unrelatedness  is  after all  a symmetric
notion   the fact that u and v are probabilistically independent  with respect to probability measure   can thus be expressed as  u jv      u   and  v ju      v    there is a
technical problem with this definition  what happens if  v        in that case  u jv   is
undefined  similarly  if  u       then  v ju   is undefined  it is conventional to say that 
in this case  u and v are still independent  this leads to the following formal definition 

definition      u and v are probabilistically independent  with respect to probability measure   if  v    
    implies  u jv      u   and  u        implies  v ju      v   
this does not look like the standard definition of independence in texts  but an easy
calculation shows that it is equivalent 
proposition      the following are equivalent 
 a   u        implies  v ju      v   
 b   u   v      u   v   
 c   v        implies  u jv      u   
thus  in the case of probability  it would be equivalent to say that u and v are independent with respect to  if  u   v      u   v   or to require only that  u jv      u  
if  v        without requiring that  v ju      v   if  u         however  these equivalences do not necessarily hold for other representations of uncertainty  the definition of
independence i have given here seems to generalize more appropriately  
the definition of probabilistic conditional independence is analogous 
definition      u and v are probabilistically independent given v    with respect to probability measure   if  v   v          implies  u jv   v        u jv     and  u   v          implies
 v ju   v       v jv    
it is immediate that u and v are  probabilistically  independent iff they are independent
conditional on w  
the generalization to conditional plausibility measures  and hence to all other representations of uncertainty that we have been considering  is straightforward 
definition      given a cps  w  f   f     pl   u  v   f are plausibilistically independent
given v     f  with respect to the cpm pl   written ipl  u  v jv      if v   v     f   implies
pl u jv   v       pl u jv     and u   v     f   implies pl v ju   v       pl v jv     
   walley        calls the asymmetric notion irrelevance and defines u being independent of v as u is
irrelevant to v and v is irrelevant to u   although my focus here is independence  irrelevance is an
interesting notion in its own right  see  cozman        cozman   walley        
   another property of probabilistic independence is that if u is independent of v then u is independent
of v   this too does not follow for the other representations of uncertainty  and walley        actually
makes this part of his definition  adding this requirement would not affect any of the results here 
although it would make the proofs somewhat lengthier  so i have not made it part of the definition

we are interested in conditional independence of random variables as well as in conditional independence of events  all the standard definitions extend to plausibility in a
straightforward way  a random variable x on w is a function from w to the reals  let
r x   be the set of possible values for x  that is  the set of values over which x ranges   as
usual  x   x is the event fw   x  w    xg  if x   fx            xk g is a set of random variables
and x    x            xk    let x   x be an abbreviation for the event x    x            xk   xk  
a random variable is measurable with respect to cps  w  f   f     pl  if x   x   f for all
x   r x    for the rest of the paper  i assume that all random variables x are measurable and that r x   is finite for all random variables x   random variables x and y are
independent with respect to plausibility measure pl if the events x   x and y   y are
independent for all x   r x   and y   r y    more generally  given sets x  y  and z of
random variables  x and y are plausibilistically independent given z  with respect to pl  
denoted iplrv  x  yjz   if ipl  x   x  y   xjz   z  for all x  y  and z   note that i am using
ipl for conditional independence of events and iplrv for conditional independence of random
variables   if z      then iplrv  x  yjz  if x and y are unconditionally independent  that
is  if ipl  x   x  y   xjw   for all x  y  if either x     or y      then iplrv  x  yjz  is taken
to be vacuously true 
now consider the following four properties of random variables  called the semi graphoid
properties  pearl         where x  y  and z are pairwise disjoint sets of variables 
cirv   if iplrv  x  yjz  then iplrv  y  xjz  

cirv   if iplrv  x  y   y  jz  then iplrv  x  yjz  

cirv   if iplrv  x  y   y  jz  then iplrv  x  yjy    z  

cirv   if iplrv  x  yjz  and iplrv  x  y  jy   z  then iplrv  x  y   y  jz  
it is well known that cirv    hold for probability measures  the following result
generalizes this  the proof is not dicult  although care must be taken to show that the
result depends only on the properties of algebraic cpms 

theorem      cirv    hold for all algebraic cps s 
proof  see the appendix 
theorem      of course  is very dependent on the definition of conditional independence
given here  other notions of independence have been studied in the literature for specific
representations of uncertainty  perhaps the most common definition tries to generalize the
observation that if u and v are probabilistically independent  then  u   v      u     v   
zadeh        considered this approach in the context of possibility measures  calling it
noninteraction  but it clearly makes sense for any algebraic cpm 

definition      u and v do not interact given v    with respect to the algebraic cpm pl  
denoted ni pl  u  v jv      if v     f   implies that pl u   v jv       pl u jv     
 pl v jv      
   shenoy        defines a notion similar in spirit to noninteraction for random variables 

   

ficonditional plausibility measures and bayesian networks

fonck        shows that noninteraction is strictly weaker than independence for a number of notions of independence for possibility measures  the following result shows that
independence implies noninteraction for all algebraic cpms 

lemma      if  w  f   f     pl  is an algebraic cps  then ipl u  v jv    implies ni pl u  v jv     
proof  suppose that v     f   and ipl u  v jv    holds  if v   v     f   then  from alg   it
follows that

pl u   v jv       pl u jv   v     
 pl v jv       pl u jv     
 pl v jv     
on the other hand  if v   v      f     then by acc   pl v jv          by cpl   pl u   v jv         
and by lemma      pl u jv     
 pl v jv          thus  pl u   v jv       pl u jv     
 pl v jv     
what about the converse to lemma      the results of fonck show that it does not hold
in general indeed  it does not hold for poss u jv    so what is required for noninteraction
to imply independence  the following lemma provides a sucient condition 

lemma      if  w  f   f     pl  is a standard algebraic cps that satisfies alg    then ni pl u  v jv   
implies ipl  u  v jv     
proof  suppose that v   v     f   and ni pl u  v jv     then by alg  
pl u   v jv       pl u jv   v     
 pl v jv     
   
by acc   v     f     so ni pl  u  v jv     implies
pl u   v jv       pl u jv     
 pl v jv     
   
since v   v     f   and  w  f   f     pl  is standard  pl v   v      
     since pl v   v     
pl v jv     
 pl v      it follows from lemma     that pl v jv      
     so  by alg         
 
 
and      it follows that pl u jv   v     pl u jv    an identical argument shows that
pl v ju   v       pl v jv     if u   v     f     thus  ipl u  v jv     
lemmas     and     show why noninteraction and independence coincide for conditional
probability defined from unconditional probability  ranking functions  and possibility measures using poss u jjv    moreover  they suggest why they do not coincide in general  since
neither poss u jv   nor plp satisfy alg     it is perhaps not surprising that in neither case
does noninteraction imply conditional independence   we shall shortly see an example in
the case of plp   fonck        gives examples in the case of poss u jv     indeed  noninteraction may not even imply conditional independence for an arbitrary conditional probability
measure  as the following example shows 
example      suppose that w   fa  bg  f    w   f     f   f g   a        b       but
 bjb       it is easy to see that fbg is not independent of itself  but fbg does not interact
with fbg  since  b     b    b   nevertheless  it is not hard to check that this conditional
probability measure  is algebraic and  in fact  satisfies alg     however  it is not standard 
since fbg   f   although  b

it is easy to see that the assumption of standardness is necessary in lemma      for
suppose that  w  f   f     pl  is an arbitrary nonstandard algebraic cps for which        
since  w  f   f     pl  is nonstandard  there must exist some u   f   such that pl u jw       
but then
    pl  jw     pl  ju   
 pl u jw       
   
thus
pl u jw           
     pl u jw   
 pl u jw   
so ni pl u  u jw    but pl u ju              pl u    so ipl  u  u jw   does not hold 
in general  theorem     does not hold if we use ni pl rather than ipl   that is  alg   
do not suce to ensure that cirv    hold for ni pl   besides noninteraction  a number of
different approaches to defining independence for possibility measures  campos   huete 
    a      b  dubois  fari nas del cerro  herzig    prade        fonck        and for sets
of probability measures  campos   huete        campos   moral        cousa et al  
      have been considered  in general  theorem     does not hold for them either  it is
beyond the scope of this paper to discuss and compare these approaches to that considered
here  but it is instructive to consider independence for sets of probability measures in a
little more detail  especially for the representation plp  
de campos and moral        define what the call type   independence  u and v
are type   independent conditional on v   with respect to p if u and v are independent
conditional on v   with respect to every    p   it is easy to check that type   independence
is equivalent to noninteraction in the context of sets of probability measures  thus  by
lemma      iplp  u  v jv     implies that u and v are type   independent conditional on
v    and similarly for random variables   however  the converse does not necessarily hold 
because the two approaches treat conditioning on events that have probability   according
to some  but not all  of the measures in p differently  to see this  consider an example
discussed by de campos and moral  suppose a coin is known to be either double headed or
double tailed and is tossed twice  this can be represented by p   f      g  where    hh   
  and    ht       th       tt       while    tt      and    ht       th       hh      
let x  and x  be the random variables representing the outcome of the first and second
coin tosses  respectively  clearly there is a functional dependence between x  and x    but
it is easy to check that x  and x  are type   independent with respect to p   moreover 
noninteraction holds  ni pl x    i  x    j   holds for i  j   fh  tg  on the other hand 
iplp  x    x    does not hold  for example  fx  h        while fx  hjx   h        
the difference between noninteraction  i e   type   independence  and the definition of
independence used in this paper in the context of sets of probability measures can be summarized as follows  u and v do not interact with respect to p if u and v are independent
   as peter walley  private communication        points out  this example is somewhat misleading  the
definition of independence with respect to plp produces the same counterintuitive behavior as type  
independence if the probabilities are modified slightly so as to make them positive  i e   when there is
 almost functional dependence  between the two variables  for example  suppose that the coin in the
example is known to either land heads with probability     or      rather than   and    as in the example  
let    and    be the obvious modifications of   and   required to represent this situation  and let
              it is easy to check that x  and x  continue to be type   independent  and noninteraction
continues to hold  but now ipl  x    x    also holds  the real problem is that this representation of
uncertainty does not enable learning

ficonditional plausibility measures and bayesian networks

with respect to all measures    p   on the other hand  u and v are independent with
respect to p if     u and v are independent for all measures    p such that  u       and
 v       and      u       iff  v       for all    p   the definition of independence used
here is thus more restrictive  it does not ignore the measures that give u or v probability  
when determining independence  the difference between the two approaches is illustrated
in the example in the previous paragraph 
as the variant of the example considered in footnote   shows though  neither definition
can completely claim to represent the intuition that if u is independent of v   then learning
u gives no information about v   if the coin in the example is known to land heads with
probability either     or      then seeing the first coin toss land heads certainly seems to
give information about the second coin toss  even though both definitions would declare
the events independent  however  the definition of independence used here does have the
advantage of leading to an algebraic cps  which means  as is shown in the next section  that
using it leads to a representation of sets of probability measures that can be represented as
a bayesian network 

   bayesian networks

throughout this section  i assume that we start with a set w of possible worlds characterized
by a set x   fx            xn g of n binary random variables  that is  a world in w is a tuple
 x            xn   with xi   f    g  and xi  x            xn     xi   that is  the value of xi in world
w    x            xn     wi    the goal of this section is to show that many of the tools of
bayesian network technology can be applied in this setting  the proofs of the main results
all proceed in essentially the same spirit as well known results for probabilistic bayesian
networks  see  geiger   pearl        geiger et al         verma         

    qualitative bayesian networks

as usual  a  qualitative  bayesian network  over x   is a dag whose nodes are labeled by
variables in x   the standard notion of a bayesian network representing a probability
measure  pearl        can be generalized in the obvious way to plausibility 
definition      given a qualitative bayesian network g  let parg x   be the parents of the
random variable x in g  let desg  x   be all the descendants of x   that is  x and all those
nodes y such that x is an ancestor of y   let ndg  x    the nondescendants of x   consist
of x   desg  x    note that all ancestors of x are nondescendants of x   the bayesian
network g is compatible with the cps  w  f   f     pl   or just compatible with pl  if the other
components of the cps are clear from context  if iplrv  x  ndg  x  jpar x     that is  if x is
conditionally independent of its nondescendants given its parents  for all x   x  
there is a standard way of constructing a bayesian network that represents a probability measure  pearl         i briey review the construction here  since it works without
change for an algebraic cpm  given an algebraic cpm pl  let y            yn be a permutation of the random variables in x   construct a qualitative bayesian network gpl hy       y i
n

    the assumption that the random variables are binary is just for ease of exposition  it is easy to generalize
the results to the case where  x   is finite for each x   there is no need to assume that  x   is a
subset of the reals

as follows  for each k  find a minimal subset of fy            yk   g  call it pk   such that
iplrv  fy            yk   g  yk jpk    then add edges from each of the nodes in pk to yk   verma
       shows that this construction gives a bayesian network that is compatible with pl in
the case that pl is a probability measure  his proof depends only on cirv     thus  the
construction works for algebraic cpms 

theorem      gpl hy       y i is compatible with pl 
proof  for ease of notation in the proof  i write g instead of gpl hy       y i   note that
y            yn represents a topological sort of g  edges always go from nodes in fy            yk  g

to yk   it follows that g is acyclic  i e   it is a dag  the construction guarantees that
pk   parg yk   and that iplrv  fy            yk  g  yk jparg yk     it follows from results of  verma 
       and is not hard to verify directly  that iplrv  ndg  yk    yk jparg  yk    can be proved
using only cirv     the result now follows from theorem     

    quantitative bayesian networks

a qualitative bayesian network g gives qualitative information about dependence and independence  but does not actually give the values of the conditional plausibilities  to provide
the more quantitative information  we associate with each node x in g a conditional plausibility table  cpt  that quantifies the effects of the parents of x on x   a cpt for x gives 
for each setting of x  s parents in g  the plausibility that x     and x     given that
setting  for example  if x  s parents in g are y and z   then the cpt for x would have an
entry denoted dx  ijy  j  z  k for all  i  j  k    f    g    as the notation is meant to suggest 
dx  ijy  j  z  k   pl x   ijy   j   z   k  for the plausibility measure pl represented by
g    for each fixed j and k  we assume that x jk  x jk      a quantitative bayesian
network is a pair  g  f   consisting of a qualitative bayesian network g and a function f
that associates with each node x in g a cpt for x  

definition      a quantitative bayesian network  g  f   represents pl if g is compatible

with pl and the cpts agree with pl  in the sense that  for each random variable x   the entry
dx  ijy   j       y  j in the cpt is pl x   ijy    j         yk   jk   if y    j         yk   jk   f    
 it does not matter what dx  ijy   j       y  j is if y    j            yk   jk    f

given a cpm pl  it is easy to construct a quantitative bayesian network  g  f   that
represents pl  simply construct g that is compatible with pl as in theorem     and define
f appropriately  using pl  the more interesting question is whether there is a unique
algebraic cpm determined by a quantitative bayesian network  as stated  this question is
somewhat undetermined  the numbers in a quantitative network do not say what  and

 ought to be for the algebraic cpm 
a reasonable way to make the question more interesting is the following  recall that 
for the purposes of this section  i have taken w to consist of the  n worlds characterized by
the n binary random variables in x   let pld  
 consist of all standard cps s of the form
 w  f   f     pl   where f    w   so that all subsets of w are measurable  the range of pl is
    of course  if the random variables are not binary  i  j  k have to range over all possible values for the
random variables 

   

ficonditional plausibility measures and bayesian networks

d  and pl is algebraic with respect to  and 
  thus  for example  plin   min   consists
of all conditional ranking functions on w defined from unconditional ranking functions by
the construction in section    since a cps  w  f   f     pl    pld  
 is determined by pl  i
often abuse notation and write pl   pld  
 
with this notation  the question becomes whether a quantitative bayesian network
 g  f   such that the entries in the cpts are in d determines a unique element in pld  
  as
i now show  the answer is yes  provided  d    
  satisfies some conditions  characterizing
the conditions on  d

it is somewhat surprising how many assumptions are required to reproduce the simple

r  is the obvious analogue of the requirement in the probabilistic case that the entries
of the cpt for x   for a fixed setting of x  s parents  add up to    r  essentially says that
certain terms  the ones required to compute the plausibility of y   y for y   hy            yn i 
are required to be in d 
   so that it makes sense to take their product  since d 
   
               in the case of probability  there is no need to make this requirement explicit 
however  it is necessary for other representations of uncertainty 
the following result shows that  as the name suggests  there is a unique cpm that
represents a representable quantitative bayesian network 

theorem       if  g  f   is  d    
  representable  then there is a unique cpm pl  
pld  
 such that  g  f   represents pl 
    d separation

just as in the case of probability  conditional independencies can be read off the bayesian
network using the criterion of d separation  pearl         recall that a set x of nodes
in g    v  e    is d separated from a set y of nodes by a set z of nodes in g  written
d sep g  x  yjz   if  for every x   x  y   y  and a trail from x to y  that is  a sequence
 x            xk   of nodes in g such that x    x   xk   y and either  xi   xi     or  xi     xi  
is a directed edge in g  and a node xi on the trail with     i   k such that either 
 a  xi   z and there is an arrow leading into xi and an arrow leading out  i e   either
 xi     xi     xi   xi       e or  xi   xi       xi     xi     e
 b  xi   z and xi is a tail to tail node  i e    xi   xi       xi   xi       e  
 c  xi is a head to head node  i e    xi     xi     xi     xi     e    and neither xi nor any
of its descendants are in z 
let g pl consist of all statements of the form iplrv  x  ndg  x  jparg  x     let pld  

be an arbitrary collection of cps s of the form  w  f   f     pl  where all components other
than pl are fixed  and the plausibility measures pl all have the same range d of plausibility
values  consider the following three statements 
   d sep g  x  yjz  
   iplrv  x  yjz  is provable from cirv    and g pl 
   

ficonditional plausibility measures and bayesian networks

   iplrv  x  yjz  holds for every plausibility measure in pld  
 compatible with g 
the implication from   to   is proved in  geiger et al         verma        

theorem       geiger et al         verma        if d sep g x  yjz   then iplrv  x  yjz  is
provable from cirv    and g pl 

it is immediate from theorem     that the implication from   to   holds for algebraic
cpms 
corollary      if iplrv  x  yjz  is provable from cirv    and g pl  then iplrv  x  yjz 
holds for every algebraic cpm pl compatible with g 
finally  the implication from   to   for probability measures is proved in  geiger   pearl 
      geiger et al          here i generalize the proof to algebraic plausibility measures 
notice that to prove the implication from   to    it suces to show that if x is not dseparated from y by z in g  then there is a plausibility measure pl   pld  
 such that
iplrv  x  y jz  does not hold  to guarantee that such a plausibility measure exists in pld  
 
we have to ensure that there are  enough  plausibility measures in pld  
 in the following
technical sense 

definition      a bn compatible domain  d    
  is rich if there exist d  d    d such
that      d  d      d        d  d      and     if x   x  
       
 xk   where each xi is either
d or d  and k   n  then  d  x    x  d    d    x   and  x  d    are all in d 
   intuitively  d 
 

contains all products involving d and d  of length at most n  

all the domains for the cps s we have considered are easily seen to be rich 

theorem       suppose that plausibility measures in pld  
 take values in a rich bncompatible domain  then if iplrv  x  yjz  holds for every plausibility measure in pld  

compatible with g  then d sep g  x  yjz  
i remark that independence and d separation for various approaches to representing sets
of probability measures using bayesian networks are discussed by cozman      b      a  
however  the technical details are quite different from the approach taken here 

   conclusion

i have considered a general notion of conditional plausibility that generalizes all other standard notions of conditioning in the literature  and examined various requirements that
could be imposed on conditional plausibility  one set of requirements  those that lead to
algebraic cps s  was shown to suce for the construction of bayesian networks  further
assuming that the range d of the plausibility measure is a bn compatible domain suces
for all the more quantitative properties of bayesian networks to hold and for d separation
to characterize the independencies  it should also be clear that standard constructions like
belief propagation in bayesian networks  pearl        can also be applied to algebraic cps s
with ranges that are bn compatible  since they typically use only basic properties of conditioning  addition  and multiplication  all of which hold in bn compatible domains  using
   

fihalpern

 and 
   in particular  these results apply to sets to probability measures  provided that

they are appropriately represented as plausibility measures  the particular representation
of sets of probability measures advocated in this paper was also shown to have a number of
other attractive properties 
the results of this paper show that alg    are sucient conditions for representing
a measure of uncertainty that is acceptable as a bayesian network  they may not be
necessary  it would be interesting to see if other natural conditions also suce  similarly  i
have focused only on acceptable cps s  that is  ones that satisfy acc     acc  and acc  are
nontrivial conditions  it would be of interest to see to what extent they could be weakened
while still being able to prove results in the spirit of this paper  i leave these questions to
future research 

appendix a  proofs

in this section i give the proofs of theorems           and       i repeat the statement of
the results for the convenience of the reader 

lemma a    suppose that  w  f   f     pl  is a cps  a            an is a partition of w   x  a            an  
f   and y   f     then
pl x jy     fi a  y  f   g pl x jai   y   
 pl ai jy     
i

proof  using an easy induction argument  it follows from alg  that
pl x jy     ni   pl x   ai jy   
if ai   y    f     then it follows from acc  that pl ai jy        thus  by cpl   pl x   ai jy    
   using lemma      it follows that
pl x jy     fi a  y  f   g pl x   ai jy   
if ai   y   f     then it follows from alg  that pl x   ai jy     pl x jai   y   
 pl ai jy   
i

thus 

pl x jy     fi a  y  f   g pl x jai   y   
 pl ai jy   
i

as desired 

theorem      cirv    hold for all algebraic cps s 
proof  cirv  is immediate from the fact that independence is symmetric 
for cirv   suppose that iplrv  x  y   y  jz   we must show iplrv  x  yjz   that is  we
must show that ipl  x   x  y   yjz   z   for all x  y  and z  this requires showing two

things 

    then pl x a y   pl a y     pl x a y   by alg   thus  the terms
    notice that if a y
arising on the right hand side of the equation in lemma a   are in dom     this means that there is
no need to put in parentheses  is associative on terms in dom

pl y   y   y    y  jx   x   z   z    pl y   y   y    y  jz   z 

   

for all y    r y     from     it follows that

y  pl y   y   y    y  jx   x   z   z    y  pl y   y   y    y  jz   z  
thus 
pl  y  y   y   y    y  jx   x   z   z    pl  y  y   y   y    y  jz   z  
since  y   y   y   y    y      y   y    a  holds 
for   b   from iplrv  x  y   y  jz   it follows that if y   y   y    y    z   z   f     then
pl x   xjy   y   y    y    z   z    pl x   xjz   z  

   

from     and lemma a    it follows that
pl x   xjy   y   z   z 
  fy   y y y   y   z z f   g pl x   xjy   y   y    y    z   z  
 pl y    y  jy   y   z   z 
  fy   y y y   y   z z f   g pl x   xjz   z  
 pl y    y  jy   y   z   z  
   
 
 
 
 
 
by acc   it follows that if y   y   y   y   z   z    f   then pl y   y jy   y  
z   z       thus  by lemma      alg   cpl   and cpl  

fy  y y y  y  z z f   gpl y    y  jy   y   z   z 
  y  pl y    y  jy   y   z   z 
  pl w jy   y   z   z 
    

   

the next step is to apply distributivity  alg   to the last line of      to do this  we
must show that certain tuples are in dom   and dom 
   respectively  since
 pl x   xjy   y   y    y    z   z   pl y    y  jy   y   z   z    dom 
  
from     it follows that
 pl x   xjz   z   pl y    y  jy   y   z   z     dom

if fyi              yi  g   fy    r y      y   y   y    y    z   z   f   g  then clearly

 pl y    y i  jy   y   z   z           pl y    y i jy   y   z   z    dom   
k

moreover  using     again and alg   it follows that
pl x   xjz   z  
 pl y    y i jy   y   z   z    pl x   x   y    y i jy   y   z   z

thus   pl x   xjz   z 
pl y    y i  jy   y z   z           pl x   xjz   z 
pl y    y i jy   y 
z   z    dom    finally  since     shows that fy  y y y  y  z z f  g     and  by the
proof of lemma       d       dom 
  for all d   range pl   it follows that
k

 pl xjz   z   fy   y y y   y   z z f   g pl y    y  jy   y   z   z     dom 
  
it now follows  using alg        and lemma      that

fy  y y y  y  z z f  gpl x   xjz   z  
 pl y    y  jy   y   z   z 
  pl x   xjz   z  
  fy   y y y   y   z z f   g pl y    y  jy   y   z   z  
  pl x   xjz   z  
  
  pl x   xjz   z  
thus  from      it follows that pl x   xjy   y   z   z    pl x   xjz   z   this com 

pletes the proof of   b  and cirv  
for cirv   suppose that iplrv  x  y   y  jz   we must show that iplrv  x  yjy    z   this
again requires showing two things 
  a   if x   x   y    y    z   z   f     then
pl y   yjx   x   y    y    z   z    pl y   yjy    y    z   z  
  b   if y   y   y    y    z   z   f     then
pl x   xjy   y   y    y    z   z    pl x   xjy    y    z   z  
for   a   suppose that x   x y    y   z   z   f     thus  by acc   x   x z   z   f    
since iplrv  x  y   y  jz   it follows that
pl y   y     y    y  jx   x   z   z    pl y   y     y    y  jz   z 
for all y     r y   applying alg  to each side of      it follows that
pl y   yjy    y    x   x   z   z  
 pl y    y  jx   x   z   z 
  pl y   yjy    y    z   z  
 pl y    y  jz   z  
thus  to prove   a   it follows from alg  that it suces to show that
pl y    y  jx   x   z   z    pl y    y  jz   z

but by     and alg   it follows that
pl y    y  jx   x   z   z 
  y    r y  pl y   y     y    y  jx   x   z   z 
  y    r y  pl y   y     y    y  jz   z 
  pl y    y  jz   z  
as desired  moreover  since x   x   y    y    z   z   f     it follows from acc  that
pl y    y  jz   z       
for   b   suppose that y   y   y    y    z   z   f     since iplrv  x  y   y  jz   it follows
that
pl x   xjy   y   y    y    z   z    pl x   xjz   z  
thus  to prove   b   it suces to show that
pl x   xjy    y    z   z    pl x   xjz   z  
   
recall that we are assuming that iplrv  x  y   y  jz   by cirv   it follows that iplrv  x  y  jz  
thus      is immediate from   b   since y   y   y    y    z   z   f   implies that y    y   
z   z   f    
finally  consider cirv   suppose that iplrv  x  yjz  and iplrv  x  y  jy   z   we must
show that iplrv  x  y   y  jz   as usual  this requires showing two things 
  a   if y   y   y    y    z   z   f     then
pl x   xjy   y   y    y    z   z    pl x   xjz   z  
  b   if x   x   z   z   f     then
pl y   y   y    y  jx   x   z   z    pl y   y   y    y  jz   z  
both   a  and   b  are straightforward  for   a   suppose that y   y y    y   z   z  
f     since iplrv  x  y  jy   z   it follows that
pl x   xjy   y   y    y    z   z    pl x   xjy   y   z   z  
and since iplrv  x  yjz   it follows that
pl x   xjy   y   z   z    pl x   xjz   z  
thus we have   a  
for   b   suppose that x   x   z   z   f     there are now two cases to consider  if
pl y   yjx   x   z   z       then  by acc   x   x   y   y   z   z   f     moreover  by
alg  
pl y   y y    y  jx   x z   z    pl y    y  jx   x y   y z   z 
pl y   yjx   x z   z  
    
since iplrv  x  y  jy   z   it follows that
pl y    y  jx   x   y   y   z   z    pl y    y  jy   y   z   z

and since iplrv  x  yjz   it follows that pl y   yjx   x   z   z    pl y   yjz   z   plugging this into      and applying alg  again gives
pl y   y   y    y  jx   x   z   z 
  pl y    y  jy   y   z   z  
 pl y   yjz   z 
  pl y   y   y    y  jz   z  
as desired 
now if pl y   yjx   x   z   z       then by cpl   it follows that pl y   y  
y    y  jx   x z   z       moreover  since iplrv  x  yjz   it follows that pl y   yjz   z   
   applying cpl   we get that pl y   y   y    y  jz   z       thus  again   b  holds 

theorem      if  g  f   is  d    
  representable then there is a unique cpm pl  
pld  
 such that  g  f   represents pl 
proof  given  g  f    suppose without loss of generality that x   hx            xn i is a topo 

logical sort of the nodes in g  i now define the plausibility measure pl determined by  g  f   
i start by defining pl g f   on sets of the form x   x 
it easily follows from alg  that if pl   pld  
 and pl x    x            xn     xn       
   then
pl x   x    pl xn   xn jx    x            xn     xn    

pl xn     xn   jx    x            xn     xn    

    
   
 pl x    x jx    x    
 pl x    x   
thus  an algebraic plausibility measure satisfies an analogue of the chain rule for probability 
 since 
 in d is assumed to be associative  no parentheses are required here  however  even
without this assumption  it follows easily from alg  that 
 is in fact associative on tuples
 a  b  c  of the form  pl u  ju     pl u  ju     pl u  ju      where u   u   u   u    which are
the only types of tuples that arise in       associativity will be more of an issue below  
if pl is compatible with g  then in fact
pl x   x    pl xn   xn j  x  par  x   xj   xj  

pl xn     xn   j  x  par  x     xj   xj  

    
   
  x    x   
 if parg  xk        then pl xk   xk j x  par  x   xj   xj   is just taken to be pl xk   xk    
it is clear from      that pl g f    x   x  must be dx  g x 
    
 dx   g x 
note that every subset of w can be written as a disjoint union of events of the form
x   x  thus  if u   f   define
pl g f    u     fx x xu gdx  g x 
    
 dx   g x 
for conditional plausibilities  suppose that pl g f    v         so that v   f     let
fx            xk g   fx   x   x  v g  it follows easily from bn   bn   r   and r  that
 pl g f    x   x             pl g f    x   xk      d    thus  by bn   if x   x  v   then
pl g f    x   x   pl g f    v    by bn   for each j   there exists dx x jv such that
 dx x jv   pl g f    v      d 
  and dx x jv 
 pl g f    v     pl g f    x   x

it follows from bn  that dx x jv is the unique element in d with this property  moreover 
by bn    dx x  jv           dx x jv     d    define pl g f    u jv     fx x xu  v g dx xjv
 where pl g f     jv   is taken to be     note for future reference that it follows from bn 
that  pl g f    u jv    pl g f    v      d 
  and
pl g f    u jv   
 pl g f    v     pl g f    u   v   
    
this completes the definition of pl g f     it remains to check that it is an algebraic cpm
that is represented by  g  f    thus  we must check that alg    and cpl    hold  alg 
is immediate from the definitions and bn  and bn   bn  is necessary for the case that
one of the disjoint sets is empty   alg  is immediate from bn  and alg  is immediate
from bn   for alg   note that if pl g f    v        and pl g f    v          then  by      
pl g f    u   v jv     
 pl g f    v       pl g f    u   v   v     and
 pl g f   u jv   v     
 pl g f    v jv      
 pl g f    v    
  pl g f   u jv   v     
  pl g f    v jv     
 pl g f    v     
  pl g f    u jv   v     
 pl g f    v   v    
  pl g f    u   v   v     
 note that the associativity of 
 is being used here   thus  by bn  
pl g f    u   v jv       pl g f   u jv   v     
 pl g f    v jv     
cpl  is immediate by definition  the empty sum is taken to be     for cpl   note that
by       pl g f    w jv   
 pl g f    v     pl g f    v    since   
 pl g f    v     pl g f    v   by
bn   it follows from bn  that pl g f    w jv        cpl  follows readily from the definitions
together with bn   bn   and bn   cpl  also follows by definition 
next we must show that  g  f   represents pl g f     the first step is to show that
pl g f    x   xjparg  x     z    dx  xjpar  x   z   note that by      
pl g f    x   xjparg  x     z  
 pl g f    parg  x     z    pl g f    x   x   parg  x     z  
by definition 
pl g f    x   x   parg  x     z    fx x x  x  x par  x    y g pl g f    x   x    
each term in the  sum  on the right is the  product  of terms  indeed  the sum is over all
possible products that include dx  yjpar  x   z as one of the terms and a term dy  yjpar  y   z 
for each y   parg  x    where y is the component of z corresponding to y   by using bn  
bn   r   and r   it is not hard to show that
pl g f    x   y   parg  x     z 
  f x x   x  x par  x    y  pl g f    x   x   
    
  dx  xjpar  z 
 pl g f    parg  x     z  
it now follows from bn  that pl g f    x   xjparg  x     z    dx  xjpar  x   z  
to show that pl g f    x   xjndg  x      y   parg  x     z    dx  xjpar  x   z   it suces
to show that
pl g f    x   x   ndg  x      y   parg  x     z 
    
  dx  xjpar  x   z 
 pl g f    ndg  x      y   parg  x     z

for then the result follows by bn        can be shown much like       but now the commutativity of 
  bn   is essential  that is  the expressions for pl g f    x   x   ndg  x    
 y   parg  x     z  and dx  xjpar  x   z 
 pl g f    ndg  x      y   parg x     z  involve
the same terms  but not necessarily in the same order  with commutativity  they can be
permuted so that they are in the same order 
similar arguments  which i leave to the reader  show that pl g f    ndg  x      yjx  
x   parg  x     z    pl g f   ndg x      yjparg  x     z   thus   g  f   represents pl g f

theorem       suppose that  d    
  is a rich bn compatible domain  then if iplrv  x  yjz 
holds for every plausibility measure in pld  
 compatible with g  then d sep g  x  yjz  
proof  suppose that x is not d separated from y by z in g  then there is some x   x
and y   y such that x is not d separated from y by z in g  i construct a cpm in
pl   pld  
 such that iplrv  x  y jz  does not hold  using the techniques of  geiger et al  

      
as shown in  geiger et al         lemma     if x is not d separated from y in g  there
exists a subgraph g  of g such that
   g  includes all the nodes in g but only a subset of the edges in g 
   x is not d separated from y by z in g   
   the edges e   in g  consist only of those specified below 
 a  a trail q from x to y  
 b  for every head to head node xi on the trail q  there is a directed path pi in g  to
a node in z  moreover  the paths pi do not share any nodes and the only node
that pi shares with q is xi  
note that every node in g  has either       or   parents in g    let  g    f   be a quantitative
bayesian network such that for each node in x in g  with no parents in g    the cpt f  x  
is such that dx      d and dx      d    if a node x in g  has one parent  say x     then the
cpt f  x   is such that dx  ijx    j is   if i   j and   if i    j   finally  if x has two parents 
say x   and x      the cpt f  x   is such that dx  kjx    i x     k is   if k   i  j   mod   and is  
otherwise  since d  d      and bn  guarantees that           the construction satisfies
r   the richness of d guarantees that r  holds  by theorem      there is a  unique 
plausibility measure in pl   pld  
 that is represented by  g    f    it is easy to check that
pl is compatible with g as well  there are three cases to consider 
 suppose that x has no parents in g   then it is easy to see that iplrv  x  yjz  for all
y and z  and  in particular  if y   ndg x   and z   parg x    
 suppose that x has one parent in g   say x     then it is easy to see that iplrv  x  yjz 
holds for all y and z such that x     z  since x   is a parent of x in g  again
iplrv  x  ndg x  jparg x    must hold 
 finally  if x has two parents in g   say x   and x      then it is easy to see that
iplrv  x  yjz  holds for all y and z such that fx     x    g  z  since x   and x    are
parents of x in g  again iplrv  x  ndg  x  jparg  x    must hold
