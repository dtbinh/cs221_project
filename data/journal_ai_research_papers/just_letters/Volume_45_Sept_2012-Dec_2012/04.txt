abstract
although  chinese and spanish are two of the most spoken languages in the world 
not much research has been done in machine translation for this language pair  this
paper focuses on investigating the state of the art of chinese to spanish statistical machine
translation  smt   which nowadays is one of the most popular approaches to machine
translation  for this purpose  we report details of the available parallel corpus which
are basic traveller expressions corpus  btec   holy bible and united nations  un  
additionally  we conduct experimental work with the largest of these three corpora to
explore alternative smt strategies by means of using a pivot language  three alternatives
are considered for pivoting  cascading  pseudo corpus and triangulation  as pivot language 
we use either english  arabic or french  results show that  for a phrase based smt system 
english is the best pivot language between chinese and spanish  we propose a system
output combination using the pivot strategies which is capable of outperforming the direct
translation strategy  the main objective of this work is motivating and involving the
research community to work in this important pair of languages given their demographic
impact 

   introduction
chinese and spanish are very distant languages in many aspects  however  they come close
together in the ranking of most spoken languages in the world  ethnologue         in the
web     era  in which most of the content is produced by the users  the number of native
speakers is an excellent indicator of the actual relevance of machine translation between two
languages  of course  other factors such as literacy  amount of text published and strength
of commercial relationships are also to be taken into account  but these factors will actually
support further our idea of the strategic importance of developing machine translation
technologies between chinese and spanish  the huge increase in volume of online contents
in chinese during the last years  as well as the steady increase of commercial relationships
between spanish speaking latin american countries and china are just two basic examples
supporting this fact  needless to say  these languages involve many economical interests

 zapatero         nevertheless  these two languages seem to become far apart again when
looking for bilingual resources 
we have been recently interested in gathering and collecting chinesespanish bilingual
resources for research and machine translation application purposes  the amount of bilingual resources that are currently available for this specific language pair is surprisingly low 
similarly  the related amount of work we have found  within the computational linguistic
community  can be reduced to a very small set of references  banchs  crego  lambert   
marino        banchs   li        bertoldi  cattoni  federico    barbaiani        wang 
wu  hu  liu  li  ren    niu         apart from the btec  corpus available through international workshop on spoken language translation  iwslt  competition  bertoldi et al  
      and holy bible datasets  banchs   li         we were not aware of any other chinese
spanish parallel corpus suitable for training phrase based  koehn  och    marcu        
statistical machine translation systems between these two languages  until a six language
parallel corpus  including both chinese and spanish  from united nations was released for
research purposes  rafalovitch   dale        
using the recently released united nations parallel corpus as a starting point  this work
focuses on the problem of developing chinese to spanish phrase based machine translation
technologies with a limited set of bilingual resources  we explore and evaluate different
alternatives for the problem in hand by means of pivot language strategies through other
languages available in the united nations parallel corpus  such as arabic  english and
french     existing strategies such as system cascading  pseudo corpus generation and triangulation are implemented and compared against a baseline system built with a direct
translation approach  as follows  we briefly describe these pivot approaches 
 the cascaded approach generates chinese to spanish translations by concatenating a
system that translates chinese into a pivot language with a system that translates
from the pivot language into spanish 
 the pseudo corpus approach builds a synthetic chinesespanish corpus either by
translating into spanish the pivot side of a chinesepivot corpus or by translating
into chinese the pivot side of a pivotspanish corpus 
 the triangulation approach implements a chinese to spanish translation system by
combining the translation table probabilities of a chinesepivot system and a pivot
spanish system 
additionally  we implement and evaluate a system combination of the three pivot strategies based on the minimum bayes risk  mbr   kumar   byrne        technique  such a
combination strategy is capable of outperforming the direct system 
besides experimenting with different pivot languages to compare the mentioned approaches  we also wanted to determine which pivot alone gives the best results and why 
   basic traveller expressions corpus 
   note that phrase based is commonly used to refer to statistical machine translation systems  in which
the term phrase refers to segments of one or more than one word and it does not have the usual meaning
of multi word syntactical consitutent  as it has in linguistics 
   although russian is available in the un corpus  we discard to use it because we do not have the proper
preprocessing tools for it

hence  we present a short comparison of the amount of reordering and vocabulary sizes of
pivot languages  following the study presented by birch et al         where they identified
these two properties as key elements for predicting machine translation quality  the results
from such comparisons  together with the translation quality obtained in the different approaches  show that english was the best pivot language for chinese to spanish translation
purposes in our experimental framework 
the paper is structured as follows  section   motivates this work which is intended to
bring some light into the investigation of chinese to spanish translation task  section  
presents some related work in the chinese to spanish translation task  section   reports
the details of the main parallel corpora available for this translation task  next  section
  describes the main strategies for performing chinese to spanish translation which are
tested in this work  direct  cascade  pseudo corpus and triangulation  section   presents
the evaluation framework which includes the corpus statistics  the system and evaluation
details  then  section   reports the experiments  including the system combination  and
the results  finally  section   concludes our work and proposes new research directions in
the area 

   motivation
although some current web translation systems allow for performing translations between
chinese and spanish  the quality of current chinese to spanish translations is still well
below the quality achieved for other language pairs  such as english to spanish  as far as
we know  there is not much research in this translation task  the main reason may be the
lack of parallel corpora  this study intends to make progress and involve other researchers
in the area of chinesespanish statistical machine translation by 
   listing the available parallel corpora for chinesespanish 
   comparing different methodologies for performing statistical machine translation  cascaded  wang et al          pseudo corpus generation  banchs et al         de gispert

   related work
one of the first works dealing with chinesespanish statistical machine translation was
presented by banchs et al          authors experimented with two independent corpora
chineseenglish and englishspanish to translate from chinese to spanish  they built
their translation systems using the so called ngram based approach  which differs from
the phrase based system mainly in the translation and reordering model  marino  banchs

the only research event recently performed for this language pair was the      iwslt
evaluation campaign  paul         this evaluation organized two chinese to spanish tracks 
one of them focused on direct translation and the other one on pivot translation through
english  the best translation results accordingly to the manual evaluation were obtained
by far in the pivot task 
the best systems in both tracks were developed by wang et al          regarding the
direct system  they used a standard phrase based smt system  what makes it different from
the other participating systems is that they provide their own chinese segmentation and
the ldc  linguistic data consortium  bilingual dictionary  regarding the pivot task  they
compared two different approaches  the first one  referred to as triangulation  consisted of
training two translation models on the chineseenglish corpus and englishspanish corpus 
and then building a new translation model for chinesespanish translation by combining
the two previous models as proposed by wu   wang         the second one obtained better
results and it was based on a cascaded approach  the idea here is to translate from chinese
into english and then from english into spanish  which means performing two translations 
other participants also proposed the cascaded methodology  this approximation can be
done with the n best translations  khalilov  costa jussa  henrquez  fonollosa  hernandez 
marino  banchs  chen  zhang  aw    li        
another proposal was to generate pseudo corpus which means to translate either the
english into chinese or into spanish  creating a parallel chinesespanish corpus  this
pseudo corpus is used to train the chinesespanish translation  bertoldi et al         
as mentioned aboved  the comparison performed by wang et al         showed that the
cascaded approach performed better than the phrase table combination for the chinese
spanish pivot task 
finally  our previous work  costa jussa  henrquez    banchs      b  compared two
standard pivot approaches  pseudo corpus and cascaded  using english and the direct system  experiments in this work showed that the quality between the direct system and the
pivot systems did not differ much  additionally  the cascaded system presented slightly
better results than the pseudo corpus system  in our other previous work  costa jussa 
henrquez    banchs      a   we compared again two pivot approaches  pseudo corpus and
cascaded  using arabic  french and english as pivot languages and the direct system  we
concluded that english was the best pivot language 
in the present work  we are extending the two previous studies by      using more pivot
strategies  including the triangulation strategy       introducing a measure to pre evaluate
the quality of pivot approaches      extending the pivot combination experiments  and    
providing further evaluation 
note that we are working with the united nations  un  corpus rather than with the
btec corpus  the one used in the iwslt   the former is freely available and larger than
the latter 

   chinesespanish parallel corpora
there are very limited resources for the language pair chinesespanish in comparison to
the number of native speakers in these languages  in practice  it is also common to translate
chinese into spanish through english even when manual translations are conducted 
   

fievaluating indirect strategies for chinesespanish smt

as parallel corpus at the sentence level  there is the basic travel expressions corpus
 btec   paul  yamamoto  sumita    nakamura         which is a collection of sentences
that bilingual travel experts consider useful for people going to or coming from another
country  this corpus contains around         parallel sentences but only around       
sentences and         words are actively used for mt purposes in the iwslt evaluation
campaign  the full corpus is not freely available  and the        version was only available
for participation purposes in the      iwslt evaluation campaign 
another parallel corpus is the holy bible  which has been proved to be a good resource for
clir  cross language information retrieval   chew  verzi  bauer    mcclain         this
corpus contains around        parallel sentences and around         tokens per language 
the main advantages of using this corpus is that it is the worlds most translated book  it
covers a variety of literary styles including narrative  poetry  and correspondence  great care
is taken over the translations  and  perhaps surprisingly  its vocabulary appears to have a
high rate of coverage  as much as      of modern day language 
finally  there is the united nations multilanguage corpus  rafalovitch   dale        
which is freely available online for research purposes  among others  it contains parallel
texts at the sentence level in the following languages  chinese  english  spanish  french and
arabic  it consists of      united nations general assembly resolutions with translation in
the six official languages of the united nations  with average of around   million tokens per
language  this is the material that we are using in this work  table   shows the statistics

   direct and pivot statistical machine translation approaches
there are several strategies that we can follow when translating a pair of languages in
statistical machine translation  smt   in this section we present the details of the ones we
are using in this work 
in general  a statistical machine translation system relies on the translation of a source
language sentence s into a target language sentence t  among all possible target language
sentences t we choose the one with the highest probability  as show in equation     

t   arg max  p  t s  

   

t

  arg max  p  t  p  s t  
t

   

this probability decomposition based on bayes theorem is known as the source channel
approach to statistical machine translation  brown  cocke  della pietra  della pietra  jelinek  lafferty  mercer    roossin         it allows to model independently the target
language model p  t  and the source translation model p  s t   on the one hand  the translation model weights how likely words in the foreign language are translation of words in the
source language  the language model  on the other hand  measures the fluency of hypothesis
t  the search process is represented as the arg max operation 
later on  a variation was proposed by och   ney        named log linear model  it
allows using more than two models or features and to weight them independently as can be
seen in equation     
t   arg max
t

  m
x

 

m hm  s  t 

   

m  

this equation should be interpreted as a maximum entropy framework  we see that eq 
    is a special case of eq       in fact  it is the logarithm of     which would be similar
to      then  we have to identify h   s  t  with log p t   and h   s  t  with log p s t    and
taking m      two models  and            in the general case  s are obtained by
maximizing an objective function on a held out set  development set  
among the additional features that can be used with the log linear model we have lexical
models  word bonus  and the reordering model  the lexical models are particularly useful in
cases where the translation model may be sparse  for example  for phrases which may have
appeared few times the translation model probability may not be well estimated  then  the
lexical models provide a probability among words  koehn et al          the word bonus
is used to compensate the language model which benefits shorter outputs  the reordering
model is used to provide reordering between phrases  if not  reordering would only be
treated internally in each phrase  finally  it should be mentioned that the name log linear
is clearly a misnomer as many of these features are not logarithms at all 
as regards the reordering model  the standard way of implementing it is with a distancebased model that gives a linear cost depending on the reordering distance  for instance 
if consecutive target words t    t  come from translating source words s  and s    where the
sub scripts indicate the word position in their corresponding sentences  then a movement
   

fievaluating indirect strategies for chinesespanish smt

figure    word alignment between two sentences
of d            words has taken place and its cost should be double than a movement of
d     words  a visual representation of these phrases can be seen in figure  
besides the traditional distance based reordering mentioned before  state of the art systems implement an additional lexicalized reordering model  tillman         the lexicalized
reordering model classifies phrases by the movement they make relative to the previous used
phrase  i e   for each phrase the model learns how likely it is followed by the previous phrase
 monotone   swapped with it  swap  or not connected at all  discontinuous   for instance 
considering again sub scripts as word positions in their corresponding sentences  in figure
  the bilingual phrases  s   t    and  s   t    are not connected   s   t    is followed by
 s   t    and  s   t    is swapped with  s  s   t    
    direct system
our direct system uses the phrase based translation approach  koehn et al          the
basic idea is to segment the given source sentence s into segments of one or more words 
then each source segment is translated using a bilingual phrase obtained from the training
corpus and finally compose the target sentence from these phrase translations  a bilingual
phrase is a pair of m source words and n target words extracted from a parallel sentence
that belongs to a bilingual corpus previously aligned by words  for extraction  we consider
the words that are consecutive in both source and target sides and which are consistent
with the word alignment  we consider a phrase is consistent with the word alignment if no
word inside the phrase is aligned with one word outside the phrase 
regarding the segmentation of the sentence in k phrases  we assume that all possible
segmentations  which are considered as a hidden variable m   have the same probability
 t  

p  s t   

x

p  s  m  t 

   

p  m  t p  s t 

   

m

 

x
m

   t 

x

p  s t 

   

m

then  we consider only monotone translations so the phrase sk is produced by tk  zens 
och    ney        

p  s t   

k
y
k  

   

p sk   tk  

   

ficosta jussa  henrquez   banchs

finally  phrase translation probabilities are estimated as relative frequencies over all
bilingual phrases in the corpus 

p  s t   

n  s  t 
n  t 

   

where n  s  t  counts the number of times the phrase s is translated as t and n  t  the
number of times the phrase in the target language appears in the training corpus 
    pivot based systems
the cascaded approach handles the sourcepivot and the pivottarget system independently  they are both built and tuned to improve their local translation quality and then
composed to translate from the source language to the target language in two steps  first 
the translation output from source to pivot is computed and then it is used to obtain the
target translation output 
the pseudo corpus approach translates the pivot section of the sourcepivot parallel corpus to the target language using a pivottarget system built previously  then  a
sourcetarget smt system is built using the source side and the translated pivot side of the
sourcepivot corpus  the pseudo corpus system is tuned using an original sourcetarget
development corpus  since we have it available 
the triangulation approach combines the sourcepivot  p  s p  and p  p s   and pivot
target  p  p t  and p  t p   relative frequencies following the strategy proposed by cohn  
lapata        in order to build a sourcetarget translation model  the translation probabilities are computed assuming the independence between the source and target phrases
when given the pivot phrase 

p  s t   

x

p  s p p  p t 

   

p  t p p  p s 

    

p

p  t s   

x
p

where s  t  and p represent phrases in the source  target and pivot language respectively 
the lexical weights are computed in a similar manner  following the strategy proposed
by cohn   lapata         this approach does not handle the lexicalized reordering and
the other pivot strategies and therefore represents a limitation in its potential  instead  a
simple distance based reordering is applied during decoding  this model gives a cost linear
to the reordering distance  for instance  skipping over two words costs twice as much as
skipping over one word 
once the corresponding translation model have been obtained  the sourcetarget system
is tuned using the same original sourcetarget development corpus mentioned in the previous
approach

   evaluation framework
the following section introduces the details of the evaluation framework  we report the
statistics of the un corpus  a description of how we built the systems and the evaluation
details 
    corpus statistics
as far as we know  and as discussed in section    three parallel corpora are available for
the chinesespanish language pair  btec  holy bible and un   the former was used in
the      iwslt and complete experiments of pivot strategies are reported in works such
as bertoldi et al          the holy bible was used for the similar purposes by henrquez 
banchs   marino        
in this study we decide to use the un corpus taking advantage of the fact that it is
the largest corpus  among those three  and it contains the same sentences in six languages 
therefore we can experiment with different pivot languages 
when experimenting with different pivot languages  in order to make the systems as
comparable as possible  we first did a sentence selection over the corpus so all systems were
built exactly with the same training  tuning and testing sets  this selection process was as
follows 
   all corpora were tokenized  using the standard tokenizer available in moses  koehn 
hoang  birch  callison burch  federico  bertoldi  cowan  shen  moran  zens  dyer 
bojar  constantin    herbst        for spanish  english and french  ictclass  zhang 
yu  xiong    liu        for chinese  and mada tokan  habash   rambow       
for arabic 
   the spanish  english and french corpora were lowercased 
   if a sentence had more than     words in any language  it was deleted from all corpora 
   if a sentence pair had a word ratio larger than three for any chinesepivot or pivot
spanish parallel corpora  it was deleted from all corpora 
   to extract the tuning and test sets we identified all sentences ocurring once in the
corpora for all languages  the tuning and testing sets were drawn over these sentences
to assure they do not appear in the training corpus  additionally  from these sentences 
we want to select those which differ most from the sentences in the training set and
which have the lowest out of vocabulary rate  in order to do this  the perplexity over
the english language model was computed on a sentence by sentence basis by using
a leave one out strategy  then  we selected the two thousand sentences which had the
highest perplexity and the lowest ratio of out of vocabulary words for constructing
the tuning and testing sets  the highest perplexity criterion was used in order to
avoid that tuning and test sentences were similar from the ones in the training set 
the lowest out of vocabulary words criterion was used to minimize the number of outof vocabulary words in the tuning and test translation  the two criteria were used
   during the review process of this paper  we have been aware of a new corpus kde  k desktop environment   which is available from the recent opus project  

   

ficosta jussa  henrquez   banchs

sequentially  first we selected the sentences with the highest perplexity  and among
them  we selected those with the lowest ratio of out of vocabulary words

    system implementation and evaluation details
our systems were build using revision      of moses  koehn et al          for all systems 
we used the default moses parameters which includes the grow diagonal final and word
alignment symmetrization  the lexicalized reordering  where possible   relative frequencies 
lexical weights and phrase bonus for the translation model  with phrases up to length      a
  gram language model using kneser ney smoothing and a word penalty model  therefore 
   different features are combined in equation      the language model was built using
srilm  stolcke        version         the optimization was done using mert  och        
for word aligning we used giza    och   ney        version       
in order to evaluate the translation quality  we used bleu  papineni  roukos  ward 
  zhu         ter  snover  dorr  schwartz  micciulla    makhoul        and meteor
 banerjee   lavie        automatic evaluation metrics 
additionally  significance tests were performed to study when a system was better than
the other  these tests followed the pair bootstrap resampling method presented by koehn
        given two translation outputs coming from two different systems  we created two
new virtual test sets by drawing sentences with replacement from the translation outputs 
once we obtained them  we computed their bleus and observed which system performs
better  this procedure was repeated        times  at the end  if one of the systems outperformed the other     of the time  we concluded that it was indeed a better bleu score
with     statistical significance

   chinesespanish machine translation strategies
given the different languages available in the un corpora  we tested three different language
pivots  additionally  we compared the cascaded  pseudo corpus and triangulation pivot
strategies  finally  we tried to combine the system outputs to improve the translation 
    experimenting with different pivot languages
we built and compared several translation approaches in order to study the impact of
the different pivot languages when translating from chinese into spanish  moreover  we
evaluated how the quality of pivot approaches differs from a direct system  we built the
pivot systems using five of the languages available in the un parallel corpus  english 
spanish  chinese  arabic and french  and we built the direct system on a chinesespanish
parallel corpus 
in particular  we experimented with the following chinese to spanish systems  the direct
chinese to spanish system as a quality upper bound  three cascaded  three pseudo corpus
and three triangulation approaches  using english  arabic and french as pivots  in order
to build the pivot systems  we need the corresponding chinesepivot and pivotspanish
systems 
table   shows the bleu  ter and meteor scores achieved with the intermediate
systems trained with the un corpus that were later used to built the different pivot approaches  meteor score for the chinese to arabic system is not shown as we did not have
the postprocessing tools required for the language

table    pivot systems 
table   shows the results for our chinese to spanish configurations with the un corpus 
we can see there that the best pivot system used the pseudo corpus approach with english
as the pivot language 
in chinese to spanish  the fact that the pseudo corpus through english outperforms
cascaded through english according to the bleu score is not statistically significant  with
a     confidence  koehn         these results  however  are coherent with previous works
using the same language pair  bertoldi et al         henrquez q  et al         that also
reported the pseudo corpus strategy was better than the cascaded strategy  the cascaded
and pseudo corpus approaches through english are statistically significantly better than the
triangulation approach  with a     confidence  to the best of our knowledge  reasons why
one pivot approach is better than the other are not reported in the literature  moreover 
given that difference among approaches such as pseudo corpus as cascaded approaches is

table    chinese to spanish cascaded  pseudo corpus and triangulation approaches 
not significant  it is better to perform experiments for each particular task and language
pair 
in all three approaches  according to the scores in table   english is the best pivot
language  with a statistical signicance of      which is coherent with the pivotspanish
results in table   
as follows  we use a procedure to predict the most suitable pivot language and justify
why a language may be a better pivot than another  for example  the pivot vocabulary
sizes play an important role  birch et al         concluded in their study that the target
vocabulary size has a negative impact in the translation quality as measured with the bleu
score and it can be seen that arabic and french have both a larger vocabulary size than
english 
apart from the vocabulary size  the research mentioned above also measured the success
of machine translation in terms of word reordering  i e   differences in word order that occur
in a parallel corpus  which are mainly driven by syntactic differences between the languages 
in order to measure reordering in translation they assumed that reordering only occurs
between two adjacent blocks in the source side  this simplification allowed them to detect
a extract all reordering in a deterministic way 
a block as is defined by birch et  al         as a segment of consecutive source words
 source span  which is aligned to a set of target words  the target words also form a block
at   with the definition of block set  they formally defined a reordering r as two blocks
a and b that are adjacent in the source  the relative order of the blocks in the source is
reversed in the target and the reordering is consistent  a reordering between blocks as
and bs is consistent if the block cs   consisting of the union of blocks as and bs   is also
consistent  a block as is said to be consistent if the span defined by its corresponding
target block at does not contain words that are aligned to source words outside of as   this
definition of a consistent block is equivalent to the definition of a phrase in the phrase based
machine translation paradigm  finally  the set of all reorderings r in a sentence is defined
as r and it is unique for a given pair of sentences  summarizing  this concept of reordering
is equivalent to the swap movement described in the lexicalized reordering at the end of
section

with those concepts defined  they developed a metric called rquantity  defined as a

where r is the set of reorderings for a sentence  i is the source sentence length  a and b
are the two blocks involved in the reordering   ras   is the size or span of block a on the
source side and  rbs   is the size or span of block b on the source side  birch et al         
the objective of the rquantity is to measure the amount of reordering we need when
translating from a source language to a target language  the minimum rquantity for a
given sentence is   if the translation does not involve any word movement and its maximum
p
is   ii   i  i when the words in the translation are inverted compared with their order in
the source sentence 
we have computed the rquantity for the different language pairs involved in our pivot
approaches  it can be seen in table   that english appears as the best pivot because it
has the lowest average rquantity between the three  i e  it is the pivot that needs the
least amount of reordering in average to achieve the final translation  french and arabic
required less movements to translate into spanish than english  but a lot of reordering is
needed to obtain the first step from chinese  hence penalizing the average  this result is
coherent with the conclusion obtained by birch et al          which says that the amount
of reordering has also a negative impact in bleu score 
these results support the intuitive idea that english works as a good intermediate
step between chinese and spanish  both french and arabic have a vocabulary which is
closer in size to spanish and their reorderings are also more complex than english during
the first step  making the source to pivot translation harder with these candidates  the
gradual increase in difficulty  measured as target vocabulary size and reordering  presented
in english seems to benefit the global result 
nevertheless  it is also possible that most un texts were authored in english  and then 
translated into the other languages  this would also favour english as the best pivot
language 
in order to observe the benefits of the pivot language against the direct translation 
table   presents three examples where the bleu scores of the pivot approach were better
than those of the direct approach  notice how some phrases that disappeared from the
direct translation correctly appear on the pseudo corpus approach

when translating a sentence s  we obtain a translation t  which can then be evaluated
against reference t to measure the systems performance  mbr focuses on finding the best
performance over all possible translations  to do so  it uses a loss function lf t  t    that

mbr has been used in literature both during decoding  ehling  zens    ney        and as
a postprocess over a n best list  for instance  this last approach was used by khalilov et al 
       together with their cascaded approach in order to obtain the best chinesespanish
translation  the current version of the moses toolkit includes both implementations 
the mbr algorithm implemented in moses as postprocess uses  bleu t  t    as the loss
function  in our experiment  we consider all our hypothesis as equally likely and therefore
p t   s  was a positive constant and therefore could be discarded  at the end  mbr chooses
the hypotheses t that fullfills

tables   and   show the results of the different chinesespanish output systems  from
table    combined with the mbr technique  from these tables  it can be observed that
combinations from all pivot strategies obtained better results in all metrics than the direct
approach  only in the case of ar   fr  the combination was not statistically significantly
better than the direct system in terms of bleu score  with a     confidence  
the mbr cascaded and triangulation approach   st row   nd and  th column  respectively  in table    did not outperform the direct system 
finally  both a all and d a all  which combine all languages and pivot system outputs
from table   including or not the direct approach  are the best chinese to spanish systems 
we have not experimented on the reverse translation direction  from spanish into chinese  as we would be unable to assess subjective evaluations on the resulting translation
outputs  however  in the reversed direction  our intuition is that the reordering difficulties
will be then moved to the pivottarget step of the cascade system

regarding the fact of english being the best pivot language for the task under consideration  we can argue that english might constitute a better intermediate step between
spanish and chinese  rather than french or arabic  based on the assumption of spanish
being closer to french  both are romance languages derived from latin  and arabic  the
iberian peninsula was occupied by arabic culture for more than     years  so spanish has
strong influence from arabic  than chinese to french and arabic  in this sense  english
seems to represent an optimal intermediate point between chinese and spanish  in which the
translation complexity is divided in two phases  most of the reordering burden is resolved
in the chinese to english phase and most of the morphology generation burden is resolved
in the english to spanish phase  thinking on translation space as a non conservative field 
we can say that english is just in the middle of the way between chinese and spanish  while
passing through french or arabic implies a larger path by some kind of detour in the proximities of spanish  this is just a conjecture  of course  but it nicely explains what we are
observing  definitively  more research is needed to better understand what is happening 

   conclusions
this work provided a brief survey in the state of the art of chinesespanish smt  first
of all  this language pair is of great interest both economically and culturally if we take
into account the high number of chinese and spanish speakers  besides  statistical machine
translation is the most popular approach in the field of mt given that has shown great
quality in all the international evaluation campaigns such as nist        and wmt        
the main points covered in our study were 
 there are mainly three chinesespanish parallel corpora  btec  holy bible and un 
that are freely available for research purposes 
   

fievaluating indirect strategies for chinesespanish smt

 english is the best pivot language for conducting chinese to spanish translations
compared to languages such as french or arabic  the system built using english as
pivot was significantly better than the ones built with french or arabic  with a    
confidence in both comparisons 
 the preference for a pivot language appears to be correlated with other proposed
translation quality prediction metrics such as the differences in vocabulary sizes and
the amount of reordering  according to the above conclusion  the best pivot language
is english because it has the lowest increase in vocabulary size and the lowest increase
in reordering complexity 
 no significant difference is found among the best cascaded and pseudo corpus pivot
approaches  but the pseudo corpus strategy is the best pivot strategy for chineseto spanish  additionally  pseudo corpus and cascaded approaches are significantly
better than the triangulation approach 
 the output combination using mbr is able to improve the direct system in   bleu
point in the best case  this improvement is significantly better with a     confidence
and is coherent with improvements in all other evaluation metrics studied 
as future research we plan to work on the problem of automatically extracting parallel
corpus from comparable corpora collected from the web  additionally  we intend to develop
a freely available chinesespanish translation system which would allow for collecting user
feedback  then  we will work on special techniques to incorporate this knowledge in the
smt system
