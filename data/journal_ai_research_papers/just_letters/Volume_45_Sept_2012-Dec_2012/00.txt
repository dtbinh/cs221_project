abstract
we investigate a class of first order temporal epistemic logics for reasoning about multiagent systems  we encode typical properties of systems including perfect recall  synchronicity  no learning  and having a unique initial state in terms of variants of quantified interpreted systems  a first order extension of interpreted systems  we identify several monodic
fragments of first order temporal epistemic logic and show their completeness with respect
to their corresponding classes of quantified interpreted systems 

   introduction
while reactive systems  pnueli        are traditionally specified using plain temporal logic 
there is a well established tradition in artificial intelligence  ai  and  in particular  multiagent systems  mas  research to adopt more expressive languages  much of this tradition
is inspired by the earlier  seminal work in ai by mccarthy              and others aimed at
adopting an intentional stance  dennett        when reasoning about intelligent systems 
specifically  logics for knowledge  fagin  halpern  moses    vardi         beliefs  desires 
intentions  obligations  etc   have been put forward to represent the informational and
motivational attitudes of agents in the system  theoretical explorations have focused on
the soundness and completeness of a number of axiomatisations as well as the decidability
and computational complexity of the corresponding logics 
the great majority of work in these lines focuses on propositional languages  yet  specifications supporting quantification are increasingly required in applications  for example 
it is often necessary to refer to different individuals at different instances of time 
quantified modal languages  garson        have long attracted considerable attention 
early work included analysing the philosophical and logical implications of different setups for the quantification domains  particularly in combination with temporal concepts 
more recently  considerable attention has been given to identifying suitable fragments that
preserve completeness and decidability  and then studying the resulting computational complexity of the satisfiability problem  this article follows this direction 
in more detail  we investigate the meta theoretical properties of monodic fragments
of quantified temporal epistemic logic where interactions between quantifiers  time  and
knowledge of the agents are present  there is a deep rooted interest  fagin et al        
meyden        in understanding the implications of interaction axioms in this context  as
they often express interesting properties of mas  including perfect recall  synchronicity

and no learning  these features are well understood at the propositional level  fagin 
halpern    vardi        halpern  van der meyden    vardi        and are commonly used
in several application areas  the technical question this paper aims to resolve is whether a
similar range of results can be provided in the presence of  limited forms of  quantification 
as we shall demonstrate  the answer to this question is largely positive 
    state of the art
the analysis and application of temporal epistemic logic in a first order setting has an
established tradition in ai  one of the early contributions is the work of moore        
which presents a theory of action that takes into consideration the epistemic preconditions
to actions and their effects on knowledge  more recently  a number of first order temporalepistemic logics for reasoning about mas were introduced by wooldridge et al        
             often in the context of the mable programming language for agents  the
same authors introduced a first order branching time temporal logic for mas  wooldridge
  fisher         and developed it in a series of papers  wooldridge et al               
first order multi modal logics also constitute the conceptual base of a number of other
agent theories  such as bdi logics  rao   georgeff         the kqml framework  cohen
  levesque         and the lora framework  wooldridge      b   all of these include
operators for mental attitudes  e g   knowledge  belief  intention  desire  etc    as well as
temporal and dynamic operators with some form of quantification  however  most of the
current literature has so far fallen short of a systematic analysis of the formal properties of
these frameworks  some of the frameworks above are so rich that they are unlikely to be
finitely axiomatisable  let alone decidable  still  these earlier contributions are an inspiration
to the present investigation  as they are among the few to have explicitly addressed the
subject of first order temporal epistemic languages in a mas setting 
at a purely theoretical level  first order temporal and epistemic logics have also received increasing attention with a range of contributions on axiomatisability  degtyarev
et al         sturm et al         wolter   zakharyaschev         decidability  degtyarev
et al         hodkinson et al         wolter   zakharyaschev         and complexity  hodkinson        hodkinson et al          wolter and zakharyaschev        introduced the
monodic fragment of quantified modal logic  where the modal operators are restricted to
formulas with at most one free variable  and they proved the decidability of various fragments  similar results have been obtained for monodic fragments of first order temporal
logic  hodkinson        hodkinson et al          and the computational complexity of these
formalisms have been analysed  hodkinson        hodkinson et al          further  wolter
and zakharyaschev        provided a complete axiomatisation of the monodic first order
validities on the natural numbers  the monodic fragment of first order epistemic logic has
also been explored  sturm et al         sturm  wolter    zakharyaschev         and an
axiomatisation including common knowledge has been provided  these lines of research
constitute the theoretical background against which this research is set 
the contributions discussed previously used plain kripke models as the underlying semantics  however  it has been argued though that in applications a computationallygrounded semantics  wooldridge      a  is preferable  as this enables systems to be modelled directly  we introduced quantified interpreted systems  qis  to fill this gap  belar

dinelli   lomuscio         this enabled us to provide a complete axiomatisation of the
monodic fragment of quantified temporal epistemic logic on linear time  belardinelli   lomuscio         however  no interaction between temporal and epistemic modalities was
studied  preliminary investigations into the interactions between temporal and epistemic
operators in a first order setting have already appeared  belardinelli   lomuscio         in
this paper we extend the previous results and also consider epistemic languages containing
the common knowledge operator 
    the present contribution
this paper extends the current state of the art in first order temporal epistemic logic by
introducing a family of provably complete calculi for a variety of quantified interpreted systems characterising a range of properties including perfect recall  no learning  synchronicity 
and having a unique initial state  we prove the completeness of the presented first order
temporal epistemic logics via a quasimodel construction  which has previously been used
 hodkinson  wolter    zakharyaschev        hodkinson et al         to prove decidability
for monodic fragments of first order temporal logic  fotl   quasimodels have also been
applied to first order temporal as well as epistemic logic  sturm et al         wolter   zakharyaschev         wolter et al         present a complete axiomatisation for the monodic
fragment of fotl on the natural numbers  a similar result for a variety of first order epistemic logics with common knowledge has also appeared  sturm et al          however  the
interaction between temporal and epistemic modalities in a first order setting has not been
taken into account yet  nor has the interpreted systems semantics  nonetheless  both of
these features are essential for applications to multi agent systems and are the subject of
analysis here 
      structure of the paper 
in section   we first introduce the first order temporal epistemic languages lm and lcm
with common knowledge for a set ag               m  of agents  we then present the relevant
classes of qis as well as the monodic fragments of lm and lcm   in sections   we introduce
the axiomatisations for these classes of qis  while the details of the completeness proofs
are presented in sections   and    finally  in section   we elaborate on the results obtained
and discuss possible extensions and future work 

   first order temporal epistemic logics
interpreted systems are a standard semantics for interpreting temporal epistemic logics in a
multi agent setting  fagin et al         parikh   ramanujam         we extend interpreted
systems to the first order case by enriching these structures with a domain of individuals 
we first investigated static quantified interpreted systems  where no account for the
evolution of the system is given  belardinelli   lomuscio               then  fully fledged
qis on a language with also temporal modalities were introduced  belardinelli   lomuscio 
             we follow the definition of qis provided in the references

    first order temporal epistemic languages
given a set ag               m  of agents  the first order temporal epistemic language lm
contains individual variables x    x           individual constants c    c           n ary predicate constants p n   p n          for n  n  the propositional connectives  and   the quantifier   the
linear time operators  and u  and the epistemic operator ki for each agent i  ag  the
language lcm also contains the common knowledge operator c  fagin et al          for
simplicity we consider only one group of agents for the common knowledge modality  that
is  the whole of ag  c is really tantamount to cag   the extension to proper non empty
subsets of ag is not problematic 
the languages lm and lcm contain no symbol for functions  so all terms t    t          in
these languages are either individual variables or constants 
definition    formulas in lm are defined in the backus naur form as follows 
     p k  t            tk               x      u     ki 
the language lcm extends lm with the following clause 
 if  is a formula in lcm   then also c is a formula in lcm  
the formulas  and u  are read as at the next step  and eventually   and until
then  respectively  the formula ki  represents agent i knows   while c stands for
 is common knowledge in the set ag of agents 
we define the symbols         g  always in the future   f  some time in the future 
as standard  further  we introduce some abbreviations  the v
operator ki is dual to ki  
that is  ki  is defined as ki   while e is a shorthand for iag ki   for k  n  e k 
is defined as follows  e       and e k      ee k   the formulas ki  and e are read as
agent i considers  possible and every agent knows  respectively 
free and bound variables are defined as standard  by   y   we mean that  y   y            yn
are all the free variables in   additionally    y   t  is the formula obtained by substituting simultaneously some  possibly all  free occurrences of  y in  with  t   t            tn while
renaming bound variables  a sentence is a formula with no free variables 
    quantified interpreted systems
to introduce quantified interpreted systems we assume a set li of local states li   li          for
each agent i  ag in a multi agent system  we consider a set le of local states for the
environment e as well  the set s  le l       lm contains all and only the global states
of the multi agent system  to represent the temporal evolution of the mas we consider
the flow of time n of natural numbers  a run is a function r   n  s  intuitively  a run
represents one possible evolution of the mas assuming n as the flow of time  given the
above  we define quantified interpreted systems for the languages lm and lcm as follows 
definition    qis   a quantified interpreted system is a triple p   hr  d  ii where 
 r is a non empty set of runs 
 d is a non empty set of individuals 
 

fiinteractions between knowledge and time in a first order logic for mas

 for r  r  n  n  i is a first order interpretation  that is  a function such that
 for every constant c  i c  r n    d 
 for every predicate constant p k   i p k   r n   is a k ary relation on d 
further  for every r  r   r  n  n   n  i c  r n     i c  r   n     
notice that we assume a unique domain of interpretation  as well as a fixed interpretation
for individual constants  so we simply write i c   following standard notation  fagin et al  
       for r  r and n  n  a pair  r  n  is a point in p  if r n    hle   l            lm i is the
global state at point  r  n  then re  n    le and ri  n    li are the environments and agent
is local state at  r  n  respectively  further  for i  ag the epistemic equivalence relation
i is defined such that  r  n  i  r    n    iff ri  n    ri   n     clearly  each i is an equivalence
relation  two points  r  n  and  r    n    are said to be epistemically
reachable  or simply
s
reachable  if  r  n    r    n    where  is the transitive closure of iag i  
in this paper we consider the following classes of qis 
definition    a quantified interpreted system p satisfies
synchronicity

iff

for every i  ag  for all points  r  n    r    n    
 r  n  i  r    n    implies n   n 

perfect recall for agent i

iff

for all points  r  n    r    n     if  r  n  i  r    n    and n    
then either  r  n     i  r    n    or
there is k   n  such that  r  n     i  r    k  and
for all k     k   k    n  implies  r  n  i  r    k    

no learning for agent i

iff

for all points  r  n    r    n     if  r  n  i  r    n   
then either  r  n      i  r    n    or
there is k   n  such that  r  n      i  r    k  and
for all k     k   k    n  implies  r  n  i  r    k    

unique initial state

iff

for all r  r   r  r      r     

these conditions have extensively been discussed in the literature  halpern et al        
together with equivalent formulations  intuitively  a qis is synchronous if time is part of
the local state of each agent  a qis satisfies perfect recall for agent i if is local state records
everything that has happened to him  from the agents point of view  so far in the run  no
learning is dual to perfect recall  agent i does not acquire any new knowledge during a run 
finally  a qis has a unique initial state if all runs start from the same global state 
a qis p satisfies perfect recall  resp  no learning  if p satisfies perfect recall  resp  no
learning  for all agents  we denote the class of qis with m agents as qis m   the superscripts
pr  nl  sync  uis denote the subclasses of qis m satisfying perfect recall  no learning 
synchronicity  and having a unique initial state respectively  for instance  qis sync uis
is
m
the class of all synchronous qis with m agents and having a unique initial state 
we now assign an interpretation to the formulas in lm and lcm by means of quantified
interpreted systems  let  be an assignment from variables to individuals in d  the valuation

i   t  of a term t is defined as  y  for t   y  and i   t    i c  for t   c  a variant ax of an
assignment  assigns a  d to x and agrees with  on all other variables 
definition    the satisfaction of a formula   lm at point  r  n   p under an assignment
  denoted  p    r  n       is defined inductively as follows 
 p    r  n     p k  t            tk  
 p    r  n     
 p    r  n

for all r    n     r  n  i  r    n    implies  p    r    n       

for   lcm we have to consider also the case for the common knowledge operator 
 p    r  n     c

iff

for all k  n   p    r  n     e k 

the truth conditions for         g and f are defined from those above  from
the definition above it follows that  p    r  n     c iff for all  r    n    reachable from  r  n  
 p    r    n        
a formula  is true at a point  r  n  if it is satisfied at  r  n  by every assignment    is
true on a qis p if it is true at every point in p   is valid on a class c of qis if it is true
on every qis in c  further  a formula  is satisfiable on a qis p if it is satisfied at some
point in p  for some assignment    is satisfiable on a class c of qis if it is satisfiable on
some qis in c 
by considering all combinations of pr  nl  sync and uis we obtain    subclasses of qis m
for any m  n  not all of them are independent  nor axiomatisable  indeed  some of these
are not axiomatisable even at the propositional level  halpern   moses        halpern  
vardi         in the first column of table   we group together the classes of qis that share
the same set of validities on the languages lm and lcm   the proofs of these equivalences
are similar to those of the propositional case  halpern et al         and are not reported
here  further  we define the languages plm and plcm as the propositional fragments of
lm and lcm respectively  formally  plm and plcm are obtained by restricting atomic
formulas to   ary predicate constants p    p            table   summarises the results by halpern
et al         concerning the axiomatisability of propositional validities in plm and plcm  
observe that  as regards the language plm   for m     all sets of validities on the various
classes of qis are axiomatisable  while for m    no axiomatisation can be given for
qis nl uis
and qis nl pr uis
 halpern   vardi               as to the language plcm   we
m
m
restrict to the case for m     as for m     plcm has the same expressive power as
plm   for m    no class of validities on plcm has a recursive axiomatisation but qis m  
uis
sync uis
and qis nl sync uis
  qis nl pr sync uis
 
qis sync

m   qis m   qis m
in the next section we show that the axiomatisability results at the propositional level
can be lifted to the monodic fragment of the languages lm and lcm

    the monodic fragment
in the rest of the paper we will show that a sufficient condition for lifting the results in
table   to the first order case is to restrict the languages lm and lcm to their monodic
fragments 
definition    the monodic fragment l m is the set of formulas   lm such that any subformula of  of the form ki     or   u  contains at most one free variable  similarly 
  is the set of formulas   lc
the monodic fragment lcm
m such that any subformula of 
of the form ki   c    or   u  contains at most one free variable 
the monodic fragments of a number of first order modal logics have been thoroughly
investigated in the literature  hodkinson et al               wolter   zakharyaschev       
       in the case of lm and lcm these fragments are quite expressive as they contain
formulas like the following 
y c zavailable y  z uxrequest x  y  

   

ki  xyz request x  y   available y  z   
 ki xyz request x  y   available y  z  

   

formula     intuitively states that it is common knowledge that every resource y will
eventually be requested by somebody  but until that time the resource remains available to
everybody  notice that y is the only free variable within the scope of modal operators u
and c  formula     represents that if agent i knows that at the next step every resource is
available whenever it is requested  then at the next step agent i knows that this is indeed
the case  however  note that the formula
xki  process x   yf access x  y  
 

fibelardinelli   lomuscio

which intuitively means that agent i knows that every process will eventually try to access
every resource  is not in l m as both x and y occur free within the scope of modal operator
f   still  the monodic fragments of lm and lcm are quite expressive as they contain all
de dicto formulas  i e   formulas where no free variable appears in the scope of any modal
operator  as in      so  the limitation is really only on de re formulas 
we stress the fact that the formulas above have no propositional equivalent in the
case that they are interepreted on quantified interpreted systems in which the domain of
quantification is infinite  or its cardinality cannot be bounded in advance 
finally  observe that the barcan formulas x  x   and ki x  xki 
are both true in all quantified interpreted systems  as each qis includes a unique domain
of quantification  this implies that the universal quantifier commutes with the temporal
modality  and the epistemic modality ki   thus  it can be the case that for some formulas
      lm   we have that      is a validity  but   l m and    
  l m   for instance 
consider    xp  x  y  and      x  p  x  y   we will see that this remark does not
interfere with our results 

   axiomatisations
in this section we present sound and complete axiomatisations of the sets of monodic validities for the classes of quantified interpreted systems in section    first  we introduce
the basic system qktm that extends to the first order case the multi modal epistemic logic
s m combined with the linear temporal logic ltl 
definition    the system qktm contains the following schemes of axioms and rules 
where    and  are formulas in l m and   is the inference relation

in this paper we focus on the schemes of axioms in table   that specify key interactions
between time and knowledge  halpern et al          we use              as superscripts to denote

qis and the inference rules preserve validity  however  the axioms kt  kt  are valid only

    kripke models
to prove the completeness results in theorem    we first introduce an appropriate class of
kripke models as a generalisation of qis and prove completeness for these models  then
we apply a correspondence result between kripke models and qis to obtain the desired
results 
definition    kripke model   a kripke model is a tuple m   hw  rw    i  iag   d  ii
such that
 w is a non empty set of states 
 rw is a non empty set of functions r   n  w  
 for every agent i  ag  i is an equivalence relation on w  
 d is a non empty set of individuals 
 for every w  w   i is a first order interpretation  that is  a function such that
 for every constant c  i c  w   d 
 for every predicate constant p k   i p k   w  is a k ary relation on d 
further  for every w  w   w   i c  w    i c  w    
notice that def    differs from other notions of kripke model in that it includes the
set rw of functions to guarantee that the correspondence between kripke models and
qis is one to one  we also assume a unique domain of interpretation  as well as a fixed
interpretation for individual constants  so also in this case we simply write i c   kripke
models are a generalisation of qis in that they do not specify the inner structure of the states
in w   also for kripke models we introduce points as pairs  r  n  for r  rw and n  n 
a point derives its properties from the corresponding state  for instance   r  n  i  r    n    if
r n  i r   n    
we consider kripke models satisfying synchronicity  perfect recall  no learning  and
having a unique initial state  the definition of these subclasses is analogous to def    
definition    a kripke model m satisfies
synchronicity

iff

for every i  ag  for all points  r  n    r    n    
 r  n  i  r    n    implies n   n

for all points  r  n    r    n     if  r  n  i  r    n    and n    
then either  r  n     i  r    n    or
there is k   n  such that  r  n     i  r    k  and
for all k     k   k    n  implies  r  n  i  r    k     

no learning for agent i

iff

for all points  r  n    r    n     if  r  n  i  r    n   
then either  r  n      i  r    n    or
there is k   n  such that  r  n      i  r    k  and
for all k     k   k    n  implies  r  n  i  r    k

models with m agents and having a unique initial state  further  the inductive clauses for
the satisfaction relation    with respect to an assignment  are straightforwardly defined

we relate kripke models and quantified interpreted systems by means of a map g

notice that if m satisfies synchronicity  or perfect recall  or no learning  or has a unique
initial state  then also g m  satisfies the same property  this follows from the fact that
 
 r  n  i  r    n    iff  rri   n   i  rr   n     thus  g defines a map from each of the    subclasses
of km outlined in def    to the corresponding subclass of qis m and we obtain the following

for reasoning about the monodic fragments of lm and lcm when we are dealing with no
learning and perfect recall  we introduce the following class of monodic friendly kripke
models  these structures are motivated by the fact that kt  and kt  are too weak
to enforce either perfect recall or no learning on kripke models when these axioms are
restricted to monodic formulas  however  they suffice for monodic friendly structures  in
the following  we also prove that satisfiability in kripke models is equivalent to satisfability
in monodic friendly structures when we restrict our languages to monodic formulas 
definition     mf model   a monodic friendly
mmf   hw  rw    i a  iag ad   d  ii such that

kripke

is

a

tuple

 w   rw   d and i are defined as for kripke models 
 for i  ag  a  d  i a is an equivalence relation on w  
we can define synchronicity  perfect recall  no learning  and having a unique initial state
also for mf models by parametrising def    to each relation i a   for instance  an mf model
satisfies perfect recall for agent i if for all points  r  n    r    n     for all a  d  whenever
 r  n  i a  r    n    and n     then either  r  n     i a  r    n    or there is k   n  such that
 r  n     i a  r    k  and for all k     k   k    n  implies  r  n  i a  r    k      as regards the
subclasses of the class mf m of all mf models with m agents  we adopt the same naming
conventions as for qis and kripke models  notice that kripke models can be seen as
mf models such that for all i  ag  a  b  d  i a is equal to i b  
    in a mf model m
finally  the satisfaction relation    for   l m  resp  lcm
mf is
defined in the same way as in kripke models  except for the epistemic operators 
 mmf   r  n     ki  y 

iff

for all r    n     r  n  i  y   r    n    implies  mmf   r    n        y 

where at most y appears free in   notice that if  is a sentence  then  mmf   r  n     ki 
iff  r  n  i a  r    n    implies  mmf   r    n        for all a  d  the case for the common
knowledge operator c is straightforward by definition of e k   in particular  two points  r  n 
   
and  r    n    are epistemically reachable
s for a  d  or simply reachable  if  r  n  a  r   n   
where a is the transitive closure of iag i a  
we remark that the converse of the barcan formula  or cbf   ki x  xki  holds

proof  the implication from right to left follows from the fact that the class km of all
kripke models is isomorphic to the subclass of monodic friendly kripke models such that
for all i  ag  a  b  d  i a is equal to i b   in other words  given a kripke model m  
hw  rw    i  iag   d  ii we can define the mf model m    hw  rw    i a  iag ad   d  ii 
where for every a  d  i a is equal to i   it is straightforward to see that m  validates
both k and bf  in particular  the counterexamples in fig    are ruled out   further  if
m      then m        thus  if mf k bf
     then km     
m
for the implication from left to right  assume that mmf   hw  rw  
 i a  iag ad   d  ii is an mf model validating k and bf such that  mmf   r  n      
for some point  r  n  and some assignment   we can then build a kripke model m   
hw     r w       i  iag   d    i   i from mmf such that  m    r  n       as follows  we start by
assuming w     w   sr    r and d    d  further  for each i  ag  define  i as the
transitive closure of ad i a   finally  set i     i  we now have to check that the kripke
model m  is well defined and does not validate  
first of all  we point out the following issue associated with the construction above  it
can be the case that for some point  q  k  and some monodic formula  x   it happens that
 mmf   q  k     ki  x    q  k  i  x   q     k     and  q  k  i  y   q      k      for some  x      y  
further  suppose that  mmf   q      k           x   while we obviously have that  mmf   q     k       
 x   now by the definition of  i we have that  m    q  k      ki  x   so the two models do
not satisfy the same formulas  we can solve this problem by modifying the interpretation i
according to the structure of the monodic formula  x   while keeping the same truth value
for  x  at point  q  k   we consider the relevant cases according to the structure of  x  
the induction hypothesis consists of the fact that we are able to find such an interpretation
i for all subformulas of  x  
for  x    p  x  we simply assume that  x   i p  q     k        so that  m    q      k        
 x  and  m    q  k     ki  x   note that this does not change the truth value of any
epistemic formula in  q  k  as we assumed that  q  k   i  x   q      k       otherwise  x  would
be satisfied in  q      k        the cases for propositional connectives and modal operators are
similarly dealt with by applying the induction hypothesis  for  x    y x  y  we have
y

b
  q      k           x  y  
that  mmf   q      k           x   therefore there exists b  d such that  mmf
now we have to consider   different cases depending on whether  q  k  satisfies any of these
  formulas 

ki x  x  y 

   

ki x  x  y 

   

ki x  x  y 

   

ki x  x  y 

   

by using the axioms and inference rules in qktm for formula     we can show what
follows  where  is used for entailment  
 mmf   q  k     ki y x  y   ki x x  y  
  mmf   q  k     xki y x  y   yki x x  y  by ex

but the last formula is a contradiction  so     cannot hold in  q  k   similarly  formula
    cannot hold in  q  k  either because

similarly to above

note that in both derivations we make use of the formulas k and bf  for instance  to
prove the theorems ki       ki   ki  and zki   ki z   finally  to satify the
formulas     and     in  q  k   we have to guarantee the existence of an individual x while
avoiding the clash with  x   so  we introduce a new individual a  in the domain d  such
that a  and  x  satisfy the same formulas at all points  thus  a  can be seen as a copy
of  x   finally  by the induction hypothesis we can modify the interpretation i   so that
 m    q      k          x  y  
the case for the common knowledge operator derives from the one for ki   as a result 
we obtain a kripke model m  such that  m    r  n       
moreover  by the procedure described above  if mmf satisfies perfect recall  or no learning  or synchronicity  or has unique initial state  then also m  satisfies the same property 
thus  by lemma   we can prove the following result 
corollary    let x be any subset of  pr  nl  sync  uis   for every monodic formula   l m
     if  is satisfiable in mf x also validating the formulas k and bf   then  is

satisfiable in km
proof  it is easy to see that if mmf satisfies either synchronicity or has a unique
initial state  then m  does as well by the way it is defined  further  suppose that mmf
satisfies perfect recall  and  r  n   i  r    n    for n      this means that there is a sequence
a            ak of individuals in d and a sequence  q    m              qk   mk   of points such that  i 
 r  n     q    m    and  r    n       qk   mk    and  ii   qj   mj   i aj  qj     mj     for j   k  we
show the result for k      the case for k     follows by a straightforward generalisation 
if  q    m      i a   q    m     then by the definition of  i we have that  q    m       i
 q    m    as well  hence  mmf satisfies perfect recall  otherwise  suppose that by perfect
recall there is l    m  such that  q    m      i a   q    l     and for all l     l    l    m 
implies  q    m    i a   q    l      now consider each l    h    m   h  for    h   m  
l    by perfect recall  either  i  there exists p   h  such that  q    l    h   i a   q    p   h   
and for all p    h   p   h    p    h   p   h     implies  q    l   h   i a   q    p    h    or  ii 
 q    l    h      i a   q    p   h       where p        m    notice that in both cases  by
the definition of  i   we have that  q    m     i  q    p    h   for all    h   m   l    that is 
 q    m     i  q    p     for all p   l         p    m    further  for l    either  i  there exists l  such

or  ii   q    l      i a   q    p   l         in the first case  if some l   is strictly less than
m    then there is l   such that  q    m       i  q    l     and for all l      l     l     m  implies
 q    m     i  q    l       otherwise  we have that  q    m       i  q    m     hence  mmf satisfies
perfect recall 
the proof for no learning is similar 
finally  by combining corollaries   and   we immediately obtain the following result 
corollary    let x be any subset of  pr  nl  sync  uis   for every monodic formula   l m
     if  is satisfiable in mf x also validating the formulas k and bf   then  is
 resp  lcm
m
satisfiable in qis x

in the next section we show that it is indeed possible to build such an mf model 

   the completeness proof
in this section we outline the main steps of the completeness proof  which is based on
a quasimodel construction  gabbay  kurucz  wolter    zakharyaschev        hodkinson
et al          differently from these contributions  here we explicitly take into account
the interaction between temporal and epistemic modalities  intuitively  a quasimodel for
a monodic formula  is a relational structure whose points are sets of sets of subformulas
of   each set of sets of subformulas describes a possible state of affairs  and contains
sets of subformulas defining the individuals in that state  more formally  given a formula
  lcn  we define
subc    sub   ec   c  sub    ki c   c  sub  i  ag 
where sub is the set of subformulas of   for   l n   subc  is simply sub  further  we
define
subc    subc         subc          subc          subc  
observe that subc  is closed under negation modulo equivalences    and t   
that is  for all   subc   if  is not of the form  then   subc   otherwise 
  subc   finally  let subn  be the subset of subc  containing formulas with at most
n free variables  so  sub   is the set of sentences in subn   if x is a variable not occurring
in   we define subx      y x     y   sub     clearly  x is the only free variable in the
formulas in subx   by con we denote the set of all constants occurring in   in table  
we report the set suby  for  equal to formula     thus abbreviated

further  for k  n we define the closures clk  and clk i  by mutual recursion

table    a type t in cl    for  equal to formula     

we define ad   as the greatest number of alternations of distinct ki s along any branch
in s parse tree  halpern et al          further  an index is any finite sequence    i            ik
of agents such that in    in     for    n   k  the length of  is denoted by     also   i is
the absorptive concatenation of indexes  and i such that  i    if ik   i  finally  k  is a
shorthand for ki        kik   now let  be an index such that     ad    if  is the empty
sequence  then cl    clad     if       i  then cl    clk i  for k   ad        we now
introduce types for quasimodels  which intuitively can be seen as individuals described by
maximal and consistent sets of formulas 
definition     type   a  type t for  is any maximal and consistent subset of cl   i e  
for every monodic formulas  and    in cl  
 i    t iff  
  t 
 ii        t iff       t 
two  types t  t  are said to agree on sub   if t  sub     t   sub    i e   if they share
the same sentences  given a  type t for  and a constant c  con  ht  ci is an indexed type
for   abbreviated as tc   in table   we report a type t in cl    for  equal to formula     
we now introduce state candidates  which intuitively represent the states of a quasimodel 
definition     state candidate   a  state candidate for  is a pair c   ht  t con i such
that
 i  t is a set of  types for  that agree on sub   
 ii  t con is a set containing for each c  con an indexed type tc such that t  t

we also introduce the notion of point  which describes a state candidate from the perspective of a particular type 
definition     point   a  point for  is a pair p   hc  ti such that
 i  c   ht  t con i is a  state candidate for  
 ii  t  t is a  type 
note that  by a slight abuse of notation  we call points both the pairs  r  n  in qis and
the pairs p   hc  ti  this is to be consistent with previous work  fagin et al         halpern
et al          the context will disambiguate  also  we write t  c for c   ht  t con i and
t  t   similarly for t  p  given a  state candidate c   ht  t con i and a point p   hc  ti
we define the formulas c and p as follows 
c   

 

xt x   x

tt

 
tt

t x  

 

t x c 

tc t con

p    c  t
where we do not distinguish between a type t and the conjuction of formulas it contains 
a  state candidate c is s consistent if the formula c is consistent w r t  the system s 
i e   if  s c   similarly  a  point p is s consistent if the formula p is consistent w r t  s 
we refer to plain consistency whenever the system s of reference is understood  consistent
state candidates represent the states of our quasimodels  we now define the relations of
suitability that constitute the relational part of quasimodels 
definition    
 a    type t  and a    type t  are  suitable  or t   t    iff      
and t   t  is consistent  they are i suitable  or t  i t    iff    i      i and t   ki t 
is consistent 
 a    state candidate c  and a    state candidate c  are  suitable  or c   c    iff
      and c   c  is consistent  they are i suitable  or c  i c    iff    i      i
and c   ki c  is consistent 
 a    point p  and a    point p  are  suitable  or p   p    iff       and p  
p  is consistent  they are i suitable  or p  i p    iff    i      i and p   ki p 
is consistent 
 a    point p    hc    t  i and a    point p    hc    t  i are  suitable for a constant
c  con  or p  c p    iff p   p    tc   t con and tc   t con   they are i suitable
for c  or p  ci p    iff p  i p    tc   t con and tc   t con  
by using the axioms t     and   it can be shown that the relation i is reflexive 
transitive and symmetric  that is  an equivalence relation  also  the relation  is serial 
in the following lemma we list some properties of relations  and i that will be useful in
what follows 
lemma   

 i  let   subx   if t   t  then   t  iff   t

 ii  let ki   subx  and let t be a  type  ki   t iff for all  types t    t i t  implies
  t    moreover  let   i   ad    then ki   t iff for all  i types t    t i t  implies
  t   
proof 
 i  the proof is similar to the one for lemma   i  in the work of wolter et al          if
  t  and  
  t  then   t  and since t  t  is consistent  then also  
is consistent  which is a contradiction  from right to left  if   t  and  
  t  then
    t    since t   t  is consistent  then also      is consistent  which
is a contradiction 
 ii  from left to right  if ki   t and  
  t  then   t  and since t  ki t  is consistent 
then also ki   ki  is consistent  which is a contradiction  from right to left  if
ki  
  t then we can extend the set         ki   t  to a  type t    in particular 
t i t  and   t    moreover  if   i   ad   then we can similarly prove that ki   t
iff for all  i types t    t i t  implies   t   
we now present the frame underlying the quasimodel for  
definition     frame   a frame f is a tuple hr  d   i a  iag ad   fi where
 i  r is a non empty set of indexes r  r          
 ii  d is a non empty set of individuals 
 iii  for every i  ag  a  d  i a is an equivalence relation on the set of points  r  n  for
r  r and n  n 
 iv  f is a partial function associating to each point  r  n  a consistent state candidate
f r  n    cr n such that
 a  the domain of f is not empty 
 b  if f is defined on  r  n   then it is defined on  r  n      
 c  if f is defined on  r  n  and  r  n  i a  r    n     then f is defined on  r    n    
the function f is partial to take into consideration the case of synchronous systems  also 
it is straightforward to introduce frames satisfying perfect recall  no learning  synchronicity 
or having a unique initial state  by following the same definitions given for mf models  next 
we provide the definition of objects  which correspond to the runs of gabbay et al         
we choose this terminology to avoid confusion with the runs in qis 
definition     object   given an individual a  d  an object in the frame f is a map a
con i
associating a type a  r  n   tr n to every  r  n   dom f  with f r  n    cr n   htr n   tr n
such that
   a  r  n   a  r  n     
   if  r  n  i a  r    n    then a  r  n  i a  r    n

   u  a  r  n  iff there is n   n such that   a  r  n    and for all n     n  n     n 
implies   a  r  n    
   if a  r  n  i t are  types  then for some  r    n      r  n  i a  r    n    and a  r    n      t

an object  satisfies                    above and       below instead of

a  r    n      t 
intuitively  an object identifies the same individual  here represented by types  across
different state candidates  now we have all the elements to give the definition of quasimodel 
definition     quasimodel   a quasimodel for  is a tuple q   hr  o   i   iag o   fi
such that hr  o   i   iag o   fi is a frame  and
     t for some t  tr n and tr n  cr n
   cr n  cr n  
   if  r  n  i   r    n    then  r  n  i  r    n   
   for every t  tr n there exists an object   o such that  r  n    t
con is an object in o 
   for every c  con  the function c such that c  r  n    tc  tr n

a quasimodel  is defined as a quasimodel but where clauses     and     refer to objects 
rather than objects  we can define quasimodels  resp  quasimodel    satisfying perfect recall 
no learning  synchronicity  or having a unique initial state  by assuming the corresponding
condition on the underlying frame  the difference between objects  resp  quasimodel  and
objects   resp  quasimodel    is purely technical  in particular  the latter are needed for
systems satisfying perfect recall and no learning as it will become apparent in section   
in the following lemma we list some properties of quasimodels that will be useful in what
follows 
lemma    in every quasimodel q  for every object   o 
 i  ki    r  n  iff for all  r    n      r    n    i   r  n  implies    r    n    
 ii  c   r  n  iff for all points  r    n    reachable from  r  n  we have that    r    n    
proof 
 i  the implication from left to right follows from the fact that  r    n    i   r  n  implies
 r  n  i  r    n     for the implication from right to left  if ki  
   r  n  then by
lemma   ii  there is a  type t such that  r  n  i t and   t  by definition    for
some  r    n      r  n  i   r    n    and    r    n      t

 ii  the implication from left to right is proved by induction on the length of the path
from  r  n  to  r    n     both the base case and the inductive step follow by axiom c  
the implication from right to left follows from definition    
we now state the main result of this section  that is  satisfability in quasimodels implies
satisfability in mf models  in what follows a quasimodel q validates a formula  if  belongs
to every type in every state candidate in q 
theorem    if there is a quasimodel  resp  quasimodel    q for a monodic formula   then
 is satisfiable in a mf model mmf   moreover  if q validates the formulas k and bf   then
so does mmf   finally  if q satisfies perfect recall  or no learning  or synchronicity  or has
a unique initial state  then so does mmf  
proof  this proof is inspired by those of lemmas       and      in the work of gabbay
et al          but here we consider monodic friendly kripke models rather than standard
kripke models  first  for every monodic formula  of the form ki   c   or   u 
we introduce a k ary predicate constant pk for k equal to   or    depending whether there
are   or   free variables in   the formula pk  x  is called the surrogate of   given a
monodic formula  we denote by  the formula obtained from  by substituting all its modal
subformulas which are not within the scope of another modal operator with their surrogates 
since every state candidate c in the quasimodel q is consistent and all the system s of
first order temporal epistemic logic considered in section   are based on classical first order
logic  the formula c is consistent with respect to first order  non modal  logic  by godels
completeness theorem there is a first order structure i   hi  di  where d is a non empty set
of individuals and i is a first order interpretation on d  that satisfies c   i e   i     c for
some assignment  of the variables to the elements in d  we intend to build an mf model
by joining all these first order structures  however  it is possible that these structures have
different domains with different cardinalities  to solve this problem  we consider a cardinal
number     greater than the cardinality of the set o of all objects in q and define
d    h  i     o      
then  for  r  n   q  for any  type t  tr n we have that
  h  i  d    r  n    t     
by the method described in claim       by gabbay et al          we can expand each
first order structure to obtain a structure ir n   hir n   di with domain d such that ir n
satisfies cr n and

  a  d    x    a and ir n
   t x      

so  we can assume without loss of generality that all first order structures ir n share the
same domain d  and for every t  tr n   h  i  d  we have

 r  n    t iff ir n
   t x 

for  x    h  i  equivalently  for t  tr n    x    h  i  d 

 r  n       cl    ir n
    x

moreover  ir n  c    hc    i for every c  con 
we define the mf model mmf as the tuple hw  r   i a  iag ad   d  ii such that w is
the set of points  r  n  for r in r  q and n  n  r is the set of runs from n to w such that
r n     r  n   d is defined as above  for i  ag and h  i  d  i h i is defined as i   
and the interpretation i is obtained by joining the various first order interpretations ir n  
i e   i p  r n     ir n  p   for every predicate constant p   we can now prove the following
result for mmf  
lemma    if the mf model mmf is obtained from a quasimodel q as described above  then
for every   subx  

ir n
    iff  mmf   r  n     

moreover  if q is a quasimodel    f r  n  is a  state candidate and ad k    ad   then

ir n
    iff  mmf   r  n     

proof  the proof is similar to lemma       in the work of gabbay et al          we
begin with the first part  the base case of induction follows by definition of the interpretation i in the mf model  the step for propositional connectives and quantifiers follows by

steps      and      follow by equation      step      is motivated by lemma   ii   and
step      follows by the induction hypothesis 
now we prove the second part of the lemma  all cases are identical to the first part 
except for    ki   suppose that f r  n  is a  state candidate and ad k    ad   
for the implication from left to right  if  r  n  i   r    n    then  r    n    is a    type such
that  i      i  thus  ad k     ad k i    ad k ki    ad    so  we can apply
the induction hypothesis  for the implication from right to left  if ad k ki    ad  
then   i   ad   and by lemma   ii  there is some  i type t such that t i  r  n  and
  t  by def     there is  r    n    such that  r  n  i   r    n    and  r    n      t  since
ad k i     ad k ki    ad   we can apply the induction hypothesis 
to complete the proof of theorem    by definition of quasimodel we have that   t for
some t  tr n and tr n  cr n   therefore   is satisfied in the mf model mmf at point  r  n  
we also remark that if q validates the formulas k and bf   so does mmf   this is the case
as  if k and bf belong to every type in every state candidate in q  then by lemma   we
have that mmf validates k and bf as well 
finally  if q satisfies perfect recall  or no learning  or synchronicity  or has a unique
initial state  then the mf model obtained from q satisfies the corresponding constraints by
construction  we show this fact for perfect recall  if  r  n  i h i  r    n    and n      then
in particular  r  n  i   r    n     since q satisfies perfect recall  either  r  n     i   r    n    
or there is k   n  such that  r  n     i   r    k  and for all k     k   k    n  implies
 r  n  i   r    k      by the definition of i h i we obtain that either  r  n     i h i  r    n    
or there is k   n  such that  r  n     i h i  r    k  and for all k     k   k    n  implies
 r  n  i h i  r    k      that is  mmf satisfies perfect recall as well 
we next show the existence of quasimodels for any monodic

   dealing with each system
in this section we consider the completeness proof for each system in theorem    in particular  we show that if a monodic formula  is consistent with respect to a system s  then
we can build a quasimodel  or a quasimodel  in specific cases  for  based on a frame for
s  in the following sections the symbol   represents provability in the appropriate system
s  we start with some lemmas that are useful for the construction of the quasimodel for
any system 
lemma     i  for any consistent monodic formula  there is a consistent  state candidate c   ht  t con i such that   t for some t  t  
 ii  let p   hc  ti be a consistent  point for  such that c   ht  t con i  and let c  con

the disjunction of all formulas p for all  points p for   consider the formula     which

that   is true on all  non modal  first order structures  since both qktm and qktcm

 h  the proof is similar to  g  
by the following result it is always possible to extend the  suitability relation 
between types to  suitability between points 
lemma    suppose that t and t  are  types such that t  t    then there are  points
p   hc  ti and p    hc    t  i such that p  p    in particular  for any c  con  there are
 points p   hc  ti and p    hc    t  i such that p c p   
w
proof  by lemma   we have that    and    for     p p is a  point for   p  
since t  t    then   t     t    is consistent  thus  there must be  points p and
p  such that p  t   p   t    is consistent  then  it is the case that p   hc  ti and
p    hc    t  i for some  state candidates c and c    as a result  p  p    the second part of
the lemma is proved similarly to the first by observing that if t  t  then t x c   t x c 
is consistent  hence  also   t x c      t   x c   is consistent  thus  there must be
 points p and p  such that p  t x c    p   t   x c   is consistent  so  tc  t con and
t c  t  con   that is  p c p   
according to lemma   we can always extend a possibly infinite sequence of  types t  
t         to a possibly infinite sequence of  points p   p         such that pk   hck   tk i 
definition     let a  sequence be a possibly infinite sequence c   c         of  state
candidates  a  sequence is acceptable if for all k

 ii  if   u   tck   for tck  ck   then   u  is c realised in a sequence of  points pj  
hcj   tj i for k  j  n 
the following lemma entails the completeness result 
lemma    every finite  sequence of  state candidates can be extended to an infinite
acceptable  sequence 
proof  assume that c          cn is a finite  sequence  and   u   tk  ck for
some k  n  either   u  is realised in c          cn   or by lemma   ii  c  we can extend
 to a  sequence   that realises   u    this procedure is repeated for all formulas of
the form   u  appearing at some point in the  sequence  thus  we obtain a  possibly
infinite   sequence c   c         such that property  i  in definition    is satisfied  to
also satisfy property  ii  we reason similarly by using lemma   ii  d  instead 
now let x be a new object  a sequence x          x  cn   cn           is acceptable from n if
it starts with n copies of x and cn   cn           is an acceptable  sequence  we can now

if a monodic formula  is consistent  then by lemma   i  there is a consistent  state
candidate c   ht  t con i such that   t for some type t  t   also  by lemma   we
can extend c to an infinite acceptable  sequence  so  the set of infinite acceptable sequences is non empty  let r be the set of all  sequences acceptable from n  for some

we show that o is non empty  condition  a  is guaranteed by lemma   ii  a   and
condition  b  by the fact that r is an acceptable  sequence  as regards  c  we remark
that if  r  n  i t then we can find a consistent  point p   hc  ti by reasoning similarly
as in lemma   i   and by lemma    c can be extended to a  sequence r  acceptable

lemma    the tuple hr  o   i   iag o   fi is a synchronous frame 
proof  we have previously shown that r and o are non empty  also  each i  is an
equivalence relation by definition  and f satisfies the conditions in definition     further 
the frame is synchronous by definition of i   
now we can prove the main result 
lemma     the tuple hr  o   i   iag o   fi is a synchronous quasimodel for  and it

quasimodels are satisfied by the definitions of r  f and i    as regards      we can extend
the function  r  n    t to all dom f  by using lemma   ii  a    c    e  and  g   as to    
the function c such that c  r  n    tc is an object by lemma   ii  b    d    f  and  h

lemma     the set o of functions that satisfies conditions  a    b    c  and  e  is
non empty 
proof  conditions  a  and  b  follow respectively from lemma   ii  a  and the fact
that r is an acceptable  sequence  as regards  c  and  e   the proof proceeds by induction
on n  the result for n     is immediate  as we can take r  to be an acceptable  sequence
starting from c such that t  c  further  we define  r         t  thus   r       i  r     and
both  c  and  e  are satisfied 
now suppose that n     and the result holds for n     since f r  n      f r  n  and
 r  n  i t  it follows by lemma    that there is a  i point p   hc  ti and a  sequence of
 i points p   s          sk   p such that sk    hdk    sk  i and sk  i  r  n  for k    k 
by the induction hypothesis  there exists for every  i type s such that  r  n   i s a point
 r    n    and  r    n      s  in case  a   we take s   t  then we have that  r  n     i  r    n   
for  r    n      t  thus  it is also the case that  r  n  i  r    n     in case  b   we take s   t   
hence   r  n     i  r    n    for  r    n      t    now suppose that r  is derived from the
acceptable  sequence v    v           let r   be the run derived from an acceptable sequence
with initial segment v            vn    d            dk   again  such a run exists by lemma    we

we can now prove the following lemma

proof  by lemmas   i     and    the sets r and o are non empty  also  f satisfies the

it satisfies perfect recall by definition of the functions  in o 
finally  we prove the main result in this section 
lemma     the tuple hr  o   i   iag o   fi is a quasimodel  for  with perfect recall
and it validates the formulas k and bf  
proof  by the previous lemma hr  o   i   iag o   fi is a frame satisfying perfect

quasimodel  that satisfies no learning  in fact  given a  sequence    c    c          of state candidates and a  i type t   such that t  i t   for t   c    by lemma    we can find a
 sequence     c     c           such that t    c   and no learning is satisfied  however  it does
not follow from the acceptability of  that   is also acceptable  so  as in the propositional
case  we have to work with trees of state candidates  hereafter we extend the definitions
given by halpern et al         to be able to deal with points and monodic friendly kripke
models 
definition     let k  ad    a k tree of state candidates for  is a set  of  state
candidates for  with     k that contains a unique  state candidate  i e   the root  and for
every  point t in some c   
 if t  is a  i type such that t i t  and   i   k then there is some  i state candidate
c    such that t   c   
 if       i then there is a    state candidate c    and a    type t   c  such that
t i t   
similarly  we define a k tree of points for  as a set  of  points for  with     k that
contains a unique  point  and for every  point p   hc  ti   
 if t  is a  i type such that t i t  and   i   k  then there is some  i point p   
hc    t  i   
 if       i then there is a    point p    hc    t  i   such that t i t   
intuitively  a k tree is a view of the epistemic state of our quasimodel from a particular
type t  up to k steps from t  we now extend the  suitability relation  to k trees 
definition     let  and   be k trees of state candidates for   we say that  f  
whenever f is a function associating with each  state candidate c   and each  type t  c
finite  sequences of  state candidates in     and  types such that 
   if f  c    c          ck then  a  c   c  and  b  cj   for j   k and ck     
similarly  if f  t    t          tk then  a  t   t  and  b  tj  cj for j   k and
t k  ck  
   let t  c and t   c  for some c  c     if t i t  then f  t  and f  t    are i concordant 
   for at least one c   the sequence f  c  has a length of at least   
further  let  and   be k trees of points for   we say that  f   whenever f is a
function associating with each  point p   a finite  sequence of  points in     such
that 
   if f  p    p          pk then  a  p   p  and  b  pj   for j   k and pk

   let p   hc  ti and p    hc    t  i be in   if t i t  then f  t  and f  t    are i  concordant 
   for at least one p   the sequence f  p  has a length of at least   
finally  for any constant c  con  we say that  cf   whenever  f   and f  p   
p  c       c pk  
notice that given a k tree  of state candidates with root c and t  c  we can obtain a
k tree  of points such that p    hc    t  i   iff c     also  if     are k tree of state
candidates and  f     then we also have  f   where  and   are k trees of points
based on  and   respectively 
we now show how to obtain acceptable sequences of state candidates from sequences
of trees  given two sequences of  state candidates    c            ck and    c            where
 is finite  the fusion    is defined as c            ck    c           only if ck   c     further 
given an infinite sequence      f    f        of k trees  we say that a sequence  of
 state candidates is compatible with  if there exists some h  n and  state candidates
ch   ch            with cj  j for j  h  such that    fh  ch    fh    ch             the sequence
 is acceptable if every  sequence compatible with  is infinite and acceptable 
the basic idea of the completeness proof is to define the quasimodel  starting from an
acceptable sequence   next we introduce some definitions and lemmas that are essential
for the completeness proof 
given a k tree  and a  point p   we inductively define the formula tree p that
describes the k tree  from the viewpoint of p 
definition     if p is a  point  then tree p     p   if p is a    i point with         i
then
 
tree p   p 
ki tree p 
   point p   t  i t 

if  and   are k trees  p   and p       then we write    p         p    if there is a
sequence of k trees             l and functions f            fl  such that  a       f        fl 
l        b  fj  p    p for j  l    and fl   p     p  p     similarly     p  c       p   
if    p         p    and  a       cf        cfl  l      
we prove the following lemma  which extends a result by halpern et al         lemma

 point p    hc    t  i    such that    p         p    and tree   p    is consistent

proof  we proceed by induction on k  the case for k     is immediate using standard
arguments as tree p is just p  
assume that k     and       i for         we first prove part  a  for    ki      then
part  b   then the general case for  a   and finally  c  
as regards part  a  for    ki      note that tree p   t   ki      implies that
tree p  ki p i uki      t   i  
by the definition of k tree there is a    point p   such that t i t   let  be the
 k     tree consisting of all   points in  for      k     by the axiom kt  also
tree  p  ki p i uki      t   i   is consistent  and by part  c  there is a sequence             l
of  k     trees and points p            pl such that  i  pj  j for j  l   ii       p     
    p     iii   j   pj      j     pj     for j   l   iv  treej  pj  ki p i is consistent for
j   l   v  treel  pl  ki      t   i   is consistent 
again  by the definition of the relation   there is a sequence of  k    trees             m
and functions f            fm  such that  a           f        fm  m   l   moreover 
there are  k    points u            um such that u    p   um   pl   and for j   m  uj   pj   for
some j    j  and if uj   uj   then fj  uj     uj   while if uj    uj   then fj  uj      uj   uj     
we now show how to define the k tree  j extending j for j   m  by  iv  above
uj  ki p i is consistent for j   m  and we have that uj i p  so p   j   similarly 
um  ki t   i is consistent  so there exists p    hc    t  i such that p    m   further  we can
saturate each  j so that the conditions on k trees are satisfied and in particular        we
now show how to construct fj  for j   m  for each point s    hd    s  i   j   j there must
exist a point s   hd  si  j and an agent j    ag such that s j   s    from lemma    it
follows that there exists a sequence s  starting with s  that is j    concordant with fj  s  
moreover  we can take pj    p  for j   m     and pm     p  p     we define fj  such
that it agrees with fj on j   and for s    j   j we have fj   s      s   
notice that       by construction  if m     it follows immediately from the definition
that    p     m   p    and that treem  p   ki    is consistent  if m     we can easily
check that we have p    as t i t    since we also have t i t  it follows that t i t    we
define f so that f  u    u for every u    p and f  p     p  p     then    p  f    p    
since also p  p  we have    p       p    
the second part of  a  follows by a similar line of reasoning 
to prove part  b   by contradiction we assume that
 
  tree p  
tree   p 
     p      p       p    

v
then tree p        p      p       p     tree   p  is consistent  by temporal reasoning
there must be some point u such that
 
tree p   u 
tree   p   
    
     p      p       p    

w
is consistent  note that tree   p  is equivalent to p      point p    t i t    ki tree   p  
thus  the consistency of      implies that for each tree   such that    p         u  there

exists a    point p    hc    t  i such that t  i tu and

is consistent  by part  a 
vthere exists a k tree  and p   such that    p       p  
and tree  p u ki         p       p      tree   p    is consistent  but this means that

p   u  thus we have a contradiction  since tree  u  ki tree  p is inconsistent 
the general case for  a  follows from  b   part  c  also follows from  b  
the following lemma is the correspondent of lemma   for k trees 

lemma     if   l m is consistent with qkt m   then there exists an acceptable sequence
 of ad   trees of state candidates such that  belongs to the root of the first tree 
proof  as in lemma   the key part of this proof consists of showing that  given a finite
sequence   f        fl  l of d trees of points and a  point p   hc  ti  l such that
u    t  resp    t   by lemmas    and    we can extend the sequence of trees to
satisfy acceptability  specifically  suppose that u    t  let  include p and the    points
p    hc    t  i  l with       k       note that  is a k tree  further  by lemma    we
can find a sequence             n of k trees and points p            pn such that  i  pj  j for
j  n   ii       p         p    iii   j   pj      j     pj     for j   l   iv  treej  pj  
is consistent for j   l  and  v  treen  pl     is consistent  by using lemma    we can
extend this to a sequence of ad   trees starting with l that satisfies u   as in the proof
of lemma    a   for   t the argument is similar  since  is consistent  there must be
some tree  with root c such that   t for some t  c  we can then extend  as above to
complete the proof 
for any consistent   l m we define a quasimodel  for  to establish the completeness
of qkt m with respect to qis nl
m   let r consist of all acceptable  sequences compatible
with the ad   tree   while the function f is given by f r  k    ck if r is the acceptable
 sequence c    c           further  let o be the set of functions  associating every  r  n  
dom f  to a type  r  n   tr n such that conditions  a    b  and  c  given previously are
satisfied and the following holds 
 g  if  r  n  i  r    n    then either  r  n      i  r    n    or there exists k   n  such that
 r  n      i  r    k  and for all k     k   k    n  implies  r  n  i  r    k     
finally  for i  ag    o   r  n  i   r    n    iff  r  n  i  r    n    
as in the previous cases we have the following 
lemma     the set o of functions that satisfies conditions  a    b    c  and  g  is
non empty 
proof  conditions  a  and  b  are guaranteed by lemma   ii  and by the fact that r
is an acceptable  sequence respectively  as regards  c  and  g   assume that  r  n  is
a  type  t is a  i type and  r  n  i t  by using the proofs of lemmas    and    we can
find an acceptable  sequence r  compatible with the d tree  such that t  f r       and
 g  is satisfied 
we can now show the following lemma

lemma     the tuple hr  o   i   iag o   fi is a frame that satisfies no learning 
proof  by lemmas   i      and    the sets r and o are non empty  also  f satisfies
the conditions in definition     further  each i  is an equivalence relation by definition 
finally  the no learning condition is satisfied by definition of the functions in o 
lemma     the tuple hr  o   i   iag o   fi is a quasimodel  for  that satisfies no
learning and validates the formulas k and bf  
proof  by the previous lemma hr  o   i   iag o   fi is a frame satisfying no learning 
so we are left to prove that the functions in o are objects    conditions         on objects 
are safisfied by remarks  a   g  and the definition of i    furthermore  conditions         
and     on quasimodels  are satisfied by the definitions of r  f and i    as regards    
we use lemma    to show that it holds  finally      holds by lemma   ii  b    d    f  and
 h  and lemma     finally  q validates both k and bf   as all t  c  for all c  q  are
consistent with qktm  
this completes the proof for qkt m   thus  we obtain the following item in theorem

we need the following 
lemma     for  state candidate c    c  and  i state candidate c   there exists a  i state

p  ci p   then p   c p   and p  ci p    
proof  the proof is similar to lemma     if c   c  and c  i c   then there exist
t   c    t   c  and t    c   such that t   t  and t  i t     moreover  without loss of

generality  we can assume that for some c  con  tc   t con   tc   t con and t c

by adapting the proof of halpern et al         lemma       we can find a  i type t   such
that t  i t   and t    t     we define t   as the set of all such t   and t  con as the set of t c
  
clearly  c     ht     t  con i is a consistent  i state candidate such that c  i c     c    c    
and for c  con  p  ci p   and p   c p    
for systems including the axiom kt m we can define a synchronous version of the relation

definitions of sync   and c sync   are straightforward  we now state the following result 
which is a simplified version of lemma     the proof is analogous to that of lemma     in

specifically  if   lm is consistent with qktm by lemma    we can construct a syncacceptable sequence  of ad   trees such that  belongs to the root of the first tree  let r
be the set of all sync acceptable  sequences with suffixes that are compatible with   and
the function f is defined as in section      further  o is the set of all functions  associating
every  r  n   dom f  to a type  r  n   tr n that satisfies the conditions  a    b    c  
 f  and  h   finally  for i  ag    o   r  n  i   r    n    iff  r  n  i  r    n    and n   n   
by adapting the proof of lemma    by means of lemmas    and    we can show the
following result 

lemma     the set o of functions that satisfies conditions  a    b    c    f  and  h 
is non empty 
by lemmas   i      and    we obtain the following result 
lemma     the tuple hr  o   i   iag o   fi is a frame that satisfies perfect recall  no
learning and synchronicity 
finally  we state the following lemma whose proof follows the lines of the corresponding
proofs for qis pr sync
  qis nl sync
and lemma    
m
m
lemma     the tuple hr  o   i   iag o   fi is a quasimodel  for  that satisfies perfect
recall  no learning and synchronicity  and validates the formulas k and bf  
this completes the proof for qkt   
m   thus  we obtain the following item in theorem

we now show that the system qktm
is complete with respect to the classes qis nl sync uis

  the completeness result follows from next remark

iff it is valid in qis nl pr sync uis

the proof is a straightforward extension to first order of a result by halpern et al        
proposition        given this remark and the axiom kt  it is sufficient to prove the
completeness of qkt   
with respect to qis nl pr sync uis
  by the result in the previous
 
 
   
nl pr sync
section  qkt  is indeed complete with respect to qis  
  the desired result follows
by remark    thus  we obtain the following item in theorem   
   
theorem     completeness   the system qktm

   conclusions and further work
in this paper we investigated interaction axioms in the context of monodic first order
temporal epistemic logic  specifically  we explored classes of quantified interpreted systems
satisfying conditions such as synchronicity  no learning  perfect recall  and having a unique
initial state  the contribution of the article concerns the provably complete axiomatisation
of these classes 
the results presented extend previous contributions on first order epistemic and temporal logic with no interactions  e g   see belardinelli   lomuscio        sturm et al        
wolter   zakharyaschev         in a direction that was previously only explored at the
propositional level  halpern et al          our findings show that the characterisation
axioms considered at the propositional level can be extended to the first order monodic
setting 
while temporal epistemic logic in a first order context has so far mostly attracted theoretical contributions  there is evidence in the literature of it being increasingly embraced
in applications  for instance  there is an active interest in verifying artifact centric systems
against first order modal specifications  belardinelli  lomuscio    patrizi      a      b

given this  it remains of importance to investigate the questions pertaining to computational aspects of the formalisms introduced  including their decidability and the computational complexity of the satisfiability and model checking problems  work so far  including
belardinelli   lomuscio        hodkinson at al         wolter   zakharyaschev      
has focused on fragments where no interaction is present  but we know from the literature  halpern et al         that interactions can make these problems harder  we leave this
for further work  particularly in connection with the addition of other epistemic modalities
 e g   explicit and algorithmic knowledge  see halpern   pucella         or branching time
modalities  epistemic variants of branching time ctl are well understood at the propositional level  meyden   wong        but their first order extensions have not yet been
explored
