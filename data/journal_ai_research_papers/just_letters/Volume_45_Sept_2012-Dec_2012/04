paper focuses investigating state of the art chinese to spanish statistical machine
translation  smt   nowadays one popular approaches machine
translation  purpose  report details available parallel corpus
basic traveller expressions corpus  btec   holy bible united nations  un  
additionally  conduct experimental work largest three corpora
explore alternative smt strategies means using pivot language  three alternatives
considered pivoting  cascading  pseudo corpus triangulation  pivot language 
use either english  arabic french  results show that  phrase based smt system 
english best pivot language chinese spanish  propose system
output combination using pivot strategies capable outperforming direct
translation strategy  main objective work motivating involving

   introduction
chinese spanish distant languages many aspects  however  come close
together ranking spoken languages world  ethnologue        
web     era  content produced users  number native
speakers excellent indicator actual relevance machine translation two
languages  course  factors literacy  amount text published strength
commercial relationships taken account  factors actually

technologies chinese spanish  huge increase volume online contents
chinese last years  well steady increase commercial relationships
spanish speaking latin american countries china two basic examples

regarding fact english best pivot language task consideration  argue english might constitute better intermediate step
spanish chinese  rather french arabic  based assumption spanish
closer french  both romance languages derived latin  arabic  the
iberian peninsula occupied arabic culture     years  spanish
strong influence arabic  chinese french arabic  sense  english
seems represent optimal intermediate point chinese spanish 
translation complexity divided two phases  reordering burden resolved
chinese to english phase morphology generation burden resolved
english to spanish phase  thinking translation space non conservative field 
say english middle way chinese spanish 
passing french arabic implies larger path kind detour proximities spanish  conjecture  course  nicely explains
observing  definitively  research needed better understand happening 

   conclusions
work provided brief survey state of the art chinesespanish smt  first
all  language pair great interest economically culturally take
account high number chinese spanish speakers  besides  statistical machine
translation popular approach field mt given shown great
quality international evaluation campaigns nist        wmt        
main points covered study were 
mainly three chinesespanish parallel corpora  btec  holy bible un

fievaluating indirect strategies chinesespanish smt

english best pivot language conducting chinese to spanish translations
compared languages french arabic  system built using english
pivot significantly better ones built french arabic     
confidence comparisons 
preference pivot language appears correlated proposed
translation quality prediction metrics differences vocabulary sizes
amount reordering  according conclusion  best pivot language
english lowest increase vocabulary size lowest increase
reordering complexity 
significant difference found among best cascaded pseudo corpus pivot
approaches  pseudo corpus strategy best pivot strategy chineseto spanish  additionally  pseudo corpus cascaded approaches significantly
better triangulation approach 
output combination using mbr able improve direct system   bleu
point best case  improvement significantly better     confidence
coherent improvements evaluation metrics studied 
future research plan work problem automatically extracting parallel
corpus comparable corpora collected web  additionally  intend develop
freely available chinesespanish translation system would allow collecting user
feedback  then  work special techniques incorporate knowledge
