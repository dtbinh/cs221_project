abstract
we analyse the computational complexity of three problems in judgment aggregation 
    computing a collective judgment from a profile of individual judgments  the winner
determination problem       deciding whether a given agent can influence the outcome
of a judgment aggregation procedure in her favour by reporting insincere judgments  the
strategic manipulation problem   and     deciding whether a given judgment aggregation
scenario is guaranteed to result in a logically consistent outcome  independently from what
the judgments supplied by the individuals are  the problem of the safety of the agenda  
we provide results both for specific aggregation procedures  the quota rules  the premisebased procedure  and a distance based procedure  and for classes of aggregation procedures
characterised in terms of fundamental axioms 

   introduction
judgment aggregation  ja  is a branch of social choice theory that studies the properties
of procedures for amalgamating several agents individual judgments regarding the truth or
falsity of a set of inter related propositions into a collective judgment reflecting the views of
that group of agents as a whole  list   pettit        list   puppe         a by now classic
example is due to kornhauser and sager         suppose three judges have to decide on a
legal case involving a possible breach of contract  two relevant propositions are that there
really has been a binding contract rather than just an informal promise  proposition p  and
that the defendant broke her promise  proposition q   the defendant should be pronounced
guilty if the conjunction of these two propositions is found to be true  p  q   our judges
take the following views on the matter 
judge  
judge  
judge  
majority

p
yes
yes
no
yes

q
yes
no
yes
yes

pq
yes
no
no
no

note that the position of each individual judge is logically consistent  however  if we
aggregate this information using the majority rule  i e   if we accept a proposition if and
only if a strict majority of the judges do   then we arrive at a collective judgment set that
is inconsistent  this paradoxical outcome  variations of which are known as the doctrinal

paradox  kornhauser   sager        or the discursive dilemma  pettit         has inspired
an important and fast growing literature on ja  starting with the seminal contribution of
list and pettit         who showed that in fact no aggregation procedure satisfying certain
axioms encoding natural desiderata can avoid this kind of paradox 
the literature on ja has largely developed in outlets associated with philosophy  economic theory  political science  and logic  but recently ja has also come to be recognised
as being relevant to ai  particularly to the design and analysis of multiagent systems  the
reasons are clear  in a multiagent system  different autonomous software agents may have
different opinions on the same issues  maybe due to a difference in access to the relevant
information  or due to different reasoning capabilities   and some joint course of action
needs to be extracted from these diverse views  indeed  in ai  the related problem of belief
merging has been studied for some time  see  e g   konieczny   pino perez        maynardzhang   lehmann        chopra  ghose    meyer        everaere  konieczny    marquis 
       and there are interesting parallels between that literature and ja  pigozzi        
ja has also been found to be relevant to the analysis of abstract argumentation frameworks
widely studied in ai  caminada   pigozzi        rahwan   tohme        
given the relevance of ja to ai  it is important to understand its computational aspects 
however  to date  these have only received relatively little attention in the literature  this
can of course be explained by the origins of the field in law  economics  and philosophy 
in other domains of social choice  particularly voting and fair division  on the other hand 
the recent focus on computational aspects has been very successful and has given rise to the
field of computational social choice  chevaleyre  endriss  lang    maudet        brandt 
conitzer    endriss        
to help bridge this gap  in this paper we shall analyse the computational complexity of
three important problems that arise in ja 
 winner determination  the winner determination problem is the problem of computing the result of applying a given aggregation procedure to a given profile of individual judgment sets  it is of immediate practical relevance to all applications of ja  we
obtain both positive and negative results  for two types of aggregation procedures 
namely the quota rules and the premise based procedure  the winner determination
problem is easily seen to be polynomial  while for a certain distance based procedure
we obtain an interesting intractability result  establishing completeness for parallel
access to np that mirrors corresponding results in voting theory for the dodgson rule
 hemaspaandra  hemaspaandra    rothe         the young rule  rothe  spakowski 
  vogel        and the kemeny rule  hemaspaandra  spakowski    vogel        
 strategic manipulation  an agent may try to influence the result of aggregation
in her favour by reporting a set of judgments that is different from her truthfully held
beliefs  the manipulation problem asks  for a given aggregation procedure  a given
profile of judgment sets  and a given agent  whether that agent has the opportunity to
manipulate successfully in this situation  for one natural way of defining preferences
on top of the ja framework  namely in terms of the hamming distance  and for
aggregation procedures that are independent and monotonic  it is well known that
agents will never have an incentive to manipulate  dietrich   list      c   in other
cases  it is interesting to explore how hard it is to solve the manipulation problem  as
   

ficomplexity of judgment aggregation

high complexity might signal a certain level of immunity against manipulation  in the
context of voting  this kind of question has lead to a series of interesting and important
results  bartholdi  tovey    trick        faliszewski   procaccia         even if we
have to be careful not to over interpret theoretical intractability results as necessarily
providing protection in practice  walsh         for one widely used procedure  with
an easy winner determination problem   namely the premise based procedure  we are
able to show np completeness for the manipulation problem 
 safety of the agenda  the paradox presented above shows that for some aggregation procedures it is possible to obtain a collective judgment set that is logically
inconsistent  even though each of the judgment sets supplied by the individuals is
consistent  an important parameter determining the possibility of such a paradox is
the agenda  the set of propositions on which to pass judgment  for a given aggregation procedure  the problem of the safety of the agenda asks whether a given agenda
is safe in the sense that no profile of individual judgment sets that are consistent can
ever result in a collective judgment set that is inconsistent  for various classes of
aggregation procedures  defined in terms of classical axioms  we prove safety theorems
that fully characterise agendas that are safe in this sense and we relate our results
to known possibility theorems from the ja literature  list   puppe         we then
study the complexity of deciding whether a given agenda meets the safety conditions
identified and we find that this is typically a highly intractable problem located at
the second level of the polynomial hierarchy 
these results build on and extend our earlier work on the complexity of judgment aggregation  endriss  grandi    porello      a      b  
the remainder of this paper is organised as follows  in section   we introduce the formal
framework of ja  including several concrete aggregation procedures and the most important
axioms used to define desiderata for such procedures  section   also includes proofs of
some simple representation results that characterise aggregation procedures that satisfy
certain combinations of these axioms  section   is devoted to the study of the complexity
of the winner determination problem and section   does the same for the manipulation
problem  in section   we then introduce the problem of the safety of the agenda  prove
several agenda characterisation theorems establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for
safety  and finally study the complexity of deciding whether those conditions are satisfied 
section   reviews related work on computational aspects of ja and section   concludes
with a discussion of possible avenues for future work 
throughout this paper  we shall assume familiarity with the basics of complexity theory up to the notion of np completeness  helpful introductions include the textbooks by
papadimitriou        and arora and barak        

   the formal framework of judgment aggregation
in this section we provide a succinct exposition of the formal framework of ja  list  
puppe         which originally was laid down by list and pettit        and since then has
been further refined by a number of authors  notably dietrich         we also define three
concrete  families of  aggregation procedures and we discuss the most important axiomatic
   

fiendriss  grandi    porello

properties from the literature  finally  we prove a number of representation results  which
have the status of folk theorems in the ja literature and often play a crucial role in the
proofs of more complex results  but which have rarely been stated explicitly 
    notation and terminology
let l be a set of propositional formulas built from a finite set of propositional variables
using the usual connectives           and the constants   true  and   false  
for every formula   define  to be the complement of   i e       if  is not
negated  and     if     for some formula   we say that a set  is closed under
complementation if it is the case that    whenever    
definition    an agenda is a finite nonempty set   l that does not contain any
doubly negated formulas and that is closed under complementation 
that is  in a slight departure from the common definition in the literature  list   puppe 
       we allow for tautologies and contradictions in the agenda  the reason is that we want
to study the computational complexity of ja  and recognising a tautology or a contradiction
is itself a computationally intractable problem  we write   for the set of non negated
formulas in   i e                   
definition    a judgment set j for the agenda  is a subset j   
we call a judgment set j complete if   j or   j for all     we call it complementfree   if for all    it is not the case that both  and its complement are in j  and we
call it consistent if there exists an assignment that makes all formulas in j true  let j   
denote the set of all complete and consistent subsets of  
we shall occasionally interpret a judgment set j as a  characteristic  function j    
       with j       if   j and j       if    j  the hamming distance h j  j   
between two  complete and complement free  judgment sets j and j  is the number of
positive formulas on which they differ 
x
h j  j     
 j    j     
 

given a set n               n  of n     individuals  or agents   we write j    j            jn   
j   n for a generic profile of judgment sets  one for each individual   for ease of exposition 
we shall assume that n is odd  i e   n       we write nj    i  n     ji   for the set of
individuals accepting the formula  under profile j  
definition    a  resolute  judgment aggregation procedure for the agenda  and the
set of individuals n with n    n   is a function f   j   n     
   this property is called weak consistency by dietrich         and consistency by list and pettit        
our choice of terminology is intended to emphasise the fact that it is a purely syntactic notion  not
involving any model theoretic concept  a distinction we believe is worth stressing 
   in previous work we have used the more general notation j   n  i e   the set of functions from n to
j     for the set of admissible profiles  endriss et al       a   this is useful when n might be infinite
or when we do not necessarily want to associate the set of individuals with a set of natural numbers  but
we do not require this level of generality here 

   

ficomplexity of judgment aggregation

that is  an aggregation procedure maps any profile of individual  complete and consistent 
judgment sets to a single collective judgment set  an element of the powerset of    we
shall occasionally refer to the assumption of all individual judgment sets being complete
and consistent as individual rationality  note that the collective judgment set need not
be complete and consistent  that is  collective rationality need not hold   the kind of
procedure defined above is called resolute  because it will return a single judgment set for
any profile  later  we shall also discuss irresolute ja procedures  which may return a
nonempty set of judgment sets  that are tied for winning   finally  note that  since f is
defined on the set of all profiles of consistent and complete judgment sets  we are implicitly
making a universal domain assumption  which is sometimes stated as a separate property
 list   pettit        
    axiomatic properties
in definition   we did not put any constraints on the collective judgment set  the outcome
of the aggregation process  this is the role of the following definition 
definition    a judgment aggregation procedure f   defined on an agenda   is said to be 
 i  complete if f  j   is complete for every j  j   n  
 ii  complement free if f  j   is complement free for every j  j   n  
 iii  consistent if f  j   is consistent for every j  j   n  
we now present several axioms to provide a normative framework in which to state what
the desirable properties of an acceptable aggregation procedure should be  note that not
every procedure has to satisfy every axiom  rather  axioms model desiderata that some
procedures satisfy and others do not  the first axiom is a very basic requirement  restricting
possible aggregators f in terms of fundamental properties of the outcomes they produce 
weak rationality  wr   f is complete and complement free  
this condition differs from what has been called collective rationality in the literature on
ja  list   puppe         as we do not require the collective judgment set to be consistent 
the first reason not to include consistency in our most basic notion of rationality is that the
requirements of  wr  are purely syntactic notions that can easily be checked automatically 
which is not the case for consistency  the second reason is that consistency is not intrinsic
to the aggregation function  but rather depends on the properties of the agenda  this point
will be made more precise in section    where we will study the consistency of a class of
aggregators depending on the agenda 
the following are the most important axioms discussed in the literature on ja  list  
pettit        dietrich        list   puppe        nehring   puppe        
unanimity  u   if   ji for all agents i  n   then   f  j   
   in our previous work  endriss et al       a   we used a definition of weak rationality that in addition
to completeness and complement freeness also included the  very weak  technical requirement that no
contradictory formula should be universally accepted under all profiles  as a consequence  some of our
results later on are stated slightly differently 

   

fiendriss  grandi    porello

anonymity  a   for any profile j in j   n and any permutation    n  n   we have
f  j            jn     f  j              j n    
neutrality  n   for any two formulas    in the agenda  and any profile j in j   n  
if for all agents i  n we have that   ji    ji   then   f  j      f  j   
independence  i   for any formula  in the agenda  and any two profiles j   j  in
j   n   if   ji    ji for all agents i  n   then   f  j      f  j    
systematicity  s   for any two formulas    in the agenda  and any two profiles j  
j  in j   n   if   ji    ji for all agents i  n   then   f  j      f  j    
unanimity expresses the idea that if all individuals accept a given judgment  then so should
the collective   anonymity states that aggregation should be symmetric with respect to
individuals  i e   all individuals should be treated the same  neutrality is a symmetry
requirement for propositions  if the same subgroup accepts two propositions  then either
both or neither should be collectively accepted  independence says that if a proposition is
accepted by the same subgroup under two otherwise distinct profiles  then that proposition
should be accepted either under both or under neither profile  systematicity is satisfied if
and only if both neutrality and independence are  while all of these axioms are intuitively
appealing  they are stronger than they may seem at first  and several impossibility theorems 
establishing inconsistencies between certain combinations of axioms with other desiderata 
have been proved in the literature  the original impossibility theorem of list and pettit
        for instance  shows that  under certain assumptions regarding the agenda  there
can be no complete and consistent aggregation procedure satisfying  a  and  s  
a further important property is monotonicity  we introduce two different axioms for
monotonicity  the first is the one commonly used in the literature  dietrich   list      a 
list   puppe         it implicitly relies on the independence axiom  the second  introduced
in our previous work  endriss et al       a   is designed to be applied to neutral procedures 
for systematic procedures the two formulations are equivalent 
i monotonicity  mi    for any formula  in the agenda  and any two profiles j   j  in
j   n   if   ji    ji for all agents i  n   and for some s  n we have that
   js and   js   then   f  j      f  j    
n monotonicity  mn    for any two formulas    in the agenda  and any profile j
in j   n   if   ji    ji for all agents i  n and    js and   js for some
s  n   then   f  j      f  j   
that is   mi   expresses that if  is collectively accepted  in j   and receives additional
support  in j    from agent s   then it should continue to be collectively accepted  axiom
 mn   says that if  is collectively accepted and  is accepted by a strict superset of the
individuals accepting   then  should also be collectively accepted 
axioms can be used to define different classes of aggregation procedures  given an
agenda  and a list of desirable properties ax provided in the form of axioms  we define
f  ax  to be the set of all procedures f   j   n    that satisfy the axioms in ax 
   this notion of unanimity is stronger than another common formulation only requiring j    j          j  to
imply f  j     j  list   puppe         but the two are equivalent under the assumption of  i  

   

ficomplexity of judgment aggregation

    judgment aggregation procedures
next  we define three concrete types of aggregation procedures 
      uniform quota rules and the majority rule
an aggregation procedure f for n    n   individuals is a quota rule if for every formula 
there exists a quota q              n    such that   f  j   if and only if  nj     q   the
class of quota rules has been studied in depth by dietrich and list      a   in this paper 
we are interested in a particular class of quota rules 
definition    given some m              n    and an agenda   the uniform quota rule
with quota m is the aggregation procedure fm with   fm  j     nj     m 
an aggregation procedure satisfies  a    i    mi    and  n  if and only if it is a uniform quota
rule  this fact follows immediately from a result by dietrich and list      a   who use a
slightly more narrow definition of quota rule  provided m    n      the uniform quota rule
fm also satisfies  u  
a quota rule of special interest is the majority rule  the majority rule is the uniform
quota rule with m   n  
    it accepts a formula whenever there are more individuals accepting
it than there are rejecting it  recall that we did assume n to be odd   clearly  the majority
rule is the only uniform quota rule that satisfies  wr  
      the premise based procedure
as we have seen in the introduction  the majority rule may fail to produce a consistent
outcome  two basic aggregation procedures that can be set up in a way so as to avoid
this problem have been discussed in the ja literature from the very beginning  namely
the premise based and the conclusion based procedure  kornhauser   sager        dietrich
  mongin         the basic idea is to divide the agenda into premises and conclusions 
under the premise based procedure  we apply the majority rule to the premises and then
infer which conclusions to accept given the collective judgments regarding the premises  
under the conclusion based procedure we directly ask the agents for their judgments on the
conclusions and leave the premises unspecified in the collective judgment set  that is  the
conclusion based procedure does not result in complete outcomes  indeed  strictly speaking 
it does not conform to definition     and we shall not consider it here  the premise based
procedure  on the other hand  can be set up in a way that guarantees consistent and complete
outcomes  which provides a usable procedure of some practical interest 
for many ja problems  it may be natural to divide the agenda into premises and
conclusions  let    p  c be an agenda divided into a set of premises p and a set of
conclusions c   each of which is closed under complementation 

   this is what is commonly understood by premise based procedure  dietrich and mongin         who
call this rule premise based majority voting  have also investigated a more general class of premise based
procedures in which the procedure used to decide upon the premises need not be the majority rule 

   

fiendriss  grandi    porello

definition    the premise based procedure pbp for p and c is the function mapping
each profile j    j            jn    j   n to the following judgment set 
pbp j          c         
where       p    nj    

n  
 
 

that is   is the set of premises accepted by a  strict  majority  and the pbp will return
this set  together with those conclusions  that logically follow from         
if we want to ensure that the pbp always returns judgment sets that are consistent and
complete  then we have to impose certain restrictions 
 if we want to guarantee consistency  then we have to impose restrictions on the
premises  it is well known that the majority rule is guaranteed to be consistent if
and only if the agenda  satisfies the so called median property  i e   if every inconsistent subset of  has itself an inconsistent subset of size      nehring   puppe       
list   puppe          this result immediately transfers to the pbp  it is consistent
if and only if the set of premises satisfies the median property 
 if we want to guarantee completeness  then we have to impose restrictions on the
conclusions  for any assignment of truth values to the premises  the truth value of
each conclusion has to be fully determined 
we shall see in section   that deciding whether a set of formulas satisfies the median
property is highly intractable  that is  in its most general form  deciding whether the
pbp is a consistent aggregation procedure for a given agenda is a complex problem  for a
meaningful analysis  we therefore make two additional assumptions  first  we assume that
the agenda  is closed under propositional variables  p   for any propositional variable p
occurring within any of the formulas in   second  we equate the set of premises with the
set of literals  clearly  the above mentioned conditions for consistency and completeness
are satisfied under these assumptions 
so  to summarise  the instance of the pbp we shall work with in this paper is defined as
follows  under the assumption that the agenda is closed under propositional variables  the
pbp accepts a literal  if and only if more individuals accept  than do accept   and the
pbp accepts a compound formula if and only if it is entailed by the accepted literals  for
consistent and complete input profiles  and assuming that n is odd  this leads to a resolute
ja procedure that is consistent and complete  on the downside  the pbp violates most of
the standard axioms typically considered  such as  n  and  i   it even violates  u  
agent  
agent

pbp

p
yes
no
no
no

q
no
yes
no
no

r
no
no
yes
no

pqr
yes
yes
yes
no

in this example  all three agents unanimously accept p  q  r  but when we aggregate using
the pbp  then we end up rejecting p  q  r  because each of the three premises is rejected 
   we shall discuss this result in detail in section   

   

ficomplexity of judgment aggregation

      the distance based procedure
the basic idea of a distance based approach to aggregation is to select an outcome that  in
some sense  minimises the distance to the input profile  this idea has been used extensively
in both preference aggregation  kemeny        and belief merging  konieczny   pino perez 
       the first example of a ja procedure based on a notion of distance was introduced
by pigozzi         albeit under the restrictive assumption that the agenda is closed under
propositional variables and that each compound formula will either be unanimously accepted
or unanimously rejected by all agents  most importantly  in pigozzis approach the syntactic
information contained in the agenda was discarded by moving the aggregation from the
level of formulas to the level of models  a syntactic variant of this procedure has later been
defined by miller and osherson         which these authors call the prototype hamming
rule  this is the distance based procedure we shall define and analyse here  it is an irresolute
procedure  returning a  nonempty  set of collective judgment sets 
definition    given an agenda   the distance based procedure dbp is the function
mapping each profile j    j            jn    j   n to the following set of judgment sets 
dbp j     argmin

x

h j  ji  

jj    in

a collective judgment set under the dbp minimises the amount of disagreement with the
individual judgment sets  i e   it minimises the sum of the hamming distances with all
individual judgment sets   note that in cases where the majority rule leads to a consistent
outcome  the outcome of the dbp coincides with that of the majority rule  making it a
resolute procedure over these profiles   we can combine the dbp with a tie breaking rule
to obtain a resolute procedure 
the dbp is complete and consistent by design  only judgment sets in j    are considered candidates when searching for a solution  however  it violates most of the standard
axiomatic properties when those are adapted to the case of irresolute ja procedures  lang 
pigozzi  slavkovik    van der torre         in particular  the dbp is not independent  indeed  it is based on the very idea that correlations between propositions should be exploited
rather than neglected 
    representation results
we now prove a number of representation results that characterise the aggregation procedures that satisfy certain combinations of axioms  all of the results in this section are
known results  butdespite being very usefulthey have rarely been stated explicitly in
the literature 
observe that an aggregation procedure f satisfies  i  if and only if there exists a family
of sets of winning coalitions w   n   one for each formula     such that   f  j   
nj  w   imposing additional axioms  on top of  i   forces some additional structure onto
the family of winning coalitions 
 f satisfies  i  and  u  if and only if the grand coalition belongs to every set of winning
coalitions  n  w  
   

fiendriss  grandi    porello

 f satisfies  i  and  n   i e   it satisfies  s   if and only if there exists a single set of
winning coalitions w   n such that   f  j    nj  w 
 f satisfies  i  and  a  if and only if collective acceptance of a formula only depends
on the number of individuals accepting it  c  w and  c     c    imply c   w  
one consequence of the latter two insights is that  if f satisfies  a  and  s   then

 nj      nj   implies   f  j      f  j     this is a well known fact  list and pettit
        for instance  use it in the proof of their impossibility theorem  for the special case
of j   j     note that a  somewhat surprising  consequence of this fact is that  in case n
is even  there exists no aggregation procedure that satisfies  a    s   as well as  wr   to
see this  it suffices to consider a  single  profile j where exactly n  agents accept  and n 
j    i e   either both  and  must be in f  j    contraagents accept   then  nj      n
dicting complement freeness  or neither  nor  must be in f  j    this time contradicting
completeness  we emphasise that this basic impossibility result does not involve any notion
of logical consistency 
on the other hand  when n is odd  which we shall continue to assume   then these
axioms characterise a relevant class of aggregation procedures 
proposition    f  f  wr  a  s  if and only if there exists a function h               n  
       satisfying h i       h n  i  for all i  n such that   f  j    h  nj        


proof  we have already seen that when f satisfies  s  and  a   then  nj      nj   implies
  f       f  j     the latter is equivalent to the existence of a function h  
            n          with   f  j    h  nj         the additional requirement of h i   
   h n  i  then is a consequence of  wr   the other direction is immediate  as acceptance
of a formula under f only depends on the number of agents accepting it  f must be
anonymous  neutral and independent  the condition h i       h n  i  furthermore ensures
completeness and complement freeness 
dropping either neutrality or independence  we obtain the following representation results 
proposition    f  f  wr  a  i  if and only if there exists a function h               n  
       for every formula    satisfying h  i       h  n  i  for all i  n such that
  f  j    h   nj        
proof  as is clear from our characterisation of procedures satisfying  i  and  a  in terms
of winning coalitions given above  for such a procedure we can always decide whether 
should be collectively accepted by only looking at the cardinality of the coalition accepting
  the rest of the proof proceeds just as for proposition   
proposition    f  f  wr  a  n  if and only if there exists a function hj               n  
       for every profile j  j   n satisfying hj  i       hj  n  i  for all i  n such that
  f  j    hj   nj        
proof  when we drop  i   then winning coalitions are not anymore associated with formulas 
but depend on the profile j we are in   n  merely ensures that those winning coalitions do
not also depend on the formula in question   wr  again forces the symmetry requirement
hj  i       hj  n  i   the opposite direction is once again immediate 
   

ficomplexity of judgment aggregation

for each of the three representation results above  if we add  u  to the list of axioms  then
this corresponds to requiring h n      for each of the characteristic functions h 
finally  recall that we have seen in section        that f  f  a  s  mi   if and only if
f is a uniform quota rule and that f  f  wr  a  s  mi   if and only if f is the majority
rule  that is  the representation results stated above all concern natural weakenings of
the combination of axioms characterising the majority rule  in particular  we chose never
to drop the anonymity axiom  because we find it very appealing and uncontroversial for
ja  we also consider unanimity and weak rationality very fundamental  although we make
exceptions for the class of quota rules   the independence and neutrality axioms  on the
other hand  are much more debatable  which is why we have considered the various options
of either including and not including them  although we always keep at least one of them 
to maintain a minimal amount of structure   that is  the classes of aggregation procedures
covered by the representation results above are all very natural to focus on 

   winner determination
in this section we define the problem of winner determination of a given ja procedure as a
decision problem  and we study the computational complexity of this problem for each of
the procedures presented in section     
    problem definition
the problem of winner determination in voting theory is that of computing the election
winner given a profile of preferences supplied by the voters  the corresponding decision
problem asks  given a preference profile and a candidate  whether the given candidate is
the winner of the election  in ja  we want to compute f  j   for a given profile j   for a
resolute aggregation procedure f   we can formulate a corresponding decision problem by
asking  for a given formula  whether it belongs to f  j   
windet f  
instance  agenda   profile j  j   n   formula    
question  is  an element of f  j   
by solving windet once for each formula in the agenda  we can compute the collective
judgment set from an input profile  note that asking instead whether a given judgment set
j  is equal to f  j   does not lead to an appropriate formulation of the winner determination
problem  because to actually compute the winner we would then have to solve our decision
problem an exponential number of times  once for each possible j    
for the case of irresolute ja procedures f we can adapt the winner determination
problem in the following way 
windet  f  
instance  agenda   profile j  j   n   subset l   
question  is there a j    with l  j  such that j   f  j   
to see that this is an appropriate formulation of a decision problem corresponding to the
task of computing some winning set  note that we can compute a winner using a polynomial
   

fiendriss  grandi    porello

number of queries to windet as follows  first  ask whether there exists a winning set
including an arbitrarily chosen first formula of the agenda     i e   l         in case the
answer is positive  consider a second formula   and query windet with l            
use subset l            in case of a negative answer  continue this process until all
formulas in the agenda have been covered  
    winner determination for quota rules and the premise based procedure
it is immediately clear that winner determination is a polynomial problem for any quota
rule  including the majority rule 
fact    windet fm   is in p for any uniform quota rule fm  
winner determination is also tractable for the premise based procedure 
proposition    windet pbp  is in p 
proof  counting the number of agents accepting each of the premises and checking for each
premise whether the positive or the negative instance has the majority is easy  this determines the collective judgment set as far as the premises are concerned  deciding whether
a given conclusion should be accepted by the collective now amounts to a model checking
problem  is the conclusion  true in the model induced by the accepted premises literals   
which can also be done in polynomial time 
    winner determination for the distance based procedure
we now want to analyse the complexity of the winner determination problem for the
distance based procedure  as the dbp is irresolute  we study the decision problem
windet   as we shall see  windet  dbp  is p   complete  thus showing that this rule
is very hard to compute  the class p   also known as p   o log n    pnp log  or pnp
     is
the class of problems that can be solved in polynomial time asking a logarithmic number
of queries to an np oracle or  equivalently  that can be solved in polynomial time asking
a polynomial number of such queries in parallel  wagner        hemachandra         to
obtain our result  we first have to devise an np oracle that will then be used in the proof
of p   membership  we shall use the following problem 
windetk  dbp 
instance  agenda   profile j  j   n   subset l    p
k  n 
question  is there a j   j    with l  j  such that in h j    ji     k 
that is  we ask whether there exists a judgment set j  with a hamming distance to the
profile of at most k that accepts all the formulas in l  in other words  rather than aiming at
computing a winning judgment set  this problem merely allows us to compute a judgment set
   in line with recent work by hemaspaandra  hemaspaandra  and menton         we can therefore argue
that our formulation of the winner determination problem is the correct decision problem associated
with the search problem of actually computing a winning judgment set 

   

ficomplexity of judgment aggregation

of a certain minimal quality  where quality is measured in terms of the hamming distance  
we now show that this problem lies in np  
lemma    windetk  dbp  is in np 
proof  we show that windetk  dbp  can be modelled as an integer program  without
objective function   this proves membership in np  papadimitriou         suppose we
want to answer an instance of windetk  dbp   the number of subformulas of propositions
occurring in the agenda  is linear in the size  not cardinality  of   we introduce a binary
decision variable for each of these subformulas  xi         for the ith subformula 
we first write constraints that ensure that the chosen outcome will correspond to a
consistent judgment set  i e   that j   j      note that we can rewrite any formula in
terms of negation  conjunction  and bi implication without resulting in a superpolynomial
 or even superlinear  increase in size  so we only need to show how to encode the constraints
for these connectives  the following table indicates how to write these constraints 
     
x       x 
         x    x  and x    x  and x    x    x     
         x    x    x      and x    x    x     
and x    x    x      and     x    x    x

in the definition of windetk  dbp

we will need to bound this sum from above  now suppose that variables xi with indices
i              m  with m      are those that correspond to the propositions that are elements
of   let ai    nji   be the number of individuals that accept the ith proposition in 
 under j    to compute a winner under the dbp  we need to find a consistent judgment
set j   characterised by variables x            xm   that minimises the sum  n  x   a          
 n  xm  am    we do this by introducing an additional set of integer variables yi     for
i              m  we can ensure that yi    n  xi  ai   by adding the following constraints  
 i   m 
 i   m 

n  x i  a i   yi
a i  n  x i   yi

   our proof not only establishes membership in np  but also suggests how to implement a solver for this
difficult problem  as pointed out by one anonymous reviewer  it is also possible to prove np membership
more directly  using a certificate that consists of both j  and a satisfying assignment for j   
   to be precise  these constraints only ensure  n  xi  ai     yi   however  our next constraint will force the
yi to be minimal

now the sum     m
i   yi corresponds to the hamming distance between the winning set
and the profile  to ensure it does not exceed k  we can add the following constraint 
m
  x
yi   k

 
i  

finally  we need to ensure that all the formulas in the set l   get accepted  we do this
by adding one last set of constraints 
 for all i such that i  l 

xi    

now  by construction  the integer program we have presented is feasible if and only if the
instance of windetk  dbp  we have started out with should be answered in the positive 
this completes the proof 
to obtain an upper bound for the winner determination problem for the dbp  we can now
use a standard construction  this first involves identifying the best value for k  and then
deciding windetk  dbp  for that value of k  the latter can be done with a logarithmic
number of queries to the problem the complexity of which we have analysed in lemma   
together  this yields the desired upper bound 
lemma    windet  dbp  is in p   
proof  the problem windet  dbp  asks whether there exists a winning judgment set
that accepts all formulas in a given subset l    since the hamming distance between
a judgment set and a profile is bounded from above by a polynomial figure  we can solve
this problem by performing a binary search over k using a logarithmic number of queries
to windetk  dbp  
p
more precisely  since in h j    ji      k      
    n    a figure that is polynomial
in the size of the problem description  we can ask a first query to windetk  dbp  with

k   k  and an empty subset of designated formulas  in case of a positive answer  we

can continue the search with a new k   k    otherwise we move to the higher half of the
interval querying windetk  dbp  with k       k    this process ends after a logarithmic
number of steps  providing the exact hamming distance k w of a winning candidate from
the profile j under consideration  it is now sufficient to run the problem windetk  dbp 
with k   k w and subset l as in the original instance of windet  dbp  we wanted to
solve  in case the answer is positive  since there cannot be a winning judgment set with
hamming distance strictly less than k w   one of the winning judgment sets contains all
formulas in l  on the other hand  in case of a negative answer all judgment sets containing
l have hamming distance bigger than k w   and thus cannot belong to the winning set 
next  we show that the upper bound established by lemma   is tight  we exploit the
similarity of the dbp to the kemeny rule in preference aggregation to build on a known
p   hardness result by hemaspaandra et al         
lemma    windet  dbp  is p   hard 
   

ficomplexity of judgment aggregation

proof  we build a reduction from the problem kemeny winner  as defined in the work of
hemaspaandra et al            an instance of this problem consists of a set of candidates c 
a profile of linear preference orders p    p            pn   over c  and a designated candidate c 
c  define the kemeny score of c as the following expression 
p
kemenyscore c  p     min  ni   dist pi   q    q is a linear order with top q    c 
here  dist pi   q  is the hamming distance between two linear orders  defined as the number
of ordered pairs of candidates on which they disagree  and top q  is the most preferred
candidate under preference order q  kemeny winner asks whether the kemeny score of
c is less than or equal to the kemeny score of all other candidates d  c 
we now build an instance of windet  dbp  to decide this problem  define an agenda
c in the following way  first  add propositional variables pab for all ordered pairs of
distinct candidates a  b in c  these variables can encode a linear order over c as a binary
relation  where pab stands for a  b   now we can describe the properties of a linear order
by means of formulas of the form pab  pbc  pac and pab  pba   we include all of these
formulas  for all a  b  c  c  in c   in fact  we include m      syntactic variants  where
m    c   for each of them    the figure m      is chosen to be higher than the maximal
hamming distance between any two linear orders  which is m    
given a preference profile p   we can build a judgment profile j p by encoding each
order pi over c in a judgment set jip over c   for example  if agent  s preference order
is a  b  c  then j p will include the set  pab   pba   pbc   pcb   pac   pca    in addition  each
jip will include all of the syntactic copies of all of the formulas encoding linear orders 
observe that we have dist pi   pj     h jip   jjp   by construction  it is therefore sufficient
to ask a query to windet  dbp  using c as the agenda  j p as the profile  and l  
 pcd   d  c  c    d  as the set of propositions to accept for sure  to obtain an answer to
the initial kemeny winner instance with designated candidate c  if the winning ranking
features c as the top candidates  i e   formulas pcd are accepted for all other candidates d  
then its kemeny score will be lower than or equal to that of all other candidates  providing
a positive answer to the original problem  a key insight here is to notice that judgment
sets encoding relations that are not linear orders will not be considered in the minimisation
process  since every disagreement on one of the formulas encoding linear orders will cause
a much greater loss in the hamming distance than what can be gained by modifying the
variables encoding the individual candidate rankings 
putting lemma   and   together yields a complete characterisation of the complexity of
winner determination under distance based aggregation 
theorem    windet  dbp  is p   complete 
theorem   shows that the dbp is highly intractable  however  by adapting efficient heuristics developed for the kemeny rule  which  as seen in the proof of lemma    is closely related
to the dbp  it may be possible to obtain an implementation of the dbp that achieves an
acceptable performance in practice  conitzer  davenport    kalagnanam        
    hemaspaandra et al         work with preferences that are weak orders  but point out that their results
remain valid when linear orders are used instead  to simplify presentation  we work with linear orders 
    for instance  for the formula  we might use the syntactic variants             and so forth

   strategic manipulation
in the context of voting  an agent is said to be able to manipulate a voting rule when there
exists a situation in which voting in a manner that does not truthfully reflect her preferences
will result in an outcome that she prefers to the outcome that would be realised if she were
to vote truthfully  gaertner         what would constitute an appropriate definition of
manipulation in the context of ja is not immediately clear  because in ja there is no
notion of preference  however  by fixing a suitable notion of closeness on judgment sets 
it is possible to build a preference ordering starting from an individuals initial judgment
set  this is the approach followed by dietrich and list      c  for ja and by everaere
et al         in the related setting of belief merging  it builds on the assumption that an
agents individual judgment set is also her most preferred outcome and amongst any two
outcomes she will prefer the one that is closer to that most preferred outcome  we will
measure closeness using the hamming distance and we will call an aggregation procedure
f manipulable if it permits a situation where an agent can change the outcome to get closer
to her truthful judgment by reporting untruthfully 
our main interest will be the computational complexity of deciding whether a given
agent can successfully manipulate under a given profile  in this context  a result showing
that manipulation is computationally intractable would count as a positive result  specifically  we will study this problem for the premise based procedure  we will not do so for
the family of quota rules  because  as we shall see  it is impossible to manipulate a quota
rule in the aforementioned sense  we will also not study the manipulation problem for
the distance based procedure  because  as we have seen  even the much more basic winner
determination problem already is intractable for this procedure 
    problem definition
we first need to define a preference ordering over judgment sets for each agent i  n  
in principle  there are any number of ways of doing this  but one reasonable approach is
to assume that agent is judgment set ji is also her most preferred outcome and that her
preferences over other outcomes depend on how close they are to ji  dietrich   list      c  
we shall measure closeness using the hamming distance  but other distances could also be
used to this end  duddy   piggins         so we will say that agent i prefers j to j  if
and only if h ji   j    h ji   j    
below we employ standard game theoretical notation and denote by  j i   ji   the profile
that is like j   except that the judgment set of agent i has been replaced by ji  
definition    f is manipulable at profile j  j   n by agent i  n   if there exists an
alternative judgment set ji  j    such that h ji   f  j i   ji      h ji   f  j    
that is  by reporting ji rather than her truthful judgment set ji   agent i can achieve the
outcome f  j i   ji   and that outcome is closer  in terms of the hamming distance  to her
truthful  and most preferred  set ji than the outcome f  j   that would get realised if she
were to truthfully report ji   a procedure that is not manipulable at any profile by any
agent is called strategy proof 
dietrich and list      c  have shown that a ja procedure is strategy proof if and only if
it satisfies  i  and  mi    indeed  this follows immediately from our definitions  independence
   

ficomplexity of judgment aggregation

means that the would be manipulator can consider one proposition at a time  monotonicity
then means that it is always in her best interest to drive up the support for formulas in her
judgment set and to reduce the support for those not in her judgment set  i e   it is in her
best interest to report her judgment set truthfully   
for aggregation procedures for which strategy proofness cannot be guaranteed  we want
to study the algorithmic problem of computing a manipulating judgment set  to this end 
we formulate manipulation as a decision problem for an aggregation procedure f  
manip f  
instance 
question 

agenda   profile j  j   n   agent i  n  
is there a ji  j    such that h ji   f  j i   ji      h ji   f  j    

note that we are asking whether an agent can manipulate successfully  rather than how 
that is  this problem does not immediately correspond to the practical  and potentially
harder  problem of computing an actual strategy for the manipulator  however  since the
interest here is in obtaining intractability results  to provide protection against manipulation   we can safely concentrate on this formulation  which provides a lower bound for the
corresponding search problem 
as we have seen  the uniform quota rules  including the majority rule  are all independent and monotonic  which means that they are also strategy proof  so the algorithmic
problem of deciding manip does not arise for these procedures   of course  this comes at
the price of not always producing outcomes that are consistent 
    strategic manipulation under the premise based procedure
we now prove that manipulating the premise based procedure is intractable  thus showing the existence of the kind of a jump in computational complexity between winner
determination and manipulation that is desirable in this context 
theorem     manip pbp  is np complete 
proof  we first establish np membership  an untruthful judgment set ji yielding a preferred outcome can serve as a certificate  checking the validity of such a certificate means
checking that  a  ji is actually a complete and consistent judgment set and that  b  the
outcome produced by ji is better than the outcome produced by the truthful set ji   as
for  a   checking completeness is easy  consistency can also be decided in polynomial time 
for every propositional variable p in the agenda  ji must include either p or p  this admits
only a single possible model  all that remains to be done is checking that all compound
formulas in ji are satisfied by that model    as for  b   we need to compute the outcomes
for ji and ji  by proposition    this is polynomial   compute their hamming distances from
ji   and compare those two distances 
next  we prove np hardness by reducing sat to manip pbp   suppose we are given
a propositional formula  and want to check whether it is satisfiable  we will build a
    note that this does not contradict the gibbard satterthwaite theorem in voting theory  gaertner 
       that theorem involves a universal domain assumption  while the manner in which we are using
the hamming distance to induce preferences from judgment sets amounts to a domain restriction 
    that is  at this point we crucially rely on our assumption that the pbp is only defined for agendas that
are closed under propositional variables

the judgments of agents   and   regarding q      q    are irrelevant for our argument  so
they are indicated as   in the table  but note that they can be determined in polynomial
time  in particular  j   q      q         for any   
if agent   reports her judgment set truthfully  as shown in the table   then the hamming
distance between j  and the collective judgment set will be      m        m      note that
agent   is decisive about all propositional variables  i e   premises  except for q   which will
certainly get rejected   now 
 if  is satisfiable  then agent   can report judgments regarding p            pm that correspond to a satisfying assignment for   if she furthermore accepts q    then all m    
copies of q      q    will get accepted in the collective judgment set  thus  the
hamming distance from j  to this new outcome will be at most m      i e   agent  
will have manipulated successfully 
 if  is not satisfiable  then there is no way to get any of the m   copies of q   q   
accepted  and q  will get rejected in any case   thus  agent   has no means of
improving over the hamming distance of m     she can guarantee for herself by
reporting truthfully 
hence   is satisfiable if and only if agent   can manipulate successfully  and our reduction
from sat to manip pbp  is complete 
thus  manipulating the pbp is significantly harder than using it  at least in terms of worstcase complexity  and under the assumption that p    np  

   safety of the agenda
in this section  we introduce the concept of safety of the agenda  an agenda  is safe
for a given aggregation procedure f   if the collective judgment set returned by f will be
consistent for any  consistent  input profile  of course  this question is only relevant for
aggregation procedures that are not always consistent to begin with  which is why we do
not consider the pbp and the dbp in this section  in fact  our main interest will be in
the safety of the agenda for entire classes of aggregation procedures  characterised by a set
   

ficomplexity of judgment aggregation

of axioms ax   is safe for a class f  ax  of aggregation procedures if it is safe for every
procedure f  f  ax  
after defining the problem and relating it to so called agenda characterisation results  or
possibility theorems  as we shall call them  studied in the ja literature  we characterise safe
agendas for a number of natural combinations of axioms and we establish the computational
complexity of checking the safety of an agenda for these cases 
    problem definition
when performing an aggregation of judgments  we would like to avoid paradoxical outcomes 
i e   we would like to ensure that the collective judgment set will be consistent  whether or
not this will indeed be the case depends on several factors  the aggregation procedure  the
agenda  and the individual judgment sets  we cannot control what choices the individuals
will make  we might not even know what aggregation procedure exactly they are going
to use  we might only know about some of its properties  i e   we might only know that it
belongs to a certain class of procedures  can we nevertheless guarantee that the collective
judgment set will be consistent  we formalise this question as follows 
definition    an agenda  is safe with respect to a class of aggregation procedures f  if
every procedure in f is consistent when applied to profiles of judgment sets over  
the example for a paradox presented in the introduction demonstrates the unsafety of the
agenda  p  p  q  q  p  q   p  q   with respect to the majority rule  the agenda  p  p  
on the other hand  is immediately seen to be safe with respect to the full class of all weakly
rational aggregation procedures 
the question of whether an agenda is safe is closely related to the rich literature on socalled agenda characterisation results  see  e g   nehring   puppe        dokow   holzman 
      dietrich   list      b  list   puppe         these authors have asked the following
kind of question  for a given agenda and a given list of axiomatic requirements  always
including the requirement of consistency   is it possible to find an aggregation procedure
that meets those requirements on that agenda  we may rephrase this question as follows 
given an agenda  and a list of axioms ax  now excluding consistency   is it possible to
find a procedure in f  ax  that is consistent  to distinguish results of this kind from our
safety theorems below  which are also agenda characterisations of a kind   we shall refer to
them as possibility theorems  to summarise  while a possibility theorem shows that there
is some consistent procedure in f  ax   a safety theorem shows that all procedures in
f  ax  are consistent 
note that in case a class of aggregation procedures consists of just a single aggregation
procedure  e g   f  wr  a  s  mi   consists only of the majority rule   possibility and safety
results coincide 
possibility theorems are important from the point of view of the mechanism designer 
given certain axioms that i would like to see satisfied  is it still possible to design an
aggregation procedure meeting them once i know certain characteristics of the kind of
agenda on which the procedure should be used  that is  this is a question we are likely to
ask in an off line situation and only once  safety theorems  on the other hand  are more
likely to play a role in an on line situation and they arguably are of particular interest
   

fiendriss  grandi    porello

for applications  the reason is that actual users are more likely to want an assurance that
aggregation will be consistent  provided certain axioms are satisfied and the agenda has
certain properties  rather than to learn that there exists a consistent form of aggregation
 satisfying certain axioms   for instance  suppose we want to give certain guarantees for
the quality of operations of a multiagent system  but without full knowledge of the precise
specification of every individual agent and without full knowledge of all the interaction
protocols they are going to employ  we might nevertheless have sufficient information for a
safety theorem to apply  in which case we can check  for a given agenda  whether consistency
can be guaranteed  that is  deciding whether safety holds is a question we might have
to answer again and again  for many different agendas  this is why the computational
complexity of this problem is a relevant question 
    agenda properties
as we shall see  if an agenda satisfies certain structural properties  then that might be a
sufficient condition to ensure safety with respect to certain aggregation rules  it turns out
that the types of agenda properties that are of help here are similar to those that feature in
known possibility theorems  specifically  we shall make use of the so called median property 
introduced by nehring and puppe          
definition     we say that an agenda  satisfies the median property  mp   if every
inconsistent subset of  has itself an inconsistent subset of size at most   
in other words   satisfies the mp if it has no minimally inconsistent subset  mi subset 
with more than   elements  note that in case  is known not to include any tautologies
 and thus no contradictions   this definition simplifies to requiring that any mi subset must
be exactly of size    we can generalise the median property as follows 
definition     let k      an agenda  satisfies the k median property  kmp   if every
inconsistent subset of  has itself an inconsistent subset of size at most k 
that is  the mp and the  mp are the same property  agendas satisfying the mp are already
quite simple  but the restriction can be made tighter by requiring all inconsistent subsets to
have a particular form  in the sequel  we call an inconsistent set  nontrivially inconsistent
if it does not contain any single formula that is a contradiction 
definition     an agenda  satisfies the simplified median property  smp   if every
nontrivially inconsistent subset of  has a subset of the form      with  being logically
equivalent to  
a further simplification yields 
definition     an agenda  satisfies the syntactic simplified median property
 ssmp   if every nontrivially inconsistent subset of  has a subset of the form      
    the name median property derives from the work of nehring and puppe         who analyse social
choice functions for a class of vector spaces called median spaces 

   

ficomplexity of judgment aggregation

agendas satisfying the ssmp are composed of uncorrelated formulas  i e   they are essentially equivalent to agendas composed of atoms alone  the smp is less restrictive  allowing
for logically equivalent but syntactically different formulas 
observe that every agenda that satisfies the smp also satisfies the mp  the converse
is not true      p  p  p  q   p  q   satisfies the mp  but not the smp  similarly  every
agenda that satisfies the ssmp also satisfies the smp  again  the converse is not true 
    p  p  p  p   p  p   satisfies the smp  but not the ssmp 
    safety theorems  linking agenda properties and axioms
we now prove several characterisation results for the safe aggregation of judgments  concentrating on classes of procedures defined by weakening the axiomatisation of the majority
rule  we begin with a safety theorem for the majority rule itself  in fact  this result is
familiar from the literature  nehring   puppe         although it is presented there in a
different form  despite the fact that it is a known result  we still provide a proof  which
arguably is simpler than translating the result of nehring and puppe into our setting 
theorem     an agenda  is safe for the majority rule if and only if  satisfies the mp 
proof  let f be the majority rule 
   first  suppose  satisfies the mp  we need to show that f  j   is consistent for
any j  j   n   for the sake of contradiction  suppose it is not  and let  be a mi subset
of f  j    as f  j       can have at most   elements  clearly  it cannot be the case
that f  j   includes a contradiction    as that would mean that a majority of the agents
would have accepted    hence   must be a set of exactly two formulas  say   and  
this means that  must have been accepted by n  
  or more agents and  must have been
accepted by n  
or
more
agents 
hence 
by
the
pigeon hole principle  at least one agent
 
must have accepted both of them  thereby contradicting individual rationality 
   for the other direction  suppose  does not satisfy the mp  i e    has a mi subset
 of size k      we need to show that there exists a profile j such that f  j   is inconsistent 
let  and  be two distinct formulas in   now consider a profile j with the following
properties  recall that we assume that n           the first n 
  agents accept all formulas
in  except for       the last n 
agents
accept
all
formulas
in
 except for   and     the
 
n  
middlemost agent   accepts  and  and no other formula in   that is  no individual
agent accepts all of the formulas in   i e   we really can build an individually rational
profile with these properties  note that any consistent subset of  can always be extended
to a complete and consistent judgment set in    however  under this profile each of the
formulas in  has a majority and we get   f  j    i e   f  j   is inconsistent 
the reason that in this case we were able to rely on a known result is the aforementioned fact
that for classes of aggregation procedures consisting of just a single procedure  safety and
possibility results coincide  unfortunately  for larger classes of procedures  this approach of
exploiting known possibility results cannot be used 
we first establish two sufficient conditions for the safety of the agenda  for two different
 fairly large  classes of aggregation procedures 
lemma     if an agenda  satisfies the ssmp  then  is safe for f  wr  u  
   

fiendriss  grandi    porello

proof  consider an aggregation procedure that satisfies  wr  and  u   let  be an agenda
that satisfies the ssmp  hence  the only way to obtain an inconsistent outcome would be to
either accept an inconsistent formula or to accept a formula  and its syntactic complement
  the latter possibility is excluded by  wr   so  for the sake of excluding also the
former possibility  suppose the inconsistent formula  has been collectively accepted  by
individual rationality   will get accepted by all agents  hence  by  u    will be
collectively accepted  and thus  will be collectively rejected by  wr  
lemma     if an agenda  satisfies the smp  then  is safe for f  wr  u  n  
proof  let f be an aggregation procedure that satisfies  wr    u  and  n   and let  be an
agenda that satisfies the smp  for the sake of contradiction  suppose there exists a profile
j  j   n such that f  j   is inconsistent  we distinguish two cases 
    there exists a set       f  j   with  being logically equivalent to   but given
that all individual judgment sets are assumed to be complete and consistent   being
logically equivalent to  means that every agent who accepts  will also accept  
j   together with  n  this entails   f  j     
and vice versa  i e   nj   n
f  j    we already know that   f  j    thus  we also get   f  j    but as we also
have   f  j    we have obtained a contradiction to  wr  
    there exists an inconsistent formula   f  j    by the same argument as used in
the proof of lemma     this contradicts our assumption of f satisfying  u  and  wr  
that is  we obtain a contradiction in all possible cases 
next  we prove two results concerning necessary conditions for the safety of the agenda
 now we aim for relatively narrowly defined classes of aggregation procedures  
lemma     if an agenda  is safe for f  wr  a  u  s   then  satisfies the smp 
proof  let  be an agenda that violates the smp  we need to provide an example for
an aggregation procedure f that satisfies  wr    a    u  and  s  that will produce an
inconsistent outcome for at least one input profile  we distinguish two cases 
    suppose  violates the smp by virtue of having a mi subset of size greater than    in
this case  also violates the mp  then theorem    shows that  is not safe for the
majority rule  as the majority rule satisfies  wr    a    u  and  s   we are done 
    the only other possibility is for  to have a mi subset consisting of two formulas
that are not logical complements  i e   there exists a set of the form        with
     but          consider then the following weakly rational  anonymous 
unanimous and systematic aggregation procedure fh for   individuals  defined using
the notation of proposition    h      h        and h      h         that is  fh
accepts a proposition only if it is accepted by an odd number of individuals    consider
the following profile  restricted to  and  and their complements  j         
    for example   might be p  q and  might be p 
    this parity rule has also been used by dokow and holzman        to provide a witness for one of their
possibility results 

   

ficomplexity of judgment aggregation

j          j          note that each of these sets is consistent  however 
the profile  opportunely extended to a profile on the whole agenda  will generate an
inconsistent outcome  since both  and  are accepted by exactly one individual 
hence  in all cases  fails to be safe for at least one procedure in f  wr  a  u  s  
lemma     if an agenda  is safe for f  wr  a  u  i   then  satisfies the ssmp 
proof  let  be an agenda that violates the ssmp  if it also violates the smp  then
lemma    applies and we are done 
otherwise  there must be two formulas  and  in  such that       but      
i e   they are logical but not syntactic complements  let f be the procedure that accepts
  and rejects   if at least one agent accepts   that accepts   and rejects   if at
least one agent accepts   and that behaves like the majority rule with respect to all other
propositions  f satisfies  wr    a    u  and  i   but  is not safe for f   because in case one
agent accepts  and another   the collective judgment set will include both  and  
we are now ready to state and prove our safety theorems 
theorem     an agenda  is safe for f  wr  a  u  s  if and only if  satisfies the smp 
proof  one direction is given by lemma     the other follows from lemma    together
with the observation that f  wr  u  n   f  wr  a  u  s  
this characterisation of safe agendas remains intact when we widen the class of aggregation
procedures under consideration from systematic to neutral procedures 
theorem     an agenda  is safe for f  wr  a  u  n  if and only if  satisfies the smp 
proof  one direction follows from lemma    together with the fact that f  wr  a  u  s  
f  wr  a  u  n   the other from lemma    and f  wr  u  n   f  wr  a  u  n  
indeed  while theorems    and    state safety results for particularly natural classes of
aggregation procedures  by the same argument we can easily see that for any class f with
f  wr  a  u  s   f  f  wr  u  n  it is the case that  is safe for f if and only if 
satisfies the smp 
if we drop neutrality from f  wr  a  u  s  rather than independence  then we obtain
an even more restrictive characterisation of safe agendas 
theorem     an agenda  is safe for f  wr  a  u  i  if and only if  satisfies the ssmp 
proof  one direction is given by lemma     the other follows from lemma    together with
f  wr  u   f  wr  a  u  i  
again  we can generalise the above result to say that  for any class f with f  wr  a  u  i  
f  f  wr  u   it is the case that  is safe for f if and only if  satisfies the ssmp 
finally  for uniform quota rules a characterisation result of the kind we seek is available
in the literature  albeit under a different name   at least for rules with certain bounds
imposed on the quota  dietrich   list      a   we state this interesting result as follows
 recall that n is the number of individuals  
   

fiendriss  grandi    porello

theorem     let k      an agenda  is safe for the class of uniform quota rules fm
satisfying the constraint m   n  nk if and only if  satisfies the kmp 
theorem    is a reformulation of corollary   a  in the work of dietrich and list      a 
and we shall not prove it here 
let us conclude this presentation of safety theorems with a remark on the role of the
axiom  u  in our results above  recall that we have not made any assumption about the
agenda not including any contradictory formulas  or their complements  i e   tautologies  
if we do make this assumption  which is very common in the ja literature and certainly
not unreasonable   then we can remove all mentionings of  u  in the safety results above 
indeed  we only ever used  u  in our proofs to avoid situations where a contradiction gets
unanimously rejected yet collectively accepted  if we do not wish to make any assumption
regarding the absence of contradictory formulas from the agenda  then we can still remove
all mentionings of  u  from our safety results above  provided we replace all mentionings of
the smp with the property of both satisfying the smp and not including any contradictory
formulas  and accordingly for results involving the ssmp  
    membership results for agenda properties
now that we have identified conditions under which we can guarantee the safety of a given
agenda  we want to know how difficult it is to decide whether those conditions are satisfied 
as we shall see  this problem is p   complete for each of the classes of aggregation procedures
we have considered  p   also known as conpnp or conp with an np oracle  is a complexity class located at the second level of the polynomial hierarchy  meyer   stockmeyer       
stockmeyer        arora   barak         this is the class of decision problems for which a
certificate for a negative answer can be verified in polynomial time by a machine that has
access to an oracle for answering queries to sat  or any other np complete problem   to
prove a problem p   complete  we have to prove both membership in p  and p   hardness 
we begin by proving membership in p    to do so  we need to provide an algorithm
that  when provided with a certificate intended to establish a negative answer  can verify
the correctness of that certificate in polynomial time  if we assume that the algorithm has
access to a sat oracle  in the sequel  we shall write mp both for the median property itself
and for the problem of deciding whether a given agenda  satisfies the median property 
and similarly for the smp  ssmp and kmp 
lemma     mp  smp  ssmp  and kmp are all in p   
proof  we shall present the proof for kmp  which is intuitively the most difficult of the four
problems  the proofs for the other three problems are very similar 
we need to give an algorithm that decides the correctness of a certificate for the violation
of the kmp in polynomial time  assuming it has access to a sat oracle  for a given agenda
  with m        such a certificate is a set    that  a  needs to be inconsistent and that
 b  must not have any inconsistent subsets of size   k  inconsistency of  can be checked
p

with a single query to the sat oracle  if m       then there are ki   mi nonempty
subsets of  of size   k  which is polynomial in m  and thus also in m     hence  the second
condition can be checked by a further polynomial number of queries to the oracle 
    this figure is not polynomial in k  but this does not affect the argument  as k is a constant

    hardness results for agenda properties
next  we want to show that mp  smp  ssmp and kmp are all p   hard  this can be done
by giving a polynomial time reduction from a problem that is already known to be p   hard
to the problem under investigation  for this purpose  we will make use of quantified boolean
formulas  qbfs   while qsat  the satisfiability problem   for general qbfs  is pspacecomplete  by imposing suitable syntactic restrictions we can generate complete problems
for any level of the polynomial hierarchy  consider a qbf of the following form 
x     xr y     ys   x            xr   y            ys  
here  is an arbitrary propositional formula and  x            xr     y            ys   is the set of
all propositional variables occurring in   that is  the above could be any qbf for which
any existential quantifiers occur inside the scope of all universal quantifiers   the problem
of checking whether a formula of this form is satisfiable  i e   true   which we shall denote
sat  is known to be p   complete  arora   barak         below  we shall abbreviate
formulas of the above type by writing xy  x  y  
the basic intuition for why mp and related problems are p   hard is that they share
some basic structure with sat  asking a question of the form for all subsets of  that
are inconsistent  does there exist a subset with a certain property  indeed  embedding 
say  mp into sat is relatively straightforward  however  here we require the opposite 
we need to show that even though sat may appear to be more general than mp and our
other agenda problems  it actually can be reduced to each of these problems 
we first prove a technical lemma  let sat  be the problem of checking whether a
qbf of the following form is true  given that we already know that  i   is not a tautology 
 ii   is not a contradiction  and  iii   is not logically equivalent to a literal 
xy  x  y   xy  x  y 
lemma     sat  is p   hard 
proof  by reduction from sat  given any qbf of the form xy  x  y   we show
that checking its satisfiability is equivalent to running sat  on    a   b with a being
universally and b being existentially quantified  for two new propositional variables a and b
not occurring in   i e   to checking the satisfiability of the formula
xayb    x  y   a   b   xayb    x  y   a   b  
first  note that    a   b cannot be a tautology  a contradiction  or equivalent to a literal 
so the side constraints specified in the definition of sat  are satisfied  also note that the
first conjunct above is true exactly when the original formula xy  x  y  is true  this is
because b can always be set to true  and the original formula has to be true whenever a is
set to false  a falls under the scope of a universal quantifier   therefore  a positive answer
to the sat  instance above entails a positive answer to the original sat instance  the
other direction is immediate  because the second of the above conjuncts is always satisfiable
 by making b false  
    we shall speak of satisfiability problems for qbfs  even though strictly speaking for qbfs there is no
distinction between satisfiability  truth and validity  as every qbf is a closed formula 

   

fiendriss  grandi    porello

we are now able to prove p   hardness for the ssmp 
lemma     ssmp is p   hard 
proof  we shall give a polynomial time reduction from sat  to ssmp  the claim
then follows from lemma     take any instance of sat    i e   the question whether
xy  x  y   xy  x  y  is true for some  with              and        for
literals   suppose x   hx            xr i  and define an agenda as follows   
    x    x    x    x            xr   xr              
we now prove that  violates the ssmp if and only if the answer to our sat   question
is no  to see this  consider the following facts  first  suppose  violates the ssmp  under
what circumstances will this be the case  as  is neither a tautology nor a contradiction  any
inconsistent subset of  must be nontrivially inconsistent  furthermore  by construction
of   consisting largely of literals   any inconsistent subset of  not including a pair of
syntactic complements must include either      or       as well as a  complementfree  subset of  x    x            xr   xr    that is  the only way of violating the ssmp is to
find a subset of literals from  x    x            xr   xr   to make true that forces either     
or      to be false  but this is precisely the situation in which our instance of sat 
requires a negative answer 
for the other direction  suppose the answer to our sat   question is no  this means
that we are able to find an assignment  for the variables in x that makes either  or 
unsatisfiable  w l o g   suppose we are in the latter situation  construct a subset of  
containing       that includes the literal xi if it is set to true by the assignment   and
xi otherwise  this is an inconsistent subset of   and since  is neither a tautology nor a
contradiction  this falsifies the ssmp 
proving hardness for the smp works similarly 
lemma     smp is p   hard 
proof  the construction used is the same as for the proof of lemma     the only additional
insight required is the observation that for the special kind of agenda constructed in that
proof  the smp and the ssmp coincide  by excluding formulas  that are equivalent to
literals  we ensure that the agenda  constructed in the previous proof does not contain
any pairs of logically equivalent formulas 
for the mp we give a proof using a reduction from the ssmp 
lemma     mp is p   hard 
proof  we will show how to reduce the problem of deciding ssmp to an instance of mp 
let  be an agenda on which we want to test the ssmp and let                  m   be
the set of non negated formulas in   now build the set   in the following way  copy all
formulas in   m times  every time renaming the variables occurring in i   obtaining the
    using      rather than  ensures that the agenda  does not include doubly negated formulas

formulas ji for     i  j   m  for every i substitute ii by ii  pi   where pi is a new variable
not occurring in any of the ji   finally  add p            pm to     we obtain the following set 
     p        p             m

define                  we will now show that  satisfies the ssmp if and only
if  satisfies the mp  one direction is immediate  suppose  does not satisfy the ssmp 
then  must have a mi subset  of size k        let     i            ik    then there exists
a subset of   namely     pi    ii    pi    ii             ii k    that is a mi set of size k         
thereby falsifying the mp 
for the opposite direction  suppose that  does not satisfy the mp  that is   has
a mi subset  of size      by construction of   we know that such a subset must only
contain formulas with the same superscript or their complements  all other formulas having
different variables   if this subset does not contain any pi or pi   then we can find a copy of
it in   which then violates the ssmp  in which case we are done  clearly   cannot include
both pi and pi   as that would contradict         so we are left with those cases where
 includes either pi or pi for some i  then  by minimality  also ii  pi or its negation
must be included  we can now reason by cases      if both pi and ii  pi are in   then
by dropping the disjunction we will still get an inconsistent subset  against the assumption
of minimality      both pi and  ii  pi   cannot be in  for the same reason      finally 
pi together with the negation of ii  pi is already inconsistent  therefore  we can conclude
that  must be of the form  pi   ii pi  i   where i is a set of  one or more  formulas in
 with the same superscript i  it is now easy to see that the set we obtain when we remove
the superscript from  ii    i is a mi subset of  that falsifies the ssmp  in particular 
ii   i   because ii    by construction  i e   the mi subset of  we obtain does not
consist of two formulas that are logical complements 
finally  we establish hardness for the kmp 
lemma     kmp is p   hard for every k     
proof  for k      the claim has been established by lemma     now observe that we can
use exactly the same construction as in the proof of lemma    to reduce any instance of
kmp for some k     to an instance of the corresponding  k   mp  hence  by a simple
inductive argument  kmp must be p   hard for any finite k     
    complexity of the safety of the agenda
we have shown that deciding whether a given agenda  satisfies the mp  the smp  the
ssmp  or the kmp is both in p  and p   hard  furthermore  in section     we have linked
these properties to the safety of  for various combinations of axioms  as an immediate
corollary to all of these results  we obtain our theorem concerning the complexity of deciding
the safety of an agenda 
    the fact that  cannot contain two formulas that are logical complements is not relevant for our proof

together with lemma     membership in p  follows from lemma    in all five cases 
that is  not only is it the case that the safety of the agenda can only be guaranteed for
structurally simple agendas  but deciding whether a given agenda meets those structural
constraints is highly intractable  this is a negative result in the sense that it concerns a
problem that we would like to be able to solve efficiently  we should stress that this does not
render the problem hopeless  work on qbf solvers has seen a lot of progress in recent years
 see  e g   narizzano  pulina    tacchella         and such tools could be deployed to check
whether an agenda satisfies a given type of median property    in any event  understanding
how a naturally arising question in ja relates to a difficult but well studied algorithmic
problem such as sat is interesting and worthwhile in its own right 

   related work  computational perspectives on judgment aggregation
starting with the work of list and pettit         most research in ja has focussed either
on the philosophical implications of the fact that aggregation may result in an inconsistent
outcome or on the derivation of impossibility and characterisation results  the extensive
literature in this field has recently been reviewed by list and puppe         some work

this does however not extend the range of available procedures in a significant way  second

ones out of a set of arguments that mutually attack each other to accept  which to reject 
and on which to remain undecided  rahwan and tohme        study a variant of this
problem where a group of agents have to decide which status to award to which argument 
a problem that naturally lends itself to be viewed through the lens of ja  in related work 
caminada and pigozzi        have proposed an approach to ja that involves a translation
into an abstract argumentation framework  which makes the tools and techniques of abstract
argumentation available to the aggregation of judgments 
a field of research within ai that is closely related to ja is belief merging  see  e g  
konieczny   pino perez        maynard zhang   lehmann        chopra et al        
everaere et al          the work of konieczny and pino perez         in particular  has
inspired the distance based procedure for ja we have used in this paper  ja and belief
merging as modelled by konieczny and pino perez share interesting features  but ultimately
study different problems  while in ja individuals are assumed to submit consistent judgment sets  in belief merging this constraint is enforced only on the outcome  this reflects
the view that consistency in belief merging  modelled in terms of an integrity constraint  is
a feasibility requirement  while in ja it amounts to a rationality assumption 

   conclusions and future work
we have studied the computational complexity of three problems in ja  computing the
winning judgment set for a given aggregation procedure  deciding whether manipulation
would be beneficial for a given agent under a given aggregation procedure and for a given
profile  and deciding on the safety of the agenda for a given class of aggregation procedures 
we have also proven several safety theorems that link safety to simple structural properties
of the agenda and that provide an interesting counterpart to known possibility theorems 
our results show that  while the winner determination problem is easy for all quota rules
and the premise based procedure  it is intractable for the otherwise attractive distance based
procedure  regarding strategic manipulation  we have seen that manipulation is np hard
for the premise based procedure  which is a positive result  we have also seen that for
quota rules the question of manipulation complexity does not arise  at least not for the
   

fiendriss  grandi    porello

model of preferences used here  for the distance based procedure  we have not investigated
the complexity of the manipulation problem  because already the winner determination
problem was found to be intractable  in our work on the safety of the agenda  we have
derived characterisation results for a wide range of procedures  defined in terms of commonly
used axioms  we have seen that safety can only be guaranteed for relatively simple agendas
and we have also seen that deciding whether these simplicity conditions are met is highly
intractable 
while work on the computational aspects of ja has so far been limited to a small
number of interesting but scattered contributions  we strongly believe that ja should be
taken up as an important research topic in both ai and computational social choice  one
important direction to pursue concerns practical algorithms for the problems studied in this
paper  as well as for related problems naturally arising in ja   we have already mentioned
that existing work on algorithms for the winner determination problem for the kemeny
rule in preference aggregation  conitzer et al         may provide a starting point for a
working implementation of the distance based procedure and that work on qbf solvers in
automated reasoning  narizzano et al         or work on answer set programming  leone
et al         could prove helpful in tackling the challenges identified by our complexity
results regarding the safety of the agenda 
alongside the development of practical algorithms  improving our understanding of the
algorithmic aspects of ja by studying it in the framework of parameterised complexity would
also be of great interest  in the context of voting  this approach has lead to a number of
insightful results  betzler         indeed  for ja  initial steps in this direction have already
been taken by baumeister et al         
studying the winner determination problem  both in complexity theoretic and in practical terms  for the other distance based procedures proposed by miller and osherson       
and lang et al         also constitutes a very worthwhile direction for future work 
recall that we have analysed manipulation for one particular way of defining preferences 
namely in terms of the hamming distance to an agents true set of judgments  thus  it
would be interesting to investigate to what extent changing the definition of manipulation
 by altering the notion of induced preference  affects our complexity result  indeed  other
notions of induced preference  and thus manipulation  are conceivable  for instance  a
would be manipulator might only be interested in the status of specific propositions  e g  
the conclusions  or she might use a different notion of distance  e g   one of those recently
proposed by duddy and piggins        
above we have justified our decision not to study the complexity of the manipulation
problem for the distance based procedure with the fact that already the much more basic
winner determination problem is p   complete  an important question that we believe
requires discussion in the research community is whether this is indeed a valid argument 
in the context of voting  the initial idea of bartholdi et al         had been that  say  an
np hardness result for the manipulation problem for a particular voting rule might suggest
that this rule is immune against manipulation in practice  recent work very strongly
suggests that this is not the case  faliszewski   procaccia         and that for the kind
of np hard problems encountered in this context algorithms that perform well in practice
are relatively easy to design  walsh         the question now arises whether the same will
still be true for hardness results with respect to higher complexity classes  for instance  it
   

ficomplexity of judgment aggregation

is conceivable that it will be possible to design algorithms that can efficiently solve most
typical instances of the winner determination problem for the distance based procedure 
while it might turn out to be much more difficult to design a similarly successful algorithm
for the corresponding manipulation problem  that is  the question arises whether hardnessof manipulation studies need to be restricted to problems for which winner determination
is polynomial  or whether any jump in complexity is desirable in principle and might
provide some level of protection in practice 
regarding the safety of the agenda  we have given results for the most natural combinations of axioms that correspond to a weakening of the majority rule  but a similar study
could also be conducted for other combinations of axioms  indeed  it would be interesting to
explore how robust our p   completeness results are  that is  an open question that suggests
itself is whether there exists an interesting and relevant class of aggregation procedures for
which the safety problem falls into a different complexity class 
generally speaking  we believe that much more work on exploring the obvious potential
of ja for ai and multiagent systems is needed  this should lead to both practical advances
and the definition of interesting new theoretical problems  some steps in this direction have
recently been taken by slavkovik         concerning the modelling of collective decision
making in multiagent systems  and by caminada and pigozzi        and rahwan and
tohme         concerning applications of ja to abstract argumentation
