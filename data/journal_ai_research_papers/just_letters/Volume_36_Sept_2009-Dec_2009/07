eight agents play tac game  simulated travel agent whose task
organize itineraries clients travel tactown five day  four
night  period  time allotted  nine minutes   agents objective procure
travel goods inexpensively possible  trading fact goods
ultimately compiled feasible trips satisfy client preferences greatest
extent possible  agents know preferences eight clients only 
   
travel goods sold simultaneous auctions follows 
flight tickets sold tacair dynamic posted pricing environments 
flights tactown applicable day  resale flight
tickets agents permitted 
flight price quotes broadcast tac server every ten seconds 
hotel reservations sold tac seller multi unit ascending call markets 
specifically     hotel reservations sold hotel auction    highest
bidders   th highest price  tac seller runs eight hotel auctions  one per
night hotel combination  recall travel takes place four night period 
moreover  two hotels  good one bad one   resale hotel
reservations agents permitted  bid withdrawal allowed 
specifically  eight hotel auctions clear minute exactly one auction
closing minutes one eight   the precise auction close chosen

among continuous double auctions  cdas   three entertainment events scheduled day 
although event auctions clear continuously  price quotes broadcast every

flights useful client without corresponding hotel reservations  vice

   conclusion
foremost aim trading agent research develop body techniques effective
design analysis trading agents  contributions trading agent design include
invention trading strategies  together models algorithms realizing
computation methods measure evaluate performance agents characterized
strategies  researchers seek specific solutions particular trading problems
general principles guide development trading agents across market scenarios 
paper purports contribute research agenda  described design
implementation roxybot     able trading agent demonstrated performance
tac    
although automated trading electronic markets yet fully taken hold 
trend well underway  tac  trading agent community demonstrating
potential autonomous bidders make pivotal trading decisions effective way 
agents offer potential accelerate automation trading broadly 
thus shape future commerce

equation      limits client one trip scenario  equation      prevents
agent allocating flights buy  equation      prevents agent
allocating hotels buy  equation      prevents agent
allocating event tickets buy sell  equation      ensures
agent bids least hqw units hotel auction  equation      prevents agent
placing one buy offer per unit hotel auction 
agent might constrained place sell offers units good
owns  and or place buy  sell  offers units good
market supplies  demands  
note need explicitly enforce bid monotonicity constraints
ilp formulation 
buy offers must nonincreasing k  sell offers nondecreasing 
ilp need constraint prices assumed linear 
effect  decisions ilp makes many units good bid
on  hence  bids                           equivalent 
agent may offer sell less price willing buy

ilp would choose place buy offer sell offer good
buy price good exceeds sell price  would unprofitable
