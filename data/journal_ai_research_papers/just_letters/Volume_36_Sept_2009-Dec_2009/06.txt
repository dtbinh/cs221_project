abstract
this article considers the task of automatically inducing role semantic annotations in
the framenet paradigm for new languages  we propose a general framework that is based
on annotation projection  phrased as a graph optimization problem  it is relatively inexpensive and has the potential to reduce the human effort involved in creating role semantic
resources  within this framework  we present projection models that exploit lexical and
syntactic information  we provide an experimental evaluation on an english german parallel corpus which demonstrates the feasibility of inducing high precision german semantic
role annotation both for manually and automatically annotated english data 

   introduction
semantic roles play a prominent role in linguistic theory  fillmore        jackendoff       
dowty         they describe the relations that hold between a predicate and its arguments 
abstracting over surface syntactic configurations  as an example  consider sentences   a 
and   b  where butter is uniformly assigned the semantic role undergoer  since it undergoes a physical change  even though it is syntactically realized as the object of the verb
melt in   a  and its subject in   b

this intermediate representation seems a promising first step towards text understanding 
and can ultimately benefit many natural language processing tasks that require broad coverage semantic processing 
methods for the automatic identification and labeling of semantic roles  often referred to
as shallow semantic parsing  gildea   jurafsky         are an important prerequisite for the
widespread use of semantic role information in large scale applications  the development
of shallow semantic parsers  has been greatly facilitated by the availability of resources like
framenet  fillmore  johnson    petruck        and propbank  palmer  gildea    kingsbury         which document possible surface realization of semantic roles  indeed  semantic
   approaches to building shallow semantic parsers are too numerous to list  we refer the interested reader

in the framenet paradigm  the meaning of a predicate  usually a verb  noun  or adjective  is represented by reference to a frame  a prototypical representation of the situation
the predicate describes  fillmore         the semantic roles  which are called frame elements  correspond to entities present in this situation  and are therefore frame specific  for
each frame  the english framenet database  lists the predicates that can evoke it  called
frame evoking elements or fees   gives the possible syntactic realizations of its semantic
roles  and provides annotated examples from the british national corpus  burnard        
an abbreviated example definition of the departing frame is shown in table    the semantic roles are illustrated with example sentences and the fees are shown at the bottom
of the table  e g   abandon  desert  depart   the propbank corpus  the second major semantic role resource for english  provides role realization information for verbs in a similar
manner on the wall street journal portion of the penn treebank  it uses index based role
names  arg argn   where arg  and arg  correspond to dowtys        proto agent and
proto patient  higher indices are defined on a verb by verb basis 
unfortunately  resources such as framenet and propbank are largely absent for almost
all languages except english  the main reason being that role semantic annotation is an
expensive and time consuming process  the current english framenet  version      has
been developed over the past twelve years  it now contains roughly     frames covering
   available from http   framenet icsi berkeley edu

around         annotated tokens of       frame evoking elements  although framenets
are being constructed for german  spanish  and japanese  these resources are considerably
smaller  the same is true for propbank style resources  which have been developed for
korean    chinese  xue   palmer         spanish and catalan  taule  mart    recasens 
       compared to the english propbank  which covers         predicate argument structures  the resources for the other languages are two to three times smaller  e g   the korean
propbank provides        annotations  
given the data requirements for supervised learning algorithms  fleischman   hovy 
      and the current paucity of such data  unsupervised methods could potentially enable
the creation of annotated data for new languages and reduce the human effort involved 
however  unsupervised approaches to shallow semantic parsing are still at an early stage 
and mostly applicable to resources other than framenet  swier   stevenson             
grenager   manning         in this article  we propose a method which employs parallel
corpora for acquiring frame elements and their syntactic realizations for new languages  see
the upper half of table     our approach leverages the existing english framenet to overcome the resource shortage in other languages by exploiting the translational equivalences
present in aligned data  specifically  it uses annotation projection  yarowsky  ngai    wicentowski        yarowsky   ngai        hwa  resnik  weinberg    kolak        hi  
hwa        to transfer semantic roles from english to less resource rich languages  the key
idea of projection can be summarized as follows      given a pair of sentences e  english 
and l  new language  that are translations of each other  annotate e with semantic roles 
and then     project these roles onto l using word alignment information  in this manner 
we induce semantic structure on the l side of the parallel text  which can then serve as
data for training a shallow semantic parser for l that is independent of the parallel corpus 
the annotation projection paradigm faces at least two challenges when considering semantic roles  firstly  the semantic structure to be projected must be shared between the two
sentences  clearly  if the role semantic analysis of the source sentence e is inappropriate for
the target sentence l  simple projection will not produce valid semantic role annotations 
secondly  even if two sentences demonstrate semantic parallelism  semantic role annotations
pertain to potentially arbitrarily long word spans rather than to individual words  recovering the word span of the semantic roles in the target language is challenging given that
automatic alignment methods often produce noisy or incomplete alignments 
we address the first challenge by showing that  if two languages exhibit a substantial
degree of semantic correspondence  then annotation projection is feasible  using an englishgerman parallel corpus as a test bed  we assess whether english semantic role annotations
can be transferred successfully onto german  we find that the two languages exhibit a
degree of semantic correspondence substantial enough to warrant projection  we tackle the
second challenge by presenting a framework for the projection of semantic role annotations
that goes beyond single word alignments  specifically  we construct semantic alignments
between constituents of source and target sentences and formalize the search for the best
semantic alignment as an optimization problem in a bipartite graph  we argue that bipartite
graphs offer a flexible and intuitive framework for modeling semantic alignments that is able
to deal with noise and to represent translational divergences  we present different classes

of models with varying assumptions regarding admissible correspondences between source
and target constituents  experimental results demonstrate that constituent based models
outperform their word based alternatives by a large margin  
the remainder of this article is organized as follows  section   discusses annotation
projection in general and presents an annotation study examining the degree of semantic
parallelism on an english german corpus  in section    we formalize semantic alignments
and present our modeling framework  our experiments are detailed in section    we review
related work in section   and conclude the article with discussion of future work  section    

   annotation projection and semantic correspondence
in recent years  interest has grown in parallel corpora for multilingual and cross lingual
natural language processing  beyond machine translation  parallel corpora can be exploited
to relieve the effort involved in creating annotations for new languages  one important
paradigm  annotation projection  creates new monolingual resources by transferring annotations from english  or other resource rich languages  onto resource scarce languages
through the use of word alignments  the resulting  noisy  annotations can be then used
in conjunction with robust learning algorithms to obtain nlp tools such as taggers and
chunkers relatively cheaply  the projection approach has been successfully used to transfer a wide range of linguistic annotations between languages  examples include parts of
speech  yarowsky et al         hi   hwa         chunks  yarowsky et al          dependencies  hwa et al          word senses  diab   resnik        bentivogli   pianta        
information extraction markup  riloff  schafer    yarowsky         coreference chains  postolache  cristea    orasan         temporal information  spreyer   frank         and lfg
f structures  tokarczyk   frank        
an important assumption underlying annotation projection is that linguistic analyses
in one language will be also valid in another language  it is however unrealistic to expect
any two languages  even of the same family  to be in perfect correspondence  there are
many well studied systematic differences across languages often referred to as translational
divergences  van leuven zwart        dorr         these can be structural  where the same
semantic content in the source and in the target language can be realized using different
structures  or semantic  where the content itself undergoes a change in translation  translational divergences  in conjunction with poor alignments  are a major stumbling block
towards achieving accurate projections  yarowsky and ngai        find that parts of speech
that are transferred directly from english onto french contain considerable noise  even in
cases where inaccurate automatic alignments have been manually corrected  accuracies vary
between     and     depending on tagset granularity   for syntax  hwa  resnik  weinberg  cabezas  and kolak        find that only     of english dependency relations have
direct counterparts in chinese  and     in spanish  the problem is commonly addressed
with filtering mechanisms  which act as a post processing step on the projection output 
for example  yarowsky and ngai        exclude infrequent projections and poor alignments
   a preliminary version of this work was published in the proceedings of emnlp      and coling acl
      the current article contains a more detailed description of our approach  presents several novel
experiments  and a comprehensive error analysis

and hwa et al         apply transformation rules which encode linguistic knowledge about
the target language 
in the case of semantic frames there is reason for optimism  by definition  frames are
based on conceptual structure  fillmore         the latter constitute generalizations over
surface structure and therefore ought to be less prone to syntactic variation  indeed  efforts
to develop framenets manually in german  japanese  and spanish reveal that a large
number of english frames can be re used directly to describe predicates and their arguments

      burchardt  erk  frank  kowalski  pado    pinkal         boas        even suggests
frame semantics as an interlingual meaning representation 
computational studies on projection in parallel corpora have also obtained good results
for semantic annotation  fung and chen        induce framenet style annotations in chinese by mapping english framenet entries directly onto concepts listed in hownet    an
on line ontology for chinese  without using parallel texts  in their experiment  they transfer
semantic roles from english to chinese with an accuracy of      basili  cao  croce  coppola  and moschitti        use gold standard annotations to transfer semantic roles from
english to italian with     accuracy  bentivogli and pianta        project eurowordnet
sense tags  which represent more fine grained semantic information than framenet  also
from english to italian  they obtain a precision of     and a recall of      without applying any filtering  fung  wu  yang  and wu              analyse an automatically annotated
englishchinese parallel corpus and find high cross lingual agreement for propbank roles
 in the range of         depending on the role  
to provide a sound empirical justification for our projection based approach  we conducted a manual annotation study on a parallel english german corpus  we identified
semantic role information in bi sentences and assessed the degree to which frames and semantic roles agree and diverge in english and german  the degree of divergence provides
a natural upper bound for the accuracy attainable with annotation projection 
    sample selection
english german bi sentences were drawn from the second release of europarl  koehn        
a corpus of professionally translated proceedings of the european parliament  europarl is
aligned at the document and sentence level and is available in    languages  the english
german section contains about    million words on both sides  even though restricted in
genre  transcriptions of spoken text   europarl is fairly open domain  covering a wide range
of topics such as foreign politics  cultural and economic affairs  and procedural matters 
a naive sampling strategy would involve randomly selecting bi sentences from europarl
which contain a framenet predicate on the english side aligned to some word on the
german side  there are two caveats here  first  the alignment between the two predicates
may be wrong  leading us to assign a wrong frame to the german predicate  secondly  even
if the alignment is accurate  it is possible that a randomly chosen english predicate evokes
a frame that is not yet covered by framenet  for example  framenet     documents the
receive sense of the verb accept  as in the sentence mary accepted a gift   but has no
entry for the admit sense of the predicate  e g   in i accept that this is a problem for

table    monolingual inter annotator agreement on the calibration set

the eu   which is relatively frequent in europarl  indeed  in a pilot study  we inspected a
small random sample consisting of     bi sentences  using the publicly available giza  
software  och   ney        to induce english german word alignments  we found that    
of the english predicates did not have readings documented in framenet  and an additional
   of the predicate pairs were instances of wrong alignments  in order to obtain a cleaner
sample  our final sampling procedure was informed by the english framenet and salsa 
a framenet compatible database  for german  erk  kowalski  pado    pinkal        
we gathered all germanenglish sentences in the corpus that had at least one pair of
giza   aligned predicates  we   wg    where we was listed in framenet and wg in salsa 
and where the intersection of the two frame lists for wg and we was non empty  this corpus
contains    frame types      lemma pairs  and     unique english and     unique german
lemmas  sentence pairs were grouped into three bands according to their frame frequency
 high  medium  low   we randomly selected     pairs from each band for annotation 
the total sample consisted of       bi sentences  before semantic annotation took place 
constituency parses for the corpus were obtained from collins        parser for english and
dubeys        for german  the automatic parses were then corrected manually  following
the annotation guidelines of the penn treebank  english  and the tiger corpus  german  
    annotation
after syntactic correction  two annotators with native level proficiency in german and english annotated each bi sentence with the frames evoked by we and wg and their semantic
roles  i e   one frame per monolingual sentence   for every predicate  the task involved two
steps   a  selecting the appropriate frame and  b  assigning the instantiated semantic roles
to sentence constituents  annotators were provided with detailed guidelines that explained
the task with multiple examples 
the annotation took place on the gold standard parsed corpus and proceeded in three
phases  a training phase     bi sentences   a calibration phase      bi sentences   and a
production mode phase       bi sentences   during training  annotators were acquainted
with the annotation style  in the calibration phase  each bi sentence was doubly annotated to
assess inter annotator agreement  finally  in production mode  each of the      bi sentences
in the main dataset was split and each half randomly assigned to one of the coders for
single annotation  we thus ensured that no annotator saw both parts of any bi sentence
to avoid any language bias in the role assignment  annotators may be prone to label an
english sentence similar to its german translation and vice versa   each coder annotated
approximately the same amount of data in english and german and had access to the
framenet and salsa resources

table    semantic parallelism between english and german
the results of our inter annotator agreement study are given in table    the widely used
kappa statistic is not directly applicable to our task as it requires a fixed set of items to be
classified into a fixed set of categories  in our case  however  there are no fixed items  since the
span for the frame elements can have any length  in addition  the categories  i e   frames and
roles  are predicate specific  and vary from item to item  for a discussion of this issue  see also
the work of miltsakaki et al          instead  we compute three different agreement measures
defined as  the ratio of common frames between two sentences  frame match   the ratio of
common roles  role match   and the ratio of roles with identical spans  span match   as
shown in table    annotators tend to agree in frame assignment  disagreements are mainly
due to fuzzy distinctions between closely related frames  e g   between awareness and
certainty   annotators also agree on what roles to assign and on identifying role spans 
overall  we obtain high agreement for all aspects of the annotation  which indicates that
the task is well defined  we are not aware of published agreement figures on the english
framenet annotations  but our results are comparable to numbers reported by burchardt 
erk  frank  kowalski  pado  and pinkal        for german  viz      agreement on frame
assignment  frame match  and     agreement on role annotation  
    evaluation
recall that the main dataset consists of       english german bi sentences annotated with
framenet semantic roles  since the annotations for each language have been created independently  they can be used to provide an estimate of the degree of semantic parallelism
between the two languages  we measured parallelism using precision and recall  treating
the german annotations as gold standard  this evaluation scheme directly gauges the usability of english as a source language for annotation projection  less than      recall
means that the target language has frames or roles which are not present in english and
cannot be retrieved by annotation projection  conversely  imperfect precision indicates that
there are english frames or roles whose projection yields erroneous annotations in the target language  frames and roles are counted as matching if they occur in both halves of a
bi sentence  regardless of their role spans  which are not comparable across languages 
as shown in table    about     of the time english and german evoke the same
frame  frame match   this result is encouraging  especially when considering that frame
disagreements also arise within a single language as demonstrated by our inter annotator
study on the calibration set  see the row frame match in table     however  it also indicates
that there is a non negligible number of cases of translational divergence on the frame level 
these are often cases where one language chooses a single predicate to express a situation
whereas the other one uses complex predication  in the following example  the english
transitive predicate increase evokes the frame cause change of scalar position  an
   the parallel corpus we created is available from http   nlpado de  sebastian srl data html

agent or cause increases the position of a variable on some scale   its german translation
fuhrt zu hoheren  leads to higher  combines the causation frame evoked by fuhren with
the inchoative change of scalar position frame introduced by hoher

level of employment lead

at the level of semantic roles  agreement  role match  reaches an f  score of      this
means that when frames correspond across languages  the roles agree to a large extent 
role mismatches are frequently cases of passivization or infinitival constructions leading
to role elision  in the example below  remembered and denkt both evoke the memory
frame  english uses a passive construction which leaves the deep subject position unfilled 
in contrast  german uses an active construction where the deep subject position is filled by
a semantically light pronoun  man  one  
   

i ask that  ireland content be remembered 
ich mochte
darum bitten  dass  man cognizer  an irland content denkt 
i would like
to ask that one
of ireland
thinks

in sum  we find that there is substantial cross lingual semantic correspondence between
english and german provided that the predicates evoke the same frame  we enlisted the
help of the salsa database to meet this requirement  alternatively  we could have used an
existing bilingual dictionary  fung   chen         aligned the frames automatically using a
vector based representation  basili et al         or inferred framenet style predicate labels
for german following the approach proposed by pado and lapata        

   modeling semantic role projection with semantic alignments
most previous work on projection relies on word alignments to transfer annotations between
languages  this is not surprising  since the annotations of interest are often defined at the
word level  e g   parts of speech  word senses  or dependencies  and rarely span more than
one token  in contrast  semantic roles can cover sentential constituents of arbitrary length 
and simply using word alignments for projection is likely to result in wrong role spans 
as an example  consider the bi sentence in figure     assume for now that the  english  source has been annotated with semantic roles which we wish to project onto the
 german  target  although some alignments  indicated by the dotted lines below the sentence  are accurate  e g   promised  versprach  to  zu   others are noisy or incomplete
 e g   time  punktlich instead of on time  punktlich   based on these alignments  the
message role would be projected into german onto the  incorrect  word span punktlich zu
instead of punktlich zu kommen  since kommen is not aligned with any english word 
it is of course possible to devise heuristics for amending alignment errors  however  this
process does not scale well  different heuristics need to be created for different errors  and
   a literal gloss of the german sentence is kim promises timely to come

figure    bilingual projection of semantic role information with semantic alignments between constituents 

the process has to be repeated for each new language pair  instead  our projection model
alleviates this problem in a more principled manner by taking constituency information into
account  specifically  we induce semantic alignments between source and target sentences
by relying on syntactic constituents to introduce a bias towards linguistically meaningful
spans  for a constituent to be aligned correctly  it is sufficient that a subset of its yield
is correctly word aligned  so  in figure    we can align to be on time with punktlich zu
kommen and project the role message accurately  despite the fact that be and kommen are
not aligned with each other  in the following  we describe in detail how semantic alignments
are computed and subsequently guide projection onto the target language 
    framework formalization
each bi sentence is represented as a set of linguistic units  these are distinguished into
source  us  us   and target  ut  ut   units and can be words  chunks  constituents  or other
groupings  the semantic roles for the source sentence are modeled as a labeling function
as   r   us which maps roles to sets of source units  we view projection as the construction
of a similar role labeling function on the target sentence  at   r   ut   without loss of
generality  we limit ourselves to one frame per sentence  as does framenet  
a semantic alignment a between us and ut is a subset of the cartesian product of the
source and target units 
a  us  ut
   
an alignment link between us  us and ut  ut implies that us and ut are semantically
equivalent  provided with a and the role assignment function for the source sentence  as  
projection consists simply of transferring the source labels r onto the union of the target
units that are semantically aligned with the source units bearing the label r 
at  r     ut k  us  as  r     us   ut    a 

   

   this entails that we cannot take advantage of potentially beneficial dependencies between the arguments of different predicates within one sentence  which have been shown to improve semantic role

we seek the alignment that maximizes the product of bilingual similarities sim between

there are several well established methods in the literature for computing semantic similarity within one language  see the work of weeds        and budanitsky   hirst       
for overviews   measuring semantic similarity across languages is not as well studied and
there is less consensus on what the appropriate methods are  in this article  we employ a
very simple method  using automatic word alignments as a proxy for semantic equivalence 
however  other similarity measures can be used  see the discussion in section     following
general convention  we assume that sim is a function ranging from    minimal similarity 
to    maximal similarity  
a wealth of optimization methods can be used to solve      in this article  we treat
constituent alignment as a bipartite graph optimization problem  bipartite graphs provide
a simple and intuitive modeling framework for alignment problems and their optimization algorithms are well understood and computationally moderate  more importantly  by
imposing constraints on the bipartite graph  we can bias our model against linguistically
implausible alignments  for example alignments that map multiple english roles onto a single german constituent  different graph topologies correspond to different constraints on
the set of admissible alignments a  for instance  we may want to ensure that all source and
target units are aligned  or to restrict alignment to one to one matches  see section     for
further details  
more formally  a weighted bipartite graph is a graph g    v  e  whose node set v is
partitioned into two nonempty sets v  and v  in such a way that every edge e joins a
node in v  to a node in v  and is labeled with a weight  in our projection application  the
two partitions are the sets of linguistic units us and ut   in the source and target sentence 
respectively  we assume that g is complete  that is  each source node is connected to all
target nodes and vice versa   edge weights model the  dis  similarity between a pair of
source and target units 
the optimization problem from equation     identifies the alignment that maximizes the
product of link similarities which are equivalent to edges in our bipartite graph  finding an
optimal alignment amounts to identifying a minimum weight subgraph  cormen  leiserson 
  rivest         a subgraph g  of g that satisfies certain structural constraints  see the
discussion below  while incurring a minimal edge cost

the minimization problem in equation     is equivalent to the maximization problem in    
when setting weight us   ut   to

   unwanted alignments can be excluded explicitly by setting their similarity to zero

high similarity scores  low edge weights  occur in the diagonal of the matrix 
in order to obtain complete projection models we must  a  specify the linguistic units
over which alignment takes place   b  define an appropriate similarity function  and  c 
formulate the alignment constraints  in the following  we describe two models  one that
uses words as linguistic units and one that uses constituents  we also present appropriate
similarity functions for these models and detail our alignment constraints 
    word based projection
in our first model the linguistic units are word tokens  source and target sentences are represented by sets of words  us    ws    ws            and ut    wt    wt             respectively  semantic
alignments here are links between individual words  we can thus conveniently interpret
off the shelf word alignments as semantic alignments  formally  this is achieved with the
following binary similarity function  which trivially turns a word alignment into an optimal
semantic alignment 
 
  if ws and wt are word aligned
sim ws   wt    
   
  else
constraints on admissible alignments are often encoded in word alignment models either
heuristically  e g   by enforcing one to one alignments as in melamed        or by virtue of
   

fipado   lapata

the translation model used for their computation  for example  the ibm models introduced
in the seminal work of brown  pietra  pietra  and mercer        require each target word to
be aligned to exactly one source word  which may be the empty word   and therefore allow
one to many alignments in one direction  our experiments use the alignments induced by
the publicly available giza   software  och   ney         giza   yields alignments
by interfacing the ibm models     brown et al         with hmm extensions of models  
and    vogel  ney    tillmann         this particular configuration has been shown to
outperform several heuristic and statistical alignment models  och   ney         we thus
take advantage of the alignment constraints already encoded in giza   and assume that
the optimal semantic alignment is given by the set of giza   links  the resulting target
language labeling function is 
aw
t  r     wt k  ws  as  r    ws and wt are giza   word aligned 

    

this labeling function corresponds to the  implicit  labeling functions employed in other
word based annotation projection models  such models can be easily derived for different
language pairs without recourse to any corpus external resources  unfortunately  as discussed in section    automatically induced alignments are often noisy  thus leading to
projection errors  cases in point are function words  e g   prepositions  and multi word
expressions  which are systematically misaligned due to their high degree of cross lingual
variation 
    constituent based projection
in our second model the linguistic units are constituents  source and target sentences
are thus represented by constituent sets  us    c s   c s            and  ut    c t   c t             a
constituent based similarity function should capture the extent to which cs and its projection ct express the same semantic content  we approximate this by measuring word
alignment based word overlap between cs and ct with jaccards coefficient 
let yield c  denote the set of words in the yield of a constituent c  and al c  the set of
words in the target language aligned to the yield of c  then the word overlap o between a
source constituent cs and a target constituent ct is defined as 
o cs   ct    

 al cs    yield ct   
 al cs    yield ct   

    

jaccards coefficient is asymmetric  it will consider how well the projection of a source
constituent al cs   matches the target constituent ct   but not vice versa  in order to take
target source and source target correspondences into account  we measure word overlap in
both directions and use their mean as a measure of similarity 
sim cs   ct      o cs   ct     o ct   cs     

    

in addition to a similarity measure  a constituent based projection model must also specify
the constraints that characterize the set of admissible alignments a  in this paper  we
consider three types of alignment constraints that affect the number of alignment links per
constituent  in graph theoretic terms  the degree of the nodes in us    this focus is motivated

figure    constituent alignments and role projections resulting from three families of alignment constraints  us   ut   source and target constituents  r    r    semantic roles  

by patterns that we observe on our gold standard corpus  cf  section     for each english
and german constituent  we determined whether it corresponded to none  exactly one  or
several constituents in the other language  according to a gold standard word alignment 
the majority of constituents correspond to exactly one constituent        followed by a
substantial number of one to many many to one correspondences        while cases where
constituents are not translated  i e   do not have a corresponding node on the other side of
the bi sentence  are very rare      
this analysis indicates that on perfect data  we should expect the best performance from
a model that allows one to many alignments  however  it is a common finding in machine
learning that more restrictive models  even though not appropriate for the data at hand 
yield better results by limiting the hypothesis space  in this spirit  we compare three families
of admissible alignments which range from the more restrictive to the more permissive  and
evaluate them against each other 
      alignments as perfect matchings
we first consider the most restrictive case  where each constituent has exactly one adjacent
alignment edge  semantic alignments with this property can be thought of as bijective
functions  each source constituent is mapped to one target constituent  and vice versa  the
resulting bipartite graphs are perfect matchings  an example of a perfect bipartite matching
is given in figure  a  note that the target side contains two nodes labeled  e   a shorthand
for empty node  since bi sentences will often differ in size  the resulting graph partitions
will have different sizes as well  in such cases  we introduce empty nodes in the smaller
partition to enable perfect matching  empty nodes are assigned a similarity of zero with
all other nodes  alignments to empty nodes  such as for source nodes     and      are
ignored for the purposes of projection  this gives the model the possibility of abstaining
from aligning a node when no good correspondence is found 
perfect matchings assume a strong equivalence between the constituent structures of
the two languages  neither of the alignments in figure   b  and   c  is a perfect matching 
   

fipado   lapata

perfect matchings cannot model one to many matches  i e   cases where semantic material
expressed by one constituent in one language is split into two constituents in the other
language  this means that perfect matchings are most appropriate when the source and
target role annotations span exactly one constituent  while this is not always the case 
perfect matchings also have an advantage over more expressive models  by allowing each
node only one adjacent edge  they introduce strong competition between edges  as a result 
errors in the word alignment can be corrected to some extent 
perfect matchings can be computed efficiently using algorithms for network optimization  fredman   tarjan        in time approximately cubic in the total number of constituents in a bi sentence  o  us    log  us      us     ut      furthermore  perfect matchings are
equivalent to the well known linear assignment problem  for which many solution algorithms
have been developed  e g   jonker and volgenant       time o max  us     ut        
      alignments as edge covers
we next consider edge covers  a generalization of perfect matchings  edge covers are bipartite graphs where each source and target constituent is adjacent to at least one edge  this is
illustrated in figure  b  where all source and target nodes have one adjacent edge  i e   alignment link   and some nodes more than one  see source node     and target node       edge
covers impose weaker correspondence assumptions than perfect matchings  since they allow one to many alignments between constituents in either direction    so  in theory  edge
covers have a higher chance of delivering a correct role projection than perfect matchings
when the syntactic structures of the source and target sentences are different  they can also
deal better with situations where semantic roles are assigned to more than one constituent
in one of the languages  cf  source nodes     and      labeled with role r    in the example
graph   notice that perfect matchings as shown in figure  a are also edge covers  whereas
the graph in figure  c is not  as the target side nodes     and     have no adjacent edges 
eiter and mannila        develop an algorithm for computing optimal edge covers 
they show that minimum weight edge covers can be reduced to minimum weight perfect
matchings  see above  of an auxiliary bipartite graph with two partitions of size  us      ut   
this allows the computation of minimum weight edge covers in time o   us      ut        
o max  us     ut        which is also cubic in the number of constituents in the bi sentence 
      total alignments
the last family of admissible alignments we consider are total alignments  here  each source
constituent is linked to some target constituent  i e  the alignment forms a total function
on the source nodes   total alignments do not impose any constraints on the target nodes 
which can therefore be linked to an arbitrary number of source nodes  including none  total
alignments are the most permissive alignment class  in contrast to perfect matchings and
edge covers  constituents in the target sentence can be left unaligned  total alignments can
    the general definition of edge covers also allows many to many alignments  however  optimal edge covers
according to equation     cannot be many to many  since the weight of edge covers with many to many
alignments can never be minimal  from each many to many edge cover  one edge can be removed 
resulting in an edge cover with a lower weight

c t ut

due to the independence of source nodes  this local optimization results in a globally optimal
alignment  the time complexity of this procedure is quadratic in the number of constituents 
o  us   ut    
an example is shown in figure  c  where source constituents     and     correspond
to target constituent      and source constituents        correspond to      target constituents     and     are not aligned  the quality of total alignments relies heavily on
the underlying word alignment  since there is little competition between edges  there is a
tendency to form alignments mostly with high  similarity  scoring target constituents  in
practice  this means that potentially important  but idiosyncratic  target constituents with
low similarity scores will be left unaligned 
    noise reduction
as discussed in section    noise elimination techniques are an integral part of projection
architectures  although our constituent based model will not be overly sensitive to noise 
we expect the syntactic information to compensate for alignment errors  the word based
model will be more error prone since it relies solely on automatically obtained alignments
for transferring semantic roles  below we introduce three filtering techniques that either
correct or discard erroneous projections 
      filling the gaps
according to our definition of projection in equation      the span of a projected role r
corresponds to the union of all target units that are aligned to source units labeled with r 
this definition is sufficient for constituent based projection models  where roles rarely span
more than one constituent but will yield many wrong alignments for word based models
where roles will typically span several source units  i e   words   due to errors and gaps in
the word alignment  the target span of a role will often be a non contiguous set of words 
we can repair non contiguous projections where the first and last word has been projected
correctly by applying a simple heuristic which fills the gaps in a target role span  let pos
be the index of a word token t in a given sentence  and by extension the set of indices for
a set of words  the target span of role r without any gaps is then defined as 
acc
t  r     u   min pos at  r     pos u   max pos at  r   

    

we apply this heuristic to all word based models in this article 
      word filtering
this technique removes words form a bi sentence prior to projection according to certain
criteria  we apply two intuitive instantiations of word filtering in our experiments  the
first removes non content words  i e   all words which are not adjectives  adverbs  verbs 
or nouns  from the source and target sentences  since alignments for non content words

figure    argument filtering  predicate in boldface  potential arguments in boxes  
are notoriously unreliable and may negatively impact the similarity computations  the
second filter removes all words which remain unaligned in the output of the automatic word
alignment  both filters aim at distinguishing genuine word alignments from noisy ones and
speed up the computation of semantic alignments 
      argument filtering
our last filter applies only to constituent based models defined over full parse trees  previous
work in shallow semantic parsing has demonstrated that not all nodes in a tree are equally
probable as semantic roles for a given predicate  xue   palmer         in fact  assuming a
perfect parse  there is a set of likely arguments  to which almost all semantic roles should
be assigned  this set of likely arguments consists of all constituents which are a child
of some ancestor of the predicate  provided that  a  they do not dominate the predicate
themselves and  b  there is no sentence boundary between a constituent and its predicate 
this definition covers long distance dependencies such as control constructions for verbs  or
support constructions for nouns  and can be extended to accommodate coordination  we
apply this filter to reduce the size of the target tree  in the example in figure    all tree
nodes are removed except the np kim and the s punktlich zu kommen 
    discussion
we have presented a framework for the bilingual projection of semantic roles which is based
on the notion of semantic alignment  we have discussed two broad instantiations of the
framework  namely word based and constituent based models  in the latter case  we operationalize the search for an optimal semantic alignment as a graph optimization problem 
specifically  each bi sentence is conceptualized as a bipartite graph  its nodes correspond
to the syntactic constituents of the bi sentence  and its weighted edges to the cross lingual
pairwise similarity between constituents  assumptions about the semantic correspondence
between the languages are formalized as constraints on the graph structure 
we have also discussed three families of constraints  perfect matching forces correspondences between english and german constituents to be bijective  in contrast  total alignments assume a looser correspondence by leaving constituents on the target side unaligned 
edge covers occupy a middle ground  assuming that all constituents must be aligned without strictly enforcing one to one alignments  while perfect matching is linguistically implausible  by assuming no structural divergence between languages  it can overcome word
alignment errors  total alignments can model structural changes and are therefore linguis

tically more appropriate  but at the same time more sensitive to alignment errors  finding
an optimal alignment corresponds to finding the optimal subgraph consistent with our constraints  efficient algorithms exist for this problem  finally  we have introduced a small

   experiments
we now describe our evaluation of the framework developed in section    we present two
experiments  both of which consider the projection of semantic roles from english sentences
onto their german translations  and evaluate them against german gold standard role annotation  experiment   uses gold standard data for both syntactic and semantic annotation 
this oracle setting assesses the potential of role projection on its own  separating the errors due to translational divergence and our modeling assumptions from those incurred by
preprocessing  e g   parsing and automatic alignment   experiment   investigates a more
practical setting which employs automatic tools for syntactic and semantic parsing  thus
approximating the conditions of large scale role projection on parallel corpora 
    setup
      data

randomly shuffled and split into a development and a test set  each     of the data  
table   reports the number of tokens  sentences  frames  and arguments in the development

used the entire english german europarl bitext as training data to induce alignments for
both directions  source target  target source   with the default giza   settings  following
common practice in machine translation  the alignments were symmetrized using the intersection heuristic  koehn  och    marcu         which is known to lead to high precision
alignments  we also produced manual word alignments for all sentences in our corpus

      method
we implemented the four models shown in table   on their own and with the filtering
techniques introduced in section      this resulted in a total of sixteen models  all of which
were evaluated on the development set  results for the best performing models were next
validated on the test set  we found the practical runtime of our experiment to be dominated
by input output xml processing rather than the optimization problem itself 
in both experiments  constituent based models were compared against the word based
model  which we treat as a baseline  this latter model is relatively simple  projection relies
exclusively on word alignments  it does not require syntactic analysis  and has linear time
complexity  it thus represents a good point of comparison for models that take linguistic
knowledge into account 
      evaluation measure
we measure model performance using labeled precision  recall  and f  in the exact
match condition  i e   both the label and the span of the projected english role have to
match the german gold standard role to count as a true positive  we also assess whether differences in performance are statistically significant using stratified shuffling  noreen        
an instance of assumption free approximate randomization testing  see yeh        for a discussion     whenever we discuss changes in f   we refer to absolute  rather than relative 
differences 
      upper bound
our annotation study  see table    section      obtained an inter annotator agreement
of      in the span match condition  annotation of the same roles with the same span  
this number can be seen as a reasonable upper bound for the performance of an automatic
semantic role labeling system within a language  it is more difficult to determine a ceiling
for the projection task  since in addition to inter annotator agreement  we have to take into
account the effect of bilingual divergence  our annotation study did provide an estimate of
the former  but not of the latter  in default of a method for measuring bilingual agreement
on spans  we adopt the monolingual span match agreement as an upper bound for our
projection experiments  note  however  that this upper bound is not strict  a system with
an oracle should be able to outperform it

moderate improvements are observed for constituent based models when non content
words are removed  nc filter   perfmatch performs best in this condition  it is significantly
better than perfmatch  edgecover or total in the no filter condition  p          but significantly worse than all constituent based models in the na filter condition  p          the
nc filter yields significantly worse results for wordbl  p          this is not surprising 
since the word based model cannot recover words that have been deleted by a filter  such
as role initial prepositions or subordinating conjunctions 
note also that combinations of different filtering techniques can be applied to our
constituent  and word based models  for example  we can create a constituent based model
where non aligned and content words are removed as well as non arguments  for the sake
of brevity  we do not present results for filter combinations here as they generally do not
improve results further  we find that combining filters tends to remove a large number of
words  and as a result  good alignments are also removed 
overall  we obtain best performing models when non argument words are removed
 arg filter   arg filter is an aggressive filtering technique  since it removes all constituents
but those likely to occupy argument positions  edgecover and total are significantly better
than perfmatch in the arg filter condition  p          but perform comparably to perfmatch when the na filter is applied  moreover  edgecover and total construct almost
identical alignments  this indicates that the two latter models behave similarly when the
alignment space is reduced after removing many possible bad alignments  despite imposing
different constraints on the structure of the bipartite graph  interestingly  the strict correspondence constraints imposed by perfmatch result in substantially different alignments 
recall that perfmatch attempts to construct a bilingual one to one mapping between arguments  when no direct correspondence can be identified for source nodes  it abstains from
projecting  as a result  the alignment produced by perfmatch shows the highest precision
among all models          which is offset by the lowest recall          these results tie
in with our earlier analysis of constituent alignments  section       where we found that
about one third of the corpus correspondences are of the one to many type  consider the
following example 
    

the charter means  np an opportunity to bring the eu closer to the people  
die charta bedeutet  np eine chance    s die eu den burgern naherzubringen  
the charter means  np a chance    s the eu to the citizens to bring closer  

ideally  the english np should be aligned to both the german np and s  edgecover  which
can model one to many relationships  acts confidently and aligns the np to the german s
to maximize the overlap similarity  incurring both a precision and recall error  perfmatch 
on the other hand  cannot handle one to many alignments and acts cautiously and makes
only a recall error by aligning the english np to an empty node  thus  according to our
evaluation criteria  the analysis of edgecover is deemed worse than that of perfmatch  even
though the former is partly correct 
in sum  filtering improves the resulting projections by making the syntactic analyses
of the source and target sentences more similar to each other  best results are observed in
na filter  perfmatch  and arg filter conditions  total and edgecover   finally  note that
the best models obtain precision figures that are close to or above the upper bound  the

      test set
our experiments on the test set focus on models which have obtained best results on the
development set using a specific filtering technique  in particular  we report performance
for edgecover and perfmatch in the arg filter and na filter conditions  respectively  in
addition  we assess the effect of the automatic word alignment on these models by using
both intersective and manual word alignments 
our results are summarized in table    when intersective alignments are used  lefthand side   edgecover performs numerically better than perfmatch  but the difference is
not statistically significant  this corresponds to our findings on the development set    the
right hand side shows the results when manually annotated word alignments are used  as
can be seen  the performance of wordbl increases sharply from       to        f    this
underlines the reliance of the word based model on clean word alignments  despite this
performance improvement  wordbl still lags behind the best constituent based model by
approximately    f   this means that there are errors made by the word based model that
can be corrected by constituent based models  mostly cases where translation introduced
material in the target sentence that cannot be word aligned to any expressions in the source
sentence or recovered by the filling the gaps heuristic  an example is shown below  where
the translation of clarification as more detailed explanation leads to the introduction of two
german words  die naheren  these words are unaligned at the word level and thus do not
form part of the role when word based projection is used

constituent based models generally profit less from cleaner word alignments  their performance increases by      f   the improvement is due to higher recall  approximately

are used  under noise free conditions it is able to account for one to many constituent alignments  and thus models our corpus better

diathesis alternation  they subcategorize either for a prepositional phrase  x glaubt an y 
x believes in y   or for an embedded clause which must be preceded by the pronominal
adverb daran  x glaubt daran  dass y  x believes that y   even though the pronominal
adverb forms part of the complement clause  and therefore also of the role assigned to it  
it has no english counterpart  in contrast to example      above  the incomplete span dass
y forms a complete constituent  unless it is removed by arg filter prior to alignment  this
error cannot be corrected by the use of constituents 
    experiment    projection with automatic roles
in this experiment  we evaluate our projection models in a more realistic setting  using
automatic tools for syntactic and semantic parsing 
      preprocessing
for this experiment  we use the uncorrected syntactic analyses of the bilingual corpus as
provided by collins        and dubeys        parsers  cf  section       we automatically
assigned semantic roles using a state of the art semantic parser developed by giuglea and
moschitti         we trained their parser on the framenet corpus  release      using their
standard features and not the extended set which is based on propbank and would
have required a propbank analysis of the entire framenet corpus 
we applied the shallow semantic parser to the english side of our parallel corpus to
obtain semantic roles  treating the frames as given    the task involves locating the frame
elements in a sentence and finding the correct label for a particular frame element  table  
shows an evaluation of the parsers output on our test set against the english gold standard
annotation  giuglea and moschitti report an accuracy of       on the role classification
    this decomposition of frame semantic parsing has been general practice in recent role labeling tasks

task  using the standard feature set    our results are not strictly comparable to theirs 
since we identify the role bearing constituents in addition to assigning them a label  our
performance can thus be expected to be worse  since we inherit errors from the frame element
identification stage  secondly  our test set differs from the training data in vocabulary
 affecting the lexical features  and suffers from parsing errors  since giuglea and moschittis
       implementation can handle only verbs  we also assessed performance on the subset of
verbal predicates        of test tokens   the difference between the complete and verbs only
data sets amounts to      f   which represents the unassigned roles for nouns 
      setup
we report results for the word based baseline model  and the best projection models from
experiment    namely perfmatch  na filter  and edgecover  arg filter   we use the the
complete test set  including nouns and adjectives  in order to make our evaluation comparable to experiment   
      results
the results are summarized in table    both perfmatch  na filter  and edgecover
 arg filter  perform comparably at       f   this is approximately    points f  worse
than the results obtained on manual annotation  compare table   to table     wordbls
performance  now       f   degrades less  around    f    since it is only affected by
semantic role assignment errors  however  consistently with experiment    the constituentbased models sill outperform wordbl by more than     f   p          these results
underscore the ability of bracketing information  albeit noisy  to correct and extend word
alignment  although the arg filter performed well in experiment    we observe less of an
effect here  recall that the filter uses not only bracketing  but also dominance information 
and is therefore particularly vulnerable to misparses  like in experiment    we find that
our models yield overall high precision but low recall  precision drops by     f  when
automatic annotations are used  whereas recall drops by      however  note that this drop
includes about    nominal roles that fall outside the scope of the shallow semantic parser 
further analysis showed that parsing errors form a large source of problems in experiment    german verb phrases are particularly problematic  here  the relatively free
word order combines with morphological ambiguity to produce ambiguous structures  since
    see the work of giuglea and moschitti        for an updated version of their shallow semantic parser

   related work
previous work on annotation projection has primarily focused on annotations spanning
short linguistic units  these range from pos tags  yarowsky   ngai         to np chunks
 yarowsky   ngai         dependencies  hwa et al          and word senses  bentivogli  
pianta         a different strategy for the cross lingual induction of frame semantic information is presented by fung and chen         who do not require a parallel corpus  instead 
    it is reasonable to assume that in these sentences  at least the relevant part of the syntactic analysis is
correct 

   

ficross lingual annotation projection for semantic roles

they use a bilingual dictionary to construct a mapping between framenet entries and concepts in hownet  an on line ontology for chinese    in a second step  they use hownet
knowledge to identify monolingual chinese sentences with predicates that instantiate these
concepts  and label their arguments with framenet roles  fung and chen report high accuracy values  but their method relies on the existence of resources which are presumably
unavailable for most languages  in particular  a rich ontology   recently  basili et al        
propose an approach to semantic role projection that is not word based and does not employ syntactic information  using a phrase based smt system  they heuristically assemble
target role spans out of phrase translations  defining phrase similarity in terms of translation probability  their method occupies a middle ground between word based projection
and constituent based projection 
the work described in this article relies on a parallel corpus for harnessing information
about semantic correspondences  projection works by creating semantic alignments between
constituents  the latter correspond to nodes in a bipartite graph  and the search for the best
alignment is cast as an optimization problem  the view of computing optimal alignments
by graph matching is relatively widespread in the machine translation literature  melamed 
      matusov  zens    ney        tiedemann        taskar  lacoste julien    klein        
despite individual differences  most approaches formalize word alignment as a minimumweight matching problem  where each pair of words in a bi sentence is associated with a
score representing the desirability of that pair  the alignment for the bi sentence is the
highest scoring matching under some constraints  for example that matchings must be oneto one  our work applies graph matching to the level of constituents and compares a larger
class of constraints  see section      than previous approaches  for example  taskar et al 
       examine solely perfect matchings and matusov et al         only edge covers 
a number of studies have addressed the constituent alignment problem in the context of
extracting of translation patterns  kaji  kida    morimoto        imamura         however 
most approaches only search for pairs of constituents which are perfectly word aligned  an
infeasible strategy when alignments are obtained automatically  other work focuses on the
constituent alignment problem  but uses greedy search techniques that are not guaranteed to
find an optimal solution  matsumoto  ishimoto    utsuro        yamamoto   matsumoto 
       meyers  yangarber  and grishman        propose an algorithm for aligning parse
trees which is only applicable to isomorphic structures  unfortunately  this restriction limits
their application to structurally similar languages and high quality parse trees 
although we evaluate our models only on the semantic role projection task  we believe
they also show promise in the context of smt  especially for systems that use syntactic
information to enhance translation quality  for example  xia and mccord        exploit
constituent alignment for rearranging sentences in the source language so as to make their
word order similar to that of the target language  they learn tree reordering rules by aligning
constituents heuristically  using an optimization procedure analogous to the total alignment
model presented in this article  a similar approach is described in a paper by collins  koehn 
and kucerova         however  the rules are manually specified and the constituent alignment step reduces to inspection of the source target sentence pairs  the different alignment
    for information on hownet  see http   www keenage com zhiwang e zhiwang html

models presented in this article could be easily employed for the reordering task common
to both approaches 

   conclusions
in this article  we have argued that parallel corpora show promise in relieving the lexical acquisition bottleneck for new languages  we have proposed annotation projection as a means
of obtaining framenet annotations automatically  using resources available for english and
exploiting parallel corpora  we have presented a general framework for projecting semantic
roles that capitalizes on the use of constituent information during projection  and modelled
the computation of a constituent alignment as the search for an optimal subgraph in a
bipartite graph  this formalization allows us to solve the search problem efficiently using
well known graph optimization methods  our experiments have focused on three modeling
aspects  the level of noise in the linguistic annotation  constraints on alignments  and noise
reduction techniques 
we have found that constituent information yields substantial improvements over word
alignments  word based models offer a starting point for low density languages for which
parsers are not available  however  word alignments are too noisy and fragmentary to deliver
accurate projections for annotations with long spans such as semantic roles  our experiments have compared and contrasted three constituent based models which differ in their
assumptions regarding cross lingual correspondence  total alignments  edge covers  and perfect matchings   perfect matchings  a restrictive alignment model that enforces one to one
alignments  performed most reliably across all experimental conditions  in particular  its
precision surpassed all other models  this indicates that a strong semantic correspondence
can be assumed as a modelling strategy  at least for english and german and the parsing
tools available for these languages  as a side effect  the performance of constituent based
models increases only slightly when manual word alignments are used  which means that
near optimal results can be obtained using automatic alignments 
as far as alignment noise reduction techniques are concerned  we find that removing
non aligned words  na filter  and non arguments  arg filter  yields the best results  both
filters are independent of the language pair and make only weak assumptions about the
underlying linguistic representations in question  the choice of the best filter depends on
the goals of projection  removing non aligned words is relatively conservative and tends
to balance precision and recall  in contrast  the more aggressive filtering of non arguments
yields projections with high precision and low recall  arguably  for training shallow semantic
parsers on the target language  johansson   nugues         it is more desirable to have
access to high quality projections  however  there is a number of options for increasing
precision subsequent to projection that we have not explored in this article  one fully automatic possibility is generalization over multiple occurrences of the same predicate to detect
and remove suspicious projection instances  e g  following the work by dickinson and lee
        another direction is postprocessing by annotators  e g   by adopting the annotate
automatically  correct manually methodology used to provide high volume annotation in
the penn treebank project  our models could also be used in a semi supervised setting 
e g   to provide training data for unknown predicates 
   

ficross lingual annotation projection for semantic roles

the extensions and improvements of the framework presented here are many and varied 
firstly  we believe that the models developed in this article are useful for other semantic
role paradigms besides framenet  or indeed for other types of semantic annotation  potential applications include the projection of propbank roles     discourse structure  and
named entities  as mentioned earlier  our models are also relevant for machine translation
and could be used for the reordering of constituents  our results indicate that syntactic
knowledge on the target side plays an important role in projecting annotations with longer
spans  unfortunately  for many languages there are no broad coverage parsers available 
however  it may not be necessary to obtain complete parses for the semantic role projection
task  two types of syntactic information are especially valuable here  bracketing information  which guides projection towards linguistically plausible role spans  and knowledge
about the arguments of sentence predicates  bracketing information can be acquired in an
unsupervised fashion  geertzen         argument structure information could be obtained
from dependency parsers  e g   mcdonald        or partial parsers that are able to identify
predicate argument relations  e g   hacioglu         another interesting direction concerns
the combination of longer phrases  like those provided by phrase based smt systems  with
constituent information obtained from the output of a parser or chunker 
the experiments presented in this article made use of a simple semantic similarity
measure based on word alignment  a more sophisticated approach could have combined
the alignment scores with information provided in a bilingual dictionary  inspired by crosslingual information retrieval  widdows  dorow  and chan        propose a bilingual vector
model  the underlying assumption is that words that have similar co occurrences in a
parallel corpus are also semantically similar  source and target words are represented as
n dimensional vectors whose components correspond to the most frequent content words in
the source language  in this framework  the similarity of any source target word pair can be
computed using a geometric measure such as cosine or euclidean distance  the more recent
polylingual topic models  mimno  wallach  naradowsky  smith    mccallum        offer
a probabilistic interpretation of a similar idea 
in this article  we have limited ourselves to parallel sentences where the frame is preserved  this allows us to transfer roles directly from the source onto the target language
without having to acquire knowledge about possible translational divergences first  a generalization of the framework presented here could adopt a strategy where some form of
mapping is applied during projection  akin to the transfer rules used in machine translation 
thus far  we have only explored models applying the identity mapping  knowledge about
other possible mappings can be acquired from manually annotated parallel corpora  pado
  erk         an interesting avenue for future work is to identify semantic role mappings
in a fully automatic fashion
