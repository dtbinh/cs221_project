people stop smoking good one attempt 

people stop smoking really want stop  encouraging
many good reasons stopping  scales show good
bad things smoking you  tipped favour 

overcoming barriers stopping   

things

it s relaxing
stops stress
enjoy
relieves boredom
stops weight gain
stops craving

things dislike
makes less fit
it s bad example kids
you re addicted
it s unpleasant others
people disapprove
it s smelly habit
it s bad
it s expensive
it s bad others  health

could it   
people really want stop eventually succeed  fact    
million people britain stopped smoking   stayed stopped  
last    years  many found much easier expected 
although don t feel confident would able stop
try  several things favour 




stopped month 
good reasons stopping smoking 
expect support family  friends 
workmates 

said questionnaire might find difficult stop
smoking helps cope stress  many people think
cigarettes help cope stress  however  taking cigarette
makes feel better short while  ex smokers feel calmer
control smoking 
ideas coping stress back page leaflet 
said might find difficult stop would put
weight  people put weight  stop smoking 
appetite would improve would taste food much better 
would wise plan advance you re
reaching biscuit tin time  remember putting weight
overeating problem  no smoking one  tackle later
diet exercise 

finally

table    summary evaluation ka techniques nlg
    directly asking experts knowledge
simplest perhaps obvious ka technique nlg simply ask experts
write texts question  stop sumtime mousam  experts initially
gave us spreadsheets flowcharts describing thought texts generated 
projects  turned experts description texts
generated fact match people actually wrote texts question 
common finding ka  partially due fact difficult experts
introspectively examine knowledge use practice  anderson        
proponents expert oriented ka prefer structured ka techniques 
example  beginning sumtime mousam  one meteorologists gave
us spreadsheet designed  essentially encoded thought
parts weather forecasts generated  the spreadsheet generate complete
weather forecast   analysed logic used spreadsheet  largely based first
version sumtime mousam logic 
one goal analysis create algorithm could decide change
parameter value significant enough mentioned weather
report  spreadsheet used context dependent change thresholds make decision 
example  change wind speed would mentioned
change    knots more  final wind speed    knots less 
change   knots more  final wind speed      
knots 
change    knots more  final wind speed    knots 
context dependent thresholds reflect usage weather reports users  in
case  oil company staff making decisions related north sea offshore oil rigs  
example  user deciding unload supply boat  moderate changes wind
speed dont matter low speeds  because light winds minimal impact supply
boat operations  high speeds  because boat wont even attempt unload
heavy winds   may affect decisions in between speeds  context dependent
   

fireiter  sripada    robertson

thresholds would expected vary according specific forecast recipient 
set consultation recipient 
perspective  two main pieces knowledge encoded algorithm 
   absolute size change determines whether mentioned not 
   threshold significance depends context ultimately user
use information 
      validation direct expert knowledge
checked rules comparing observed corpus analysis
manually written forecasts  section       suggested     probably
correct      may incorrect  particular  linear segmentation model  sripada et al  
       basically looks changes slope rather changes absolute value
parameter  better matches corpus texts  expert designed spreadsheet model
agreed segmentation probably better approach  essentially commented
one reason use absolute size model something
easily comprehensible someone neither programmer expert numerical
data analysis techniques 
words  addition problems introspecting knowledge  perhaps
reasonable expect domain expert able write sophisticated data analysis
algorithm based expertise  issue knowledge needed purely
declarative  many ai applications  need procedural algorithmic
knowledge  must bear mind domain experts may sufficient computational
expertise express knowledge computer algorithm 
      role directly asking experts knowledge
although experts spreadsheet sumtime mousam far ideal  extremely useful starting point  specified initial system could build fairly
easily  produced least vaguely plausible output  much fact happened stop  one doctors gave us flowchart certainly many
weaknesses  useful initial specification relatively easy to build
somewhat plausible system  stop sumtime mousam  indeed nlg
projects involved in  initial prototype system working soon
possible useful developing ideas explaining domain experts
interested parties trying do 
terms types knowledge mentioned section      stop flowchart
sumtime mousam spreadsheet specified domain knowledge  for example 
smokers categorised  domain communication knowledge  for example  use
ranges instead single numbers communicate wind speed   stop flowchart
specify generic communication knowledge english grammar morphology 
author probably believed knew things did  sumtimemousam spreadsheet effect include english grammar rules 
get spreadsheet work  author much confidence them 
   

fiacquiring correct knowledge nlg

summary  think directly asking experts knowledge excellent way
quickly build initial system  especially nlg developers supply communication
knowledge domain expert may possess  initial system place 
probably best use ka techniques  least poorly understood areas
nlg  however  applications solid theoretical basis  expert
simply say build system according theory x  experts direct knowledge may
perhaps needed 
    structured expert oriented ka  think aloud protocols
numerous types structured expert oriented ka techniques  including thinkaloud protocols  sorting  structured interviews  scott et al          focus
think aloud protocols  technique used most  tried
structured ka techniques well  sorting  reiter et al         
describe here  broad conclusions structured ka techniques
similar conclusions think aloud protocols 
think aloud protocol  expert carries task question  in case  writing
text  thinking aloud audio  or video  recorder  used think aloud
protocols stop sumtime mousam  especially important stop 
provided basis content phrasing rules 
simple example think aloud process follows  one doctors wrote
letter smoker tried stop before  managed stop several weeks
starting again  doctor made following comments think aloud transcript 
tried stop smoking before  yes  longest managed
stop ticked one week right three months thats
encouraging managed stop least before 
always said people one two goes likely
succeed future 
included following paragraph letter wrote smoker 
see managed stop smoking one two occasions
gone back smoking  glad know common
people finally stop smoking one two attempts
past finally succeed  show capable
stopping even short period  means much likely
able stop permanently somebody never ever stopped smoking
all 
analysing session  proposed two rules 
 previous attempt stop   message  likely succeed 
 previous attempt stop   message  people stop
unsuccessful attempts first 

   

fireiter  sripada    robertson

final system incorporated rule  based several ka sessions 
one  stated smoker tried stop before  letter included
section confidence building  confidence building section include short
message previous attempts stop  smoker managed quit

recency smokers previous cessation attempt within past   months 
actual text generated rule example letter figure  
although dont feel confident would able stop
try  several things favour

note text produced actual stop code considerably simpler
text originally written expert  fairly common  simplifications
logic used decide whether include message letter not  many cases
due expert much knowledge expertise computer system
 reiter   dale        pp        general  process deriving implementable rules
nlg systems think aloud protocols perhaps art science 
least different experts often write texts different ways 
      validation structured ka knowledge
attempted verify rules acquired stop think aloud sessions performing series small experiments asked smokers comment letter 
compare two versions letter  many rules supported experiments example  people general liked recap smoking likes dislikes  see
good reasons stop      section figure     however  one general negative finding
experiments tailoring rules insufficiently sensitive unusual
atypical aspects individual smokers  smokers probably unusual atypical
way  example  stop letters go medical details smoking  as
none think aloud expert written letters contained information  
seemed right choice many smokers  smokers say would
liked see medical information smoking  another example  again based
think aloud sessions  adopted positive tone try scare smokers 
seemed right smokers  smokers said brutal
approach would effective them 
fact experts tailor letters ways may possibly reflect
fact tailoring would appropriate relatively small number
specific cases considered think aloud sessions     think aloud sessions
experts  looked    different smoker questionnaires    questionnaires considered two experts   may sound lot  drop ocean
consider tremendously variable people are 
comments made smokers stop clinical trial  reiter  robertson    osman        revealed problems think aloud derived rules  example 
decided include practical how to stop information letters people currently intending stop smoking  smoker comments suggest mistake 
   

fiacquiring correct knowledge nlg

fact  experts include information think aloud letters people 
not  decision include information influenced stages
change theoretical model  prochaska   diclemente        behaviour change 
states how to stop advice inappropriate people currently intending stop 
retrospect  decision probably mistake 
repeated two think aloud exercises    months originally performed
them  is  went back one experts gave two questionnaires
analysed    months earlier  asked think aloud writing letters
based questionnaires  letters expert wrote second session
somewhat different ones originally written  preferred smokers
letters originally written  reiter et al          suggests experts
static knowledge sources  learning task writing
tailored smoking cessation letters course project  perhaps
surprise given none experts ever attempted write letters
getting involved project 
      role structured expert oriented ka
structured expert oriented ka certainly useful way expand  refine  generally
improve initial prototypes constructed basis experts direct knowledge  focusing
actual cases structuring ka process  learned many things
experts mention directly  obtained types knowledge mentioned
section      working experts relevant expertise  example stop
acquired domain knowledge  such medical effects smoking  doctors  domain
communication knowledge  such words use  psychologist expertise
writing patient information leaflets  communication knowledge graphic design
layout graphic designer 
however  structured expert oriented ka problems  including particular coverage variability  mentioned above     sessions examined    smoker
questionnaires could possibly give good coverage population smokers  given
complex variable people are  variation  fact different experts wrote
texts different ways made difficult extract rules think aloud protocols 
undoubtably made mistakes regard  giving how to stop information people currently intending stop smoking  perhaps focused
single expert order reduce variation  however  experiences suggested
different experts better different types information  experts changed
time  so might see substantial variation even texts single author  
observations raise doubts wisdom usefulness single expert strategy 
short  complexity nlg tasks means large number structured ka
sessions may needed get good coverage  fact numerous ways
write texts fulfill communicative goal means different experts tend write
differently  makes analysis structured ka sessions difficult

    corpus analysis
recent years great interest natural language processing areas
ai using machine learning techniques acquire knowledge relevant data sets 
example  instead building medical diagnosis system trying understand expert
doctors diagnose diseases  instead analyse data sets observed symptoms actual
diseases  use statistical machine learning techniques determine symptoms
predict disease  similarly  instead building english grammar working
expert linguists  instead analyse large collections grammatical english texts
order learn allowable structures  grammar  texts  collections texts
called corpora natural language processing 
growing interest applying techniques learn knowledge

learning learn paraphrase possibilities  duboue mckeown        used corpus based
machine learning learn np constituents ordered  hardt rambow
       used corpus based machine learning learn rules vp ellipsis 
nlg researchers  mckeown et al          used term corpus

small set texts written explicitly nlg project domain experts  and
hence naturally occurring   certainly valid valuable ka technique 
regard form structured expert oriented ka  ways similar thinkaloud protocols  paper  corpus analysis refers use machine learning
statistical techniques analyse collections naturally occurring texts 
corpus analysis sense word possible stop
collection naturally occurring texts  since doctors currently write personalised
smoking cessation letters   briefly considered analysing example letters produced
think aloud sessions machine learning techniques    
texts  believed would successful learning  especially given
high variability experts  words  perhaps primary strength corpus

particular analysis guaranteed correct need validated  checked

nlg perspective  namely identifying individual variations letting user choose
variation prefers  requires analysing differences individual writers 
best knowledge published nl corpus analyses done this  perhaps
part many popular corpora include author information 
recurring problem corpus derived rules cases writers
produced sub optimal texts particular shorter been 
probably texts quicker write  instance  noticed
parameter changed less steady fashion throughout forecast period 
forecasters often omitted time phrase  example  wind rose steadily speed
      course forecast period covering calendar day  forecasters
might write      rising        instead      rising       midnight 
statistical corpus analysis showed null time phrase common one
contexts  used     cases  next common time phrase  later 
used     cases  accordingly  programmed system omit time phrase
circumstances  however  asked experts comment revise
generated forecasts  section       told us behaviour incorrect 
forecasts useful end users included explicit time phrases rely
readers remembering forecast periods ended  words  example
forecasters wrong thing  course meant rule produced
corpus analysis incorrect 
dont know forecasters this  discussions forecast managers
mistakes  such forecast authors describing wind speed direction
changing time  even actually predicted change different
times  suggested one possible cause desire write forecasts quickly  particular 
numerical weather predictions constantly updated  customers want
forecasts based up to date prediction  limit amount time
available write forecasts

   conclusion
