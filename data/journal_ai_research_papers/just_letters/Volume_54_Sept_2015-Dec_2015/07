   introduction
recently  samantha leung  halpern   leung        suggested representing uncertainty set weighted probability measures  suggested way making decisions
based representation uncertainty  maximizing weighted regret  however 
answer apparently simpler question  given representation uncertainty 
mean event e likely event e    
paper  explain issues  start reviewing halpern leung approach 
frequently observed many situations agents uncertainty adequately described single probability measure  specifically  single
measure may adequate representing agents ignorance  example 
seems big difference coin known fair coin whose bias agent
know  yet agent use single measure represent uncertainty 
cases would seem measure assigns heads probability    
would used 
one approach suggested representing ignorance use set p
probability measures  idea old one  apparently going back work boole

uncertainty general  single number  range numbers  allows us

approach problems  example  consider agent believes
coin may slight bias  thus  although unlikely completely fair 
close fair  represent set probability measures  suppose
agent quite sure bias          could  course  take
p consist measures give heads probability         
agent know possible biases exactly         
consider       possible small   even confident bias
         representation cannot take account possibility
views biases closer     likely biases     
second well known concern  learning  suppose agent initially
considers possible measures gives heads probability         
starts tossing coin  sees that  first    tosses     heads  seems
agent consider bias greater     likely bias less
     use standard approach updating sets probability measures
 halpern         condition measures observation  since coin
tosses viewed independent  agent continue believe probability
next coin toss          observation impact far learning
predict better  set p stays same  matter observation made 
well known solution problems  putting measure uncertainty
probability measures p  idea long history  one special case put
second order probability probability measures  see  good        discussion
approach references  example  agent express fact
bias coin likely close     far      addition 
problem learning dealt straightforward conditioning  approach
leads problems  essentially  seems ambiguity agent might feel
outcome coin toss seems disappeared  example  suppose
agent idea bias is  obvious second order probability use
uniform probability possible biases  cannot talk probability
coin heads  there set probabilities  all  single probability   expected
probability heads      agent idea bias coin
know believe expected probability heads      course  one use
single probability measure describe uncertainty  symmetry considerations dictate
one ascribes equal likelihood heads tails  similarly  one
put single second order probability set possible biases  uniform probability
seems obvious choice  moreover  interest making decisions 
maximizing expected utility using expected probability take
agents ignorance account  kyburg        pearl        even argued
need second order probability probabilities  whatever done
second order probability already done basic probability 
nevertheless  comes decision making  seem useful use approach
represents ambiguity  still maintaining features secondorder probability probabilities  idea goes back least gardenfors sahlin

decision making using representations uncertainty 
leung similarly suggested putting weights probability measure p  since
assumed weights normalized supremum weights   
weights viewed possibility measure  set p finite 
normalize view weights second order probabilities  secondorder probabilities  weights vary time  information acquired

approaches    thus  approach allows learning natural way  if  example 
actual bias coin     example above  matter initial weights 
long     positive weight  weight would almost surely converge  
observations made  weight measures would approach    this 
course  exactly would happen second order probability p 
weights used represent fact probabilities set p
likely others 
essentially others considered representation uncertainty based set
probability weights  leung suggested way using representation
make decisions  however  approach different suggested earlier 
based approach regret  standard approach decision making introduced
 independently  niehans        savage         uncertainty represented
set p probability measures  regret works follows  act

worst case expected regret a  measures pr p  compare acts

making decisions different others mentioned incorporate
likelihood probabilities  moreover  using weights way means cannot
simply replace set weighted probability measures single probability measure 
objections kyburg        pearl        apply 
leung  halpern   leung        show approach seems reasonable
things number examples interest  provide axiomatization decision making
approach  since sets weighted probabilities certainly intended way
representing uncertainty  seems natural ask whether used represent
