abstract
we study the problem of computing possible and necessary winners for partially specified weighted and unweighted tournaments  this problem arises naturally in elections with
incompletely specified votes  partially completed sports competitions  and more generally
in any scenario where the outcome of some pairwise comparisons is not yet fully known 
we specifically consider a number of well known solution conceptsincluding the uncovered set  borda  ranked pairs  and maximinand show that for most of them  possible and
necessary winners can be identified in polynomial time  these positive algorithmic results
stand in sharp contrast to earlier results concerning possible and necessary winners given
partially specified preference profiles 

   introduction
many multi agent situations can be modeled and analyzed using weighted or unweighted
tournaments  prime examples are voting scenarios in which pairwise comparisons between
alternatives are decided by majority rule and sports competitions that are organized as
round robin tournaments  other application areas include webpage and journal ranking 
biology  psychology  and ai  more generally  tournaments and solution concepts on tournaments are used as a mathematical tool for the analysis of all kinds of situations where
a choice among a set of alternatives has to be made exclusively on the basis of pairwise
comparisons 
when choosing from a tournament  relevant information may only be partly available 
this could be because some preferences are yet to be elicited  some matches yet to be played

or certain comparisons yet to be made  in such cases  it is natural to speculate which are
the potential and inevitable outcomes on the basis of the information already at hand 
for tournaments  a number of attractive solution concepts have been proposed  brandt 
brill    harrenstein        laslier         given any such solution concept s  we define
possible winners of a partial tournament g as alternatives that are selected by s in some
completion of g  and necessary winners are alternatives that are selected in all completions 
by a completion we here understand a  complete  tournament extending g 
in this article we address the computational complexity of identifying the possible and
necessary winners for a number of solution concepts whose winner determination problem for tournaments is tractable  we consider five of the most common solution concepts
for tournamentsnamely  condorcet winners  cond   condorcet non losers  cnl   the
copeland set  co   the top cycle  tc    and the uncovered set  uc  and three common
solutions for weighted tournamentsborda  bo   maximin  mm    and ranked pairs  rp   
for each of these solution concepts  we consider the computational complexity of the following problems  deciding whether a given alternative is a possible winner  pw   deciding
whether a given alternative is a necessary winner  nw   as well as deciding whether a
given subset of alternatives equals the set of winners  the winning set  in some completion  pws   these problems can be challenging  as even unweighted partial tournaments
may allow for an exponential number of completions  our results are encouraging  in the
sense that most of the problems can be solved in polynomial time  table   summarizes our
findings 
similar problems have been considered before  for condorcet winners  voting trees
and the top cycle  it has been shown that possible and necessary winners are computable
in polynomial time  konczak   lang        lang et al          the same holds for the
computation of possible copeland winners  a problem that has been considered in the
context of sports tournaments  cook  cunningham  pulleyblank    schrijver        
another more specific setting is also frequently considered within the area of computational social choice and differs from our setting in a subtle but important way that is
worth being pointed out  there  tournaments are assumed to arise from pairwise majority
comparisons on the basis of a profile of individual voters preferences  
since a partial preference profile r need not conclusively settle every majority comparison  it may give rise to a partial tournament only  there are then two natural ways to define
possible and necessary winners for a partial preference profile r and solution concept s as
illustrated in figure    the first is to consider the completions of r and the winners under
s in the corresponding tournaments  the secondcovered by our more general settingis
to consider the completions of the partial tournament g r  corresponding to r and the
winners under s in these  since every tournament corresponding to a completion of r is
also a completion of g r  but not necessarily the other way round  the second definition

gives rise to a stronger notion of a possible winner and a weaker notion of a necessary winner  interestingly  and in sharp contrast to our results  determining these stronger possible
and weaker necessary winners is computationally hard for many voting rules  lang et al  
      xia   conitzer         this contrast has been foreshadowed by the work of lang et
al         and pini  rossi  venable  and walsh         who compared these two ways of
defining possible and necessary winners  both theoretically and experimentally  for three
solution concepts  condorcet winners  voting trees  and the top cycle 
in the context of this article  we do not assume that tournaments arise from majority
comparisons in voting or from any other specific procedure  this approach has a number
of advantages  firstly  it matches the diversity of settings to which solution concepts on
tournaments are applicable  which goes well beyond social choice and voting  for instance 
our results also apply to a question commonly encountered in sports competitions  namely 
which teams can still win the cup and which future results this depends on  cook et al  
      kern   paulusma        b  l  schwartz         secondly   partial  tournaments
provide an informationally sustainable way of representing the relevant aspects of many
situations while maintaining a workable level of abstraction and conciseness  for instance 
in the social choice setting described above  the partial tournament induced by a partial
preference profile is a much more succinct piece of information  and discloses less information  than the preference profile itself  more generally  it gives a canonical way of extending
tournament solutions to incomplete tournaments  a line that has been pursued by brandt 
brill    harrenstein         finally  specific settings may impose restrictions on the feasible
extensions of partial tournaments  the positive algorithmic results in this article can be
used to efficiently approximate the sets of possible and necessary winners in such settings 
where the corresponding problems may be intractable  the voting setting discussed above
serves to illustrate this point 
we also point out that computing possible outcomes has been considered in other domains in social choice for example in matching and allocations  aziz  walsh    xia

figure    this non commutative diagram illustrates the two approaches to possible and
necessary winners of partial preference profiles for majoritarian social choice functions 
first  the completions of the partial profile to full preference profiles are shown in the
bottom left  the corresponding majority tournaments are in the dashed box on the bottom
right  in this work  we start from the partial majority tournament on the top right which
is induced by the partial preference profile  then  we consider all possible completions to
tournaments which are depicted in the solid box on the bottom right

   preliminaries
a partial tournament is a pair g    v  e  where v is a nonempty finite set of alternatives
and e  v  v an asymmetric relation on v   i e    y  x  
  e whenever  x  y   e  if
 x  y   e we say that x dominates y  a tournament t is a partial tournament  v  e  for
which e is also complete  i e   either  x  y   e or  y  x   e for all distinct x  y  v   we
denote the set of all tournaments by t  
let g    v  e  be a partial tournament  another partial tournament g     v     e     is
called an extension of g  denoted g  g    if v   v   and e  e     if e   is complete  g  is
called a completion of g  we write  g  for the set of completions of g  i e  
 g     t  t   g  t   
   

fipossible and necessary winners of partial tournaments

we say an alternative x  v is dominated if  y  x   e for some y  v   and undominated
 
otherwise  we define the dominion of x in g as dg
 x     y  v    x  y   e   and the

 
dominators of x in g as dgs

a partial or complete tournament  v  e  is dominant if every alternative in x dominates
every alternative outside x  for given g    v  e  and x  v   we further write e x for
the set of edges obtained from e by adding all missing edges from alternatives in x to
alternatives not in x  i e  
e x   e    x  y   x  v   y 
  x and  y  x  
  e  
we use e x as an abbreviation for e v  x   and write e x   e x   gx   and gx for
e  x    e  x     v  e x    and  v  e x    respectively  for g    v  e  and x  v   we
use e x and g x to denote the restriction e xx  of e to x and the restriction  x  e x  
of g to x  respectively 
let n be a positive integer  a partial n weighted tournament is a pair g    v  w 
consisting of a finite set v of alternatives and a weight function w   v  v              n 
such that for each pair  x  y   v  v with x    y  w x  y    w y  x   n  we say that
t    v  w  is an n weighted tournament if for all x  y  v with x    y  w x  y    w y  x    n 
we call t a  partial  weighted tournament if it is a  partial  n weighted tournament for
some n  n  the class of n weighted tournaments is denoted by tn   observe that with
each partial   weighted tournament  v  w  we can associate a partial tournament  v  e  by
setting e     x  y   v   w x  y        thus   partial  n weighted tournaments can be seen
to generalize  partial  tournaments  and we may identify t  with t  
the notations g  g  and  g  can be extended naturally to partial n weighted tournaments g    v  w  and g     v     w    by letting  v  w    v     w    if v   v   and
w x  y   w   x  y  for all x  y  v   and  g     t  tn   g  t   
for given g    v  w  and x  v   we further define wx such that for all x  y  v

n  w y  x  if x  x and y 
  x 
 x  y   
w x  y 
otherwise 

and set wx   wv  x   moreover  wx   wx   gx   and gx are defined in the obvious
way 
we use the term solution concept for functions s that associate with each tournament t    v  e   or with each weighted tournament t    v  w   a choice set s t    v    a
solution concept s is called resolute if  s t        for each tournament t   in this article we
will consider the following solution concepts  condorcet winners  cond   condorcet nonlosers  cnl   copeland  co   top cycle  tc    and uncovered set  uc   for tournaments 
and maximin  mm    borda  bo   and ranked pairs  rp   for weighted tournaments  of
these only ranked pairs is resolute  formal definitions will be provided later in the article 
   we avoid the otherwise natural term tournament solution as in its common definition it requires the
choice set to be nonempty  laslier         this would exclude cond

   possible and necessary winners
a solution concept selects a unique set of alternatives from each complete tournament 
this holds in particular for the completions of a partial tournament  however  for each
completion of a partial tournament  a solution concept may select another set of alternatives  a similar remark concerns weighted tournaments and their completions  for a given
solution concept s  we can thus define the set of possible winners for a partial  weighted 
tournament g as the set of alternatives selected by s from some completion of g  i e   as
 
s t   
pws  g   
t  g 

analogously  the set of necessary winners of g is the set of alternatives selected by s from
every completion of g  i e  
 
nws  g   
s t   
t  g 

we furthermore write
pwss  g     s t     t   g  
for the possible winning sets  i e   the set of sets of alternatives that s selects for the
different completions of g  for the sake of completeness  we also mention necessary winning
sets  a set x is a necessary winning set of a partial tournament g if x   s t   for
all t   t    accordingly  the conditions for a set to be a necessary winning set are very
strong and are satisfied relatively seldom  necessary winning sets can also straightforwardly
be characterized by means of the sets of possible and necessary winners  x is a necessary
winning set if and only if x   pw  g    nw  g   this implies that for the solution
concepts addressed in this article  computational results surrounding necessary winning
sets follow as easy corollaries   we will not further consider necessary winning sets 
note that nws  g  may be empty even if s selects a nonempty set of alternatives for
each tournament t   g   and that the number  pwss  g   of possible winning sets may
be exponential in the number of alternatives of g 
we have the following lemmas  which relate to some useful structural properties of
the sets of possible and necessary winners  the proofs are straightforward and therefore
omitted 
lemma    let s be a solution concept and g and g  partial tournaments  then 
 i  g  g  implies pws  g     pws  g   and
 ii  g  g  implies nws  g   nws  g    
we say that a solution concept s refines another solution concept s     denoted s  s     if
s g   s    g  for all g  we find that the following monotonicity properties hold 
   given our results in table    the fact that x is a necessary winning set if and only if x   pw  g   
nw  g  immediately implies that for all concepts apart from ranked pairs deciding whether a set is a
necessary winning set can be achieved in polynomial time  since ranked pairs is resolute  every set in
nwsrp has to be a singleton  x  and  x   pwsrp if and only if x  nwrp   consequently  the
problem of deciding whether a set x is contained in nwsrp is conp complete

lemma    let s and s   be solution concepts and g and g  partial tournaments  then 
 i  s  s   implies pws  g   pws    g   and
 ii  s  s   implies nws  g   nws    g  
the next lemma concerns the way in which the sets of possible and necessary winners can
be defined in terms of one another

deciding membership in the sets pws  g   nws  g   and pwss  g  for a given solution

winning set  outputting the set pwss of possible winning sets may be much more difficult 
because pwss may be of exponential size  
for irresolute solution concepts  pwss may appear a more complex problem than
pws   we are  however  not aware of a generic polynomial time reduction from pws to
pwss   the relationship between all of these problems may also be of interest for the
classic possible winner setting with partial preference profiles 
for complete tournaments t we have  t      t   and thus pws  t     nws  t     s t  
and pwss  t      s t     as a consequence  for solution concepts s with an np hard
winner determination problemlike banks  slater  and the tournament equilibrium set
the problems pws   nws   and pwss are np hard as well   we therefore restrict our
attention to solution concepts for which winners can be computed in polynomial time 

   unweighted tournament solutions
in this section  we consider the following well known solution concepts for unweighted tournaments  condorcet winners  condorcet non losers  the copeland set  the top cycle  and
the uncovered set  we will use the partial tournament depicted in figure   i   as a running
example

    condorcet winners and condorcet non losers
condorcet winners and condorcet non losers are fundamental solution concepts and will
provide a nice warm up  an alternative x  v is a condorcet winner of a complete tournament t    v  e  if it dominates all other alternatives  i e   if  x  y   e for all y  v    x  
the set of condorcet winners of tournament t will be denoted by cond t    obviously
this set is always either a singleton or empty  an alternative x is a condorcet loser in t if it
is dominated by every other alternative  i e   if  y  x   e for all y  v    x   consequently 
x is a condorcet non loser in t    v  e  if x is not a condorcet loser in t or v    x  
the set of condorcet non losers of a tournament t will be denoted by cnl t    obviously
this set has always cardinality  v   or  v      
   for instance  if g    v    then pws tc  g      x  v    x         even though pwstc is in p
 theorem    
   this does not exclude the possibility that computing some  arbitrary  possible winner or possible winning
set for some of these solution concepts could be done in polynomial time 

   

fipossible and necessary winners of partial tournaments

let g    v  e  be a partial tournament  if some alternative x is dominant in g  then x
will obviously be the condorcet winner in all completions of g  on the other hand  if for
some y  v    x  it is not the case that  x  y   e  there is some completion of g in which x
is not a condorcet winner  hence 
x  nwcond  g  if and only if  x  y   e for all y  v    x 
and
x  pwcond  g  if and only if  y  x   e for no y  v    x  
obviously  the criteria on the right hand side of the equivalences can be checked in polynomial time 
we now turn to the problem pwscond   each of the sets in pwscond  g  is either
a singleton or the empty set  and determining membership for a singleton is obviously
tractable  checking whether   pwscond  g  is not quite that simple  the following
result gives an exact characterization of pwscond  g   which is interesting in its own
right 
lemma    let u be the set of undominated alternatives of a partial tournament g    v  e  
then 
 for every alternative x  v    x   pwscond  g  if and only if x  u  
    pwscond  g  if and only if     u      and u is dominant 
proof  since a complete tournament has either one condorcet winner or none  any set in
pwscond  g  has cardinality   or    clearly   x   pwscond  g  if and only if x  u  
it remains to be shown that pwscond  g  contains  if and only if u     or  u       or
    u      and u is not dominant 
if u     cond t      for every t   g   it follows that   pwscond  g   if
 u       consider a directed cycle c  u  u that visits every alternative in u    then 
the set of undominated alternatives in g     v  e  c  is empty  it again follows that
  pwscond  g  
if u    x  and x is dominant  then x is a condorcet winner in every t   g   therefore 

  pwscond  g  
if u    x  and  x  is not dominant  then  x  y  
  e for some y    x  consider a
completion of g containing  y  x   in this completion  the set of undominated alternatives
is empty  it follows that   pwscond  g  
if u    x  y  and  x  y  is dominant  then for every t   g   either  x  y   t and x is
a condorcet winner in t   or  y  x   t and y is a condorcet winner in t   it follows that

  pwscond  g  
finally  if u    x  y  and  x  y  is not dominant  then for some z    x  y we have
 x  z  
  e or  y  z  
  e  without loss of generality  assume  x  z  
  e  consider a
completion of g containing  z  x  and  x  y   such a completion exists  because  x  z  
  e 
and  y  x  
  e  since x  u    in this completion  the set of undominated alternatives is
empty  it follows that   pwscond  g  
   the cycle c is not a subgraph of g  in fact  g u does not contain any edges

we are now in a position to prove the following theorem 
theorem    pwcond   nwcond   and pwscond can all be solved in polynomial time 
the results for pwcond and nwcond also follow from corollary   of konczak and
lang        
we further note that theorem   is a corollary of corresponding results for maximin
in section      the reason is that a condorcet winner is the maximin winner of a  weighted tournament  and a tournament does not admit a condorcet winner if and only if
all alternatives are maximin winners 
we conclude this section by observing that the problems pwcnl   nwcnl   and
pwscnl are reducible to nwcond   pwcond   and pwscond   respectively  it can
straightforwardly be checked that for all partial tournaments g    v  e  with  v      
and all x  v  
x  pwscnl  g  if and only if v   x  pwscond  g    
where g     v  e     is g with all of its set edges inverted  i e   e       x  y     y  x   e  
it also follows that 
pwcnl  g    v   nwcond  g     and
nwcnl  g    v   pwcond  g    
since the complement of a set can be computed in polynomial time and edges can
be reversed in polynomial time as well  we obtain the following result as a corollary of
theorem   
theorem    pwcnl   nwcnl   and pwscnl can all be solved in polynomial time 
as an example  consider the partial tournament g depicted in figure   i   in which there
is no dominating alternative while the set of undominated alternatives in g is u    a  b  
therefore

    copeland
copelands solution selects alternatives based on the number of other alternatives they
dominate  define the copeland score of an alternative x in tournament t    v  e  as
sco  x  t      dt   x   
the set co t   then consists of all alternatives that have maximal copeland score 
for an illustrative example  consider again the partial tournament g shown in figure   i    in completions of g where a  respectively b  is a condorcet winner  a  respectively b  is the sole copeland winner as in the completion shown in figure   ii    the only
two completions in which neither a nor b is a condorcet winner are
  a  c    a  d    b  a    b  d    c  b    c  d   
where the set of copeland winners is  a  b  c   and
  a  c    a  d    b  a    b  d    c  b    d  c   
also depicted in figure   iii    where the set of copeland winners is  a  b   therefore 
pwco  g     a  b  c  
nwco  g      and
pwsco  g      a    b    a  b    a  b  c   
since copeland scores coincide with borda scores in the case of   weighted tournaments 
the following is a direct corollary of the results in section      
theorem    pwco   nwco   and pwsco can all be solved in polynomial time 
from pwsco being solvable in polynomial time  we get the following corollary  which
may be of independent interest to graph theorists 
corollary    there exists a polynomial time algorithm to check whether a partial tournament admits a regular completion  i e   a completion in which every alternative has the
same out degree 
to see this  merely observe that a completion t    v  e  of a partial tournament is
regular if and only if co t     v  
    top cycle
the top cycle of a tournament t    v  e   denoted by tc  t    is the unique minimal
dominant subset of v  
lang et al  have shown that possible and necessary winners for tc can be computed
efficiently by greedy algorithms  lang et al         corollaries   and     still  we give the
following characterization that will prove useful when we come to consider the possible
   pwco can alternatively be solved via a polynomial time reduction to maximum network flow  cook et

winning sets under tc   an alternative is a possible tc  winner if and only if it can
reach every other alternative via existing or unspecified edges  formally  given a partial
tournament g    v  e   an alternative x  v is in pwtc  g  if and only if for every other
alternative y  v   there exists a path x    x    x            xk with x   x    y   xk   and such that
 xi     xi   
  e for all i              k      we call such a path a possible path  if a possible
path from x to y exists  we denote that by x
y 
observe that for any pair a and b of alternatives in a partial tournament g    v  e  
if there is no possible path from a to b  then  b  a   e  the set of alternatives that can
reach every other alternative via a possible path in a partial tournament g    v  e  is also
known as the good set  good        and is denoted by go g    it follows from the above
that go g  is polynomial time computable  moreover  we have the following lemma 
lemma    let g    v  e  be a partial tournament with  v       go g    v   and x
and y alternatives such that  x  y    y  x  
  e  let further gxy    v  e    x  y    and
gyx    v  e    y  x     then  go gxy     v or go gyx     v  
proof  assume for contradiction that both go gxy   and go gyx   are strict subsets
of v   clearly  we have x  go gxy   and y  go gyx    moreover  we claim that x 
 
go gyx   and y 
  go gxy    to see why x 
  go gyx   holds  assume for contradiction
that x  go gyx    then  there is a possible path from x to y in gyx   this path can
be used to replace the edge  x  y   which is available for possible paths in g  but not
in gyx    therefore  there is a possible path between two alternatives in gyx whenever
there is one in g  since go g    v   we have go gyx     v as well  contradicting our
assumption  an analogous argument shows that y 
  go gxy   
having established that x  go gxy     go gyx   and y  go gyx     go gxy   
we know that there is no possible path from x to y in gyx   and neither is there a possible
path from y to x in gxy   now consider some z  v    x  y   we have that either
 i   x  z   e and  y  z   e  or
 ii   z  x   e and  z  y   e 
as otherwise there would be either a possible path from x to y in gyx or a possible path
from y to x in gxy  
if  i   recall that we have assumed that go g    v   hence  in g there are possible
paths z
x and z
y  observe that we may assume that either the possible path from z
to x does not contain  y  x   or the possible path from z to y does not contain  x  y   in the
former case  y  z
x is a possible path in gxy   in the latter case  x  z
y is a possible
yx
path in g
  thus  either case yields a contradiction 
if  ii   go g    v implies that there are possible paths x
z and y
z in g  and
we may assume that either the possible path from x to z does not contain  y  x  or the
possible path from y to z that does not contain  x  y   in the former case  there is a possible
path x
z  y in gxy   in the latter case  there is a possible path y
z  x in gyx   again 
either case leads to a contradiction  this concludes the proof 
   equivalently  the good set of a partial tournament g    v  e  is the unique minimal dominant subset
of v   the good set is also known as the smith set  smith        and getcha  t  schwartz        

   

fipossible and necessary winners of partial tournaments

we are now ready to show that pwstc can be solved efficiently  note that we not only
have to check that there exists a completion such that the set in question is dominating 
but also that there is no smaller dominating set 
theorem    pwstc can be solved in polynomial time 
proof  let the set under consideration be x  the set x cannot be empty as t c t      
for every t   g   if  x       then the problem pwstc is equivalent to pwcond   if
 x       then the answer is already no because the top cycle is never of size two  we may
therefore assume that  x     
consider the graph gx   if x does not dominate v   x in gx   then x 
  pwstc  g 
because an alternative in v   x beats an alternative in x  therefore  we now need to check
whether x  pwstc  g x    i e   whether x is a possible top cycle set in the partial
tournament g restricted to x  in essence  the problem pwstc is reduced to the restricted
problem pwstc for the set of all alternatives 
we prove that v  pwstc  g  if and only if go g    v   obviously  if v    go g 
then v 
  pwstc  g   for the other direction  we start with a partial tournament g  
 v  e  with go g    v   by iteratively applying lemma    new edges can successively be
added to g while maintaining go g    v until g is a tournament 
as an example  we again consider the partial tournament g depicted in figure   i    for
which we show that
pwtc  g     a  b  c  d  
nwtc  g      and
pwstc  g      a    b    a  b  c    a  b  c  d   
the result for pwtc  g  is witnessed by the completion shown in figure   iii   where every
alternative is in the top cycle  for nwtc  g   the statement follows from the observation that for every alternative  there exists a completion in which another alternative is
a condorcet winner  regarding pwstc  g   we consider each subset separately  since
pwscond  pwstc   we get that  a  and  b  are in pwstc  g   for  a  b  c   we apply
the result shown in the second paragraph of the proof of theorem    a  b  c are undominated
by d  and the good set of g  a b c  is  a  b  c   likewise  the good set of g is  a  b  c  d  
it remains to be shown that the other subsets of size three are not in pwstc  g   to this
end  note that the good set of g  a b d  is only  a  b  and that neither  a  c  d  nor  b  c  d 
is undominated in g 
    uncovered set
given a tournament t    v  e   an alternative x  v is said to cover another alternative
y  v if dt   y   dt   x   i e   if every alternative dominated by y is also dominated by x 
the uncovered set of t   denoted uc  t    then is the set of alternatives that are not covered
by any other alternative  a useful alternative characterization of the uncovered set is via
the two step principle  an alternative is in the uncovered set if and only if it can reach
every other alternative in at most two steps   formally  x  uc  t   if and only if for all
   in graph theory  vertices satisfying this property are often called kings

two step dominion de
 de
 x   of an alternative x by de
 x  
we first consider pwuc   for which we check for each alternative whether it can be
reinforced to reach every other alternative in at most two steps 
theorem    pwuc can be solved in polynomial time 
proof  for a given partial tournament g    v  e  and an alternative x  v   we check
whether x is in uc  t   for some completion t   g  
consider the graph g     v  e      where e    is derived from e as follows  first  we
let d   x  grow as much as possible by letting e     e x   then  we do the same for its
 
two step dominion by defining e    as e  de   x    we claim that x  pwuc  g  if and only
 
  
if v    x   de
    x   de     x  
   first  let x  pwuc  g   by definition  there is a completion  v  e    such that for
 
  
  
all y  v    x  we have y  de
  x   de   x   but from the definition of e   it follows that
  
 
  
  
 
 
de   x   de     c  and de   x   de     x   consequently  y is also in de     x   de
    x  
  
 
   for the other direction  let y  v    x   y  de     x   de     x   in any completion
t of g    x is trivially in uc  t    implying that x  pwuc  g  
a similar argument yields the following 
theorem    nwuc can be solved in polynomial time 
proof  for a given partial tournament g    v  e  and an alternative x  v   we check
whether x is in uc  t   for all completions t   g  
consider the graph g     v  e      with e    defined as follows  first  let e     e x   then 

expand it to e      e  de   x    intuitively  this makes it as hard as possible for x to beat
alternatives outside of its dominion in two steps  we claim that x  nwuc  g  if and only
 
  
if v    x   de
    x   de     x  or equivalently  if and only if for all y    x there is a path
of length one or two from x to y in g 
   first  let x  nwuc  g   assume for contradiction that there exists a y  v    x 
  
 

 
such that y 
  de
    x   de     x   then  in any completion  v  e   of g   x cannot reach y

in two steps and consequently x 
  uc  v  e    a contradiction 
  
 
in any completion  v  e    of g  we
   now  let v    x    de
    x   de     x  
 
 
  
  
have de     x   de   x  and de     x   de   x   consequently  x  uc  v  e    and
x  nwuc  g  
 
  
as it can be checked in polynomial time whether v    x   de
    x   de     x   this
completes the proof 
consider the partial tournament g from figure   i   as an example  it can be
checked that nwuc  g        for pwuc   we consider each alternative separately 
for a  we have e     e a     a  b    a  c    a  d    b  d    and e      e     therefore
 
de
likewise  b  pwuc  g   now  for c  we
    a     b  c  d  and a  pwuc  g  
have e       a  c    a  d    b  d    c  b    c  d   and e        a  c    a  d    b  d    c  b    c  d    b  a

where pwsuc  g  is obtained by an ad hoc argument 
for all solution concepts considered so farcondorcet winners  condorcet non losers 
copeland  and the top cyclepw and pws have the same complexity  one might wonder
whether a result like this holds more generally  and whether there could be a polynomialtime reduction from pws to pw  in the following we find that this is not the case  unless
p np  and show that pwsuc   the problem of deciding whether a subset of alternatives of
a partial tournament g is the uncovered set of some completion of g  is np complete  the
proof of this result proceeds by a reduction of sat and involves the construction of partial
tournaments on the basis of formulas in conjunctive normal form  for each propositional
variable p and every clause c  there is a gadget that is based on the partial tournament gp
depicted in figure   i   
it is not hard to see that there are exactly two completions of gp with  p   p      
as the uncovered set  the first  t   or positive completion  is depicted in figure   ii  
and the other  t  or negative completion  in figure   iii    to verify that there are no
other ones  consider an arbitrary completion  v  e     of gp   then  either  p   p     e  
or  p    p    e     in the former case  observe that p must be covered by    hence 
    p    e   and  c  p    e     it now follows that c is covered by p    therefore  also
 p        e   and  p    c   e     this entails that p covers p  and  with  p    p     e   we
finally obtain  p   p     e     the resulting tournament is t     by an analogous argument
it can be seen that t  results if we assume that  p   p     e     in the construction below 
the positive completion t   will correspond to setting propositional variable p to true and
the negative completion t  to setting p to false 
besides c  the construction also involves an alternative c for each clause  how c is related
to the other alternatives in gp depends on whether the respective clause contains p or p as
a literal  as we may assume that no clause contains both p and p  three cases remain  which

every clause c the alternatives p   p    p   p       c  and c are organized as in figure    the
remaining edges are set in such a way as to make the construction work properly  formally 
define the edge set e such that for every propositional variable p and every clause c 
 p dominates d and d for every clause d as well as q    q     q    q   for every q    p 
 p  dominates    p  and p along with q    q     and d for all q    p and all clauses d 
moreover  for every clause d  alternative p  dominates alternative d if and only if p
occurs as a literal in clause d 
 p dominates    p  and p  along with q    q     and d for all q    p and all clauses d 
moreover  for every clause d  alternative p dominates alternative d if and only if p

 p  dominates    p  and p   
 p dominates    p  and p  
 c dominates    q    and q   for every variable q  and d for every clause d    c  moreover 
for very variable q  alternative c dominates q   whenever c does not contain q as a literal

moreover  for every variable p  the edges among p   p    and   are missing as well as those

   first assume that  is satisfiable and let v be the satisfying assignment for   for

 q    c   accordingly  q  is covered by q     q   by    and  provided that q occurs as a literal
in c  c also by q    observe that this procedure induces a well defined completion of g  
which we denote by tv   as v satisfies   every clause contains a literal p such that v sets p to
true or a literal q such that v sets q to false  it follows that for every clause c  alternative c
is covered in tv   observe that p and p  are covered in tv irrespective of whether v sets p

via which alternative r can reach c  the minus    in the entry for   and   means that  
cannot reach   in at most two steps  no matter how g is completed  thus    is covered
by   in every completion of g   we may assume that no clause contains both a literal and
its negation  that there are at least two clauses  and that every literal occurs in at least one
clause 
to true or false  hence  c  p    p 
  uc  tv    recalling that   covers   and x  uc  t   for
all completions t of g   we may conclude that uc  tv     x  as desired 
   for the opposite direction  assume that there is some completion t of g such
that for every propositional variable p and for every clause c  alternatives p   p    and c
are covered in t   i e   such that uc  t     x  define assignment vt such that it sets
propositional variable p to true if there is some clause c containing p as a literal such
that p  covers c in t and sets p to false  otherwise  observe that vt is a well defined
assignment 
we now show that vt satisfies every clause in  and hence  itself as well  to this end
consider an arbitrary clause c  by assumption  c is covered by some alternative x  recall
that c reaches all alternatives in at most two steps except alternatives p  such that p occurs
as a literal in c and alternatives q  such that q occurs as a literal in c  also see table    
hence  either x   p  for some variable p occurring as a literal in c or x   q  for some
variable q such that q occurs as a literal in c 
if the former  vt sets p to true and consequently also satisfies clause c  if the latter  we
have to demonstrate that vt sets q to false and in that way satisfies clause c  it suffices to

the proof of theorem   

show that there is no clause d such that q   covers d in t   to this end  consider an arbitrary
clause d  we prove that q   does not cover d and refer to figure   for an illustration of our
reasoning  let et denote the edge set of t   as t extends g   obviously e  et   first
recall that we have assumed that q  covers c in t   as  c      e   then also  q        et  
since  q    q     e   it can therefore not be the case that   covers q  in t   reaching every
other alternative in at most two steps in g   alternative q  must therefore be covered by q  
in t   as  q    q     e   it now follows that  q     q     et   since  moreover   q     q      e  
we also have that q  does not cover q   in t   rather  q   reaches every alternative except  
in at most two steps in t   it follows that q   is covered by    moreover  since  q     q      e  
also     q      et   now consider alternative d and observe that  by construction   d      e  
thus  d can reach q   in two steps and we may conclude that q   does not cover d in t   it
follows that vt sets q to false and thus satisfies c  as desired 

   weighted tournament solutions
we now turn to weighted tournaments  and in particular consider the solution concepts
borda  maximin  and ranked pairs 
    borda
the borda solution  bo  is typically used in a voting context with a set n of n voters 
where each voter i is equipped with a linear ranking i as its individual preference  then 
each alternative receives  v      points for each time it is ranked first by a voter   v     
points for each time it is ranked second  and so forth  the total number of points of an
alternative x constitute its borda score sbo  x   i  in   which can be written as
sbo  x   i  in    

x

  y  v   x i y

more generally  the borda solution can be extended to n weighted tournaments where the
borda scores are defined as
x
sbo  x   v  w    
w x  y 
yv   x 

and bo v  w  again chooses those alternatives with maximum borda score  this subsumes
the voting setting because
x
sbo  x   i  in    
  i  n   x i y     sbo  x   v  w  
yv

if the weight on the edge from x to y is defined to be the number of voters who rank x
higher than y  i e  
w x  y      i  n   x i y   
before we proceed  we define the notion of a b matching  which will be used in the proofs
of several of our results in this section  let h    vh   eh   be an undirected graph with
vertex capacities b   vh  n    then  a b matching of h is a function m   eh  n  such
that for all v  vh  
x
m e   b v  
e e  eh  ve   

p
the size of b matching m is defined as
eeh m e   it is easy to see that if b v     
for all v  vh   then a maximum size b matching is equivalent to a maximum cardinality
matching  in a b matching problem with upper and lower bounds  there further is a function
a   vh  n    a feasible b matching then is a function m   eh  n  such that
x
a v  
m e   b v  
e e  eh  ve   

if h is bipartite  then the problem of computing a maximum size feasible b matching
with lower and upper bounds can be solved in strongly polynomial time  schrijver       
ch       we will use this result to show that pwbo and pwsbo can both be solved in
polynomial time  while the following result for pwbo can also be shown using theorem    
of kern and paulusma         we still give a direct proof that will then be extended to
pwsbo  
theorem    pwbo can be solved in polynomial time 
proof  observe that bo satisfies the following  weak  monotonicity property  making a
winner x stronger by increasing weight on an edge to another alternative  cannot make x a
losing alternative 
let g    v  w  be a partial n weighted tournament  x  v   by the previous observation 
x  pwbo  g  if and only if x  pwbo  gx    therefore  we can assume w l o g that
g   gx   i e   all edges incident to x are completely specified already  moreover  if there
exists a y  v    x  such that sbo  y  gx     sbo  x  gx    then we already know that
x
  pwbo  g   we thus assume that sbo  y  gx    sbo  x  gx   for all y  v    x

theorem    pwsbo can be solved in polynomial time 
proof  let g    v  w  be a partial n weighted tournament  and x  v   we give a
polynomial time algorithm for checking whether x  pwsbo  g   via a bisection method
and a reduction to the problem of computing a maximum b matching of a graph with lower
and upper bounds 
assume that there is a target borda score s and a completion t   g  with x 
pwsbo  t   and sbo  x  t     s for all x  x  then  the maximum possible borda score of
an alternative not in x is s    
for a given target borda score s   we construct a bipartite graph h    vh   eh   with
vertices vh   v  e x   where
e x     i  j   v   i    j  
and edges
eh     i   i  j      i  j   v  i    j  w i  j    w j  i    n  
only the lower bounds as   vh  n  and upper bounds bs   vh  n  depend on s and
are defined as follows  for vertices x  x  lower and upper bounds coincide and are given
by
as  x    bs  x    s  sbo  x  g  
all other vertices v  vh   x have a lower bound of as  v       upper bounds for these
vertices are defined such that
bs  v    s  sbo  v  g    
for v  v   x  and
bs   i  j     n  w i  j   w j  i 
for  i  j   e x  
as in the proof of theorem    it holds that a feasible b matching in h corresponds to
an extension of g  such an extension is a completion t   g  if and only if the b matching
has size
x
   n v    v         
sbo  v  g

which equals the weight not yet used up in g  then  t satisfies x  pwsbo  t   and
sbo  x  t     s for all x  x  if  on the other hand  no s gives rise to a graph that has a
b matching of size   then x   pwsbo  g  
in order to obtain a polynomial time algorithm  we need to check whether there exists a
target score s for which the corresponding graph h with upper and lower bounds admits a
b matching of size   it is easily verified that any such s is contained in the integer interval
i     max sbo  x  g   n  v         
xx

observe that  i  depends on n and thus is not polynomially bounded in the size of g 
checking every integer s  i is therefore not feasible in polynomial time  however  we now
show that we can perform binary search in order to find s efficiently  we need the following
   

fipossible and necessary winners of partial tournaments

two observations about the interval i  for s  i  we say that s admits a feasible b matching
if the corresponding graph h has a feasible b matching 
first  if an s   i admits a feasible b matching  then every s    i with s    s  also
admits a feasible b matching  this is because removing all weight from edges that exceeds
the  reduced  upper bounds gives a feasible b matching for s    
second  with s  as before and   the size of the corresponding maximum feasible bmatching m    there cannot be an s    i with s    s  such that the size    of a maximum
feasible b matching m   for s   is smaller than     this is because either  i   no such m   exists
since not all lower bounds can be met  or  ii   such an m   exists and its size is at least    
to see the latter  note that a decrease in the size of a maximum feasible matching cannot be
caused by upper bounds as bs    v   bs   v  for all v  vh   it remains to be shown that the
increase in as    v  for v  x does not result in a smaller maximum b matching  since the
weight of all edges incident to a vertex in x in the b matching is completely determined by
the bounds and increases from m  to m     a total decrease in size can only be due to edges
 j   i  j   with i  v   x  j  v whose weight is bounded by bs     i  j    m    i   i  j    but
then 
m    i   i  j     m    j   i  j     bs     i  j    bs    i  j    m   i   i  j     m   j   i  j  
and therefore        
these two observations show that i can be partitioned into two non overlapping integer
intervals i  and i    here  each s  i  admits a feasible b matching whose size increases
when s grows  whereas each s  i  does not admit a feasible b matchings  therefore  either
i  is empty and the desired s does not exist  or s   max i    
we can check the existence of s with the following binary search algorithm  let
 imin   imax   be an interval that is initialized to i    maxxx sbo  x  g   n  v         consider
the median value s of this interval  if the corresponding graph h has no feasible b matching 
continue with the interval  imin   s      otherwise  if the maximum feasible b matching has
size at least   return yes  if its size is less than   continue with  s    imax    if  imin   imax  
is empty  return no 
the number of queries of this algorithm is bounded by dlog   i e  dlog  n v  e and 
therefore  polynomial in the size of g 
to conclude this section  we show that nwbo can be solved in polynomial time as well 
it is worth noting that this result does not follow directly from the polynomial time result
for nwbo for the case of preference profiles  xia   conitzer        
theorem     nwbo can be solved in polynomial time 
proof  let g    v  w  be a partial weighted tournament  x  v   we give a polynomial time
algorithm for checking whether x  nwbo  g  
let g   gx   we want to check whether some other alternative y  v    x  can
achieve a borda score of more than s   sbo  x  g   this can be done separately for each
y  v    x  by reinforcing it as much as possible in g  if for some y  sbo  y  gy     s  
then x 
  nwbo  g   if  on the other hand  sbo  y  gy    s for all y  v    x   then
x  nwbo  g

as an example  consider the partial   weighted tournament g in figure   i    the fact
that  a  b  c   pwbo  g  follows already from the completion shown in figure   iv    also
note that this was the only completion in which c was chosen  alternative d is not a possible
borda winner since sbo  d  gd             sbo  a  g   to determine pwsbo  g   we still
have to check which subsets of  a  b  c  are possible winning sets  for singletons  it is easy
to see that only  a  and  b  are in pwsbo  g   for  a  b   we could employ the binary
search method described in theorem    here  we just argue that moving one unit of weight
from  c  d  to  d  c  in the completion shown in figure   iv   gives a completion in which
 a  b  is the winning set  for nwbo  g   it is straightforward to check that no alternative
is a necessary borda winner  altogether  we have that

    maximin
the maximin score smm  x  t   of an alternative x in a weighted tournament t    v  w   is
given by its worst pairwise comparison  i e   smm  x  t     minyv   x  w x  y   the maximin solution  also known as simpsons method and denoted by mm   returns the set of all
alternatives with the highest maximin score 
as an example  consider the partial   weighted tournament depicted in figure   i    it is
easy to see that a  or b  are the unique maximin winners in all completions of ga  or gb   
also  c cannot be a possible maximin winner as it will always have a maximin score of  
whereas a always has at least    similarly  alternative d can never have a higher maximin
score than a  figure   iii   shows a completion in which  a  d  is the set of maximin winners 
if one unit of weight is shifted from  c  b  to  b  c   the resulting completion has  a  b  d  as
the maximin winners  it is also straightforward to find a completion of g a b  with  a  b 
as the set of maximin winners  it is easy to verify that no alternative is a necessary maximin
winner 
together  this gives
pwmm  g     a  b  d  
nwmm  g      and
pwsmm  g      a    b    a  b    a  d    a  b  d   
we first show that pwmm is polynomial time solvable by reducing it to the problem of
finding a maximum cardinality matching of a graph 
theorem     pwmm can be solved in polynomial time 
proof  we show how to check whether x  pwmm  g  for a partial n weighted tournament
g    v  w   consider the graph gx    v  wx    then  smm  x  gx   is the best possible
maximin score x can get among all completions of g  if smm  x  gx    n    then we have
smm  y  t    wx  y  x   n  for every y  v    x  and every completion t   gx    and
therefore x  pwmm  g

figure    example of a   weighted partial tournament and completions relevant for possible
maximin winners 
now consider smm  x  gx     n    we will reduce the problem of checking whether x 
pwmm  g  to that of finding a maximum cardinality matching of an undirected unweighted
graph  which is known to be solvable in polynomial time  edmonds         we want to
find a completion t   gx   such that smm  x  t    smm  y  t   for all y  v    x   in
other words  we want to complete the weights on edges between alternatives in v    x  in
such a balanced way so that x is still a winner  if there exists a y  v    x  such that
smm  y  gx     smm  x  gx    then we already know that x 
  pwmm  g   otherwise 
each y  v    x  derives its maximin score from at least one particular edge  y  z  where
z  v    x  y  and w y  z   smm  x  gx    moreover  it is clear that in any completion  y
and z cannot both achieve a maximin score of less than smm  x  gx   from edges  y  z  and
 z  y  at the same time  let h    vh   eh   be an undirected and unweighted graph with
vertices
vh   v    x     i  j   v   i    j 
and edges
eh     i   i  j     i  v    x   j  v    i   wx  i  j   smm  x  gx    
in this way  if i is matched to  i  j  in h  then i derives a maximin score of less than or
equal to smm  x  gx   from his comparison with j  clearly  the size of h is polynomial

in the size of g  we show that x  pwmm  g  if and only if there exists a matching of
cardinality  v      in h 
   first  assume that x  pwmm  g   then there exists a completion t    v  w   
of gx in which the maximin score of each y  v    x  is at most smm  x  gx     n   
if alternative i derives its maximin score from a comparison with j    i  v    x   i e  
smm  i  t     w   i  j   then j cannot derive its maximin score from a comparison with i
because w   j  i   n  smm  x  gx   implies w   j  i    n    therefore  in h  each i  vh  v
can be matched to a vertex  i  j   vh such that  i  j  is not matched to any other vertex
in vh   the resulting matching in h has cardinality  v      
   now  assume that there exists a matching m of cardinality  v      in h  then 
each i  v    x  has to be matched to an  i  j  where w i  j   smm  x  gx    consider a
completion t    v  w      gx   in which for all  i  j   v  v such that  i   i  j    m   we
set w   i  j    w i  j  and w   j  i    n  w i  j   moreover  the weights of all other edges in t
are set by any arbitrary completion of edges in gx   clearly  t is a proper completion of
gx and therefore of g  in t   the maximin score of each y  v    x  is less than or equal
to the maximin score of x  therefore x  mm  t   which implies that x  pwmm  g  
next  we show that pwsmm can be solved in polynomial time  the proof proceeds
by identifying the maximin values that could potentially be achieved simultaneously by
all elements of the set in question  and solving the problem for each of these values using
similar techniques as in the proof of theorem     only a polynomially bounded number of
problems need to be considered 
theorem     pwsmm can be solved in polynomial time 
proof  let g    v  w  be a partial n weighted tournament and x  v   we give a
polynomial time algorithm for checking whether x  pwsmm  g  
if x  pwsmm  g  there must be a completion t   g  and s              n  such that
smm  x  t     s for all x  x and smm  i  t     s for all y  v   x 
first  we note that if s   n  w j  i  for some i  x  j  v or s  w i  j  for some
i
  x  j  v   then x   pwsmm  g   therefore  we assume that
n  w j  i   s for all i  x  j  v and

the respective completion

in addition  we need to check whether alternatives not in x can be forced to have a
strictly smaller maximin score than n    to this end  construct an unweighted undirected
bipartite graph h    vh   eh   with vertices

we claim that x  pwsmm  g    with a maximin score of s   n  in the corresponding
completion if and only if there is a maximum cardinality matching of size  v   x  in h 
   let t    v  w     a completion of g   and thereby of g  in which x is the set of
maximin winners with smm  i  t     s   n  for all i  x  for each i 
  x  there needs to
be a j    i with w    i  j    s   collecting  i   i  j   for each such pair gives a matching of
size  v   x  in h which is maximum since each vertex on one side of the bipartite graph is
contained in it 
   for the other direction  assume that there is a maximum matching of size  v   x  
we construct a completion t    v  w     of g  such that x is the set of maximin winners 
note that every i   vh  v     x has to be contained in an edge  i   i  j   in the matching 
for each such edge  let w    i  j    w   i  j    s and w    j  i    n  w    i  j   implying that
smm  i  t     s   otherwise  t is an arbitrary completion of g 
together  we have that smm  i  t     s for all i  x and smm  i  t     s for all i

we claim that x is in pwsmm  g  with a maximin score of s in the corresponding

also derives its maximin score from w   j  i   therefore  the set of all such pairs  i   i  j   is
a valid matching of size  v    it is obviously maximal

that every i   vh  v   is matched and define j i   v such that the edge  i   i  j i   is

note that t is a proper completion of g  now  we have smm  i  t     s for all i  x and

it remains to be shown that only a limited number of possible s  and thereby h s   have
to be considered  in contrast to the proof of theorem    we cannot employ a binary search
method since there is no clear cut between a feasible and an infeasible integer interval 
however  we can see that when s is gradually incremented from   to n      whether an
s or not changes at most twice due to the definition of
edge  i   i  j   is contained in eh

s   this partitions the integer interval i       n     of possible s into a finite number
eh
 

of subintervals ik such that all s within a single ik induce the same h s   therefore  it is
sufficient to only consider one s per ik and for this we choose the minimum  the set s

    ranked pairs
the method of ranked pairs  rp   is the only resolute solution concept considered in this
article  given a weighted tournament t    v  w   it returns the unique undominated
alternative of a transitive tournament t   on v constructed in the following manner  first
order the  directed  edges of t in decreasing order of weight  breaking ties according to
some exogenously given tie breaking rule  then start with an empty graph t   and consider
the edges one by one according to this ordering  if the current edge can be added to t  
without creating a cycle  then do so  otherwise discard the edge   
as an example  consider the partial   weighted tournament depicted in figure    i   
which is a slightly modified version of the tournament considered in figures   and    it is
easy to see that a is the ranked pairs winner in all completions of ga   and likewise b is the
ranked pairs winner in all completions of gb   on the other hand  there is no completion
that has c as a ranked pairs winner  whether d is a possible ranked pairs winner depends
on the tie breaking rule that is used  and in particular on how the tie breaking rule ranks
edges  d  c  and  b  d   alternative d is a possible ranked pairs winner if and only if  d  c  is
considered before  b  d   see figure    iv     since rp is resolute  we have  assuming that
the tie breaking rule ranks  d  c  over  b  d  
pwrp  g     a  b  d 
nwrp  g    
pwsrp  g      a    b    d   
it is readily appreciated that the winner determination problem for rp is computationally tractable  the possible winner problem  on the other hand  turns out to be np hard 
this also shows that tractability of the winner determination problem  while necessary for
tractability of pw  is not generally sufficient 
theorem     pwrp is np complete 
proof  we will work with an alternative characterization of ranked pairs winners that was
introduced by zavist and tideman         for a given a weighted tournament t    v  w 
    the variant of ranked pairs originally proposed by tideman         which was also used by xia and
conitzer         instead chooses a set of alternatives  containing any alternative that is selected by the
above procedure for some way of breaking ties among edges with equal weight  we do not consider
this irresolute version of ranked pairs because winner determination for this variant is np hard  brill
  fischer         as mentioned in section    this immediately implies that all problems concerning
possible or necessary winners are np hard as well

figure     example of a   weighted partial tournament and completions relevant for possible
ranked pairs winners  for each completion  the transitive tournament constructed by the
ranked pairs procedure is indicated by the thick edges 
and a given tie breaking rule  let  denote the order in which edges are considered in the
ranked pairs procedure  that is   x  y    u  v  if and only if either w x  y    w u  v  or
w x  y    w u  v  and the tie breaking rule ranks  x  y  higher than  u  v   given a ranking
l of v   and two alternatives a and b  we say that a attains b through l if there exists
a sequence of distinct alternatives a    a            at   where t     such that a    a  at   b 
ai l ai     and
 ai   ai       b  a  for all i with    i   t 
in this case  we will say that a attains b via  a    a            at    a ranking l is called a stack if
for any pair of alternatives a and b it holds that a l b implies that a attains b through l 
zavist and tideman        have shown that an alternative is the ranked pairs winner if and
only if it is the top element of a stack    intuitively  the defining properties of a stack l
ensure that for all pairs  a  b  of alternatives with a l b  by the point in time the edge  b  a 
is considered  it will be discarded because it would create a cycle 
membership of pwrp in np is obvious  as for a given completion and a given tiebreaking rule  the ranked pairs winner can be found efficiently 
    the characterization by zavist and tideman        addresses the irresolute version of ranked pairs
discussed in the previous footnote  our adaptation to the resolute version of ranked pairs is a straightforward corollary

np hardness can be shown by a reduction from sat  our construction is based on the
proof of theorem   by brill and fischer         for a boolean formula  in conjunctive
normal form with a set c of clauses and set p of propositional variables  we construct a
partial   weighted tournament g    v   w   as follows  for each variable p  p   v
contains two literal alternatives p and p and two auxiliary alternatives p  and p    for
each clause c  c  there is an alternative c  finally  there is an alternative d for which
membership in pwrp  g   is to be decided 
in order to conveniently describe the weight function w   let us introduce the following
terminology  for two alternatives x  y  v   say that there is a heavy edge from x to y if
w  x  y       and therefore w  y  x        a medium edge from x to y means w  x  y     
and w  y  x       and a light edge from x to y means w  x  y      and w  y  x      
finally  a partial edge between x and y means w  x  y    w  y  x      
we are now ready to define w   for each variable p  p   we have heavy edges from
p to p  and from p to p    and partial edges between p and p  and between p and p    for
each clause c  c  we have a medium edge from c to d and a heavy edge from the literal
alternative    with     p or     p for some p  p   to c if the corresponding literal   appears
in clause c  finally  we have heavy edges from d to all auxiliary alternatives and light edges
from d to all literal alternatives  for all pairs x  y for which no edge has been specified  we
define w  x  y    w  y  x       an example is shown in figure     observe that the only
pairs of alternatives for which w is not fully specified are those pairs that are connected
by a partial edge

we will now show that alternative d is a possible ranked pairs winner in g if and only
if  is satisfiable  intuitively  choosing a completion such that  p    p    p    p  corresponds
to setting the variable p to true 
   first assume that d  pwrp and let t   g   be a completion of g with
rp  t      d   consider a stack l with top element d and an alternative c corresponding to
a clause in   since l is a stack and d l c  d attains c though l via some sequence sc    if
d attains c via several sequences  fix one of them arbitrarily   since w  c  d       all edges
in the sequence sc must be heavy  medium  or appropriate completions of partial edges 
therefore  sc must have one of the following two forms  depicted in figure     
 

sc    d                 c 

or sc    d          c  
 

where   is some literal  the former is in fact not possible because w             implies
 
that   does not attain   through l  therefore  each sc is of the form sc    d          c  for
some literal   
now define assignment  by setting to true all literals that are contained in one of the
sequences sc   c  c  we claim that  is a satisfying assignment for  
in order to show that  is well defined  suppose there exists a literal   such that both  
and   are set to true under   this implies that there exist c  and c  such that d attains c 
 
 
via sc     d          c    and d attains c  via sc     d         c     in particular     l   and   l   
 
 
however  it is easily verified that any stack ranks   higher than    because w             
 
and   higher than     because w                thus  there is an l cycle   l   l   l    l   
contradicting the assumption that l is a stack 
in order to show that  satisfies   consider an arbitrary clause c  as d attains c via
sc    d          c  and w  c  d       we have that w     yj       by definition of w       this
implies that literal   appears in clause c  furthermore    is set to true under  because   is
contained in sc  
   for the other direction  assume that  is satisfiable and let  be a satisfying
assignment  we use  to construct a completion t    v   w     g   with rp  t      d

on partial edges  the weight function w is defined as follows  if literal   is set to true
under   let w              and w               otherwise  let w              and w              
we now show that rp  t      d  by going through the procedure that constructs the
transitive tournament t     starting with the empty tournament on v     first  the set of
all edges with weight   or more will be added  because there are no cycles among those
edges  this set consists of the heavy edges and the  previously  partial edges  next  the
medium edges are considered  all these edges are of the form  c  d  where c is an alternative
corresponding to a clause  since  is a satisfying assignment  t   already contains paths from
d to every clause alternative c  therefore  all of the edges  c  d  with c  c will be discarded 
in the next step  all light edges  i e   edges of weight    are considered  all of those edges
are of the form  d     for a literal    therefore  all of those edges can be added to t   without
creating a cycle  d has no ingoing edges in t      after adding the light edges  d has an
outgoing edge to all literal alternatives   and to all auxiliary alternatives      furthermore 
all edges from a clause candidate c to d have already been discarded  thus  d is the unique
undominated alternative in t     i e   rp  t      d  
since the ranked pairs method is resolute  hardness of pwsrp follows immediately 
corollary    pwsrp is np complete 
computing necessary ranked pairs winners turns out to be conp complete  this is again
somewhat surprising  as computing necessary winners is often considerably easier than computing possible winners  for both partial tournaments and partial preference profiles  xia
  conitzer        
theorem     nwrp is conp complete 
proof  membership in conp is again obvious  for hardness  we give a reduction from
unsat that is a slight variation of the reduction in the proof of theorem     let g  be
the partial   weighted tournament that results form g by adding a new alternative d
which has heavy edges to all alternatives in v except d  furthermore  there is a light edge
from d to d   we show that d is a necessary ranked pairs winner in g  if and only if  is
unsatisfiable 
   assume for contradiction that nwrp  g       d   and  is satisfiable  let  be
a satisfying assignment and define the tournament t    v   d    w      g    such that
w  coincides with w  as defined in the proof of theorem     for all partial edges  by the
same arguments as in the proof of theorem     it follows that d does not have any ingoing
edges in the tournament t   constructed by the ranked pairs procedure  at the point in
time when the edge  d  d   is considered  it will be added to t     this yields rp  t      d  
contradicting the assumption that nwrp  g       d   
   assume for contradiction that  is unsatisfiable and there exists a completion
t   g    with rp  t      x      d    it follows that x   d   all alternatives in v    d 
have an incoming heavy edge  from d    and all heavy edges will be added because there
is no cycle among them   by the same argument as in the proof of theorem     it follows
that  is satisfiable  contradicting our assumption 
    the following arguments are independent of the choice of a particular tie breaking rule

   possible winning subsets
we considered the problem whether a subset of alternatives is a possible winning set  pws  
in addition  it may be of interest whether a subset of alternatives is among the winners in
some completion  i e   whether there is a completion for which all the alternatives in the
subset  and possibly other alternatives  are in the choice set  we will refer to the latter
problem as pwss  possible winning subset   we note that an oracle to solve pwss can
be used to solve pw  if we want to check whether i  pw  g   we simply check whether
 i   pwss  g   we are not aware of any direct algorithmic relation between the problems
pws and pwss 
we examined the computational complexity of pwsss for most of the solution concepts
considered in this article  since the arguments are often very similar to proofs already given 
we briefly summarize our findings here

singleton and the problem reduces to computing pwcond  g  
cnl for pwsscnl   note that for a nonempty set x  v   x

co just as for the other problems  polynomial computability of pwssco follows from
the corresponding result for pwssbo  
tc the problem pwsstc can be solved in polynomial time  in fact  it can be shown
that for a partial tournament g and a set of alternatives x  it is sufficient to check
whether x  pwtc  g   with an additional argument if  x       in order to
determine whether x  pwsstc  g  
bo the argument and algorithm for checking whether x  pwssbo  g  is almost
the same as the argument for pwsbo in theorem    the only difference is that
sbo  v  t   may now be up to s instead of s    for v  v   x in t   g  
consequently  we only need to redefine bs  v  to s  sbo  v  g  for all v  v   x 
mm the proof for efficient computability of checking whether x  pwsmm  g  can be
modified to accommodate pwssmm   more precisely  the second basic assumption
is now w i  j   s for i 
  x  j  v   for s   n    it is sufficient to check whether g 
is an extension of g  for s   n    edges  i   i  j   with i  x are now contained in
s if w i  j   s   the rest of the argument can be adjusted appropriately  for

rp since pwrp is np complete  theorem      we get np hardness of pwssrp by

fipossible and necessary winners of partial tournaments

the complexity of pwssuc is left open  minor modification of our hardness construction for pwsuc will not do the trick  in that argument  the crucial question was whether
there is a completion that excludes certain alternatives from the choice set  this does not
help for pwssuc  

   discussion
the problem of computing possible and necessary winners for partial preference profiles has
recently received a lot of attention  in this article  we have investigated this problem in a
setting where partially specified  weighted or unweighted  tournaments instead of profiles
are given as input  we have summarized our findings in table   
a key conclusion is that computational problems for partial tournaments can be significantly easier than their counterparts for partial profiles  for example  possible borda or
maximin winners can be found efficiently for partial tournaments  whereas the corresponding problems for partial profiles are np complete  xia   conitzer         furthermore 
computing possible and necessary copeland winners is np hard and conp hard respectively for partial preference profiles  xia   conitzer         in contrast  we showed that
even pwsco can be solved in polynomial time for partial tournaments  as for negative
 hardness  results  they can be tempered by the fact that when some parameters of the
problem are bounded by a constant  some of these hard problems may be solved in polynomial time  in particular  yang and guo        have shown that pwsuc is polynomial time
solvable if the size of the given subset x is bounded by a constant   
while tractability of the winner determination problem is necessary for tractability of
the possible or necessary winners problems  the results for ranked pairs in section     show
that it is not sufficient  we further considered the problem of deciding whether a given
subset of alternatives equals the winning set for some completion of the partial tournament 
the results for the uncovered set in section     imply that this problem cannot be reduced
in polynomial time to the computation of possible or necessary winners  whether a reduction
exists in the opposite direction remains an open problem 
partial tournaments have also been studied in their own right  independent of their
possible completions  for instance  peris and subiza        and dutta and laslier       
have generalized several solution concepts on tournaments to partial tournaments  the
common point with the approach we follow here is the nature of the input  namely  partial tournaments  however  peris and subiza        and dutta and laslier        define
solution concepts for partial tournaments by directly generalizing the usual definition on
tournaments  this is in contrast to our definitions  which are based on the completions of
the input partial tournament  the notion of possible winners suggests a canonical way to
generalize any solution concept defined on tournaments to partial tournaments  this way
of extending tournament solutions to partial tournaments is referred to as the conservative
extension and inherits various axiomatic properties which the original tournament solutions satisfies for tournaments  brandt et al          the positive computational results in
this article are an indication that this may be a promising approach 
    yang and guo        also give hardness and fixed parameter tractability results for a generalization of
the banks set to partial tournaments 

   

fiaziz  brill  fischer  harrenstein  lang    seedig

we also highlight another way of viewing algorithmic results concerning possible and
necessary winners  there is a burgeoning literature in computational social choice which
deals with the problem of manipulation and control in voting  bartholdi  iii  tovey    trick 
            faliszewski   procaccia         if a given alternative is already a necessary winner  then there is no need to invest effort into influencing the remaining comparisons or votes
to make it winning  moreover  our results also have implications on a partial tournament
version of the coalitional manipulation problem  coalitional tournament manipulation  in
its constructive version  is defined as follows  given a partial tournament  v  e   a subset x  v   and a distinguished alternative x  is there a way to complete the missing edges
in x  x such that x is a winner  informally  do the players in x have a way of fixing the
winners of the matches among themselves so as to make x win 
constructive coalitional tournament manipulation is polynomial time solvable whenever
pw is  likewise  the destructive version of coalitional tournament manipulation  is there a
way to complete the edges within x such that candidate x is not winning   is polynomial
whenever nw is 
regarding future work  we have not yet examined the complexity of computing possible
and necessary winners for some attractive tournament solutions such as the minimal covering
set and weighted versions of the top cycle and the uncovered set  de donder  le breton   
truchon          
an interesting related question that goes beyond the computation of possible and necessary winners is the following  when the winners are not yet fully determined  which unknown
comparisons need to be learned  which pairs of candidates do we have to compare  or which
matches should be played  this problem can be seen as a tournament based version of
the preference elicitation problem  conitzer   sandholm        ding   lin        walsh 
       while the standard version of the problem looks for minimal sets of queries to voters
about pairwise preferences between candidates  in the tournament version a query bears on
a pair of candidates and its output is an edge between these two candidates  in one direction
or the other  procaccia        considers a similar question for cond  the construction of
a policy tree defining an optimal protocol minimizing the number of questions to be asked
or the number of matches to be played  in the worst case or on average  is an even more
challenging issue that we leave for future research
