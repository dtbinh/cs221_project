studied fragment mbnf relationship logic programming paradigm 

computational aspects reasoning mbnf  results presented section   prove one source complexity due presence nested occurrences
modalities theory  since reasoning mbnf computationally easier
general case 
proven another source complexity lies underlying objective
language  fact  consider l  tractable fragment propositional logic 
complexity reasoning modal language l m built upon l  lower
general case  particular  easy see that  assumption entailment
l  computed polynomial time  algorithm mbnf not entails provides
upper bound p  mbnf entailment fragment l m
