abstract
we investigate the problem of reasoning in the propositional fragment of mbnf  the
logic of minimal belief and negation as failure introduced by lifschitz  which can be considered as a unifying framework for several nonmonotonic formalisms  including default
logic  autoepistemic logic  circumscription  epistemic queries  and logic programming  we
characterize the complexity and provide algorithms for reasoning in propositional mbnf 
in particular  we show that skeptical entailment in propositional mbnf is p   complete 
hence it is harder than reasoning in all the above mentioned propositional formalisms for
nonmonotonic reasoning  we also prove the exact correspondence between negation as
failure in mbnf and negative introspection in moore s autoepistemic logic 

   introduction
research in the formalization of commonsense reasoning has pointed out the need of formalizing agents able to reason introspectively about their own knowledge and ignorance
 moore        levesque         modal epistemic logics have thus been proposed  in which
modalities are interpreted in terms of knowledge or belief  generally speaking  the conclusions an introspective agent is able to draw depend on both what she knows and what she
does not know  hence  any such conclusion may be retracted when new facts are added to
the agent s knowledge  for this reason  many nonmonotonic modal formalisms have been
proposed in order to characterize the reasoning abilities of an introspective agent 
among the nonmonotonic modal logics proposed in the literature  the logic of minimal
belief and negation as failure mbnf  lifschitz              is one of the most studied formalisms  chen        bochman        beringer   schaub         roughly speaking  such
a logic is built by adding to first order logic two distinct modalities  a  minimal belief 
modality b and a  negation as failure  modality not   the logic thus obtained is characterized in terms of a nice model theoretic semantics  mbnf has been used in order to
give a declarative semantics to very general classes of logic programs  lifschitz   woo 
      schwarz   lifschitz        inoue   sakama         which generalize the stable model
semantics of negation as failure in logic programming  gelfond   lifschitz             
       also  mbnf can be viewed as an extension of the theory of epistemic queries to
databases  reiter         which deals with the problem of querying a first order database
about its own knowledge  due to its ability of expressing many features of nonmonotonic
logics  lifschitz        schwarz   lifschitz         mbnf is generally considered as a unifying framework for several nonmonotonic formalisms  including default logic  autoepistemic
logic  circumscription  epistemic queries  and logic programming

although several aspects of the logic mbnf have been thoroughly investigated  schwarz
  lifschitz        chen        bochman         the existing studies concerning the computational properties of mbnf are limited to subclasses of propositional mbnf theories
 inoue   sakama        or to a very restricted subset of the first order case  beringer  
schaub        
in this paper we present a computational characterization of deduction in the propositional fragment of mbnf  in particular  we show that logical implication in the propositional fragment of mbnf is a p   complete problem  hence  it is harder  unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses  than reasoning in all the best known propositional formalisms
for nonmonotonic reasoning  like autoepistemic logic  niemela        gottlob         default logic  gottlob         circumscription  eiter   gottlob          disjunctive  logic
programming  eiter   gottlob         and several mcdermott and doyle s logics  marek
  truszczynski         as shown in the following  this result also implies that minimal
knowledge is computationally harder than negation as failure 
moreover  we study the subclass of at mbnf theories  i e  mbnf theories without nested occurrences of modalities  showing that in this case logical implication is p  complete  this case is the most interesting one from the logic programming viewpoint 
indeed  it implies that  under the stable model semantics  increasing the syntax of program
rules  by allowing propositional formulas as goals in the rules  does not affect the worst case
complexity of query answering for disjunctive logic programs with negation as failure 
furthermore  we provide algorithms for reasoning both in mbnf and in its at fragment 
which are optimal with respect to worst case complexity  notably  such deductive methods
can be considered as generalizations of known methods for reasoning in nonmonotonic
formalisms such as default logic  autoepistemic logic  and logic programming under stable
model semantics 
we also show that the  negation as failure  modality in mbnf exactly corresponds
to negative introspection in autoepistemic logic  moore         this result implies that
the logic mbnf can be considered as the  composition  of two epistemic modalities  the
 minimal knowledge  operator due to halpern and moses        and moore s autoepistemic
operator 
besides its theoretical interest  we believe that such a computational and epistemological
analysis of mbnf has interesting implications for the development of knowledge representation systems with nonmonotonic abilities  since it allows for a better understanding and
comparison of the different nonmonotonic formalisms captured by mbnf  the interest in
defining deductive methods for mbnf also arises from the fact that such a logic  originally
developed as a framework for the comparison of different logical approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning  has recently been considered as an attractive knowledge representation
formalism  in particular  it has been shown  donini  nardi    rosati      a  that the full
power of mbnf is necessary in order to logically formalize several features of implemented
frame based knowledge representation systems 
in the following  we first briey recall the logic mbnf  in section   we address the
relationship between mbnf and moore s autoepistemic logic  then  in section   we study
the problem of reasoning in propositional mbnf  we first consider the case of general mbnf
theories  then we deal with at mbnf theories  in section   we present the computational
   

fireasoning about minimal belief and negation as failure

characterization of reasoning in mbnf  we conclude in section    this paper is an extended
and thoroughly revised version of  rosati        

   the logic mbnf

in this section we briey recall the logic mbnf  lifschitz         which is a modal logic
with two epistemic operators  a  minimal belief  modality b and a  negation as failure 
 also called  negation by default   modality not   we use l to denote a fixed propositional
language built in the usual way from   i  an alphabet a of propositional symbols   ii  the
symbols true  false   iii  the propositional connectives            we denote as lm the
modal extension of l with the modalities b and not   we say that a formula     lm
has  modal  depth i  with i     if each subformula in   lies within the scope of at most
i modalities  and there exists a subformula in   which lies within the scope of exactly i
modalities 
we denote as lsm the set of subjective mbnf formulas  i e  the subset of formulas from
lm in which each occurrence of a propositional symbol lies within the scope of at least one
modality  and with l m the set of at mbnf formulas  that is the set of formulas from lm
in which each propositional symbol lies within the scope of exactly one modality  we call a
modal formula   from lm positive  resp  negative   if the modality not  resp  b   does not
occur in    lb denotes the set of positive formulas from lm   while lsb denotes the set of
positive formulas from lsm  
we now recall the notion of mbnf model  an interpretation is a set of propositional
symbols  an mbnf structure is a triple  i  mb   mn    where i is an interpretation  also called
initial world  and mb   mn are non empty sets of interpretations  worlds   satisfiability of a
formula in an mbnf structure is defined inductively as follows 
   if   is a propositional symbol    is satisfied by  i  mb   mn   iff     i  
      is satisfied by  i  mb   mn   iff   is not satisfied by  i  mb   mn   

           is satisfied by  i  mb   mn   iff    is satisfied by  i  mb   mn   and    is satisfied
by  i  mb   mn   

           is satisfied by  i  mb   mn   iff either    is satisfied by  i  mb   mn   or    is
satisfied by  i  mb   mn   
          is satisfied by  i  mb   mn   iff either    is not satisfied by  i  mb   mn   or   
is satisfied by  i  mb   mn   
   b  is satisfied by  i  mb   mn   iff  for every j   mb     is satisfied by  j  mb   mn   

   not   is satisfied by  i  mb   mn   iff there exists j   mn such that   is not satisfied by
 j  mb   mn   
we write  i  mb   mn   j    to indicate that   is satisfied by  i  mb   mn    we say that
a theory   lm is satisfied by  i  mb   mn    and write  i  mb   mn   j    iff each formula
from  is satisfied by  i  mb   mn    if     lsm   then the evaluation of   is insensitive to
the initial interpretation i   thus  in this case we also write  mb   mn   j     analogously  if
   

firosati

    lsb   then the evaluation of   is insensitive both to the initial interpretation i and to
the set mn   and we also write mb j     if     l then the evaluation of   does not depend
on the sets mb   mn   and in this case we write i j    

in order to relate mbnf structures to standard interpretation structures in modal
logic  i e  kripke structures   we remark that  due to the above notion of satisfiability 
we can consider the sets mb   mn in an mbnf interpretation structure as two distinct
universal kripke structures  i e  possible world structures in which each world is connected
to all worlds of the structure  in fact  since the accessibility relation in such a structure is
universal  without loss of generality it is possible to identify a universal kripke structure
with the set of interpretations contained in it  we recall that the class of universal kripke
structures characterizes the logic s   marek   truszczynski        theorem       
the nonmonotonic character of mbnf is obtained by imposing the following preference
semantics over the interpretation structures satisfying a given theory 

definition     a structure  i  m  m    where m       is an mbnf model of a theory
  lm iff  i  m  m   j   and  for each interpretation j and for each set of interpretations
m    if m    m then  j  m     m    j   
we say that a formula   is entailed  or logically implied   by  in mbnf  and write
 j mbnf    iff   is satisfied by every mbnf model of   in order to simplify notation 
we denote the mbnf model  i  m  m   with the pair  i  m    and  if    lsm   we denote
 i  m  m   with m   since in this case the evaluation of  is insensitive to the initial world i  
namely  if  i  m   is a model for   then  for each interpretation j    j  m   is a model for  

example     let    fbpg  the only mbnf models for  are of the form  i  m    with
m   fi   i j  pg  hence   j mbnf bp  and  j mbnf  b for each   l such that the
propositional formula p  is not valid  therefore  the agent modeled by  has minimal
belief  in the sense that she only believes p and the objective facts logically implied by p 

example     let    fnot married  b hasnochildren g  it is easy to see that the only
models for  are of the form  i  m   such that m   fi   i j  hasnochildren g  since married
can be assumed not to hold by the agent modeled by   which is then able to conclude
  married in
b hasnochildren   notably  the meaning of  is analogous to the default rule hasnochildren
reiter s default logic  lifschitz         also  let    fb bird   not   ies  b ies   b bird g 

in a way analogous to the previous case  it can be shown that the only mbnf models for
 are of the form  i  m    with m   fi   i j  bird   ies g  therefore   j mbnf b ies   as
 ies g  bird   
shown by lifschitz          corresponds to the default theory  f birdies

given a set of interpretations m   th m   denotes the set of formulas b  such that
b    lb and m j  b   let m   m  be sets of interpretations  we say that m  is
equivalent to m  iff th m      th m    

definition     a set of interpretations m is maximal iff  for each set of interpretations
m    if m   is equivalent to m then m    m  
   

fireasoning about minimal belief and negation as failure

it turns out that  when restricting to theories composed of subjective positive formulas 
mbnf corresponds to the modal logic of minimal knowledge due to halpern and moses
        also known as ground nonmonotonic modal logic s g  kaminski        donini 
nardi    rosati      b   in fact  s g is obtained from modal logic s  by imposing the
following preference order over the universal kripke structures satisfying a theory    lb  
m is a model for  iff m j   and  for each m     if m   j   then m     m  shoham 
       in fact  it is immediate to see that the mbnf semantics of theories composed of
subjective positive formulas corresponds to the above semantics according to s g   hence 
the following property holds 

proposition     let   lb   then  m is an s g model for  iff  for each i    i  m   is
an mbnf model for fb        g 
the previous proposition implies that  when   lsb   a set of interpretations m satisfying  is compared with all other sets of interpretations satisfying   while  in the case
  lm   m is only compared with the sets m   such that  m     m   satisfies  

hence  the main difference between mbnf and s g lies in the fact that in s g all models
are maximal with respect to set containment  or minimal with respect to the objective
knowledge which holds in the model   while in mbnf this property is not generally true 
e g   the theory    fnot married   b married g has two types of models  for each possible
choice of the initial world j    j  m     where m  corresponds to the set of all interpretations
 which represents the case in which married is not assumed to hold   and  j  m     where
m    fi   i j  married g  namely  if married is assumed to hold  then  forces one to
conclude b married   that is  the initial assumption is justified by the knowledge derived on
the basis of such an assumption  lin   shoham         we remark that  by proposition     
the interpretation of the mbnf operator b exactly corresponds to the interpretation of the
modality b in s g  

   relating mbnf to autoepistemic logic

in this section we study the relationship between autoepistemic logic and mbnf  first  we
briey recall moore s autoepistemic logic  ael   in order to keep notation to a minimum 
we change the language of ael  using the modality b instead of l  thus  in the following
a formula of ael is a formula from lb  

definition     a propositionally consistent set of formulas t  lb is a stable expansion
for a set of initial knowledge   lb if t satisfies the following equation 
t   cn    fb  j     t g   f b  j      t g 
   
where cn s   denotes the propositional deductive closure of the modal theory s  lb  
given a theory   lb and a formula     lb   we write  j ael   iff   belongs to
all the stable expansions of   each stable expansion t is a stable set according to the
following definition  stalnaker        

definition     a modal theory t  lb is a stable set if
   

firosati

   t   cn t   
   for every     lb   if     t then b    t  
   for every     lb   if      t then  b    t  

we recall that a stable set t corresponds to a maximal universal kripke structure mt
such that t is the set of formulas satisfied by mt  marek   truszczynski         with the
term ael model for  we will thus refer to a set of interpretations m whose set of theorems
th m   corresponds to a stable expansion for  in ael 
finally  notice that we have adopted the notion of consistent autoepistemic logic  marek
  truszczynski         i e  in     we do not allow the inconsistent theory t   lb composed
of all modal formulas to be a  possible  stable expansion  the results presented in this
section can be easily extended to this case  corresponding to moore s original proposal  
however  this requires to slightly change the semantics of mbnf  allowing in definition    
the empty set of interpretations to be a possible component of mbnf structures 
in the following  we use the term embedding  or translation  to indicate a transformation
function     for modal theories  we are interested in finding a faithful embedding  gottlob 
      schwarz        janhunen         in the following sense      is a faithful embedding
of ael into mbnf if  for each theory   lb and for each model m   m is an ael model
for  iff m is an mbnf model for     
it is already known that ael theories can be embedded into mbnf theories  in particular  it has been proven  lin   shoham        schwarz   truszczynski        that ael
theories with no nested occurrences of b  called at theories  can be embedded into mbnf 
now  since in ael any theory can be transformed into an equivalent at theory  which has
in general size exponential in the size of the initial theory   it follows that any ael theory
can be embedded into mbnf 
however  we now prove a much stronger result  negation as failure in mbnf exactly
corresponds to negative introspection in ael  i e  ael s modality  b and mbnf s modality not are semantically equivalent  hence  such a correspondence is not only limited to
modal theories without nested modalities  and induces a polynomial time embedding of any
ael theory into mbnf 
we first define the translation     of modal theories from ael to mbnf theories 

definition     let     lb   then       is the mbnf formula obtained from   by substituting each occurrence of b with  not  moreover  if   lb   then     denotes the mbnf
theory fb    j    g 
we now show that the translation     embeds ael theories into mbnf  to this aim  we

exploit the semantic characterization of ael defined by schwarz         roughly speaking 
according to such a preference semantics over possible world structures  an ael model for
 is a set of interpretations m satisfying  such that  for any interpretation j not contained
in m   the pair  j  m   does not satisfy   formally 

proposition      schwarz        proposition      let   lb   then  m is an ael
model for  iff  for each interpretation i   m    i  m   j   and  for each interpretation
j    m    j  m    j   
   

fireasoning about minimal belief and negation as failure

in the following  we say that an occurrence of a subformula in a formula     lm is
strict if it does not lie within the scope of a modal operator  e g   let    b    not  b      
the occurrence of b  in  is strict  while the occurrence of b is not strict 

theorem     let   lb   then  m is an ael model for  iff  for each i    i  m   is an
mbnf model of     

if part  suppose  i  m   is an mbnf model of      then  for each m    m  
 m     m    j       since     is a set of formulas of the form b   where   does not contain
any occurrence of the operator b   it follows that  for each subformula of the form not  
occurring in       m     m   j  not   iff  m  m   j  not    now let b         let    denote
the propositional formula obtained from   by replacing each strict occurrence in   of a
formula of the form not with true if  m  m   j  not and with false otherwise  and let
    f     b       g  now suppose there exists an interpretation j such that j j   
and j    m   then  from the definition of satisfiability in mbnf structures it follows that
 m  fj g  m   j       thus contradicting the hypothesis that  i  m   is an mbnf model for
     hence  m   fi   i j   g  now consider a pair  j  m    again  from the definition of
satisfiability in mbnf structures it follows immediately that  j  m   j   iff j j      and
since m contains all the interpretations satisfying     it follows that  for each interpretation
j    m    j  m    j    therefore by proposition     it follows that m is an ael model for  
only if part  suppose m is an ael model for   then  by proposition      for each
interpretation i   m    i  m   j   and  for each interpretation j    m    j  m    j    for
each       let     denote the propositional formula obtained from   by replacing each strict
occurrence of a formula of the form b with true if m j  b and with false otherwise  and
let      f          g  then  suppose there exists an interpretation j such that j j    
and j    m   then  from the definition of satisfiability in mbnf structures it follows that
 j  m   j    thus contradicting the hypothesis that m is an ael model for   hence 
m   fi   i j    g  now suppose that  for some interpretation i    i  m   is not an mbnf
model for      then  there exists m    m such that  m     m   j       from the definition
of      it follows that each interpretation in m   satisfies      and  since m    m   there exists
j    m such that j j      contradiction  therefore   i  m   is an mbnf model for  
we remark that the above theorem could alternatively be proved from the fact that
the k  free fragment of the logic mknf  lifschitz        is equivalent to ael  which is
stated  although without proof  by schwarz and truszczynski        page       and from
the correspondence between mbnf and mknf  lifschitz        
the previous theorem implies that the interpretation of the modality not in mbnf and
of the modal operator in autoepistemic logic are the same  this property extends previous
results relating mbnf with ael  lin   shoham        schwarz   lifschitz        chen 
       and has interesting consequences both in the logic programming framework and in
nonmonotonic reasoning  in particular  since mbnf generalizes the stable model semantics
for logic programs  gelfond   lifschitz         the above result strengthens the idea that
ael is the true logic of negation as failure  as interpreted according to the stable model
semantics   moreover  positive theories have the same interpretation both in mbnf and
in the logic of minimal knowledge s g  halpern   moses         consequently  the logic
mbnf generalizes both halpern and moses  s g and moore s ael

   reasoning in mbnf

in this section we present algorithms for reasoning in propositional mbnf  in particular  we
study the entailment problem in mbnf  from now on  we assume to deal with finite mbnf
theories   therefore we refer to a single formula   which corresponds to the conjunction
of all the formulas contained in the finite theory   

    characterizing mbnf models

we now present a finite characterization of the mbnf models of a formula    lm   as
in several methods for reasoning in nonmonotonic modal logics  gottlob        marek
  truszczynski        eiter   gottlob        niemela        donini et al       b   the
technique we employ is based on the definition of a correspondence between the preferred
models of a theory and the partitions of the set of modal subformulas of the theory  in
fact  such partitions can be used in order to provide a finite characterization of a universal
kripke structure  specifically  a partition satisfying certain properties identifies a particular
universal kripke structure m   by uniquely determining a propositional theory such that m
is the set of all interpretations satisfying such a theory 
we extend such known techniques in order to deal with the preference semantics of
mbnf  in particular  we characterize the properties that a partition of modal subformulas
of a formula    lm must satisfy in order to identify an mbnf model for   in this way 
we provide a method that does not rely on a modal logic theorem prover  but reduces the
problem of reasoning in a bimodal logic to a number of reasoning problems in propositional
logic 
first  we introduce some preliminary definitions  we call a formula of the form b  or
not    with     lm   a modal atom 

definition     let    lm   we call the set of modal atoms occurring in  the modal
atoms of   and denote such a set as ma    

definition     let    lm and let  p  n   be a partition of a set of modal atoms  we
denote as  p  n   the formula obtained from  by substituting each strict occurrence in 
of a formula in p with true  and each strict occurrence in  of a formula in n with false 

observe that only the occurrences in  of modal subformulas which are not within the
scope of another modality are replaced  notice also that  if p   n contains ma    then
 p  n   is a propositional formula  in this case  the pair  p  n   identifies a guess on the
modal subformulas from   i e  p contains the modal subformulas of  assumed to hold 
while n contains the modal subformulas of  assumed not to hold 

definition     let    lm and let  p  n   be a partition of ma    we denote as ob  p  n  
the propositional formula

 
  p  n  
b  p
roughly speaking  the propositional formula ob  p  n   represents the  objective knowledge  implied by the guess  p  n   on the formulas of the form b  belonging to p   from the
ob  p  n    

   

fireasoning about minimal belief and negation as failure

semantic viewpoint  in each structure  i  m  m     satisfying the guess on the modal atoms
given by  p  n    the propositional formula ob  p  n   constrains the interpretations of m  
since in each such structure the propositional formula ob  p  n   must be satisfied by each
interpretation j   m   i e  j j  ob  p  n   

example     let

    ba   not  b   c     d    b   f   g 
then  ma     fba  not  b   c   b   f   g g  now suppose that
p   fba  not  b   c g
n   fb   f   g g
then   p  n      true   true    d    false  which is equivalent to d   and ob  p  n     a 

definition     we say that a pair of sets of interpretations  m  m     induces the partition
 p  n   of ma   if  for each modal atom    ma       p iff  m  m     j    
lemma     let     lm   let i be an interpretation  let m  m   be sets of interpretations 
and let  p  n   be the partition induced by  m  m     on a set of modal atoms s   then 
 i  m  m     j    iff  i  m  m     j    p  n   
follows immediately from definitions     and      and from the definition of
satisfiability in mbnf structures 
we now show that  if  i  m   is an mbnf model for  which induces the partition  p  n  
of ma    then the formula ob  p  n   completely characterizes the set of interpretations
m 
proof 

theorem     let    lm   let  i  m   be an mbnf model for   and let  p  n   be the
partition of ma   induced by  m  m    then  m   fj   j j  ob  p  n  g 
let m     fj   j j  ob  p  n  g  since  m  m   induces the partition  p  n    by
definition     it follows that each interpretation in m must satisfy ob  p  n    hence m  m    
now suppose m  m     and consider the structure  i  m     m    we prove that each modal
atom    ma   belongs to p iff  i  m     m   j     the proof is by induction on the depth
proof 

of formulas in ma   
first  consider a modal atom not such that   l  from the definition of satisfiability
of a formula in an mbnf structure  it follows immediately that not   p iff  i  m     m   j 
not   then  consider a modal atom b such that   l  if b   p   then  by definition of
ob  p  n    the propositional formula ob  p  n    is valid  therefore  i  m     m   j  b   if
b   n   then there exists an interpretation j in m such that j  j    and since m    m  
it follows that  i  m     m    j  b   hence  each modal atom    ma   of depth   belongs
to p iff  i  m     m   j    
suppose now that    p iff  i  m     m   j   for each modal atom  in ma   of depth
less or equal to i  consider a modal atom b of ma   of depth i      by the induction
hypothesis  and by lemma       i  m     m   j  b iff m   j  b    p  n     now  if b   p

then  by definition of ob  p  n    the propositional formula ob  p  n     p  n   is valid  and
since m     fj   j j  ob  p  n  g  it follows that m   j  b    p  n     which in turn implies
 i  m     m   j  b   on the other hand  if b   n   then there exists an interpretation j in m
such that  j  m  m    j    hence  by the induction hypothesis and lemma      j  j   p  n   
now  since m    m   it follows that m    j  b    p  n     hence  i  m     m    j  b   in the
same way it is possible to show that a modal atom of the form not of depth i     belongs
to p iff  i  m     m   j  not  
we have thus proved that each modal atom    ma   belongs to p iff  i  m     m   j    
this in turn implies that  i  m     m   j   iff i j   p  n    and since by hypothesis  i  m  m  
satisfies  and  p  n   is the partition of ma   induced by  m  m    by lemma     it
follows that i j   p  n    therefore   i  m     m   j    which contradicts the hypothesis
that  i  m   is an mbnf model for   consequently  m     m   which proves the thesis 
informally  the above theorem states that each mbnf model for  can be associated with
a partition  p  n   of the modal atoms of   moreover  the propositional formula ob  p  n  
exactly characterizes the set of interpretations m of an mbnf model  i  m    in the sense
that m is the set of all interpretations satisfying ob  p  n    this provides a finite way to
describe all mbnf models for  
we now define the notion of a partition of a set of modal atoms induced by a pair of
propositional formulas 

definition     let    lm             l  we denote as prt              the partition of
ma   induced by  m    m     where m    fi   i j     g  m    fi   i j     g 
in order to simplify notation  we denote as prt       the partition prt           the
following theorem provides a constructive way to build the partition prt         

theorem     let    lm        l  let  p  n   be the partition of ma   built as follows 
   start from p   n     
   for each modal atom b in ma   such that   p  n     l  if the propositional formula
    p  n   is valid  then add b to p   otherwise add b to n  
   for each modal atom not  in ma   such that   p  n     l  if the propositional
formula    p  n   is not valid  then add not  to p   otherwise add not  to n  
   iteratively apply the above rules until p   n   ma   
then   p  n     prt         

the proof is by induction on the structure of the formulas in ma    first 
from the fact that prt         is the partition induced by  m  m      with m   fi   i j 
 g  m     fi   i j  g  and from the definition of satisfiability in mbnf structures  it
follows that  if    l  then  m  m     j  b if and only if     is a valid propositional
formula  and  m  m     j  not  if and only if   is not a valid propositional formula 
therefore   p  n   agrees with prt         on all modal atoms of modal depth    suppose
now that  p  n   and prt         agree on all modal atoms of modal depth less or equal
proof 

   

fireasoning about minimal belief and negation as failure

to i  consider a modal atom b of ma   of modal depth i      from lemma     and
from the definition of satisfiability in mbnf structures  it follows that  m  m     j  b if
and only if      prt          is a valid propositional formula  and since by definition    
the value of the formula   prt          only depends on the guess of the modal atoms of
modal depth less or equal to i in prt          by the induction hypothesis it follows that
 prt             p  n    hence b belongs to p if and only if  m  m     j  b  analogously 
it can be proven that any modal atom of depth i     of the form not  belongs to p if and
only if  m  m     j  not    therefore   p  n   and prt         agree on all modal atoms of
modal depth i     
the algorithms we present in the following for reasoning in mbnf use the above shown
properties of partitions of modal subformulas of a formula   together with additional
conditions on such partitions  that vary according to the different classes of theories accepted
as inputs   in order to identify all the mbnf models for  
as for the entailment problem  j mbnf    we point out that the occurrences of not in
  are equivalent to occurrences of  b   since in each mbnf model for  both modalities in
  are evaluated on the same set of interpretations  therefore  as in the original formulation
of mbnf  lifschitz         we restrict query answering in mbnf to positive formulas 
let     lb     l  and m   fj   j j  g  we denote as      the propositional
formula obtained from   by substituting each strict occurrence of a modal atom b of
  with true if m j  b  and with false otherwise  it can be immediately verified that
         prt        

theorem      let       lm   let  i  m   be an mbnf model for  and let  p  n   be
the partition of ma   induced by  m  m    then    is satisfied by  i  m  m   iff i j 

  ob  p  n    

the proof follows immediately from the fact that  by theorem        ob  p  n     
  prt     ob  p  n      and from lemma     
we now show that the entailment problem in mbnf is related to the membership
problem for stable sets  gottlob         which in turn is related to the notion of  objective 
kernel that has been used to characterize stable expansions of autoepistemic theories  marek
  truszczynski        
proof 

definition      let   l  we denote as st     the  unique  stable set t  lb such
that

t   l   f    lj    is validg

theorem      let    lm       lsb   then    j mbnf   iff there exists an mbnf model
 i  m   for  such that      st  ob  p  n     where  p  n   is the partition of ma   induced

by  m  m   

let m   fi   i j  ob  p  n  g  from the above definition and definition      it follows
immediately that st  ob  p  n      th m    therefore  if     lsb then  i  m  m   j    iff

    reasoning in propositional mbnf

we now define a deductive method for reasoning in general propositional mbnf theories 
specifically  we present the algorithm mbnf not entails  reported in figure    for computing entailment in mbnf 
the algorithm exploits the finite characterization of mbnf models given by theorem    
and an analogous finite characterization  in terms of partitions of ma    of all the models
relevant for establishing whether a partition  p  n   of ma   identifies an mbnf model 
the algorithm checks whether there exists a partition  p  n   of ma   satisfying the
three conditions  a    b    c   intuitively  the partition cannot be self contradictory  condition  a    in particular  the condition  p  n     prt    ob  p  n    establishes that the
objective knowledge implied by the partition  p  n    that is  the formula ob  p  n    identifies a set of interpretations m   fi   i j  ob  p  n  g such that  m  m   induces the same
partition  p  n   on ma    moreover  the partition must be consistent with  and   
 condition  b    such a condition implies that there exists an interpretation i such that
both  is satisfied in  i  m  m   and   is not satisfied in the structure  i  m  m    finally 
condition  c  corresponds to check whether such a structure  i  m  m   identifies an mbnf
model for  according to definition      i e  whether there is no pair  j  m     such that
m    m and  j  m     m   satisfies   again  the search of such a structure is performed by
examining whether there exists a partition of ma    different from  p  n    which does not
satisfy any of the conditions  c     c     c   
we illustrate the algorithm through the following simple example 

example      suppose
   b  a   bb     not  c    d    b  not b    c
   

fireasoning about minimal belief and negation as failure

     bb     b   b  a   b  
then  ma     fb  a   bb   bb  not  c    d   b  not b  not bg  now suppose that  p  n    
 p    n     where

p    fb  a   bb   not  c    d   not bg
n    fbb  b  not bg
then   p  n     true    true   false    c  which is equivalent to c   and ob  p  n     a   false
 which is equivalent to a   now  let m   fi   i j  ag  it is easy to see that  m  m  
satisfies the modal atoms in p   while it does not satisfy the modal atoms in n   hence
 p  n     prt    ob  p  n     thus satisfying condition  a  of the algorithm  then  since
a  a   b is not a valid propositional formula  m  j  b  a   b   hence    ob  p  n     
  true     b   false    which is equivalent to false  therefore   p  n        ob  p  n    is not
satisfiable  thus condition  b  does not hold 
suppose now that  p  n      p    n     where

p    fb  a   bb   not  c    d   bb  b  not bg
n    fnot bg
then   p  n     true    true   true    c  which is equivalent to c   and ob  p  n      a   true   
b true  which is equivalent to b  again  it is easy to see that  p  n     prt    ob  p  n     thus
satisfying condition  a  of the algorithm  then  since b  a   b is not a valid propositional
formula     ob  p  n        false     b   false    which is equivalent to true  hence   p  n    
   ob  p  n    is equivalent to c  which implies that condition  b  holds  finally  it is easy
to verify that either condition  c   or condition  c   holds for each partition of ma  
different from  p    n     with the exception of  p    n     so let  p     n        p    n     as shown
before  ob  p     n     is equivalent to a  hence ob  p  n      ob  p     n     is equivalent to b    a 
therefore condition  c   holds for  p     n        p    n     which implies that condition  c 
holds for  p  n      p    n     consequently  mbnf not entails      returns true  in fact 
the partition  p    n    identifies the set of mbnf models for   i  m   such that i is an
interpretation satisfying c and m   fi   i j  bg  each such model does not satisfy the
query    indeed  it can immediately be verified that  for each interpretation i    i  m  m    j 
 bb     b   b  a   b    since m  j  b  a   b  and m j  bb 
to prove correctness of the algorithm mbnf not entails we need the following preliminary lemma 

lemma      let    lm   and let  p  n   be the partition of ma   induced by  m    m   
let m      fi   i j  ob  p  n  g  then   p  n   is the partition induced by  m      m   
the proof is by induction on the depth of the modal atoms of ma    let
not   ma   such that   l  then   m     m   j  not iff there exists an interpretation
i   m such that i  j    therefore  m     m   j  not iff  m      m   j  not   now let b  
ma   such that   l  by definition       m     m   j  b iff the propositional formula
proof

ob  p  n    is valid  and since m      fi   i j  ob  p  n  g  it follows that  m     m   j  b
iff  m      m   j  b  
now suppose that  for each modal atom  of depth i   m     m   j   iff  m      m   j    
and let  p     n     denote the partition of the modal atoms in ma   of depth less or equal
to i induced by  m     m    first  consider a modal atom not of depth i      then 
by lemma       m     m   j  not iff  m     m   j  not    p     n      and  by the inductive
hypothesis and lemma       m      m   j  not iff  m      m   j  not    p     n       then  since
has depth i   p     n     is a propositional formula  hence  m     m   j  not    p     n      iff
there exists an interpretation i   m such that i  j   p     n      which immediately implies
that  m     m   j  not iff  m      m   j  not   now consider a modal atom b of depth
i      then  by lemma       m     m   j  b iff  m    m   j  b    p     n      and  by the
inductive hypothesis and lemma       m      m   j  b iff  m      m   j  b    p     n       by
definition       m     m   j  b iff the propositional formula ob  p  n     p     n     is valid 
and since m      fi   i j  ob  p  n  g  it follows that  m     m   j  b iff  m      m   j  b  
which proves the thesis 
we are now ready to prove correctness of the algorithm mbnf not entails 

theorem      let    lm       lb   then  mbnf not entails      returns true iff
  j mbnf   
if part  suppose   j mbnf    then  there exists a pair  i  m   such that  i  m   is
an mbnf model for  and  i  m  m    j     let  p  n   be the partition of ma   induced
by  m  m    by theorem      m   fi   i j  ob  p  n  g  therefore  by definition     
 p  n     prt    ob  p  n     then  since  i  m  m    j     by theorem      it follows that
i  j    ob  p  n     and since  i  m  m   j    by lemma     i j   p  n    therefore i j 
 p  n       ob  p  n     now suppose there exists a partition  p     n    of ma   such that
 p     n      
   p  n   and none of conditions  c     c    and  c   holds  then  since  p     n    
is satisfiable  there exists an interpretation j such that j j   p     n      and since  p     n      
prt    ob  p     n      ob  p  n     from lemma     it follows that there exists an interpretation
j such that  j  m     m   j    where m     fi   i j  ob  p     n   g  then  since condition  c  
does not hold  the propositional formula ob  p  n    ob  p     n     is valid  which implies that
m    m   now  if m     m   then  p     n     would be the partition induced by  m  m    thus
contradicting the hypothesis  p     n      
   p  n    hence  m    m   and since  j  m     m   j   
proof 

it follows that  i  m   is not an mbnf model for   contradiction  consequently  condition
 c  in the algorithm holds  therefore mbnf not entails      returns true 
only if part  suppose mbnf not entails      returns true  then  there exists a partition  p  n   of ma   such that conditions  a    b   and  c  hold  let m   fi   i j 
ob  p  n  g  since  p  n     prt    ob  p  n     by definition      p  n   is the partition induced by  m  m    and since  p  n      ob  p  n    is satisfiable  it follows that there exists
an interpretation i such that i j   p  n   and i  j    ob  p  n     hence  by lemma     
 i  m  m   j   and  i  m  m    j     now suppose  i  m   is not an mbnf model for  
then  there exists a set m   and an interpretation j such that m    m and  j  m     m   j   
let  p     n     be the partition of ma   induced by  m     m    since m   fi   i j  ob  p  n  g 
it follows that m   contains
v at least one interpretation j which does not satisfy ob  p  n   
and since ob  p  n     b  p  p  n    j does not satisfy at least one formula of the form
   

fireasoning about minimal belief and negation as failure

 p  n   such that b   p   therefore  p      p   which implies that  p     n         p  n   
then  since  j  m     m   j    by lemma     j j   p     n      hence  p     n     is satisfiable 
now let m      fi   i j  ob  p     n    g  by lemma       it follows that  p     n     is the partition
induced by  m      m    therefore  by definition       p     n       prt    ob  p     n      ob  p  n    
moreover  since m    m   it follows that the propositional formula ob  p  n    ob  p     n    
is valid  hence the formula ob  p  n      ob  p     n     is unsatisfiable  consequently   p     n    
does not satisfy condition  c  in the algorithm  thus contradicting the hypothesis  therefore   i  m   is an mbnf model for   and since  i  m  m    j     it follows that   j mbnf   
thus proving the thesis 
we point out the fact that the algorithm mbnf not entails does not rely on a theorem
prover for a modal logic  thus   modal reasoning  is not actually needed for reasoning in
mbnf  this is an interesting peculiarity that mbnf shares with other nonmonotonic
modal formalisms  like autoepistemic logic  moore        or the autoepistemic logic of
knowledge  schwarz        

    reasoning in flat mbnf

we now study reasoning in at mbnf theories  the main reason for taking into account the
at fragment of mbnf is the fact that reasoning in many of the best known nonmonotonic
formalisms like default logic  circumscription  and logic programming  can be reduced to
reasoning in at mbnf theories  lifschitz        
it is known that  if    l m and     lsb   then it is possible to reduce the entailment
 j mbnf   to reasoning in logic s fmdd   by translating mbnf formulas into unimodal
formulas of s fmdd  schwarz   truszczynski         thus  the procedure for deciding
entailment in the logic s fmdd presented by marek and truszczynski        can be employed for computing the entailment  j mbnf    in the following we study a more general
problem  that is entailment  j mbnf   in the case    l m and     lb   and present a
specialized algorithm for this problem  which is simpler than the more general reasoning
method for s fmdd  
in figure   we report the algorithm flat not entails for computing such an entailment 
in the algorithm  pn denotes the subset of modal atoms from p prefixed by the modality
not   i e  pn   fnot   not   p g 
informally  correctness of the algorithm flat not entails is established by the fact that 
if    l m   then  a    b   and  c  are necessary and sucient conditions on a partition  p  n  
in order to establish whether it is induced by a pair  m  m   such that there exists an mbnf
model for  of the form  i  m    in particular  condition  c  states that b  ob  p  n    must
be a consequence of  pn   n   in modal logic s    since it can be shown that if  pn   n   
b  ob  p  n    is not valid in s   then the guess on the modal atoms of the form b  in p is
not minimal  we illustrate this fact through the following example 

example      let
    ba   not  c   d      b  a   b     bc    bc
   we denote as b the modal operator used in s

model for  which does not satisfy   
therefore  the algorithms mbnf not entails and flat not entails only differ in the
way in which it is verified whether the mbnf structure associated with a partition  p  n  
satisfies the preference semantics provided by definition      which is implemented through
condition  c  in both algorithms  in the algorithm mbnf not entails  a partition is checked
against all other partitions of ma    while in the algorithm flat not entails it is sucient
to verify that the partition  p  n   satisfies a  local  property  as shown in the next section 
such a difference reects the different computational properties of the entailment problem
in the two cases 
in order to establish correctness of the algorithm  we need a preliminary lemma 
   

fireasoning about minimal belief and negation as failure

lemma      let    l m and let  p  n   be the partition induced by a structure  m  m   
then   i  m   is an mbnf model for  iff for each m    m the positive formula  pn   n  
is not satisfied by m    
suppose  i  m   is an mbnf model for   and let  p  n   be the partition induced
by  m  m    let m   be any set of interpretations such that m    m   then   m     m    j   
since    l m and m    m   this implies that for each modal atom  in n    m     m    j    
moreover  for each modal atom not   p    m     m   j  not   therefore  by lemma     
 m     m    j   pn   n    now  since    l m    pn   n   is a at positive formula  hence its
satisfiability only depends on the structure m     therefore m    j   pn   n   
conversely  suppose  i  m   is not an mbnf model for   and let  p  n   be the partition
induced by  m  m    then  there exists a set of interpretations m   such that m    m and
 m     m   j    as shown before  this implies that the positive formula  pn   n   is satisfied
by m    
as observed in section    the class of universal kripke structures characterizes modal
logic s   this immediately implies the following property 
proof 

lemma      a formula     lsb is valid in s  iff  for each set of interpretations m   the
formula    is not satisfied by m  
based on the above property  we are now able to prove correctness of the algorithm
flat not entails 

theorem      let    l m and     lb   then  flat not entails      returns true iff
  j mbnf   
if part  if   j mbnf    then there exists an mbnf model  i  m   for  such
that  i  m  m    j     let  p  n   be the partition of ma   induced by  m  m    from
theorem     it follows that m   fj   j j  ob  p  n  g  therefore  by definition     
 p  n     prt    ob  p  n     hence condition  a  in the algorithm holds 
now let      pn   n    and suppose the formula    b  ob  p  n    is not valid in s  
then  since the formula    b  ob  p  n    belongs to lsb   by lemma      it follows that
there exists a set of interpretations m   satisfying      b  ob  p  n     let  p     n     be the
partition of vma     induced by  m     m      and let m      fi   i j  ob  p     n    g  since
ob  p  n     b  ma       by definition     it follows that ob  p  n    ob  p     n     is a valid
propositional formula  hence m     m   now  since by hypothesis m   j   b  ob  p  n     it
follows that m     m   moreover  since     lb   by lemma      it follows that  p     n     is
the partition induced by  m      m       and since m   j    and   is at     p     n     is equivalent
to true  therefore m    j     p     n     and  by lemma      m    j      on the other hand  since
m     m   by lemma      it follows that m     j     contradiction  hence     b  ob  p  n   
proof 

 

is valid in s   consequently condition  c  of the algorithm holds 
finally  since  i  m  m    j    and m   fj   j j  ob  p  n  g  by theorem      it follows
that i  j    ob  p  n     moreover  since  i  m  m   j    from lemma     it follows that
i j   p  n    consequently i j   p  n        ob  p  n     hence the propositional formula
 p  n      ob  p  n    is satisfiable  therefore  conditions  a    b   and  c  in the algorithm
hold  which implies that flat not entails      returns true 
   

firosati

only if part  if flat not entails      returns true  then there exists a partition  p  n  
of ma   for which conditions  a    b   and  c  of the algorithm hold  let m   fj   j j 
ob  p  n  g  by definition       p  n   is the partition of ma   induced by  m  m    now 
since  p  n        ob  p  n    is satisfiable  there exists an interpretation i such that i j 
 p  n   and i j     ob  p  n     hence by lemma      i  m  m   j    and by theorem     
 i  m  m    j     therefore we only have to show that  i  m   is an mbnf model for   so 
let us suppose  i  m   is not an mbnf model for   then  by lemma      there exists
m    m such that  pn   n   is satisfied in m     now  condition  c  in the algorithm implies
that b  ob  p  n    is a consequence of  pn   n   in s   therefore ob  p  n   is satisfied by each
interpretation in m     that is  m    fj   j j  ob  p  n  g  which contradicts the hypothesis
m    m   fj   j j  ob  p  n  g  consequently   i  m   is an mbnf model for  

we remark the fact that the algorithm flat not entails can be seen as a generalization
of known methods for query answering in reiter s default logic  moore s autoepistemic logic 
and  disjunctive  logic programming under the stable model  and answer set  semantics  in
particular  condition  c  in the algorithm can be seen as a generalization of the minimality
check used in  disjunctive  logic programming for verifying stability of a model of a logic
program  gelfond   lifschitz              

   complexity results
in this section we provide a computational characterization of reasoning in mbnf 
we first briey recall the complexity classes in the polynomial hierarchy  and refer
to  johnson        papadimitriou        for further details about the complexity classes
mentioned in the paper  pa  npa   is the class of problems that are solved in polynomial
time by deterministic  nondeterministic  turing machines using an oracle for a  i e  that
solves in constant time any problem in a   the classes pk   pk and pk pof the polynomial
hierarchy are defined by p    p    p    p  and for k     pk     npk   pk     copk  
p
and pk     pk   in particular  the complexity class p  is the class of problems that are
solved in polynomial time by a nondeterministic turing machine that uses an np oracle 
and p  is the class of problems that are complement of a problem in p    while p  is the
class of problems that are solved in polynomial time by a nondeterministic turing machine
that uses an p   oracle  and p  is the class of problems that are complement of a problem
in p    it is generally assumed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse  hence 
a problem in the class p  or p  is considered computationally easier than a p   hard or
p   hard problem 
as for the complexity of entailment in mbnf  we start by establishing a lower bound
for reasoning in propositional mbnf theories  to this end  we exploit the correspondence
between mbnf and the logic of minimal knowledge s g  halpern   moses         indeed 
as stated by proposition      there is a one to one correspondence between mbnf models
and s g models of positive subjective theories 

lemma
    let    lsm and let     lb   then  the problem of deciding whether  j mbnf
p
  is   hard 

   

fireasoning about minimal belief and negation as failure

as shown by  donini et al       b   entailment in s g is p   complete  therefore 
by proposition      for subjective  and hence for general  mbnf theories  entailment is
p   hard 
then  we show that the entailment problem in propositional mbnf is complete with
respect to the class p   
proof 

theorem     let
   lm and let     lb   then  the problem of deciding whether
 j mbnf   is p   complete 

hardness with respect to p  follows from lemma      as for membership in p   
we analyze the complexity of the algorithm mbnf not entails reported in figure    in
particular  observe that 
 given  p  n    the formula ob  p  n   can be computed in polynomial time with respect
to the size of p   moreover  by lemma     it follows that  since ma   has size linear
with respect to the size of   construction of the partition prt    ob  p  n    can be
performed through a linear number  with respect to the size of   of calls to an nporacle for propositional satisfiability  therefore  condition  a  can be checked through
a linear number  in the size of the input  of calls to an np oracle 
 since   ob  p  n        prt     ob  p  n      the formula    ob  p  n    can be computed
in time linear with respect to the size of     ob  p  n   using an np oracle  and since 
given  and  p  n     p  n   can be computed in polynomial time with respect to
the size of the input  it follows that condition  b  can be computed through a linear
number  in the size of the input  of calls to an np oracle 
 given a partition  p     n     each of the conditions  c     c   and  c    analogous to
conditions  a  and  b   can be checked in polynomial time  with respect to the size of
  using an np oracle  therefore  since the guess of the partition  p     n     ofpma  
requires a nondeterministic choice  falsity of condition  c  can be decided in     which
implies that verifying whether condition  c  holds can be decided in p   
since the guess of the partition  p  n   of ma   requires a nondeterministic choice  it
follows that the algorithm mbnf not entails  if considered as a nondeterministic procedure  decides   j mbnf   in nondeterministic polynomial time  with respect to the size of
       using a p  oracle  thus  we obtain an upper bound of p  for the non entailment
problem  which implies that entailment in mbnf is in p   
the previous analysis also allows for a computational characterization of the logic mknf
 lifschitz         which is a slight modification of mbnf  indeed  it is known  lifschitz 
      that  for each theory   lm   m is an mknf model of  iff  for each interpretation
i    i  m   is an mbnf model of the subjective theory     fb        g  therefore  from
proposition     and from p   hardness of entailment in s g  donini et al       b   it follows
that entailment in mknf is p   hard  then  since  j mknf   iff   j mbnf b   lifschitz 
       it follows that entailment in mknf can be polynomially reduced to entailment in
mbnf  hence such a problem belongs to p    therefore  the following property holds 
proof 

theorem     entailment in propositional mknf is p  complete 
   

firosati

finally  the previous theorem provides a computational characterization of the logic of
grounded knowledge and justified assumptions gk  lin   shoham         in fact  the
logic gk can be considered as a syntactic variant of the propositional fragment of mknf 
therefore  skeptical entailment in gk is p   complete 

remark  the computational properties of mbnf and its variants relate such formalisms

to ground nonmonotonic modal logics  eiter   gottlob        donini et al       b  rosati 
       notably  ground nonmonotonic modal logics share with mbnf the interpretation in
terms of minimal knowledge  or minimal belief  of the modality b   specifically  as already
mentioned  the propositional fragment of mbnf can be considered as built upon s g by
adding a second modality not   therefore  it turns out that  in the propositional case  adding
a  negation by default  modality to the s  logic of minimal knowledge does not increase
the computational complexity of reasoning  while adding a minimal knowledge modality to
ael does increase the complexity of deduction  we can thus summarize as follows  minimal
knowledge is computationally harder than negation as failure 
we now study the complexity of entailment for at mbnf theories  first  it is known
that  in the case of at mbnf theories and subjective queries  entailment is p   complete 
membership in the class p  is a consequence of the fact that at mknf theories can
be polynomially embedded into mcdermott and doyle s nonmonotonic modal logic s f
 schwarz   truszczynski        proposition       whose entailment problem is p   complete
 marek   truszczynski         while p   hardness follows from the existence of a polynomialtime embedding of propositional default theories into at mbnf theories  lifschitz        
therefore  the following property holds 

proposition    p let    l m and let     lsb   then  the problem of deciding whether
 j mbnf   is    complete 
as for complexity of entailment of generic queries with respect to at mbnf theories 
we analyze the complexity of the algorithm flat not entails reported in figure    as shown
before  both condition  a  and condition  b  can be checked through a linear number  with
respect to the size of the input  of calls to an np oracle  moreover  validity in modal logic
s  is a conp complete problem  halpern   moses         hence  each of the conditions in
the algorithm can be computed through a number of calls to an oracle for the propositional
validity problem which is polynomial in the size of the input  and since the guess of the
partition  p  n   of ma   requires a nondeterministic choice  it follows that the algorithm
runs in p    therefore  the following property holds 

theorem     let
   l m and let     lb   then  the problem of deciding whether
p
 j mbnf   is    complete 
membership of the problem to the class p  is implied by the algorithm flat notentails  whereas p   hardness is implied by proposition     
hence  the algorithm flat not entails is  optimal  in the sense that it matches the
lower bound for the entailment problem 

proof 

   

fireasoning about minimal belief and negation as failure

finally  we remark that the subset of at mbnf theories in conjunctive normal form
can be seen as a further extension of the framework of generalized logic programming introduced by inoue and sakama         which in turn is an extension of the disjunctive logic
programming framework under the stable model semantics  gelfond   lifschitz        
roughly speaking  at mbnf theories in conjunctive normal form correspond to rules of
generalized logic programs in which propositional formulas  instead of literals  are allowed
as goals  the above computational characterization implies that such an extension of the
framework of logic programming under the stable model semantics does not affect the worstcase complexity of the entailment problem  which is p   complete just like entailment in logic
programs with disjunction under the stable model semantics  eiter   gottlob         such
a result extends analogous properties  marek  truszczynski    rajasekar        to the case
of disjunctive logic programs 

   conclusions
in this paper we have investigated the problem of reasoning in the propositional fragment
of mbnf  the main results presented can be summarized as follows 

 the negation as failure modality not of mbnf exactly corresponds to negative introspection in ael  this implies that the logic mbnf can be viewed as the conservative
extension of two different nonmonotonic modal logics  halpern and moses  logic of
minimal knowledge s g and moore s ael 

 reasoning in the propositional fragment of mbnf lies at the third level of the polyno 

mial hierarchy  hence  unless the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse  reasoning in
mbnf is harder than reasoning in the best known propositional nonmonotonic logics 
like default logic  autoepistemic logic  and circumscription 

 we have defined methods for reasoning in mbnf  which subsume and generalize wellknown nonmonotonic reasoning algorithms used in logic programming  gelfond  
lifschitz         default logic  gottlob         and autoepistemic logic  marek  
truszczynski        

 we have studied the at fragment of mbnf and its relationship with the logic programming paradigm 

as for the computational aspects of reasoning in mbnf  the results presented in section   prove that one source of complexity is due to the presence of nested occurrences of
modalities in the theory  since reasoning in at mbnf is computationally easier than in
the general case 
it can be proven that another source of complexity lies in the underlying objective
language  in fact  if we consider l  to be a tractable fragment of propositional logic  then
the complexity of reasoning in the modal language l m built upon l  is lower than in the
general case  in particular  it is easy to see that  under the assumption that entailment
in l  can be computed in polynomial time  the algorithm mbnf not entails provides an
upper bound of p  for mbnf entailment in the fragment l m  
   

firosati

one possible development of the present work is towards the analysis of reasoning about
minimal belief and negation as failure in a first order setting  in particular  it should be
interesting to see whether it is possible to extend the techniques developed for the propositional case to a more expressive language  a first attempt in this direction is reported by
donini et al       a
