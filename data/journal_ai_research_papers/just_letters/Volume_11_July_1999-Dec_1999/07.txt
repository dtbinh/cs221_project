abstract

the assumptions needed to prove cox s theorem are discussed and examined  various
sets of assumptions under which a cox style theorem can be proved are provided  although
all are rather strong and  arguably  not natural 

i recently wrote a paper  halpern        casting doubt on how compelling a justification
for probability is provided by cox s celebrated theorem  cox         i have received  what
seems to me  at least  a surprising amount of response to that article  here i attempt to
clarify the degree to which i think cox s theorem can be salvaged and respond to a glaring
inaccuracy on my part pointed out by snow          fortunately  it is an inaccuracy that
has no affect on either the correctness or the interpretation of the results of my paper   i
have tried to write this note with enough detail so that it can be read independently of
my earlier paper  but i encourage the reader to consult the earlier paper as well as the two
major sources it is based on  cox        paris         for further details and discussion 
here is the basic situation  cox s goal is to  try to show that       it is possible to derive
the rules of probability from two quite primitive notions which are independent of the notion
of ensemble and which       appeal rather immediately to common sense   cox         to
that end  he starts with a function bel that associates a real number with each pair  u  v  
of subsets of a domain w such that u       we write bel v ju   rather than bel u  v    since
we think of bel v ju   as the belief  credibility  or likelihood of v given u   cox s theorem
as informally understood  states that if bel satisfies two very reasonable restrictions  then
bel must be isomorphic to a probability measure  the first one says that the belief in v
complement  denoted v   given u is a function of the belief in v given u   the second says
that the belief in v   v   given u is a function of the belief in v   given v   u and the belief
in v given u   formally  we assume that there are functions s   ir   ir and f   ir    ir
such that
a   bel v ju     s  bel v ju    if u       for all u  v  w  
a   bel v   v   ju     f  bel v   jv   u    bel v ju    if v   u       for all u  v  v    w  
if bel is a probability measure  then we can take s  x        x and f  x  y     xy  
before going on  notice that cox s result does not claim that bel is a probability measure 
just that it is isomorphic to a probability measure  formally  this means that there is a
continuous one to one onto function g   ir   ir such that g  bel is a probability measure
on w   and
g  bel v ju     g  bel u      g  bel v   u    if u

where bel u   is an abbreviation for bel u jw   
if we are willing to accept that belief is real valued  this is a strong assumption since 
among other things  it commits us to the assumption that beliefs cannot be incomparable 
for any two events u and v   we must have either bel u    bel v   or bel v    bel u    
then a  and a  are very reasonable  if this were all it took to prove cox s theorem  then
it indeed would be a very compelling argument for the use of probability 
unfortunately  it is well known that a  and a  by themselves do not suce to prove
cox s theorem  dubois and prade        give an example of a function bel  defined on a
finite domain  that satisfies a  and a  with f  x  y     min x  y   and s  x        x but is
not isomorphic to a probability measure  thus  if we are to prove cox s theorem  we need
to have additional assumptions 
it is hard to dig out of cox s papers              exactly what additional assumptions
his proofs need  i show in my paper that the result is false under some quite strong
assumptions  see below   my result also suggests that most of the other proofs given of
cox style theorems are at best incomplete  that is  they require additional assumptions
beyond those stated by the authors   see my previous paper for discussion  the goal of
this note is to clarify what it takes to prove a cox style theorem  by giving a number of
hypotheses under which the result can be proved  all of the positive versions of the theorem
that i state can be proved in a straightforward way by adapting the proof given by paris
         this is the one correct  rigorous proof of the result of which i am aware  with
all the hypotheses stated clearly   nevertheless  i believe it is worth identifying all these
variants  since they are philosophically quite different 
paris        proves cox s theorem under the following additional assumptions 
par   the range of bel is        
par   bel  ju       and bel u ju       if u      
par   the s in a  is decreasing 
par   the f is a  is strictly increasing  in each coordinate  in         and continuous 
par   for all    ff  fi      and       there are sets u   u   u   u  such that u       
and each of jbel u ju      ffj  jbel u ju      fi j  and jbel u ju      j is less than  

theorem     paris        if par    hold  then bel is isomorphic to a probability measure 
there is nothing special about   and   in par  and par   all we need to assume is that
there is some interval  e  e   with e   e such that bel v ju      e  e   for all v  u  w  
bel  ju     e  and bel u ju     e   these assumptions certainly seem reasonable  provided
we accept that beliefs should be linearly ordered  nor is it hard too hard to justify par 
and par   indeed  cox justifies them in his original paper   the problematic assumption
here is par   called a  in my earlier paper and co  by paris          par  can be thought
of as a density requirement  among other things  it says that for each fixed v   the set of
values that bel u jv   takes on is dense in         it follows that  in particular  to satisfy
par   w must be infinite  par  cannot be satisfied in finite domains  while  natural  and
 reasonable  are  of course  in the eye of the beholder  it does not strike me as a natural
   

ficox s theorem revisited

or reasonable assumption in any obvious sense of the words  this is particularly true since
many domains of interest in ai  and other application areas  are finite  any version of cox s
theorem that uses par  is simply not applicable in these domains  can we weaken par  
cox does not require anything like par  in his paper  he does require at various times
that f be twice differentiable  with a continuous second derivative  and that s be twice
differentiable   while differentiability assumptions are perhaps not as compelling as continuity assumptions  they do seem like reasonable technical restrictions  unfortunately  the
counterexample i give in my earlier paper shows that these assumptions do not suce to
prove cox s theorem  what i show is the following 

theorem     halpern        there is a function bel   a finite domain w   and functions

s and f satisfying a  and a   respectively  such that

 bel  v ju            for u      
 s  x        x  so that s is strictly decreasing and infinitely differentiable  
 f is infinitely differentiable  nondecreasing in each argument in          and strictly increasing in each argument in          moreover  f is commutative  f  x       f     x   
   and f  x       f     x    x 

however  bel  is not isomorphic to a probability measure 

to understand what the makes counterexample tick and the role of par   it is useful to
review part of cox s argument  in the course of his proof  cox shows that a  forces f to
be an associative function  that is  that
f  x  f  y  z      f  f  x  y    z   

   

here is cox s argument 
suppose u   u   u   u    let x   bel u ju    y   bel u ju    z   bel u ju    
u    bel u  ju    u    bel u  ju    and u    bel u  ju    by a   we have that u    f  x  y   
u    f  y  z    and u    f  x  u     f  u    z    it follows that f  x  f  y  z      f  f  x  y    z   
note that this argument does not show that f  x  f  y  z      f  f  x  y    z   for all x  y  z  
it shows only that the equality holds for those x  y  z for which there exist u   u   u  
u  such that x   bel u  ju    y   bel u ju     and z   bel u ju    par  guarantees that
the set of such x  y  z is dense in          combined with the continuity of f assumed in
par   this tells us that     holds for all x  y  z  
i had claimed in my earlier paper that none of the authors who had proved variants
of cox s theorem  including cox himself  aczel  and reichenbach  seemed to be aware of
the need to make     hold for all x  y  z    i was wrong in including cox in this list   this
is the glaring inaccuracy i referred to above   as snow        points out  cox actually
does realize that f must satisfy     for all x  y  z   and explicitly makes this assumption at
   cox never collects his assumptions in any one place  so it is somewhat dicult to tell exactly what he
thinks he needs for his proof  more on this later 
   as i pointed out in in my earlier paper  aczel recognized this problem in later work  aczel   daroczy 
      

   

fihalpern

a certain point in his first paper  cox         although he does not make this assumption
explicitly in his  more informal  later paper  cox        
unfortunately  although cox escapes from my criticism by recognizing the need to make
this assumption  it does not make his theorem any less palatable  indeed  if anything  it
makes matters worse  associativity is a rather strong assumption  as cox himself shows 
in fact  cox shows that if f is associative and has continuous second derivatives  then
f is isomorphic to multiplication  that is  there exists a function f and constant c such
that cf  f  x  y      f  x f  y    let me stress that the conclusion that f is isomorphic to
multiplication just follows from the fact that it is associative and has continuous second
derivatives  and has nothing to do with a   of course  by the time we are willing to assume
that there is a function f that is isomorphic to multiplication that satisfies a   then we
are well on the way to showing that bel is isomorphic to a probability measure  for future
reference  i remark that paris shows  in his lemma      that par   par   par   and par 
suce to show that f is isomorphic to multiplication  and that we can take c      
in any case  suppose we are willing to strengthen par  so as to require f to be associative
as well as continuous and strictly increasing  does this suce to get rid of par  altogether 
unfortunately  it does not seem to 
later in his argument  cox shows that s must satisfy the following two functional
equations for all sets u   u   u   
s  s  bel u ju        bel u  ju  

   

and
bel u  ju   s  bel u  ju   bel u ju      s  s  bel u ju    s  bel u ju     s  bel u ju    
   
this means that for all x and y     for which there exist sets u   u    and u  such that
x   bel u ju   and y   bel u  ju    we have
s  s  y      y

   

and

ys  x y     s  x s  s  y   s  x   
   
cox actually wants these equations to hold for all x and y   paris shows that this follows from
par      here is paris s argument  using par   it can be shown that s is continuous  see

 paris        lemma        this combined with par  easily gives us that     holds for all
y               follows from par  and the fact that f must be isomorphic to multiplication 
as i mentioned above  the latter fact is shown by paris to follow from par   par   par   and
par    without par   we need to assume that     and     both hold for all x and y   and
that is what cox does  
in the proof given by paris for theorem    the only use made of par  is in deriving the
associativity of f and the fact that s satisfies     and      thus  we immediately get the
following variant of cox s theorem 
   actually  cox starts with     and derives the more symmetric functional equation ys  s  x  y   
xs  s  y  x   rather than      it is this latter functional equation that he assumes holds for all x and y 
if we replace x by s  x  everywhere and use      then we get     

   

ficox s theorem revisited

theorem    if par    hold and  in addition  the f in a  is associative and the s in a 
satisfies both     and     for all x  y           then bel is isomorphic to a probability measure 
i stress here that a  and a  place constraints only on how f and s act on the range of
bel  that is  on elements x of the form bel u   for some subset u of w    while associativity 
     and     place constraints on the global behavior of f and s   that is  on how f and s
act even on arguments not in the range of bel  the example i give in my earlier paper can
be viewed as giving a bel for which it is possible to find f and s satisfying a  and a   but
there is no f satisfying a  which is associative on        
we can get a variant even closer to what cox        shows by replacing par  by the
assumption that f is twice differentiable  note that we need to make some continuity 
monotonicity  or differentiability assumptions on f   as i mentioned earlier  dubois and
prade show there is a bel that is not isomorphic to a probability function for which s  x   
    x and f  x  y     min x  y    the min function is differentiable  and a fortiori continuous  
but is not twice differentiable  nor is it strictly increasing in each coordinate in        
 although it is nondecreasing  
the advantage of replacing par  by the requirement that f be associative and that s
satisfy     and     is that this variant of cox s theorem now applies even if w is finite  on
the other hand  it is hard  at least for me  to view     as a  natural  requirement  while
assumptions like associativity for f and idempotency for s  i e        are certainly natural
mathematical assumptions  the only justification for requiring them on all of        seems to
be that they provably follow from the other assumptions for certain tuples in the range of
bel  is this reasonable or compelling  of course  that is up to the reader to judge  in any
case  these are assumptions that needed to be highlighted by anyone using cox s theorem
as a justification for probability  rather than being swept under the carpet  the requirement
that s must satisfy     is not even mentioned by snow         let alone discussed  snow is
not alone  it does not seem to be mentioned in any other discussion of cox s results either
 other than by paris   of course  we can avoid mentioning     and     by just requiring
that s  x        x  as cox        does   however  this makes the result less compelling 
a number of other variants of cox s theorem which are correct are discussed in  halpern 
      section     let me conclude by formalizing two of them that apply to finite domains 
but use par   or slight variants of it   rather than assuming that f must be associative and
that s must satisfy     and     for all pairs x  y          
the first essentially assumes that we can extend any finite domain to an infinite domain
by adding a suciently many  irrelevant  propositions  such as the tosses of fair coin  as
i observed in my earlier paper  this type of extendability argument is fairly standard  for
example  it is made by savage        in the course of justifying one of his axioms for
preference  snow        essentially uses it as well  formally  this gives us the following
variant of cox s theorem  whose proof is a trivial variant of that of theorem   

theorem    given a function bel on a domain w   suppose there exists a domain w    w
and a function bel  extending bel defined on all subsets of w   such that a  and a  hold
for bel  and all subsets u  v  v   of w   and par    hold for bel    then bel   and hence
bel  is isomorphic to a probability measure 

   

fihalpern

the problem with this approach is that it requires us to extend bel to events we were never
interested in considering in the first place  and to do so in a way that is guaranteed to
continue to satisfy par    
the second variant assumes that bel is defined not just on one domain w   but on all
domains  or at least  a large family of domains   the functions f and s then have to be
uniform across all domains  more precisely  we would get the following 

theorem    suppose we have a function bel defined on all domains w in some set w of

domains  there exist functions f and s such that f and s satisfy a  and a  for all the
domains w   w   par    hold for f and s   and the following variant of par  holds 

par     for all    ff  fi      and       there exists w   w and sets u    u   u   u   w
such that u   u   u   u    u        and each of jbel u  ju     ffj  jbel u ju      fi j 
and jbel u ju       j is less than  
then bel is uniformly isomorphic to a probability measure  in that there exists a function
g   ir   ir such that for all w   w   we have that g  bel is a probability measure on each
w and for all u  v  w   we have
g  bel v ju     g  bel u      g  bel v

  u    if u      

the advantage of this formulation is that w can consist of only finite domains  we never
have to venture into the infinite  although then w would have to include infinitely many
finite domains   this conception of one function bel defined uniformly over a family of
domains seems consistent with the philosophy of both cox and jaynes  see  in particular 
 jaynes         
while the hypotheses of theorems   and   may seem more reasonable than some others
 at least  to some readers    note that they still both essentially require par  and  like all
the other variants of cox s theorem that i am aware of  disallow a notion of belief that has
only finitely many gradations  one can justify a notion of belief that takes on all values
in        by continuity considerations  again  assuming that one accepts a linearly ordered
notion of belief   but it is still a nontrivial requirement  
i will stop at this point and leave it to the reader to form his or her own beliefs 

acknowledgments

i d like to thank paul snow for some useful email exchanges on this topic  and for pointing
out that cox had in fact realized the need to assume that f was associative for all  x  y  z    
this work was supported in part by the nsf  under grant iri          
   snow        quotes the conference version of  halpern         which appeared in aaai      pp       
      as saying  cox s theorem  disallows a notion of belief that takes on only finitely many or countably
many gradations    but what i say disallows a notion of belief is not cox s theorem  but the viewpoint
that assumed that bel varies continuously from   to    in fact  co  is compatible with a notion of
belief that takes on countably many  although not finitely many  values   essentially the same sentence
appears in the journal version of the paper  where it does refer to cox s theorem  but without the phrase
 or countably
