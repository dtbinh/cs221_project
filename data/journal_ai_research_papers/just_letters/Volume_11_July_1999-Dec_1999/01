    discussion

experimental results previous section suggest measuring semantic similarity
using information content provides results better traditional method
simply counting number intervening is a links 
measure without problems  however  simple edge counting 
measure sometimes produces spuriously high similarity measures words basis
inappropriate word senses  example  table   shows word similarity several words
tobacco  tobacco alcohol similar  drugs  tobacco sugar
less similar  though entirely dissimilar  since classified substances 
problem arises  however  similarity rating tobacco horse  word horse
used slang term heroin  result information based similarity maximized 
path length minimized  two words categorized narcotics 
contrary intuition 
cases probably relatively rare  however  example illustrates
general concern  measuring similarity words  really relationship among
word senses matters  similarity measure able take account 
absence reliable algorithm choosing appropriate word senses 
straightforward way information based setting consider concepts
nouns belong rather taking single maximally informative class 
suggests defining measure weighted word similarity follows

weighting function concepts pi ff ci       measure similarity

takes information account previous one  rather relying
single concept maximum information content  allows class representing shared
properties contribute information content according value ff ci   intuitively 
values measure relevance  example  computing wsimff  tobacco horse  
ci would range concepts tobacco horse instances  including
narcotic  drug  artifact  life form  etc  everyday context one might expect low
values ff narcotic  ff drug   context of  say  newspaper article
drug dealers  weights concepts might quite high  although possible
include weighted word similarity comparison section    since noun pairs
judged without context  section   provides discussion weighting function

   conclusions
article presented measure semantic similarity is a taxonomy  based
notion information content  experimental evaluation performed using large 
independently constructed corpus  independently constructed taxonomy  previously
existing new human subject data  results suggest measure performs
encouragingly well significantly better traditional edge counting approach  semantic similarity  measured using information content  shown useful
resolving cases two pervasive kinds linguistic ambiguity  resolving coordination
ambiguity  measure employed capture intuition similarity meaning
one indicator two words conjoined  suggestive results first experiment
bolstered unequivocal results second study  demonstrating significant improvements disambiguation strategy based syntactic agreement  resolving word
sense ambiguity  semantic similarity measure used assign confidence values
word senses nouns within thesaurus like groupings  formal evaluation provided evidence technique produce useful results better suited semi automated
sense filtering categorical sense selection  application technique dictionary thesaurus world wide web provides demonstration method action
real world setting
