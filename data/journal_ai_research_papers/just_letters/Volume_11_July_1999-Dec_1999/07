assumptions needed prove cox s theorem discussed examined  various
sets assumptions cox style theorem proved provided  although
rather strong and  arguably  natural 

recently wrote paper  halpern        casting doubt compelling justification

seems me  least  surprising amount response article  attempt
clarify degree think cox s theorem salvaged respond glaring
inaccuracy part pointed snow          fortunately  inaccuracy

tried write note enough detail read independently

major sources based  cox        paris         details discussion 
basic situation  cox s goal  try show       possible derive
rules probability two quite primitive notions independent notion

end  starts function bel associates real number pair  u  v  
subsets domain w u       write bel v ju   rather bel u  v    since
think bel v ju   belief  credibility  likelihood v given u   cox s theorem
informally understood  states bel satisfies two reasonable restrictions 
bel must isomorphic probability measure  first one says belief v
complement  denoted v   given u function belief v given u   second says
belief v   v   given u function belief v   given v   u belief

additional assumptions 
hard dig cox s papers              exactly additional assumptions

state proved straightforward way adapting proof given paris
         this one correct  rigorous proof result aware

ficox s theorem revisited

reasonable assumption obvious sense words  particularly true since
many domains interest ai  and application areas  finite  version cox s
theorem uses par  simply applicable domains  weaken par  
cox require anything par  paper  require various times
f twice differentiable  continuous second derivative  twice
differentiable   differentiability assumptions perhaps compelling continuity assumptions  seem reasonable technical restrictions  unfortunately 
counterexample give earlier paper shows assumptions suce
prove cox s theorem  show following

however  bel  isomorphic probability measure

review part cox s argument  course proof  cox shows a  forces f

set x  y  z dense          combined continuity f assumed
par   tells us     holds x  y  z  
claimed earlier paper none authors proved variants
cox s theorem  including cox himself  aczel  reichenbach  seemed aware
need make     hold x  y  z    wrong including cox list   this
glaring inaccuracy referred above   snow        points out  cox actually
realize f must satisfy     x  y  z   explicitly makes assumption
   cox never collects assumptions one place  somewhat dicult tell exactly
thinks needs proof  later

certain point first paper  cox         although make assumption
explicitly  more informal  later paper  cox        
unfortunately  although cox escapes criticism recognizing need make
assumption  make theorem less palatable  indeed  anything 
makes matters worse  associativity rather strong assumption  cox shows 
fact  cox shows f associative continuous second derivatives 
f isomorphic multiplication  is  exists function f constant c
cf  f  x       f  x f  y    let stress conclusion f isomorphic
multiplication follows fact associative continuous second
derivatives  nothing a   course  time willing assume
function f isomorphic multiplication satisfies a  
well way showing bel isomorphic probability measure  future
reference  remark paris shows  in lemma      par   par   par   par 
suce show f isomorphic multiplication  and take c      
case  suppose willing strengthen par  require f associative
well continuous strictly increasing  suce get rid par  altogether 
unfortunately  seem to 
later argument  cox shows must satisfy following two functional
equations sets u  u  u

cox actually wants equations hold x   paris shows follows

associativity f fact satisfies          thus  immediately get

ficox s theorem revisited

theorem    par    hold and  addition  f a  associative a 
satisfies         x            bel isomorphic probability measure 
stress a  a  place constraints f act range
bel  that is  elements x form bel u   subset u w    associativity 
         place constraints global behavior f   is  f
act even arguments range bel  example give earlier paper
viewed giving bel possible find f satisfying a  a  
f satisfying a  associative        
get variant even closer cox        shows replacing par 
assumption f twice differentiable  note need make continuity 
monotonicity  differentiability assumptions f   mentioned earlier  dubois
prade show bel isomorphic probability function  x   
    x f  x      min x     min function differentiable  and fortiori continuous  
twice differentiable  strictly increasing coordinate        
 although nondecreasing  
advantage replacing par  requirement f associative
satisfy         variant cox s theorem applies even w finite 
hand  hard  at least me  view      natural  requirement 
assumptions associativity f idempotency  i e        certainly natural
mathematical assumptions  justification requiring        seems
provably follow assumptions certain tuples range
bel  reasonable compelling  course  reader judge 
case  assumptions needed highlighted anyone using cox s theorem
justification probability  rather swept carpet  requirement
must satisfy     even mentioned snow         let alone discussed  snow
alone  seem mentioned discussion cox s results either
 other paris   course  avoid mentioning         requiring
 x        x  as cox        does   however  makes result less compelling 
number variants cox s theorem correct discussed  halpern 
      section     let conclude formalizing two apply finite domains 
use par   or slight variants it   rather assuming f must associative
must satisfy         pairs x           
first essentially assumes extend finite domain infinite domain
adding suciently many  irrelevant  propositions  tosses fair coin 
observed earlier paper  type extendability argument fairly standard 
example  made savage        course justifying one axioms
preference  snow        essentially uses well  formally  gives us following
variant cox s theorem  whose proof trivial variant theorem   

theorem    given function bel domain w   suppose exists domain w   w
function bel  extending bel defined subsets w   a  a  hold
bel  subsets u  v  v   w   par    hold bel    bel   and hence
bel  isomorphic probability measure 

   

fihalpern

problem approach requires us extend bel events never
interested considering first place  way guaranteed
continue satisfy par    
second variant assumes bel defined one domain w  
domains  or least  large family domains   functions f
uniform across domains  precisely  would get following 

theorem    suppose function bel defined domains w set w

domains  exist functions f f satisfy a  a 
domains w   w   par    hold f   following variant par  holds 

par       ff  fi         exists w   w sets u    u   u   u  w
u  u  u  u    u        jbel u  ju     ffj  jbel u ju      j 
jbel u ju      j less  
bel uniformly isomorphic probability measure  exists function
g   ir   ir w   w   g bel probability measure
w u  v w  
g  bel v ju    g  bel u      g  bel v

  u    u      

advantage formulation w consist finite domains  never
venture infinite  although w would include infinitely many
finite domains   conception one function bel defined uniformly family
domains seems consistent philosophy cox jaynes  see  particular 
 jaynes         
hypotheses theorems     may seem reasonable others
 at least  readers    note still essentially require par  and 
variants cox s theorem aware of  disallow notion belief
finitely many gradations  one justify notion belief takes values
       continuity considerations  again  assuming one accepts linearly ordered
notion belief   still nontrivial requirement  
stop point leave reader form beliefs
