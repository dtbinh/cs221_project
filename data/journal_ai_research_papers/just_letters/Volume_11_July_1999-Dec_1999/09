   introduction
qualitative spatial reasoning received increasing amount interest recent

specific stress qualitative reasoning space  observed zimmermann
        justified fact qualitative spatial relations treated eciently
quantitative counterparts  seem closer model relations
humans adopt spatial reasoning 
even though qualitative spatial reasoning extended literature  spite
relatively short history  certain aspects discipline neglected  particular 
exhaustive computational perspective developed qualitative morphological
reasoning space  term morphological reasoning intended suggest reasoning
internal structure objects  case spatial reasoning includes
reasoning size  shape internal topology spatial regions 
purpose present work analyse complexity reasoning relations

includes internal structures  consider following example 

example

including size shape  one users wants query system opportunity
moving factory  works  present site new one  new site
prefabricated facilities already exist  problem consists deciding preserve
topological layout factory minimise costs buying new engines  substitute
cannot fit new facilities 
order reason problems system made able represent
qualitative relations old new site parts  establishing  particular whether
spatial regions occupied engines  congruent   even  congruent part 
ones chosen hosting new factory s site 
clearly cannot use topological information  since spatial region presently occupied
engine surely disjoint region engine going occupy new
site  information insucient deciding whether new site able host
engine itself 
though metric information involved final decision moving factory 
qualitative reasoning used initial design phase 
figure   give pictorial representation one possible situation which  make
decisions  need represent spatial information topological

equivalence relation congruence  consider roto translation region x
respect region y  four possible situations arise 
least one roto translation x coincides y  two regions
congruent 
least one roto translation x coincides proper part y 
region x congruent proper part y

   equality two regions implies congruence  relation proper part excludes
