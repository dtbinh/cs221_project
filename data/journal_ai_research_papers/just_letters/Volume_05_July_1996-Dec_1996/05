game theory makes contributions understanding many different fields 
particularly serendipitous match game theory heterogeneous computer systems  computers  pre programmed behavior  make concrete
notion  strategy  plays central role game theory the idea player
adopts rules behavior starting play given game  rules entirely
control responses game  idealized player imperfect model human

private information  many situations agent s goals might known

other s goals  because lanes located   worth
associates passing intersection target lane  however  private  goal
recognition techniques suitable discovering agent s intentions  worth 
however  harder discern short term external evidence 
agents declare     phase  worths  used baseline
utility calculation  and thus affect negotiation outcome   concerned
analyzing worth declaration strategies agents might adopt increase utility

eciency  agents squander resources come agree 

ment  wasted utility agreement reached  example 
makes sense agreements satisfy requirement pareto optimality
 no agent could derive different agreement  without agent
deriving less alternate agreement   another consideration might global
optimality  achieved sum agents  benefits maximized 
global optimality implies pareto optimality  vice versa  since speaking self motivated agents  who care utilities  sum
system wide utilities no agent general would willing accept lower utility
increase system s sum   pareto optimality plays primary role eciency
evaluation  among pareto optimal solutions  however  might consider
secondary criterion solutions increase sum system wide utilities 
stability  agent incentive deviate agreed upon strategies 
strategy agents adopt proposed part interaction environment
design  strategies proposed  however  want individual
designers  e g   companies  incentive go back build agents
different  manipulative  strategies 
simplicity  desirable overall interaction environment make low
computational demands agents  require little communication overhead 
related eciency stability  interaction mechanism
simple  increases eciency system  fewer resources used carrying
negotiation itself  similarly  stable mechanisms  resources need
spent outguessing opponent  trying discover optimal choices 
optimal behavior publicly revealed  nothing better
carry out 
distribution  preferably  interaction rules require central decision
maker  obvious reasons  want distributed system
performance bottleneck  collapse due single failure special node 
symmetry  may want agents play different roles interaction scenario  simplifies overall mechanism  removes question agent
play role interaction gets way 

attributes need universally accepted  fact  sometimes tradeoffs one attribute another  for example  eciency stability sometimes
con ict one another  see section     protocols designed  specific
classes domains  satisfy attributes  ultimately 
kinds criteria rate acceptability one interaction mechanism another 
one example  attribute stability assumes particular importance consider open systems  new agents constantly entering leaving community
interacting machines  here  might want maintain stability face new agents
bring new goals potentially new strategies well  mechanism
 self perpetuating   benefit society whole follow
rules  benefit individual member  social behavior remains

    side effects encounters
various kinds encounters among agents  various types domains  possible  previous work  zlotkin   rosenschein            a            b  examined task oriented
domains  tods   encompass certain kinds encounters among agents  state
oriented domains  sods  describe larger class scenarios multiagent encounters
tods  fact  see below  set task oriented domains actually
proper subset state oriented domains  classical domains artificial intelligence
instances state oriented domains 
main attribute general sods agents  actions side effects  task
oriented domains  side effects exist general common resources unrestricted 
thus  agent achieves set tasks tod positive negative
effects agent whatsoever  hinder agent achieving
goal  never satisfies agent s goals  by accident   enable another agent
carry task  example postmen domain  zlotkin   rosenschein 
       necessary explicitly declare existence letter  hand over 
delivered  absence side effects rules positive negative
interactions among agent goals  positive interactions remain
explicitly coordinated agents 
general state oriented domains  side effects exist  agents unintentionally
achieve one another s goals  thus benefit one another s actions  ip side
side effects  however  negative interactions goals exist  thus 
sod domain  unlike tods  necessarily cooperative  action
side effects  sods  agents deal goal con ict interference  well
possibility unintended cooperation

    domain definition
consider group agents co exist environment  agent goal
interested achieving  mean achieve goal  state oriented domains 
classic ai notion goal achievement  means carry sequence actions
 a plan  results transformation environment state goal
satisfied 
imagine  example  person interested getting work  goal
work  current state  work  plan sequence actions
get work  driving car  calling taxi  walking  riding bicycle         
final  goal  state  may differ depending plan executed  e g  
car is  bicycle is   states work  however  satisfy goal 
let s assume optimal plan  from time point view  involves driving car
work 
specification goal states may implicit  fact needs true
 the goal  may given  situation fact true  i e   goal satisfied 
acceptable  state oriented domain  goal described set states
satisfy it 
imagine person s wife interested place work 
states satisfy husband s wife s goals  plans
achieve state  e g   one takes car  calls taxi   however 
certain plans suitable either spouse isolation  cannot
coexist  example  husband taking car perfectly good plan  and optimal 
alone world  similarly  wife s taking car good plan  and optimal 
alone  together  another plan may suitable  husband drives wife
work  continues car work   case  extra work required
husband s point view  wife present world  certain burden
coordination 
example above  agents carry sequence activities  suitably synchronized  reach goal state satisfying both  husband wife enter car 
husband drives particular location  wife exits  on  environment  primitive operations agent alone do  operations
combined coherent sequence actions specifying agents  and
order done   say agents executing joint plan 
joint plan general transforms world initial state goal state satisfying
agents  when possible   plan transforms world initial state
husband wife home goal state  satisfying agents 
wife work  car husband place work  final state 
one many goal states 
task oriented domains cost coordinated plan need never worse
stand alone plan at worst  agent achieves set tasks 
husband wife sharing one car example  however  coordinated plan may worse
one agents stand alone plans  example one attribute

    assumptions

throughout paper  making number simplifying assumptions enable
us lay foundation theory mechanism design automated agents 
here  present assumptions 
  
  

  
  
  

  

expected utility maximizer  designers design agents maximize expected utility  example  assume designer build agent prefer
    chance getting       rather sure     
isolated negotiation  agent cannot commit part current negotiation behavior future negotiation  expect current
behavior way affect future negotiation  similarly  agent cannot expect
others behave particular way based previous interaction history 
act differently past behavior  negotiation stands
alone 
interagent comparison utility  designers means transforming
utilities held different agents common utility units 
symmetric abilities  agents able perform set operations
world  cost operation independent agent carrying out 
binding commitments  designers design agents keep explicit public
commitments  assume nothing relationship private preferences
public behavior  public commitment followed public performance
commitment  monitored  necessary  enforced 
explicit utility transfer  although agents compare respective utilities  way explicitly transferring utility units one other 
is  example   money  used compensate one agent
disadvantageous agreement  utility transfer occur  however  implicitly 
implicit transfer utility forms basis agreement among agents
