abstract

decomposable dependency models possess a number of interesting and useful properties  this paper presents new characterizations of decomposable models in terms of independence relationships  which are obtained by adding a single axiom to the well known
set characterizing dependency models that are isomorphic to undirected graphs  we also
briey discuss a potential application of our results to the problem of learning graphical
models from data 

   introduction

graphical models are knowledge representation tools commonly used by an increasing number of researchers  particularly from the artificial intelligence and statistics communities 
the reason for the success of graphical models is their capacity to represent and handle
independence relationships  which have proved crucial for the ecient management and
storage of information  pearl        
there are different kinds of graphical models  although we are particularly interested
in undirected and directed graphs  which  in a probabilistic context  are usually called
markov networks and bayesian networks  respectively   each one has its own merits and
shortcomings  but neither of these two representations has more expressive power than the
other  there are independence relationships that can be represented by means of directed
graphs  using the d separation criterion  and cannot be represented by using undirected ones
 through the separation criterion   and reciprocally  however  there is a class of models that
can be represented by means of both directed and undirected graphs  which is precisely the
class of decomposable models  haberman        pearl         decomposable models also
possess important properties  relative to factorization and parameter estimation  which
make them quite useful  so  these models have been studied and characterized in many
different ways  beeri  fagin  maier    yannakakis        haberman        lauritzen  speed 
  vijayan        pearl        wermuth   lauritzen        whittaker         for example 
decomposable models have been characterized as the kind of dependency models isomorphic
to chordal graphs  lauritzen et al         whittaker        
however  we do not know any characterization of decomposable models in terms of the
kind of independence relationships that they are capable of representing  this is somewhat
surprising  because it seems quite natural to us to characterize a type of object using the
same terms as those used to define it  in our case  the object is a special type of dependency
model  i e   a collection of conditional independence statements about a set of variables in
a given domain of knowledge  and therefore we should be able to describe it in terms of

properties of these independence relationships  the objective of this paper is precisely to
obtain such a characterization of decomposable models 
our approach to the problem will be based on identifying the set of properties or axioms
that a collection of independence relationships must satisfy  in order to be representable
by a chordal graph  this approach has been successfully used to study other kinds of
dependency models  pearl and paz        identified the set of properties characterizing
models isomorphic to undirected graphs  and de campos        determined the axioms
that characterize models isomorphic to undirected and directed singly connected graphs
 i e   trees and polytrees  respectively  
the rest of the paper is organized as follows  in section   we briey describe several
concepts which are basic for subsequent development  section   introduces decomposable
models and their representation using chordal graphs  in section   we prove two characterizations of decomposable models  these characterizations turn out to be surprisingly
simple  we only have to add a single property to the set of axioms characterizing dependency
models isomorphic to undirected graphs  section   discusses the relationships between our
results and lauritzen s characterization of chordal graphs  finally  section   contains the
concluding remarks and some proposals for future work  which include the application of
the results developed here to the problem of learning graphical models from data 

   preliminaries

in this section  we are going to describe the notation as well as some basic concepts and
results used throughout the paper 
a dependency model  pearl        is a pair m    u  i    where u is a finite set of elements or variables  and i      j   is a rule that assigns truth values to a three place predicate
whose arguments are disjoint subsets of u   single elements of u will be denoted by standard
or greek lowercase letters  whereas subsets of u will be represented by capital letters  the
interpretation of the conditional independence assertion i  x  y jz   is that having observed
z   no additional information about x could be obtained by also observing y   for example  in a probabilistic model  dawid        lauritzen  dawid  larsen    leimer        
i  x  y jz   holds if and only if

p  xjz  y    p  xjz  whenever p  z  y      
for every instantiation x  y and z of the sets of variables x   y and z   however  dependency
models are applicable to many situations far beyond probabilistic models  de campos       
pearl        shenoy        
a graphical representation of a dependency model m    u  i   is a direct correspondence
between the elements in u and the set of nodes in a given graph  g  such that the topology of
g reects some properties of i   the topological property selected to represent independence
assertions depends on the type of graph we use  separation for undirected graphs and dseparation  pearl        verma   pearl        for directed acyclic graphs  dags  

 separation  given an undirected graph g  two subsets of nodes  x and y   are said to
be separated by the set of nodes z   and this is denoted by hx  y jz ig   if z intercepts
all chains between the nodes in x and those in y  
   

ficharacterizations of decomposable dependency models

 d separation  given a dag g  a chain c  a chain in a directed graph is a sequence of
adjacent nodes  the direction of the arrows does not matter  from node ff to node fi
is said to be blocked by the set of nodes z   if there is a vertex    c such that  either
     z and arrows of c do not meet head to head at    or
      z   nor has  any descendants in z   and the arrows of c do meet head to
head at   
two subsets of nodes  x and y   are said to be d separated by z   and this is also
denoted by hx  y jz ig   if all chains between the nodes in x and the nodes in y
are blocked by z   there exists a criterion equivalent to d separation  based on the
separation of x from y by z in the moral graph of the smallest ancestral set containing
x   y   z  lauritzen et al         
given a dependency model  m   we say that an undirected graph  a dag  respectively   g 
is an i map if every separation  d separation  respectively  in g implies an independence
in m   hx  y jz ig   i  x  y jz    on the other hand  an undirected graph  a dag  resp   
g  is called a d map if every independence relation in the model implies a separation  dseparation resp   in the graph  i  x  y jz     hx  y jz ig   a graph  g  is a perfect map of
m if it is both an i map and a d map  m is said to be graph isomorphic if a graph exists
which is a perfect map of m  

the class of dependency models isomorphic to undirected graphs has been completely
characterized  pearl   paz        in terms of five properties or axioms satisfied by the
independence relationships within the model 
 c   symmetry 
 i  x  y jz     i  y  x jz     x  y  z  u 
 c   decomposition 
 i  x  y   w jz     i  x  y jz     x  y  w  z  u 
 c   strong union 
 i  x  y jz     i  x  y jz   w     x  y  w  z  u 
 c   intersection 
 i  x  y jz   w   and i  x  w jz   y     i  x  y   w jz     x  y  w  z  u 
 c   transitivity 
 i  x  y jz     i  x   jz   or i    y jz       u n  x   y   z     x  y  z  u 
pearl and paz also tacitly assumed that an additional  trivial  axiom holds  namely i  x   jz  
 x  z  u   they also assumed all through that the sets x  y  z  w involved in the axioms
are pairwise disjoint 

theorem    pearl and paz        a dependency model m is isomorphic to an undirected graph if  and only if  it satisfies the axioms c  c  

the graph associated with the dependency model m   such that conditional independence
in m is equivalent to separation in this graph  is gm    u  em    where the set of edges

em is

em   fff fi j ff  fi   u   i  ff  fi ju n fff  fi g g 

on the other hand  the class of dependency models isomorphic to dags is considerably
more dicult to characterize  it has been suggested  geiger        pearl        that the
number of axioms required for a complete characterization of the d separation in dags is
probably unbounded  however  some more restricted models  namely polytree isomorphic
models  can be fully characterized by using a finite number of axioms  de campos        
graphical models are not only convenient means of expressing conditional independence
statements in a given domain of knowledge  they also convey information necessary for
decisions and inference  in the form of numerical parameters quantifying the strength of each
link  the assignment of numerical parameters to a graphical model is also quite different
for undirected and directed graphs  here we restrict the discussion to probabilistic models  
in the case of directed acyclic graphs  this is a simple matter  we only have to assign to
each variable xi in the dag a conditional probability distribution for every instantiation of
the variables that form the parent set of xi     xi   the product of these local distributions
constitutes a complete and consistent specification  i e   a joint probability distribution
 which also preserves the independence relationships displayed by the dag  

p  x    x          xn   

yn p  xij xi  

i  

however  the case of undirected graphs is different  constructing a complete and consistent
quantitative specification while preserving the dependence structure of an arbitrary undirected graph can be done using the method of gibb s potentials  lauritzen         which
assigns compatibility functions to the cliques of the graph   but it is considerably more
complicated  in terms of both computational effort and meaningfulness of the parameters 
than the simple method used for dags 

   decomposable models and chordal graphs
some dependency models representable by means of a special class of undirected graphs
do not present the quantification problem described above  these are the so called decomposable models  which also exhibit a number of important and useful additional properties 
there are several ways of defining decomposable models  the most appropriate to our
interests  which mainly lie in graphical modelling  is based on a graph theoretic concept 
chordal graphs  also called triangulated graphs  rose        

definition   an undirected graph is said to be chordal if every cycle of length four or more
has a chord  i e   an edge linking two non adjacent nodes in the cycle 

the simplest example of a non chordal graph is the diamond shaped graph displayed in
figure    a  

definition   a dependency model is decomposable if it is isomorphic to a chordal graph

c  c  and c 
one important property satisfied by every chordal graph g  which in fact characterizes
chordal graphs  beeri et al          is that the edges of g can be directed acyclically so that
every pair of converging arrows emanates from two adjacent nodes  from this property  it
can be deduced  pearl        that the class of dependency models that may be represented
by both a dag and an undirected graph is precisely the class of decomposable models  note
that in non chordal graphs  no matter how we direct the arrows  there will always be a pair
of nonadjacent parents sharing a common child  a configuration that causes separation in
undirected graphs but does not produce d separation in dags  
another crucial property of chordal graphs is that their cliques  i e   the largest subgraphs whose nodes are all adjacent to each other  can be joined to form a tree t   called
the join tree  such that any two cliques containing a node ff are either adjacent in t or
connected by a chain of t made entirely of cliques that contain ff  beeri et al          an
example is depicted in figure

this result has important consequences for probabilistic modelling  the joint probability
distribution factorises into the product of marginal distributions on cliques  lauritzen et al

are directly calculable  whittaker         as a consequence the compatibility functions
   

fide campos

used to quantitatively specify the model  have a clear meaning and can be easily estimated 
additionally  the tree structure of the cliques in a chordal graph facilitates recursive updating of probabilities  in fact  one of the most important algorithms for propagation  i e  
updating using local computations  of probabilities in dags  is based on a transformation of
the given dag into a chordal graph  by moralising and next triangulating the dag  lauritzen

   characterizing decomposable models

our purpose is to find a characterization of decomposable models  or equivalently  of chordal
graphs  in terms of properties of independence relationships  this will be carried out by
adding a single property to the set of axioms  c  c   characterizing dependency models
isomorphic to undirected graphs 
let us consider the following axiom 
 c   strong chordality 
 i  ff  fi jz         and i     ju nf   g    i  ff  fi jz      or i  ff  fi jz        ff  fi       u  z 

u n fff  fi     g 

this axiom establishes a condition that allows us to reduce the size of the conditioning
set separating two variables ff and fi   namely that two of the variables in this set are
conditionally independent  we are going to demonstrate that by adding the axiom of strong
chordality to the axioms found by pearl and paz  c  c   the associated graph necessarily
becomes a chordal graph and vice versa  therefore  we shall obtain a characterization of
decomposable models  pearl        proposed an axiom slightly different from c   which is
a necessary  though not sucient condition for chordality  he called this axiom chordality 
 c   chordality 
 i  ff  fi j      and i     jff   fi     i  ff  fi j   or i  ff  fi j     ff  fi       u 
observe that in our context  i e   assuming that c  c  hold  c  implies c   from
i  ff  fij     and i    jff   fi    as strong union  c   guarantees that i     ju n f   g  is
implied by i     jw   for any w  u nf   g  in particular for w   fff  fi g   then by applying
c  with z      we obtain i  ff  fi j   or i  ff  fi j    however  the set of axioms c  c  and
c  do not constitute a characterization of chordal graphs  as the graph depicted in figure
   b  shows  this graph is not chordal  but it satisfies c  c  and c   by using c  instead
of c  we shall obtain the desired result 

theorem   a dependency model m is isomorphic to a chordal graph if  and only if  it
satisfies the axioms c  c  

proof  first  let us prove the sucient condition  using the pearl and paz result  from c  

c  we deduce that m is isomorphic to its associated graph g  and therefore independence
in m is equivalent to separation in g  we only have to prove that g is chordal 
let us suppose that g is not chordal  then  in g  there is a cycle t  t       tn   tn t    n    
without a chord  i e    i  j s t     i   i       j  n  the edges ti  tj do not belong to em
 except the edge t   tn   
   

ficharacterizations of decomposable dependency models

let us consider the nodes t  and tn     and the set of nodes z   u n ft           tn g  first 
we are going to prove that the independence statement i  t   tn   jz   t    tn   has to be
true  if it were  i  t    tn   jz   t    tn   then we could find a chain linking t  and tn   not
containing nodes from z   t    tn   i e   a chain linking t  and tn   containing only nodes
from ft           tn   g  but in this case we would have an edge linking t  and some node tj  
   j  n      and this contradicts the assumption that the cycle has no chord  therefore 
we have i  t   tn   jz   t    tn   
on the other hand  the nodes t  and tn are not connected by any edge  once again
because the cycle has not any chord   so they are separated by u nft    tn g  and therefore we
have i  t    tn ju nft    tn g   now  using c   we deduce either i  t   tn   jz   t    or i  t   tn   jz  
tn    in either case there is a chain linking t  and tn   which is not blocked by the separating
set  in the first case the chain is t  tn tn     and in the second case it is t  t       tn   tn    
therefore  we obtain a contradiction  hence the graph g has to be chordal 
now  let us prove the necessary condition  once again using pearl and paz s result  as m
is isomorphic to a graph g  then the properties c  c  hold 
let us suppose that c  does not hold  then  we can find nodes ff  fi     and a subset
of nodes z such that i  ff  fi jz          i     ju n f   g    i  ff  fi jz      and  i  ff  fi jz      
from  i  ff  fi jz      we deduce that a chain fft       tn fi exists in g  such that ti    z   
 i  i e   ft       tng    z           however  from i  ff  fijz        we know that every chain
linking ff and fi must contain some node from z         in particular  for the previously
found chain  we have ft       tn g    z               therefore  there is a node tk such
that tk      let us consider the node tk     from i  ff  fi jz         and transitivity  c   
we obtain i  ff  tk  jz         or i  tk     fi jz          the first independence assertion
cannot be true  because the chain fft       tk   tk   does not contain any node from z        
therefore  we have i  tk     fi jz          if it were i  tk     fi jz       then  from transitivity 
we would obtain i  ff  tk  jz      or i  ff  fi jz       and both statements are false  the first
one because of the existence of the chain fft       tk   tk   and the second one because of the
hypothesis  so  we have  i  tk     fi jz       the same reasoning allows us to assert from
 i  ff  fijz     that  i  tk    fijz      so  we have found a node tk   adjacent to    tk
satisfying the same properties as ff  a completely analogous reasoning applied to node tk  
proves i  tk     tk   jz           i  tk     tk   jz       and  i  tk     tk   jz       so  we have
replaced nodes ff and fi by two nodes adjacent to  satisfying the same properties  note
that the case in which one or the other of tk   and tk   is ff or fi does not matter to the
subsequent argument 
now  from  i  tk     tk   jz      and i  tk     tk   jz         we deduce that there is a
chain tk   s       sm tk   in g such that si    z     i and for some node sh   sh      to
simplify the notation  let us call s    tk     sm     tk     we can assume that  i  j such
that     i       j  h  there is no edge linking si and sj  if this is not the case  we can
simply replace the subchain si si        sj    sj by the single edge si  sj   i e   we consider the
shortest subchain between tk   and sh    for the same reason  we can also suppose that
 p  q such that h   p       q  m      there is not any edge linking sp and sq  
we have found a cycle s  s       sh   sh        sm sm    in g  now  let sf and sg be two
nodes satisfying f   h   g   sf and sg are adjacent to  but  is not adjacent to sj for all
j s t  f   j   g and j    h  note that we can always find these two nodes  starting from
f     and g   m       we still have a cycle sf      sh   sh        sg  of length four or more 
   

fide campos

so that  according to the hypothesis  this cycle must have some chord  however  taking
into account how the cycle has been constructed  the only possible chords are the edge   
or an edge linking a node si   f   i   h  and a node sp   h   p   g   the first possibility
contradicts the hypothesis i     ju nf   g   and the second one implies the existence of the
chain tk   s       sf      si sp      sg      sm tk   linking tk   and tk     which does not contain any
node from z         in contradiction with the statement i  tk     tk   jz          therefore 
the property c  has to be true 
we can establish another interesting characterization of chordal graphs  by also adding
only one axiom to those of pearl and paz  this new axiom is the following 
 c   clique separability 
 i  ff  fi ju n fff  fi g     w  u n fff  fi g such that i  ff  fi jw   and either jw j    or
 i    ju n f  g        w    ff  fi   u  
axiom c  asserts that whenever two nodes ff and fi are not adjacent  are independent  
we can find a separating set whose nodes are all adjacent to each other  i e   a complete
separating set 

theorem   a dependency model m is isomorphic to a chordal graph if  and only if  it
satisfies the axioms c  c  and c  

proof  let us prove the necessary condition  as the graph g associated to m is chordal 

from theorem   we know that the properties c  c  and c  hold 
let us suppose that c  does not hold  then  there are ff and fi   such that i  ff  fi ju n
fff  fig  but for all w  u n fff  fig it is either  i  ff  fijw    or jw j     and       w such
that i     ju n f   g  
let w  be any separating set of minimal size for ff and fi   i e   i  ff  fi jw   and  i  ff  fi js  
 s  w   we know that at least one separating set of this type has to exist  because
i  ff  fiju n fff  fig  holds   then  we can deduce that jw j     and       w  such that
i    ju n f   g   let us define z   w  n f   g  thus  we have i  ff  fi jz        and
i    ju n f   g  and  by applying c   we obtain either i  ff  fi jz      or i  ff  fi jz      i e  
i  ff  fijw  n fg  or i  ff  fijw  n f g   which contradicts the minimality of w    therefore 
c  has to be true 
to prove the sucient condition  let us suppose that g is not chordal  then  there is a
cycle t  t       tn   tn t    n     without a chord  so  the nodes t  and tn   are not adjacent 
hence they are separated  and let w be any separating set of t  and tn     i e   satisfying
i  t   tn   jw    then tn   w and ft          tn   g   w       otherwise we could find a chain
linking t  and tn   which would not be blocked by w   thus contradicting i  t    tn   jw   
so  every separating set w contains tn and some ti      i  n      hence jw j      now  by
applying c   we deduce that  i  tn   tiju n ftn   ti g   i e   tn and ti are adjacent nodes  which
contradicts the assumption that the cycle had no chord  then  the conclusion is that the
graph has to be chordal 
   

ficharacterizations of decomposable dependency models

   relationships with other characterizations of decomposable models
there is a characterization of decomposable models   lauritzen        which is quite related
to ours  an undirected graph is chordal if  and only if  every subset of nodes that separates
any two nodes ff and fi and is minimal is complete 
in order to rewrite this result using our notation  let us consider the following axiom 
 c   completeness 
 i  ff  fi jz   and  i  ff  fi js    s  z   jz j    or  i     ju n f   g        z    ff  fi  
u  z  u n fff  fig 
axiom c  says exactly that any minimal separator of ff and fi has to be complete  an
equivalent formulation of this axiom reads  any separator of ff and fi which is not complete
cannot be minimal  in symbols 
 c    completeness 
 i  ff  fi jz         and i     ju nf   g     w  z       such that i  ff  fi jw     ff  fi      

u  z  u n fff  fi    g 

then  lauritzen s result can be reformulated as follows  a dependency model m is
isomorphic to a chordal graph if  and only if  it satisfies the axioms c  c  and either c 
or c   
note the similarity between c  and c  and between c   and c   taking into account
theorems   and    we can deduce that all these axioms  c   c   c  and c    are equivalent
among each other  assuming that c  c  hold   however  this equivalence is not evident  in
spite of the similarities among axioms  it is clear that c  implies c   and c  implies c   but
the opposite implications are not obvious  in fact  strong chordality and clique separability
seem stronger and weaker  respectively  than completeness  this becomes clearer if we
express the axioms in the following way  assuming that two nodes ff and fi can be separated 

 completeness  c  or c     if a separator of ff and fi is minimal  then it is complete 
or  equivalently  if a separator of ff and fi is not complete  then it has a proper subset
which is still a separator of ff and fi  
 clique separability  c    there exists a separator of ff and fi which is complete 
 strong chordality  c    if a separator of ff and fi is not complete  then it has a proper
subset which is still a separator of ff and fi   moreover  we can find this subset by
removing  from the initial separator  one of the nodes causing its incompleteness 

observe that both c  and c   share the same antecedent  but the consequent of c   only
says that there exists a separator  whereas the consequent of c  gives more information
about the identity of this separator  note also that both c  and c  assert the existence of
a complete separator  but c  requires a previous condition  minimality  and c  does not 
   the existence of this result was pointed out to me by a reviewer

   concluding remarks
we have found two new characterizations of the class of decomposable dependency models 
in terms of properties of independence relationships  we believe that these results are
theoretically interesting  because they provide a new perspective of this important and well
studied class of graphical models  moreover  our results are quite concise  since only one
property has to be added to the set of properties characterizing independence relationships
in undirected graphs  they could also be useful for proving results about models of this
sort 
from a more practical point of view  the axiomatic characterizations create desiderata
that could drive automated construction of chordal graphs from data  as we have already
commented  practical use of graphical models and  particularly  of bayesian networks  requires that the dag representing the model be transformed into a chordal graph  from the
perspective of learning models from data  it may be interesting to estimate directly the
chordal graph from the available data  instead of first learning the dag and after converting it into a chordal graph  we believe that the basic independence properties of chordal
graphs identified by our theoretical study  c  and c   could guide us in the design of efficient algorithms for learning chordal graphs  it is known that the problem of learning
bayesian networks from data is computationally very complex  for example  some algorithms  spirtes  glymour    scheines        start from a complete undirected graph  and
then try to remove edges by testing for conditional independence between the linked nodes 
but using conditioning sets as small as possible  thus reducing the complexity and increasing
reliability   in this context  if we rewrite the property c  in the following way 

 i  ff  fijz      and  i  ff  fijz     and i  ff  fijz           i    ju n f  g  
then we could use it as a rule that simultaneously allows us to remove the edge ff fi from
the current graph  and to fix the edge    as a true edge in the graph 
similarly  the property c  could give rise to the following rule  if we are trying to remove
an edge ff fi from the current graph  by testing conditional independence statements like
i  ff  fijw    then discard as candidate separating sets those sets w whose nodes are not all
adjacent to each other 
this topic of designing ecient algorithms for learning chordal graphs will be the object
of future research
