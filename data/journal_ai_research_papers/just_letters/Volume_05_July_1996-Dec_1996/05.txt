   introduction
negotiation has been a major research topic in the distributed artificial intelligence  dai 
community  smith        malone  fikes  grant    howard        kuwabara   lesser 
      conry  meyer    lesser        kreifelts   von martial         the term negotiation 
however  has been used in a variety of different ways  to some researchers  negotiation
serves as an important mechanism for assigning tasks to agents  for resource allocation  and
for deciding which problem solving tasks to undertake  in these systems  there is generally
some notion of global utility that the system is trying to maximize

other researchers have focused on negotiation that might take place among agents that
serve the interests of truly distinct parties  rosenschein   genesereth        sycara       
kraus   wilkenfeld        zlotkin   rosenschein         the agents are autonomous in
the sense that they have their own utility functions  and no global notion of utility  not
even an implicit one  plays a role in their design  negotiation can be used to share the work
associated with carrying out a joint plan  or to resolve outright conict arising from limited
resources 
despite the varied use of terminology  it is clear to the dai community as a whole
that the operation of interacting agents would be enhanced if they were able to exchange
information to reach mutually beneficial agreements 
the work described in this paper follows the general direction of previous research
by the authors  rosenschein   genesereth        zlotkin   rosenschein        in treating
negotiation in the spirit of game theory  the focus of this research is to analyze the existence
and properties of certain kinds of deals and protocols among agents  we are not here
examining the computational issues that arise in discovering such deals  though the design
of ecient  possibly domain specific  algorithms will constitute an important future phase
of this research  initial work in building a domain theory of negotiation was previously
undertaken  zlotkin   rosenschein      a   and is expanded and generalized in the current
paper  this analysis serves as a critical step in applying the theory of negotiation to realworld applications 

    applying game theory tools to protocol design for automated agents

our ongoing research has been motivated by one  focused premise  the problem of how to
get computers to interact effectively in heterogeneous systems can be tackled through the
use of game theory tools 
our concern is with computer systems made up of machines that have been programmed
by different entities to pursue differing goals  one approach for achieving coordination under
these circumstances is to establish mutually accepted protocols for the machines to use in
coming to agreements 
the perspective of our research is that one can use game theory tools to design and
evaluate these high level protocols  we do not intend  with this paper  to make contributions
to game theory itself  we are not defining new notions of equilibria  nor are we providing
new mathematical tools to be used in general game theory  what we are doing is taking
the game theory approach  and some of its tools  to solve specific problems of high level
protocol design 
while game theory makes contributions to the understanding of many different fields 
there is a particularly serendipitous match between game theory and heterogeneous computer systems  computers  being pre programmed in their behavior  make concrete the
notion of  strategy  that plays such a central role in game theory the idea that a player
adopts rules of behavior before starting to play a given game  and that these rules entirely
control his responses during the game  this idealized player is an imperfect model of human
behavior  but one that is quite appropriate for computers 
while we are not the first to apply game theoretic ideas to computer science  we are
using the tools in a new way  while others have used game theory to answer the question 
   

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

 how should one program a computer to act in a given specific interaction   we are addressing the question of how to design the rules of interaction themselves for automated
agents  the approach taken in this paper is  therefore  strongly based on previous work
in game theory  primarily on what is known as  nash s bargaining problem   nash       
luce   raiffa        or  nash s model of bargaining   roth          mechanism design 
or  implementation theory   binmore        fudenberg   tirole         and  correlated
equilibrium theory   aumann              myerson        forges         a short overview
of game theory results that are used or referred to in this paper can be found in section     

    overview of the paper
in previous work  we began laying the groundwork for a domain theory of negotiation  that
is  a way of classifying interactions so that it is clear  given a domain  which negotiation
mechanisms and strategies are appropriate  previously  we considered task oriented domains  zlotkin   rosenschein            a   a restricted category of interactions  in this
paper  we define state oriented domains  a more general category of interaction 
in section     we examine scenarios where interacting agents in state oriented domains
can find themselves in cooperative  compromise  and conict encounters  in conict situations  the agents  goals cannot be simultaneously achieved  a joint goal reachable situation
 i e   where agents  goals can be simultaneously achieved  can be cooperative or compromise  depending on the cost of reaching a state that satisfies all agents compared to the
cost of each agent  alone  achieving his stand alone goal 
in section      necessary and sucient conditions for cooperation are outlined  cooperative situations lend themselves to mixed joint plan based negotiation mechanisms  however 
compromise situations require special treatment  we propose using the notion of worth in
an altered definition of utility  thereby enabling agreements in a wider class of joint goal
reachable situations  an approach is offered for conict resolution  and it is shown that
even in a conict situation  partial cooperative steps can be taken by interacting agents
 that is  agents in fundamental conict might still agree to cooperate up to a certain point  
a unified negotiation protocol  unp  is developed in section     that can be used in all
types of encounters  it is shown that in certain borderline cooperative situations  a partial
cooperative agreement  i e   one that does not achieve all agents  goals  might be preferred
by all agents  even though there exists a rational agreement that would achieve all their
goals 
the unp is further enhanced in section   to deal with the case where agents have
assigned unlimited worth to their goals and this fact is common knowledge  our solution
depends on the concept of  cleaning up after yourself   or tidiness  as a new method of
evaluating agent utility  we show that two tidy agents are able to reach agreements in all
joint goal reachable situations in state oriented domains 
in section   we analyze cases where agents have incomplete information about the goals
and worth of other agents  first  we consider the case where agents  goals are private
information  and we consider what goal declaration strategies the agents might adopt to
increase their utility 
we then consider  in section    the situation where the agents  goals  and therefore
stand alone costs  are common knowledge  but the worth they attach to their goals is
   

fizlotkin   rosenschein

private information  there are many situations where an agent s goals might be known 
but his worth is private  for example  two cars approaching an intersection may know
each other s goals  because of the lanes in which they are located   the worth that each
associates with passing through the intersection to his target lane  however  is private  goal
recognition techniques are suitable for discovering the other agent s intentions  his worth 
however  is harder to discern from short term external evidence 
the agents declare  in a    phase  their worths  which are then used as a baseline to
the utility calculation  and thus affect the negotiation outcome   we are concerned with
analyzing what worth declaration strategies the agents might adopt to increase their utility 
we introduce two mechanisms  one  strict   the other  tolerant   and analyze their affects
on the stability and eciency of negotiation outcomes  the strict mechanism turns out to
be more stable  while the tolerant mechanism is more ecient 

   negotiation in state oriented domains
how can machines decide how to share resources  or which machine will give way while
the other proceeds  negotiation and compromise are necessary  but how do we build our
machines to do these things  how can the designers of these separate machines decide on
techniques for agreement that enable mutually beneficial behavior  what techniques are
appropriate  can we make definite statements about the techniques  properties 
the way we address these questions is to synthesize ideas from artificial intelligence with
the tools of game theory  assuming that automated agents  built by separate  self interested
designers  will interact  we are interested in designing protocols for specific domains that
will get those agents to interact in useful ways 
the word  protocol  means different things to different people  when we use the word
protocol  we mean the rules by which agents will come to agreements  it specifies the kinds
of deals they can make  as well as the sequence of offers and counter offers that are allowed 
protocols are intimately connected with domains  by which we mean the environment in
which our agents operate  automated agents who control telecommunications networks are
operating in a different domain  in a formal sense  than robots moving boxes  much of our
research is focused on the relationship between different kinds of domains  and the protocols
that are suitable for each 
given a protocol  we need to consider what agent strategy is appropriate  a strategy
is the way an agent behaves in an interaction  the protocol specifies the rules of the
interaction  but the exact deals that an agent proposes are a result of the strategy that his
designer has put into him  as an analogy  a protocol is like the rules governing movement
of pieces in the game of chess  a strategy is the way in which a chess player decides on his
next move 

    attributes of standards
what are the attributes that might interest protocol designers  the set of attributes  and
their relative importance  will ultimately affect their choice of interaction rules 
we have considered several attributes that might be important to system designers 
   

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

  

  

  

  
  

eciency  the agents should not squander resources when they come to an agree 

ment  there should not be wasted utility when an agreement is reached  for example 
it makes sense for the agreements to satisfy the requirement of pareto optimality
 no agent could derive more from a different agreement  without some other agent
deriving less from that alternate agreement   another consideration might be global
optimality  which is achieved when the sum of the agents  benefits are maximized 
global optimality implies pareto optimality  but not vice versa  since we are speaking about self motivated agents  who care about their own utilities  not the sum of
system wide utilities no agent in general would be willing to accept lower utility just
to increase the system s sum   pareto optimality plays a primary role in our eciency
evaluation  among pareto optimal solutions  however  we might also consider as a
secondary criterion those solutions that increase the sum of system wide utilities 
stability  no agent should have an incentive to deviate from agreed upon strategies 
the strategy that agents adopt can be proposed as part of the interaction environment
design  once these strategies have been proposed  however  we do not want individual
designers  e g   companies  to have an incentive to go back and build their agents with
different  manipulative  strategies 
simplicity  it will be desirable for the overall interaction environment to make low
computational demands on the agents  and to require little communication overhead 
this is related both to eciency and to stability  if the interaction mechanism is
simple  it increases eciency of the system  with fewer resources used up in carrying
out the negotiation itself  similarly  with stable mechanisms  few resources need to be
spent on outguessing your opponent  or trying to discover his optimal choices  the
optimal behavior has been publicly revealed  and there is nothing better to do than
just carry it out 
distribution  preferably  the interaction rules will not require a central decision
maker  for all the obvious reasons  we do not want our distributed system to have a
performance bottleneck  nor collapse due to the single failure of a special node 
symmetry  we may not want agents to play different roles in the interaction scenario  this simplifies the overall mechanism  and removes the question of which agent
will play which role when an interaction gets under way 

these attributes need not be universally accepted  in fact  there will sometimes be tradeoffs between one attribute and another  for example  eciency and stability are sometimes
in conict with one another  see section     but our protocols are designed  for specific
classes of domains  so that they satisfy some or all of these attributes  ultimately  these are
the kinds of criteria that rate the acceptability of one interaction mechanism over another 
as one example  the attribute of stability assumes particular importance when we consider open systems  where new agents are constantly entering and leaving the community of
interacting machines  here  we might want to maintain stability in the face of new agents
who bring with them new goals and potentially new strategies as well  if the mechanism is
 self perpetuating   in that it is not only to the benefit of society as a whole to follow the
rules  but also to the benefit of each individual member  then the social behavior remains
   

fizlotkin   rosenschein

stable even when the society s members change dynamically  when the interaction rules
create an environment in which a particular strategy is optimal  beneficial social behavior
is resistant to outside invasion 

    side effects in encounters
various kinds of encounters among agents  in various types of domains  are possible  in previous work  zlotkin   rosenschein            a            b  we examined task oriented
domains  tods   which encompass only certain kinds of encounters among agents  state
oriented domains  sods  describe a larger class of scenarios for multiagent encounters
than do tods  in fact  as we will see below  the set of task oriented domains is actually a
proper subset of state oriented domains  most classical domains in artificial intelligence
have been instances of state oriented domains 
the main attribute of general sods is that agents  actions can have side effects  in task
oriented domains  no side effects exist and in general all common resources are unrestricted 
thus  when an agent achieves his own set of tasks in a tod it has no positive nor negative
effects on the other agent whatsoever  it does not hinder the other agent from achieving his
goal  and it never satisfies the other agent s goals  by accident   to enable another agent to
carry out your task  such as for example in the postmen domain  zlotkin   rosenschein 
       it is necessary explicitly to declare the existence of the letter  and hand it over  so
that it will be delivered  the absence of side effects rules out some positive and all negative
interactions among agent goals  the only positive interactions that remain are those that
are explicitly coordinated by the agents 
in general state oriented domains  where side effects exist  agents can unintentionally
achieve one another s goals  and thus benefit from one another s actions  the ip side of
side effects  however  is that negative interactions between goals can also exist  thus  an
sod is a domain that is  unlike tods  not necessarily cooperative  because of those action
side effects  in sods  agents have to deal with goal conict and interference  as well as the
possibility of unintended cooperation  
for example  consider the blocks world situation in figure    the simplest plan to
achieve on white  gray  has the side effect of achieving clear black

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

    domain definition
consider a group of agents who co exist in some environment  each agent has a goal that it
is interested in achieving  what does it mean to achieve a goal  in state oriented domains 
it is the classic ai notion of goal achievement  it means to carry out a sequence of actions
 a plan  that results in the transformation of the environment to a state where the goal is
satisfied 
imagine  for example  a person who is interested in getting to work  his goal is to be
at work  in the current state  he is not at work  his plan will be the sequence of actions
that get him to work  driving his car  or calling a taxi  or walking  or riding a bicycle         
the final  or goal  state  may differ depending on which plan was executed  e g   where his
car is  where his bicycle is   all the states in which he is at work  however  satisfy his goal 
let s assume that the optimal plan  from the time point of view  involves driving the car
to work 
the specification of the goal states may be implicit  the fact that needs to be true
 the goal  may be given  any situation in which that fact is true  i e   the goal is satisfied 
is acceptable  in a state oriented domain  any goal is described by the set of states that
satisfy it 
now imagine that this person s wife is interested in being at her own place of work 
there are states that will satisfy both the husband s and wife s goals  and plans that will
achieve such a state  e g   one of them takes the car  while the other calls a taxi   however 
there are certain plans that are suitable for either spouse in isolation  but which cannot
coexist  for example  the husband taking the car is a perfectly good plan  and optimal  if
he were alone in the world  similarly  his wife s taking the car is a good plan  and optimal 
if she were alone  together  another plan may be suitable  husband drives wife to her
work  continues on with car to his work   in this case  extra work was required from the
husband s point of view  because the wife is present in his world  there is a certain burden
to the coordination 
in the example above  the agents carry out a sequence of activities  suitably synchronized  to reach the goal state satisfying both  the husband and wife enter the car  after
which the husband drives to a particular location  the wife exits  and so on  in any environment  there are primitive operations that each agent alone can do  when these operations
are combined into a coherent sequence of actions specifying what both agents are to do  and
the order in which they are to be done   we say that the agents are executing a joint plan  a
joint plan in general transforms the world from some initial state to a goal state satisfying
both agents  when possible   the plan above transforms the world from the initial state
where both husband and wife are at home to the goal state  satisfying both agents  where
the wife is at work  and the car and husband are at his place of work  this is the final state 
one of many goal states 
in task oriented domains the cost of the coordinated plan need never be worse than
the stand alone plan at the very worst  each agent just achieves his own set of tasks  in
our husband wife sharing one car example  however  the coordinated plan may be worse
for one or both agents than their stand alone plans  this is an example of one attribute
of state oriented domains  namely negative interactions  or what are sometimes called
   

fizlotkin   rosenschein

 deleted condition interactions   gupta   nau         this is because taking the car has
the side effect of depriving the other agent of the car 
imagine a new situation  that arises during the weekend  the husband is interested
in doing carpentry in the garage  currently occupied by the car   the wife is interested in
taking the car to the baseball game  by themselves  each agent has an optimal plan to reach
a goal state  e g   the husband moves the car out of the garage  parks it outside  does his
carpentry   however  when his wife takes the car to the game  executing her stand alone
optimal plan  the husband benefits from the side effect of the car being moved  namely 
the garage is emptied  this is an example of another typical attribute of state oriented
domains accidental achievement of goals  or  enabling condition interactions   gupta  
nau        or  favor relations   von martial        among goals 
when agents carry out a joint plan  each one plays some  role   our theory assumes
that there is some way of assessing the cost of each role  this measure of cost is essential
to how an agent evaluates a given joint plan  among all joint plans that achieve his goal 
he will prefer those in which his role has lower cost 
we express the intuitive ideas above in the precise definition below 

definition   a state oriented domain  sod  is a tuple   s   a  j   c   where 
   s is the set of all possible world states 

   a   fa   a        a g is an ordered list of agents 
n

   j is the set of all possible joint  i e   n agent  plans  a joint plan j   j moves the
world from one state in s to another  the actions taken by agent k are called k s role
in j   and will be written as j   we can also write j as  j   j          j   
k

n

   c is a function c  j    ir      for each joint plan j in j   c j   is a vector of n positive
real numbers  the cost of each agent s role in the joint plan  c j   is the i th element
of the cost vector  i e   it is the cost of the i th role in j   if an agent plays no role in
j   his cost is   
n

i

our use of the term joint plan differs from other uses in the ai literature  levesque  
cohen        cohen   levesque         there  the term joint plan implies a joint goal 
and mutual commitment by the agents to full implementation of the plan  e g   if one agent
dropped out suddenly  the other would still continue   in our use of the term  the agents
are only committed to their own goal and their part of the combined plan  each may do
its part of the plan for different reasons  because each has a different goal to achieve  were
one agent to drop out  the other agent may or may not continue  depending on whether it
suited his own goal 
the details of the description of the joint plans in j are not critical to our overall theory 
the minimal requirement is that it must be possible to evaluate the cost of the joint plan
for each agent  i e   the cost of his role   in many domains  a joint plan will be a sequence of
actions for each agent with an associated schedule  partial order  constraining the actions 
parallel execution 
note also that our cost function above relates only to the joint plan itself and not 
for example  to the initial state of the world  in fact  the cost function could be altered to
   

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

include other parameters  like the initial state of the world   without affecting our discussion
below  our model is not sensitive to the details of the cost function definition  other than the
requirement that the cost of a role be the same for all agents  this is called the symmetric
abilities assumption  see below  section      

definition   an encounter within an sod   s   a  j   c   is a tuple   s   g   g          g    

such that s   s is the initial state of the world  and for all k   f       ng  g is the set of all
acceptable final world states from s for agent a   g will also be called a  s goal 
n

an agent s goal is a fixed  pre determined  set of states  an agent will  at the conclusion
of the joint plan  either achieve his goal or not achieve his goal  goals cannot be partially
achieved  domains in which goals can be partially achieved are called worth oriented
domains  wods  and are discussed in detail elsewhere  zlotkin   rosenschein      c 
    a  
one thing that we are specifically ruling out in sods is one agent having a goal that
makes reference to another agent s  as yet  unknown goal  for example  a specification
such as  agent   s goal is to make sure that agent   s goal will not be achieved  whatever
the latter s goal is  cannot constitute part of the description of an encounter in a state
oriented domain  because it cannot be described as a static set of goal states  however 
this meta goal might exist within an agent  and give rise to a well defined set of states in a
specific encounter  e g   given g   g  is its complement   similarly  one agent might have
as its goal that another agent have a specific goal g  the first agent wants the world to
be in a state where the other agent has the specific goal g  
we will only consider sets of goal states that can be specified in a finite way  either
because the set itself is finite  or the infinite set can be specified by a closed formula in
first order logic  i e   no free variables  all states that satisfy the formula  and only those
states  are in the goal set   as an example  an agent might have the goal that  there exists
a block x such that block b is on x  
we will also consider further restrictions on the kind of goals agents may have  for
example  below we will consider domains in which agents  goals are restricted to sets of
grounded predicates  i e   no variables  rather than to any closed formula 
      reachability

it may be the case that there exist goal states that satisfy both agents  goals  but that
there are constraints as to the reachability of those states  for example  it may be the case
that a state satisfying each goal can be reached by an agent alone  but a state satisfying
the combined goal cannot be reached by any agent alone  more generally  reaching any
state might require n agents working together  and be unreachable if fewer than n agents
are involved  we will call n the  parallelism factor  of the goal   when the goal in the
intersection cannot be reached by any number of agents working in parallel  we will say the
parallelism factor is infinite  the parallelism factor is a particularly appropriate concept
when there are multiagent actions that are possible or required in the domain  e g   carrying
a heavy table

    assumptions

throughout this paper  we will be making a number of simplifying assumptions that enable
us to lay out the foundation for our theory of mechanism design for automated agents 
here  we present those assumptions 
  
  

  
  
  

  

expected utility maximizer  designers will design their agents to maximize expected utility  for example  we assume that a designer will build his agent to prefer
a     chance of getting       rather than a sure     
isolated negotiation  an agent cannot commit himself as part of the current negotiation to some behavior in a future negotiation  nor can he expect that his current
behavior will in any way affect a future negotiation  similarly  an agent cannot expect
others to behave in a particular way based on their previous interaction history  nor
to act differently with him because of his own past behavior  each negotiation stands
alone 
interagent comparison of utility  the designers have a means of transforming
the utilities held by different agents into common utility units 
symmetric abilities  all agents are able to perform the same set of operations in
the world  and the cost of each operation is independent of the agent carrying it out 
binding commitments  designers will design their agents to keep explicit public
commitments  we assume nothing about the relationship between private preferences
and public behavior  only that public commitment be followed by public performance
of the commitment  this can be monitored  and if necessary  enforced 
no explicit utility transfer  although agents can compare their respective utilities  they have no way of explicitly transferring utility units from one to the other 
there is  for example  no  money  that can be used to compensate one agent for
a disadvantageous agreement  utility transfer does occur  however  implicitly  this
implicit transfer of utility forms the basis for agreement among agents 

   examples of state oriented domains

in this section  we present several examples of state oriented domains  these specific
examples illustrate some of the nuances of describing this class of domains 

    the blocks domain

in the blocks domain  there is a table of unlimited size  and a set of blocks  a block can
be on the table or on some other block  and there is no limit to the height of a stack of
blocks  one state in this domain can be seen in figure   
world states and goals  the basic predicates that make up world states and goals are 

 on x  y   such that x and y are blocks  its meaning is that block x is  directly 
on block y  

   

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

figure    a state in the blocks domain

 

 

 

figure    a state in the slotted blocks domain

 on x  table   such that x is a block  its meaning is that block x is  directly  on

the table 
 clear x   such that x is a block  its meaning is that there is no block on x  i e  
clear x     y on y  x  
as this is an sod  goals are sets of world states  these world states can be expressed
as a first order closed formula over the above predicates  sample goals are 

  clear r    block r is not clear 
  xon r  x    block r is not on the table 
  xon x  table    all blocks are on the table  and therefore  implicitly  all blocks
are also clear  

atomic operation  there is one operation in this world  move x  y    this operation moves
a clear block x onto the top of another clear block y  
cost  each move operation has a cost of   

    the slotted blocks domain

the domain here is the same as the blocks domain above  however  on the table there are
only a bounded number of slots into which blocks can be placed  one state in this domain
can be seen in figure   
world states and goals  the basic predicates that make up world states and goals are 

 on x  y   such that x and y are blocks  its meaning is that block x is  directly 
on block y  

   

fizlotkin   rosenschein

 at x  n   such that x is a block and n is a slot name  its meaning is that block

x is  directly  on the table at slot n 
 clear x   such that x is a block  its meaning is that there is no block which is
on x  i e   clear x     y on y  x  
atomic operations  there are two operations in the slotted blocks domain 

 pickup i    pick up the top block in slot i  can be executed whenever slot i is

not empty  
 putdown i    put down the block that is currently being held into slot i  an
agent can hold no more than one block at a time 
cost  each operation has a cost of one 

this slotted blocks domain is different from the blocks domain above in two ways 
   the table of unlimited size is replaced by a bounded table with distinguishable locations that we call  slots  
   the atomic  move  operation is broken into two sub operations pickup and putdown 
this allows more cooperation among the agents  for example  if we want to swap the
blocks in slot   in figure   it would take one or more agents minimally a total of
  move operations  i e   each block  black and white  is touched twice  however  if
we allow the agents to use the pickup and putdown operations two agents can do
the swap with two pickup and two putdown operations  which is equivalent to two
move operations   i e   each block is touched only once  the finer granularity of the
operations allows more exibility in scheduling within the joint plan 

    the delivery domain with bounded storage space

in this delivery domain  there is a weighted graph g   g v  e    each v   v represents a
warehouse  and each e   e represents a road  the weight function w  e   ir  is the length
of any given road  for each edge e   e   w e  is the length of e or the  cost  of e  each
agent has to deliver containers from one warehouse to another  to do the deliveries  agents
can rent trucks  an unlimited supply of which are available for rental at every node  a
truck can carry up to   containers  each warehouse also has a limited capacity for holding
containers 
atomic operations  the operations in this domain are 

 load c  t    loads a container c onto a truck t  the preconditions are 

  container c and truck t are at the same warehouse h 
  truck t has less than   containers on board  where   is the capacity limit of

each truck 
the results of the operation are 
  warehouse h has one container less 
   

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

  truck t has one container more 

a load operation costs   
 unload c  t    unloads a container c from a truck t  the preconditions are 
  container c is on truck t 
  truck t is at some warehouse h 
  warehouse h is not full 
the results of the operation are 
  warehouse h has one container more 
  truck t has one container less 
the unload operation costs   
 drive t  h    truck t drives to warehouse h  there are no preconditions on this
operation  the result is that truck t is at warehouse h  the cost of this operation
is equal to the distance  i e   the minimal weighted path  between the current
position of truck t and warehouse h 
world states and goals  the full description of a world state includes the location of each
container  either in some warehouse or on some truck  and the location of each truck
 either in some warehouse or on some road   however  we will restrict goals so that
they can only specify which containers need to be at which warehouses 

    the restricted usage shared resource domain

in this domain  there is a set of agents that are able to use a shared resource  such as a
communication line  a shared memory device  a road  a bridge         there is a restriction
that no more than m    agents can use the resource at the same time  m denotes the
maximal capacity of the resource  
atomic operations  the atomic operations in the shared resource domain are 

 use   an agent is using the shared resource for one time unit  the use operation

costs   
 wait   an agent is waiting to use the shared resource for one time unit  the
operation costs    i e   waiting for one time unit to access the shared resource
costs   
 nop   an agent does not need the resource and therefore neither uses it nor
waits for it  this operation costs   
the objective here is to find a schedule such that at any time unit no more than m
agents are performing the use operation 
world states and goals  a world state describes the current activity of the agents and their
accumulated resource usage since time    i e   not their accumulated cost   the goal
of an agent is to be in a state where it has accumulated a target number of time units
using the resource  and is currently doing the nop operation  formally  a state is an

   deals  utility  and negotiation mechanisms

now that we have defined the characteristics of a state oriented domain  and looked at a
few simple examples  we turn our attention to how agents in an sod can reach agreement
on a joint plan that brings them to some agreed upon final state  hopefully  this final state
will satisfy both agents  goals  however  this isn t always possible  there are three such
cases 
   it might be the case that there doesn t exist a state that satisfies both agents  goals
 i e   the goals contradict one another  
   it might be the case that there exists a state that satisfies them both  but it cannot
be reached with the primitive operations in the domain  see section       above  
   it might be the case that there exists a reachable state that satisfies them both  but
which is so expensive to get to that the agents are unwilling to expend the required
effort 

    a negotiation mechanism

we will start by presenting a simple mechanism that is suitable for cases where there exists a
reachable final state  that is  reachable by a suciently inexpensive plan  that satisfies both
agents  goals  we call this a cooperative situation  later  we will enhance the mechanism
so that it can handle all possible encounters in state oriented domains  i e   so that it can
handle conict resolution

as we mentioned above  for the moment we will be restricting our attention to encounters
where there does exist one or more states that satisfy both agents  goals  what if more
than one such state exists  which state should the agents choose to reach  and what if
there is more than one joint plan to reach those states  which joint plan should the agents
choose 
for example  let s say that there are two states that satisfy both agents  goals  state  
has two possible roles  with one of the roles costing   and the other costing    state   has
two roles also  with both of them costing    while state   is cheaper overall to reach  state
  seems to allow for a fairer division of labor among the agents 
assuming that the agents want their agreement to be ecient  they will decide to reach
state    but which agent should do the role that costs    and which should do the role that
costs    our approach will be to allow them to agree on a  lottery  that will equalize the
benefit they derive from the joint plan  although eventually one agent will do more than
the other  the expected benefit for the two agents will be identical  prior to holding the
lottery   these plans that include a probabilistic component are called mixed joint plans 
throughout this paper  we limit the bulk of our discussion about mechanisms to twoagent encounters  initial work on the generalization of these techniques to encounters among
more than two agents can be found elsewhere  zlotkin   rosenschein         that research
considers issues of coalition formation in n agent task oriented domains 

definition   deals given an encounter in a two agent sod   s   g   g     
   

fizlotkin   rosenschein

 we define a pure deal to be a joint plan j   j that moves the world from state s to
a state in g    g  
 we define a deal to be a mixed joint plan j   p     p      ir such that j is a pure
deal 

the semantics of a deal is that the agents will perform the joint plan  j   j   with
probability p  or the symmetric joint plan  j    j   with probability     p  where the agents
have switched roles in j    under the symmetric abilities assumption from section     
both agents are able to execute both parts of the joint plan  and the cost of each role is
independent of which agent executes it 

definition  

 if     j   p  is a deal  then cost    is defined to be pc j          p c j    where k

is i s opponent  

i

k

 if  is a deal  then utility    is defined to be c s   g     cost    
i

i

i

the utility  or benefit  for an agent from a deal is simply the difference between the
cost of achieving his goal alone and his expected part of the deal  note that we write  for
example  c s   g   rather than c s   g    since the cost of the plan is independent of the
agent that is executing it 
k

i

definition  

 a deal  is individual rational if  for all i  utility       
 a deal  is pareto optimal if there does not exist another deal that dominates it 
i

there does not exist another deal that is better for one of the agents and not worse
for the other 

 the negotiation set ns is the set of all the deals that are both individual rational and
pareto optimal 

a necessary condition for the negotiation set not to be empty is that there be no contradiction between the two agents  goals  i e   g    g        all the states that exist in the
intersection of the agents  goal sets might  of course  not be reachable given the domain of
actions that the agents have at their disposal  the condition of reachability is not sucient
for ns not to be empty  however  because even when there is no contradiction between
agents  goals  there may still not be a cooperative solution for them  in such a situation 
any joint plan that satisfies the union of goals will cost one agent  or both  more than he
would have spent achieving his own goal in isolation  that is  no deal is individual rational  
as an example in the slotted blocks domain  consider the following encounter  the
initial state can be seen at the left in figure    a  s goal is  the white block is at slot  
but not on the table  and a   s goal is  the black block is at slot   but not on the table  
to achieve his goal alone  each agent has to execute one pickup and then one putdown 
c s   g        the two goals do not contradict one another  because there exists a state
i

   

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

in the world that satisfies them both  where the white and black blocks are each placed
on a gray block   there does not exist a joint plan that moves the world from the initial
state to a state that satisfies the two goals with total cost less than eight   that is  no deal

the existence of a joint plan that moves the world from its initial state s to a mutuallydesired state in g    g  is a necessary  but not sucient  condition for the negotiation set
to be non empty  for the agents to agree on any joint plan  it should be individual rational 
this means that the sum of the roles that the agents play should not exceed the sum of their
individual stand alone costs  otherwise  at least one of the agents would not get positive
utility  i e   do more work than in his stand alone plan   but even this condition is not
sucient to guarantee an individual rational deal  since it can be the case that the minimal
role in the joint plan is still too expensive for the agent with the minimum stand alone cost 
even a probabilistic mixture of the two roles will not reduce the expected cost for that
agent below the cost of the minimal role  and thus that role will not be individual rational
for him  
we now show  however  that the combination of these conditions is necessary and sucient for the negotiation set not to be empty 

theorem   a necessary and sucient condition for the negotiation set not to be empty is
the existence of a joint plan that moves the world from its initial state s to a state in g    g 
and also satisfies the following two conditions  the sum condition and the min condition  

 a joint plan j satisfies the sum condition if

   one agent lifts the white block  while the other agent rearranges the other blocks suitably  by picking
up and putting down each block once   whereupon the white block is put down  this is the best plan
because each block is picked up and put down only once

 let j be a minimal total cost joint plan that moves the world from state s to a state

     it is
sucient to show that there exists a deal that is both individual rational and pareto
optimal  without loss of generality  we can assume that c s   g    c s   g    and
c j     c j     from the min condition  we see that c s   g    c j     there are
two cases 

  if c s   g    c j     then the deal j     is individual rational

j   p is also pareto optimal  because if there is another deal j     q that dominates j   p
then j     q is also individual rational and therefore satisfies the min and sum conditions

since j     q dominates j   p it also implies that

but this contradicts the fact that j is the minimal total cost joint plan that satisfies
the sum and min conditions 
   

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

the sum condition states that the sum of roles does not exceed the sum of the individual
agents  stand alone costs  the min condition states that the minimal role in the joint plan
is less than the minimum stand alone cost 
when the conditions of theorem   are true  we will say that the encounters are cooperative  in such encounters  the agents can use some negotiation mechanism over mixed joint
plans  the question we next examine is what kind of negotiation mechanism they should
use 

    mechanisms that maximize the product of utilities

in general we would like the negotiation mechanism to be symmetrically distributed  and
we would also like for there to be a negotiation strategy  for that mechanism  that is in
equilibrium with itself  a symmetrically distributed mechanism is one in which all agents
play according to the same rules  e g   there are no special agents that have a different responsibility in the negotiation process  when asymmetric negotiation mechanisms are used 
the problem of responsibility assignment needs to be resolved first  e g   who will be the
coordinator agent   we would then need a special mechanism for the responsibility assignment negotiation  if this mechanism is also asymmetric we will need another mechanism 
and so on  therefore  it is better to have a symmetric negotiation mechanism to start with 
among the symmetric mechanisms  we will prefer those that have a symmetric negotiation strategy that is in equilibrium  given a negotiation mechanism m   we will say that
a negotiation strategy s from m is in equilibrium if  under the assumption that all other
agents are using strategy s when using m   i  or my agent  cannot do better by using a
negotiation strategy different than s  
among all symmetrically distributed negotiation mechanisms that have a symmetric
negotiation strategy that is in equilibrium  we will prefer those that maximize the product
of agents  utilities  this means that if agents play the equilibrium strategy  they will
agree on a deal that maximizes the product of their utilities  if there is more than one
product maximizing deal  they will agree on a deal  among those product maximizers  that
maximizes the sum of utilities  if there is more than one such sum maximizing product
maximizer  the protocol will choose among those deals with some arbitrary probability 
this definition implies both individual rationality and pareto optimality of the agreed upon
deals 
note that maximization of the product of the utilities is not a decision that agents are
assumed to be making at run time  it is a property of the negotiation mechanism agreed
upon by the agent designers  i e   we are exploring what happens when the protocol designers
would agree on this property   in more classic game theory terms  see section       the
protocol acts as a kind of  mediator   recommending  maximization of product of the
utilities  in all cases 
we will call this class of mechanisms the product maximizing mechanisms  or pmms  in
previous work on tods  zlotkin   rosenschein            a  we presented the monotonic
concession protocol and the one step protocol  both of which are pmms  as mentioned
above  this paper does not examine the computational issues that arise in discovering deals 
there are a number of existing approaches to the bargaining problem in game theory 
one of the earliest and most popular was nash s axiomatic approach  nash        luce
   

fizlotkin   rosenschein

  raiffa         nash was trying to axiomatically define a  fair  solution to a bargaining
situation  he listed the following criteria as ones that a fair solution would satisfy 
   individual rationality  it would not be fair for a participant to get less than he would
anyway without an agreement  
   pareto optimality  a fair solution will not specify an agreement that could be improved
for one participant without harming the other  
   symmetry  if the situation is symmetric  i e   both agents would get the same utility
without an agreement  and for every possible deal  the symmetric deal is also possible 
then a fair solution should also be symmetric  i e   give both participants the same
utility  
   invariance with respect to linear utility transformations  for example  imagine two
agents negotiating over how to divide       if one agent measures his utility in
dollars while the other measures his in cents  it should not inuence the fair solution 
similarly  if one agent already has     in the bank  and evaluates the deal that gives
him x dollars as having utility      x while the other evaluates such a deal as having
utility x  it should not inuence the fair solution  i e   change of origin doesn t affect
the solution  
   independence of irrelevant alternatives  imagine two agents negotiating about how
to divide        cents  the nash solution will be       cents for each  due to the
symmetry assumption above  now imagine that the same agents are negotiating over
      even though there are now some deals that they can t reach  for example  the
one where one agent gets         and the other gets          the solution should be
the same  because the original solution of       cents can still be found in the new
deal space 
nash showed that the product maximizing solution not only satisfies the above criteria 
but it is the only solution that satisfies them  the first four criteria above are explicitly
or implicitly assumed in our own approach  in fact  for example  our version of the fourth
assumption above is more restrictive than nash s   the fifth criteria above is not assumed
in our work  but turns out to be true in some cases anyway  we use the nash solution 
in general  as a reasonable bargaining outcome  when it is applicable  nash  however 
had some assumptions about the space of deals that we do not have  for example  the
nash bargaining problem assumes a bounded  convex  continuous  and closed region of
negotiation  in our agent negotiations  we do not assume that the space of deals is convex 
nor that it is continuous 

    worth of a goal

when the encounter is cooperative  then agents can use some pmm over mixed joint plans 
such a mechanism guarantees a fair and ecient cooperative agreement  the question now 
however  is what can be done in non cooperative encounters 
consider again the encounter from the restricted usage shared resource domain where
there are three agents  and one resource which has a maximal capacity of two  agents

figure    two joint plans in the restricted usage shared resource domain
and   need two units of the resource while agent   needs   units of the resource  each
agent  were it alone in the world  could achieve its goal at no cost  i e   without waiting
for the resource   however  since the maximal capacity of the resource is two  the three
agents together cannot achieve their combined goal without some agent having to wait 
two possible joint plans that achieve all agents  goals can be seen in figure    the left
joint plan gives agents   and   utility of    while giving agent   utility of     the right joint
plan gives agents   and   utility of    while giving agent   utility of     globally  the plan
on the left finishes sooner  but from the perspective of the individual agents  the two plans
are really comparable in one  agent   suffers by waiting two time units  and in the other 
agent   suffers by exactly the same amount  we have assumed  however  that the agents
are not concerned with the global aspects of resource utilization  and are only concerned
about their own local cost  in addition  both plans are pareto optimal  and neither of them
is individual rational  because one agent gets negative utility  
if there exists a joint plan j that brings the world to a state that satisfies all agents 
goals  but either the min condition or the sum condition is not true  then for the agents
cooperatively to bring the world to a state that satisfies all agents  goals  at least one of
them will have to do more than if he were alone in the world and achieved only his own
goals  will either one of them agree to do extra work  it depends on how important each
goal is to each agent i  i e   how much i is willing to pay to bring the world to a state in g  
for example  in the shared resource encounter above  agent   or   might be willing
to wait two time units so as to get its turn at the resource  although they could have
done better were they alone in the world  they must cope with the presence of those other
agents  with our original definition of utility  no deal that achieves all agents  goals will
be individual rational someone will have to wait  and thus get negative utility  so with
that utility definition  no agent should be willing to wait  the agents will fail to reach
agreement  and no one will achieve his goal  this is because utility was calculated as the
difference between the cost of an agent s plan were it alone in the world and the cost of his
role in the joint plan with other agents 
however  why should the agents use stand alone cost as their baseline for determining
utility  it may be the case that agents will be willing  in the presence of other agents  to
admit the need to pay an extra cost  a sort of  coordination overhead   the fact that with
other agents around they have to do more does not necessarily make it irrational to do more 
i

   

fizlotkin   rosenschein

in task oriented domains  zlotkin   rosenschein            a         it is reasonable to
use stand alone cost as the utility baseline since there was never any coordination overhead 
in the worst case  an agent could always achieve his goal at the stand alone price  and
coordination could only improve the situation  in state oriented domains  however  it
makes sense to consider altering the utility baseline  so that agents can rationally coordinate
even when there exists a coordination overhead  one way of doing this is to assume that
each agent has some upper bound on the cost that he is willing to bear to achieve his goal 
then  the agent s utility can be measured relative to this upper bound  we call this upper
bound the worth of the agent s goal 
even in tods  one can conceive of stand alone cost as the worth that an agent assigns
to achieving a goal  the stand alone cost is then the maximum that an agent is willing to
expend  in a tod  this maximum need never be violated  so it s a reasonable worth value
to use 
when such an upper bound does not exist  i e   an agent is willing to achieve his goal
at any cost  other techniques can be used  see section   below  

definition   given an encounter in a two agent sod   s   g   g      let w be the maxi

imum expected cost that agent i is willing to pay in order to achieve his goal g   w
will be called the worth of goal g to agent i  we will denote this enhanced encounter by
  s   g   g     w   w      
i

i

i

the definition of utility can be usefully altered as follows 

definition   given an encounter   s   g   g     w   w      if  is a deal  i e   a mixed
joint plan satisfying both agents  goals  then utility     is defined to be w   cost     
i

i

i

the utility for an agent of a deal is the difference between the worth of its goal that is
being achieved  and the cost of his role in the agreed upon joint plan  if an agent achieves
his goal alone  his utility is the difference between the worth of the goal and the cost that
he pays to achieve the goal  the point is  that an agent might be better off alone but still
derive positive utility from a joint plan  when we use worth as the utility baseline  with
the new definition of utility  it may be rational to compromise 

theorem   if in theorem   we change every occurrence of c s   g   to w   then that
i

theorem is still true 

i

proof  substitute w for every occurrence of c s   g   in the proof of theorem   
i

i

by introducing the worth concept into the definition of an encounter  we have enlarged
the number of encounters that have a non empty negotiation set  cooperative behavior is
enhanced  our negotiation mechanism  that makes use of any product maximizing protocol 
becomes applicable to more sod encounters 

    interaction types

from the discussion above  we have begun to see emerging different kinds of encounters
between agents  in tod meetings  agents really benefit from coordination  in sods  this
   

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

isn t necessarily the case  sometimes agents benefit  but sometimes they are called upon to
bear a coordination overhead so that everyone can achieve their goals  in even more extreme
situations  agents  goals may simply be in conict  and it might just be impossible to satisfy
all of them at the same time  or the coordination overhead may exceed the willingness of
agents to bear the required burden 
we have four possible interactions  from the point of view of an individual agent 

 a symmetric cooperative situation is one in which there exists a deal in the negotiation

set that is preferred by both agents over achieving their goals alone  here  both agents
welcome the existence of the other agent 
 a symmetric compromise situation is one where there are individual rational deals
for both agents  however  both agents would prefer to be alone in the world  and to
accomplish their goals alone  since each agent is forced to cope with the presence of
the other  he would prefer to agree on a reasonable deal  all of the deals in ns are

 a non symmetric cooperative compromise situation is one in which one agent views
the interaction as cooperative  he welcomes the existence of the other agent   while
the second views the interaction as compromise  he would prefer to be alone in the
world  
 a conict situation is one in which the negotiation set is empty no individual rational

let s consider some simple examples in the slotted blocks world domain of cooperative 
compromise  and conict situations  in the initial situation depicted in figure     the white
block is in slot   and the black block is in slot    agent a  wants the white block alone in
slot    while agent a  wants the black block alone in slot    were either of the agents alone
in the world  it would cost each of them   pickup putdown operations to achieve their goal 
for example  a  would have to pick up the black block in slot   and move it to slot    then
pick up the white block in slot   and move it to slot    the two agents together  however 
are able to achieve both goals with a total cost of    they can execute a joint plan where
they simultaneously pick up both blocks  and then put them in their appropriate places

figure     cooperative situation
now let s consider a more complicated  compromise  situation  in the initial state shown
in figure     there is a white block in slot    a black block in slot    and two gray blocks
in slot    agent a   s goal is to have the white block somewhere at slot    but not on the
table  similarly  agent a   s goal is to have the black block somewhere at slot    but not on
the table  alone in the world  agent a  would only have to do one pickup and one putdown
operation  just moving the white block onto the black block in slot    in the same way 
agent a  alone in the world can achieve his goal with two operations  but since each is
 in his stand alone plan  using the other s block as a base  the achievement of a state that
satisfies both agents  goals requires additional blocks and operations 
the best plan for achieving both agents  goals requires moving one gray block from slot
  to slot   and the other gray block to slot   so that they act as bases for the white and
black blocks  each block needs to be picked up and put down at least once  the best plan

has each block moving only once at a total cost of    obviously  one or both agents will need
to do extra work  greater than in the stand alone situation  to bring about this mutually
satisfying state

figure     compromise situation
the best plan has two roles  one requiring   operations and one requiring   operations 
one agent will lift the black  or white  block  while the other agent rearranges all the
other blocks appropriately  the first agent will then put down the black  or white  block 
completing the plan  if both agents  worths satisfy the min and sum conditions  meaning 
here  that the sum of the worths is greater than or equal to    and each worth is greater
than or equal to     then they can reach an agreement that gives them both positive utility
 using worth as the new baseline for evaluating utility  
for example  let s say that agent a  assigned a worth of   to achieving his goal  while
agent a  assigned a worth of   to achieving his goal  since one role in the best joint plan
costs   while the other costs    there is one unit of utility to be shared between the agents 
any mechanism that maximizes the product of their utilities will split this one unit equally
between the agents  how is this done in our case  there is one deal in the negotiation set
that gives both agents the same expected utility of      namely the mixed joint plan that
has agent a  doing the cost   role with probability      and the cost   role with probability
 
a  of course assumes the complementary role  agent a   s expected utility is
    agent
 
                            which is equal to agent a   s expected utility of                             
this division of utility maximizes the product of expected utility among the agents 
there is an interesting phenomenon to note in this deal  both agents are apparently
in a symmetric situation  apart from their internal attitude towards achieving their goals
 i e   how much they are willing to pay   but as can be seen above  the more you are
willing to pay  the more you will have to pay  the agent that has a worth of   ends up
having less expected work than the agent with a worth of    this gives agents an incentive
to misrepresent their true worth values  pretending that the worth values are smaller than
they really are  so that the agents  positions within the negotiation will be strengthened  an
agent can feign indifference  claim that it really doesn t care all that much about achieving

this question in greater detail below in section   
our final example here is of a conict situation  shown in figure     again  the white
block is in slot   and the black block is in slot   the same initial state that we had above in
the cooperative and compromise examples  in the cooperative example  the agents wanted
the blocks moved to another  empty slot  in the compromise example  the agents wanted to
blocks moved to a specific non empty slot  here  in the conict example  the agents want
the blocks moved onto a specific other block in a specific slot  agent a  wants the white
block on top of the black block in slot    agent a  wants the black block on top of the white
block in slot    here  there is a real contradiction between the two agents  goals  there
exists no world state that satisfies them both  in the next section  we will discuss what
kinds of coordination mechanisms can be used in a conict situation

   conict resolution and cooperation

we have seen that in both cooperative and compromise encounters there exist deals that are
individual rational for both agents  agents will negotiate over which of these deals should
be reached  if there is more than one  what  however  can be done when the agents are in
   

fizlotkin   rosenschein

a conict situation  i e   there are no individual rational deals  here  the agents have a true
conict that needs to be resolved  and are not merely choosing among mutually acceptable
outcomes 

    conict resolution

a simple approach to conict resolution would be for the agents to ip a coin to decide who
is going to achieve his goal and who is going to be disappointed  see figure     in this
case they will negotiate on the probabilities  weightings  of the coin toss  if they run into
a conict during the negotiation  fail to agree on the coin toss weighting   the world will
stay in its initial state s

figure     conict resolution
this deal can be visualized graphically in figure     single lines represent one agent
plans 
in conict situations the agents can use some utility product maximizing protocol to
decide on the weighting of the coin  however  it turns out that in that case the probability
of    always results in the maximum product of the two agents  utilities  if the agents are
to maximize their utility product  they will always agree on a symmetric coin  the only
exception is when the initial state already satisfies one agent s goal  then  that agent will
simply cause the negotiation to fail  rather than risk moving away from his goal satisfying
state  nevertheless  even here  the product maximizing deal would have the agents ip a
symmetric coin 
why is a symmetric coin going to maximize the product of agent utilities  some simple
mathematics shows the reason  assume that agent a  has a worth of w   and the cost of
achieving his goal alone is c    when a  wins the coin toss  he will have a utility of w    c  
his utility from a deal with coin weighting p will be p w    c    his opponent s utility
   there is a special case where the initial state s already satisfies one of the agent s goals  let s say agent
   s cannot satisfy both goals since then we would not have a conict situation   in this case  the only
agreement that can be reached is to leave the world in state s  agent   will not agree to any other deal
and will cause the negotiation to fail

figure     the conict situation
from this deal will be      p  w    c    the product of the two agents  utilities will be
 p   p    w    c   w    c    this function of p is maximized when p equals    for any values
of w   w   c   and c   simply take the derivative of the function and set it equal to zero  
this may seem like a  fair  solution  but it is certainly not an ecient one  while
maximizing the product of the agents  utilities  it does not maximize their sum  the sum
of utilities will be maximized by simply having the agent with a larger w   c achieve his
goal  this  on the other hand  is certainly not a fair solution 
we might be able to be both fair and ecient if agents are able to transfer utility to one
another  in that case  one agent could achieve its goal but share part of that utility with
the other agent  the negotiation would then center on how much of the utility should be
transferred  any product maximizing mechanism used to resolve this question will transfer
half of the gained utility to the other agent  because it is a constant sum game  and dividing
the utility equally maximizes the utility product 
the entire subject of explicit utility transfer through side payments is a complicated one
that has been treated at length in the game theory community  it is not our intention to
examine these questions in this paper  even if utility is not explicitly transferable  agents
can make commitments to perform future actions  and in effect transfer utility through
these promises  again  there are many complicated issues involved in assessing the value
of promises  when they should be believed  discount factors  and limits on the amount of
promising and debts that an agent can accrue  if agents can accumulate debt indefinitely 
it will be possible for them to always pay off previous commitments by making additional
commitments to others  here  too  we are leaving these issues aside  returning to our
assumptions that each interaction stands on its own  and no explicit side payments are
possible

    cooperation in conict resolution
in both cooperative and compromise situations  agents were implicitly able to transfer utility
in a single encounter by doing more actions in the joint plan  the agent that does more
work in the joint plan relieves the other agent  increasing the latter s utility  this can be
thought of as a kind of utility transfer  here  we will see a similar kind of implicit utility
transfer that is possible even in conict situations 
   

fizlotkin   rosenschein

the agents may find that  instead of simply ipping a coin in a conict situation  it
is better for them to cooperatively reach a new world state  not satisfying either of their
goals  and then to ip the coin to decide whose goal will ultimately be satisfied 
consider the following example  one agent wants the block currently in slot   to be in
slot    the other agent wants it to be in slot    in addition  both agents share the goal of
swapping the two blocks currently in slot    i e   reverse the stack s order   see figure    
assume that w    w        the cost for an agent of achieving his goal alone is     if the
agents decide to ip a coin in the initial state  they will agree on a weighting of      which
brings them a utility of    i e                  if  on the other hand  they decide to do the swap
cooperatively  at cost of   each   and then ip a coin  they will still agree on a weighting
of      which brings them an overall utility of    i e

figure     cooperation up to a certain point
the fact that agents  even in a conict situation  can get more utility by first cooperatively working together  and only then ipping a coin  can be exploited by defining a new
kind of deal  called a semi cooperative deal  we want agents to be able to negotiate over
and agree on a deal that allows them this mixed cooperative conict resolution interaction 
changing the deal type is enough to make this possible  it ends up increasing the expected
utility that agents can derive from an encounter 

definition    a semi cooperative deal is a tuple  t  j  q  where t is a world state  j is a

mixed joint plan that moves the world from the initial state s to intermediate state t  and
   q      ir is the weighting of the coin toss the probability that agent a  will achieve
his goal 

the semantics of this kind of deal is that the two agents will perform the mixed joint
plan j   and will bring the world to intermediate state t  then  in state t  they will ip a
coin with weighting q to decide who continues the plan towards their own goal  this allows
the agents to handle conict between their goals  while still cooperating up to a certain
point 
   

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

the utility of a semi cooperative deal for an agent can be defined as follows  if he loses
the coin toss in intermediate state t  he simply has a negative expected utility equal to the
expected cost of his role in the joint plan that reached state t  if he wins the coin toss in
intermediate state t  then his expected utility is the difference between the worth of his goal
and the costs of his role in the joint plan that reached t as well as the stand alone cost of
moving from t to his goal state  this can be written formally as follows 

definition   
utility  t  j  q     q  w   c j     c t   g            q  c j  
  q  w   c t   g       c j

    semi cooperative deals in non conict situations

in cooperative and compromise situations  the agents negotiate on deals that are mixed
joint plans  j   p  cooperative deals   in a conict situation  the agents negotiate on deals
of the form  t  j  q    semi cooperative deals  
even though semi cooperative deals were intended to be used in conict situations  they
can also be used in cooperative and compromise situations  with a minor generalization in
the definition of utility  discussed below   the question is  what kinds of agreements will
agents in a non conict situation reach  if they are negotiating over semi cooperative deals 
will they do better than using standard cooperative  mixed joint plan  deals  or will they
do worse 
a cooperative deal which is a mixed joint plan j   p can also be represented as  j  s   j   p    
where j  s  is the final world state resulting from the joint plan j when the initial state is s 
in other words  mixed deals are a proper subset of semi cooperative deals  and any mixed
   

fizlotkin   rosenschein

deal can be represented as a semi cooperative deal of a special form  the intermediate state
t is taken to be the final state of the agents  cooperative joint plan  since that final state
satisfies both agents  goals  the result of the coin ip is irrelevant neither of the agents
wants to change the world state anyway 
therefore  by having agents in a non conict situation negotiate over semi cooperative
deals  we are only enlarging their space of agreements  any deal that can be reached when
negotiating over the subset  i e   mixed joint plans  can also be reached when negotiating
over the larger set  i e   semi cooperative plans   so the agents in a non conict situation
will certainly do no worse  when using semi cooperative deals  but will they do better 
there are two potential ways in which agents could do better  the first would be if
agents find a cheaper way to achieve both goals  it turns out that this is impossible 
semi cooperative deals will not uncover a more ecient way of achieving both agents  goals 
however  there is a more surprising way in which agents can benefit from semi cooperative
deals  agents can benefit by not always achieving their goals  when using semi cooperative
deals  they can give up guaranteed goal satisfaction  and gain expected utility 
to see what we mean  consider the following example in the slotted blocks world  the
initial situation in figure    consists of   duplications of the example from figure    in slots
  to     in addition  two slots     and     each contain a stack of   blocks  agent a   s goal
is  white blocks are in slots             and    but not on the table  the blocks in slots   
are swapped  and the blocks in slot    are swapped  i e   each tower is reversed    agent
a  s goal is  black blocks are in slots             and    but not on the table  the blocks in
slot    are swapped  and the blocks in slot    are swapped

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

 five duplications of the joint plan from example    each of those joint plans has a
role that costs   and a role that costs   

thus the average cost of each agent s role in the joint plan is     namely         
                 since the stand alone cost is     this situation is cooperative each agent
welcomes the existence of the other  for both agents  the expected utility of the joint plan
is    i e             this cooperative deal achieves both agents  goals 
can we find a semi cooperative deal that is better  what if the agents only cooperated
on swapping the blocks in slots    and     and then tossed a coin to see who gets to fulfill his
own goal  leaving the other s goal unsatisfied   this semi cooperative deal actually turns
out to be better for both agents 
let the intermediate state t be the state where the blocks in slots    and    are swapped 
and the other slots are unchanged  each agent invests   operations as his part of the two
swaps  he then has a chance of    of continuing on his own to achieve his goal  and a chance
of    of losing the coin toss and having wasted his initial investment  if he wins the coin toss 
he will have an additional    operations         but achieve his goal of worth     overall
utility will be              i e       if he loses the coin toss  he has just wasted his initial
investment of    so his utility is     the expected utility is the average of these two cases 
i e      this is better than the utility of   the agents got using the cooperative deal 
in other words  in this case  the agents would prefer not to guarantee themselves their
goal  and take a gamble with a semi cooperative deal  their expected utility doubles  if
they are willing to take a risk  so even in this cooperative situation  the agents benefit from
negotiating over semi cooperative deals 
now  it turns out that this is a borderline situation  brought about because w is low  as
long as w is high enough  any semi cooperative deal that agents agree on in a cooperative
situation will be equivalent to a cooperative deal  if achieving your goal isn t worth too much
to you  your profit margin is small   you might be willing to forgo guaranteed achievement
in exchange for a higher expected utility 
so semi cooperative deals  used in a non conict situation  will sometimes result in better
agreements  when forgoing guaranteed goal achievement is beneficial   and will never result
in worse agreements  clearly  it is worthwhile for agents to negotiate over semi cooperative
deals  regardless of whether they are in cooperative  compromise  or conict situations

    unified negotiation protocols  unp 

in this section  we will make the necessary generalizations so that agents can use semicooperative deals in all types of encounters  we will call all product maximizing mechanisms
based on semi cooperative deals  unified negotiation protocols  unp    since they can be
used for conict resolution  as well as for cooperative agreements  
as mentioned above  we will need to generalize the previous definition of the utility
of a semi cooperative deal  to enable unps  before  we assumed  since we had a conict
situation  that the final state would be of no benefit to the agent that lost the coin toss 
   an earlier version of this subsection and the next two appeared in  zlotkin   rosenschein      a   the
current treatment incorporates new material on multi plan deals  recasts the protocols in the context of
domain theory  and alters the notation to correspond to the more general domain framework 

   

fizlotkin   rosenschein

now  even though a semi cooperative deal is being used  the final state might still satisfy
both agents  goals  and not just the goal of the agent that wins the coin toss 
if  t  j  q   is a semi cooperative deal  then we ll define f to be the final state of the world
when agent i wins the coin toss in state t  f    t   g   t    g   the worth for agent i of
any state r  which we will write as w  r   will be his goal worth w if r is a goal state  and
  otherwise  now  we can revise our definition of utility for semi cooperative deals

the utility of a semi cooperative deal  t  j  q   for an agent is now defined to be the
expected worth of the final state minus the expected cost  the worth of the expected final
state  of course  depends on the weighting of the coin  and whether both possible final
states  or only one  are goal states for the agent  similarly  the expected cost depends on
the weighting of the coin  whether the agent only participates in the first  joint  plan  or
also continues with the second  lone  plan  
the definition of utility given above is completely consistent with the earlier definition
of the utility of cooperative deals  and can be viewed as a generalization of that earlier
definition  in other words  if a cooperative deal  a mixed joint plan  is mapped into a
semi cooperative deal  t  j  q   using the transformation discussed above  then the definition
of utility for a mixed joint plan  definition    and this definition of utility  definition    
for a semi cooperative deal yield the same number 
a sucient condition for the negotiation set to be non empty over semi cooperative
deals is that agents  worths be high enough  so that each agent would be able to achieve its
own goal alone 

theorem   if for each agent i the worth of its goal is greater than or equal to his standalone cost  i e    i w  c s   g     then the negotiation set over semi cooperative deals is
not empty 
i

proof  to show that ns       it is sucient to show that there is an individual rational

semi cooperative deal  the existence of pareto optimal deals among the individual rational
deals is due to the compactness of the deal space  since there is only a finite number of
agent operations  and the worth of agent goals is bounded    s    q    where  is the empty
joint deal  is individual rational for any q 
the above condition is sucient  but is not necessary  for the negotiation set to be nonempty  for example  consider again the situation given in figure     but with the agents 
worths being equal to    instead of      neither agent can achieve its goal alone  and thus
the conditions of the theorem above are not satisfied  however  there is a perfectly good
semi cooperative deal that gives both agents positive utility they perform a joint plan that
swaps the blocks in slot    then ip a coin to see whether the block in slot   goes to slot  
or    this mixed deal gives each agent an expected utility of    so the negotiation set is
not empty 
it turns out that if there is a semi cooperative deal in the negotiation set  and one of
the agents  winning the coin toss  will bring the world into a state that satisfies both agents 
goals  then there exists another deal in the negotiation set with the same utility for both
agents in which the intermediate state already satisfies both agents  goals

theorem   for a semi cooperative deal  t  j  q    ns  if there exists an i such that f

proof  there are two cases  both final states  or only one final state  is in g    g

at state t and let agent   achieve the goal for him without his spending any more 
the deal  t  j     is better for   and can only be better for   as well  so it dominates
 t  j  q    but  t  j  q     ns  so they are equivalent   t  j     is equivalent to the mixed
joint plan p in which the agents perform the joint plan j until t  and then agent  
performs the one agent plan t   g    g   p is a cooperative deal 

in other words  if there exists a semi cooperative deal in the negotiation set that sometimes satisfies both agents  goals  depending on who wins the coin toss   then there also
exists another semi cooperative deal in the negotiation set that always satisfies both agents 
goals  equivalent to a cooperative deal   even though semi cooperative deals constitute a
superset of cooperative deals  no extra utility is derived from using semi cooperative deals
if the agreement preserves mutual satisfaction of both agents  i e   if it s equivalent to a
cooperative deal  
in a cooperative situation  agents cannot extract more utility from a semi cooperative
deal  unless they are willing to agree on a deal that will never satisfy both agents  goals 
the example above  section      is the prototype of that situation  agents increase their
utility by using a semi cooperative deal in a cooperative situation  they do this by forgoing
guaranteed mutual satisfaction  the above theorem implies that this is the only way they
can increase their utility with semi cooperative deals 

    multi plan deals

in semi cooperative deals  we assume that the agents cooperate  ip a coin  then the winner
proceeds alone to achieve his goal  this arrangement only requires that the agents engage
   

fizlotkin   rosenschein

in  pre ip cooperation   what if the agents were willing  or required  to also engage in
 post ip cooperation   then  an entirely new dimension of agreements would be opened
up  in this section  we consider a kind of deal that exploits cooperation after the coin toss 
to illustrate the potential of this new kind of deal  consider the following encounter 
shown in figure

figure     post flip cooperation can be helpful
the initial state s of the world can be seen in figure     a   s goal is to swap the position
of the blocks in slot    but to leave the blocks in slot   in their initial position  a   s goal is
to swap the position of the blocks in slot    but to leave the blocks in slot   in their initial
position 
to achieve his goal alone  each agent needs to do at least   pickup or putdown operations 
apparently  there is very little room for cooperation  not only is there no final state that
satisfies both agents  goals  there is no intermediate state  other than the initial state  to
which the agents can cooperatively bring the world  before tossing a coin  as in a semicooperative deal  
negotiating over semi cooperative deals  agents will agree to ip a coin in the initial
state  and whoever wins the coin toss will by himself bring the world into his goal state
 at a cost of     assume that the worth of each agent s goal is     then negotiating over
semi cooperative deals brings each agent an expected utility of    this is a compromise
situation  alone in the world  each agent would have utility of    
what if the agents could reach the following agreement  as shown in figure      they
ip a coin in the initial state  whoever wins the toss gets his goal satisfied  however  no
matter who wins  the agents commit themselves to work together in a joint plan to achieve
the chosen goal 
doing either swap jointly costs a total of   for the two agents    each   the agent that
wins the coin toss gets a utility of         his goal is satisfied and he expends   in the
joint plan   the agent that loses gets a utility of     he just expends   in the joint plan
that achieves his opponent s goal   if each agent has an equal chance of winning the coin
toss  his expected utility will be    this is better than the semi cooperative deal that gave

multi plan deal
 

 

 

 

 

figure     multi plan deal
the agents each a utility of    it s even better than the stand alone utility of   that the
agents could get if they were alone  suddenly  the situation has become cooperative  the
agents welcome each other s existence  even though their goals have nothing in common 
there is no goal state that satisfies both agents  there are no subgoals that the agents have
in common  there are no positive interactions between the agents  stand alone plans  the
goals are completely decoupled  and yet the situation is cooperative 
the agreement above  of course  requires  post ip cooperation   with semi cooperative
deals  the  pre ip cooperation  contributed potentially to either agents  benefit either
agent might win the coin toss and exploit the early work  but with this new deal type  even
the agent who loses the coin toss will be required to expend effort  knowing that it is just
for the benefit of the other agent 
if agents will commit themselves to post ip cooperation  then this new deal type is
possible  agents could then negotiate over deals that are pairs of mixed joint plans  we
will call these new deals multi plan deals  by committing to post ip cooperation  agents
enlarge the space of agreements  and this potentially improves their expected utility 

definition   

 a multi plan deal is        q   where each  is a mixed joint plan that moves the
world to a state that satisfies i s goal     q      ir is the probability that the agents
will perform    they will perform   with probability     q

so a multi plan deal has agents agreeing on two joint plans  and deciding which to execute by tossing a coin  this deal can be visualized informally in figure     as in section    
above  a triple line represents a joint plan  carried out by multiple agents 
note that here the symmetric abilities assumption from section     may not be essential

utility accurately  since the agents have the additional q probability that they can adjust 
just as semi cooperative deals can be used in cooperative situations  multi plan deals can
also be used in cooperative situations  since  as we will see below  they are a generalization
of semi cooperative deals   all that is needed is to enhance the definition of multi plan deal
utility appropriately  as was done for semi cooperative deals  definition     
consider the following example  which shows the increased utility available for the agents
to share when they negotiate over multi plan deals instead of over mixed joint plans

the negotiation set includes the deals  s   f         and    s   f        using the protocol
mentioned above  the agents will break the symmetry of this situation by ipping a coin 
the utility of each agent from this deal is                 
negotiation over the multi plan deal type will cause the agents to agree on

for each agent  the utility for each agent from this deal is                               by
negotiating using the multi plan deal type instead of mixed joint plans  there is more utility

    the hierarchy of deal types   summary

there exists an ordering relationship among the various kinds of deals between agents that
we have considered  we call this relationship the  deal hierarchy   at the bottom of the
hierarchy are pure deals and mixed deals  these first two types of deals in the hierarchy can
be used only in cooperative situations  for negotiation in general non cooperative domains 
additional types of deals were needed 
next in the hierarchy come semi cooperative deals  as we have shown  semi cooperative
deals are a superset of mixed deals  even in cooperative situations  there may be some
semi cooperative deals that do not achieve all goals  but which dominate all other mixed
joint plans that do achieve both agents  goals 
finally  at the top of the hierarchy  come multi plan deals  which are a superset of semicooperative deals  this is the most general deal type in our deal hierarchy  this deal type
can also serve as the foundation for a class of unified negotiation protocols 
in summary  our hierarchy looks as follows 

fj g  fj   pg  ft    qg  f        qg
pure deals  mixed deals  semi cooperative deals  multi plan deals

   unbounded worth of a goal tidy agents

in section      we assumed that each agent assigns a finite worth to achieving his goal 
which is the upper bound on cost that he is willing to spend to achieve the goal  what if
such an upper bound does not exist  there may be situations and domains in which there is
no limit to the cost that an agent is willing to pay in order to achieve his goal he would be
willing to pay any cost  similarly  there may be situations when an agent is simply unable 
by design  to evaluate the worth of its goal  however  even though the worth is unbounded
or unevaluable  the agent is still interested in expending the minimum necessary to achieve
its goal  the agent gets more utility when it spends less  and can determine an ordinal
ranking over all possible deals  even though it has diculty assigning cardinal values to the
utility derived from those deals 
nevertheless  we really are interested in having cardinal values that can be used in our
negotiation mechanisms  our whole approach to negotiation is founded on the existence of
these inter agent comparable cardinal utility functions  when worth is unbounded for both
agents  we seem to be deprived of the tool on which we have depended 
   

fizlotkin   rosenschein

we would like to identify a different baseline by which to define the concept of utility 
originally  above  we used the baseline of  stand alone cost   c s   g    taking the utility
of a deal for an agent to be the difference between the cost of achieving the goal alone and
the agent s part of the deal  then  we used the baseline of  worth  in a similar manner 
linearly transforming the utility calculation  utility of a deal for an agent was then the
difference between the maximum cost he was willing to pay and the agent s part of the
deal  when worth is unbounded  however  that linear transformation obviously cannot be
used 
in other work  zlotkin   rosenschein      b   we present an alternative baseline that
can satisfy our desire for symmetry  fairness  simplicity  stability  and eciency  it turns
out to constitute the minimum sucient baseline for agents to reach agreements 
the minimum cost that an agent must offer to bear in a compromise encounter  where
neither agent has an upper bound on its worth  is that which leaves the other agent with
less cost than the latter s stand alone cost  in other words  the first agent will offer to
 clean up after himself   to carry out a sucient portion of the joint plan that achieves
both goals such that the other agent s remaining part of the joint plan will cost him less
than his stand alone cost  we call an agent who is willing to clean up after himself a tidy
agent  the formal definition appears elsewhere  zlotkin   rosenschein      b   it is shown
that in any joint goal reachable encounter  i e   there exists a joint plan that achieves both
agents  goals   if both agents are tidy  the negotiation set is not empty 
i

   negotiation with incomplete information
all the mechanisms considered in the sections above can be straightforwardly implemented
only if both agents have full information about each other s goals and worths  in many
situations  this won t be the case  and in this section we will examine what happens to our
negotiating mechanisms in state oriented domains when agents don t necessarily have full
information about each other 
we consider incomplete information about goals  and incomplete information about
worths  as two separate issues  an agent  for example  might have particular information
about worth  but not about goals  or vice versa  there are thus four possible cases  where
worths are known or not known  combined with goals that are known or not known  in
previous sections  we considered the case where both goals and worth were known  in this
section we consider two of the other three situations  where neither goals nor worth are
known  and where goals are known and worth is not  we do not analyze situations where
worth is known but the goals are not 
the general conclusion is that a strategic player can gain benefit by pretending that its
worth is lower than it actually is  this can be done directly  by declaring low worth  in
certain mechanisms   or by declaring a cheaper goal  in the case where stand alone cost is
taken to be the implicit worth baseline  
in this first section  we consider the space of lies that are available in different types of
interactions  and with different types of mechanisms 
there are several frameworks for dealing with incomplete information  such as incremental goal recognition techniques  allen  kautz  pelavin    tenenberg         but the
framework we explore here is that of a     negotiation phase  in which agents simultane   

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

ously declare private information before beginning the negotiation  this was also introduced
elsewhere  zlotkin   rosenschein            a  for the case of tods   the negotiation then
proceeds as if the revealed information were true  in the tod case  we have analyzed the
strategy that an agent should adopt for playing the extended negotiation game  and in
particular  whether the agent can benefit by declaring something other than his true goal 
here  we will take a similar approach  and consider the    phase game in state oriented
domains  will agents benefit by lying about their private information  what kinds of
mechanisms can be devised that will give agents a compelling incentive to only tell the
truth  
a negotiation mechanism that gives agents a compelling incentive to only tell the truth
is called  in game theory  incentive compatible  although we are able to construct an
incentive compatible mechanism to be used when worths are unknown  we are unable to
construct such a mechanism in state oriented domains to be used when the other s goals
are unknown 

    worth of a goal and its role in lies
we again assume that agents associate a worth with the achievement of a particular goal 
sometimes  this worth is exactly equal to what it would cost the agent to achieve that goal
by himself  at other times  the worth of a goal to an agent exceeds the cost of the goal to
that agent  the worth of a goal is the baseline for calculating the utility of a deal for an
agent  in this section  we will always assume that worth is bounded 
the worth of a goal is intimately connected with what specific deals agents will agree on 
first  an agent will not agree on a deal that costs him more than his worth  he would have
negative utility from such a deal   second  since agents will agree on a deal that maximizes
the product of their utilities  if an agent has a lower worth  it will ultimately reduce the
amount of work in his part of the deal  thus  one might expect that if agent a  wants to
do less work  he will try to fool agent a  into thinking that  for any particular goal  a  s
worth is lower than it really is  this strategy  in fact  often turns out to be beneficial  as
seen below 
let s consider the following example from the slotted blocks world 
the initial state can be seen at the left in figure     g  is  the black block is on a
gray block which is on the table at slot    and g  is  the white block is on a gray block
which is on the table at slot    
to achieve his goal alone  each agent has to execute four pickup and four putdown
operations that cost  in total     the two goals do not contradict each other  because there
exists a state in the world that satisfies them both  there also exists a joint plan that moves
the world from the initial state to a state that satisfies both goals with total cost of   one
agent lifts the black block  while the other agent rearranges the other blocks suitably  by
picking up and putting down each block once   whereupon the black block is put down  the
agents will agree to split this joint plan with probability      leaving each with an expected
utility of   
   some of these issues  in everyday human contexts  are explored in  bok         our immediate motivation
for discouraging lies among agents is so that our negotiation mechanisms will be ecient

    beneficial lies with mixed deals

what if agent a  lies about his true goal above  claiming that he wants a black block on
any other block at slot    see figure     if agent a  were alone in the world  he could
apparently satisfy this relaxed goal at cost    assuming that agent a  reveals his true goal 
the agents can only agree on one plan  agent a  will lift a block  either the white or black
one   while agent a  does all the rest of the work  the apparent utility for agent a  is then
   still individual rational   while agent a  has a utility of    in reality  agent a  has an
actual utility of    agent a   s lie has benefited him 

   
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure     agent a  relaxes his goal
this works because agent a  is able to reduce the apparent cost of his carrying out his
goal alone  which ultimately causes him to carry less of a burden in the final plan   while
not compromising the ultimate achievement of his real goal  the reason his real goal is
   

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

 accidentally  satisfied is because there is only one state that satisfies agent a   s real goal
and agent a  s apparent goal  coincidentally the same state that satisfies both of their real
goals 
the lie above is not agent a   s only beneficial lie in this example  what if agent a 
claimed that his goal is  slot   is empty and the black block is clear   see figure    
interestingly  this goal is quite different from his real goal  if agent a  were alone in the
world  he could apparently satisfy this variant goal at cost    the agents will then be forced
again to agree on the deal above  a  does two operations  with apparent utility of    and
agent a  does six operations  with utility of    again  agent a  s actual utility is   


 

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure     agent a  makes up an entirely new goal
in task oriented domains  zlotkin   rosenschein            a   we also saw something
similar to this lying about a goal  there  for example  an agent could hide a task  and lower
the apparent cost of its stand alone plan  similarly  in the first lie above the agent in the
blocks world relaxed his true goal  and lowered the apparent cost of his stand alone plan
 and thus of his worth   the set of states that will satisfy his relaxed goal is then a superset
of the set of states satisfying his true goal 
however  there is a major difference between lying in sods and lying in tods  in the
latter  there can never be any  accidental  achievement of hidden goals  the lying agent
will always find it necessary to carry out the hidden goal by himself  and this is the main
reason why in subadditive tods hiding goals is not beneficial  in sods  a hidden goal
might be achieved by one s opponent  who carries out actions that have side effects  thus 
even when you hide your goal  you may fortuitously find your goal satisfied in front of your
eyes 
this situation can be visualized informally in figure     as other sod interactions were
in section     above  in the figure  agent a   s expanded apparent goal states are represented
by the thicker oval and labeled g    note that the expansion of the goal states is toward
the initial state s  this is the meaning of lowering one s apparent cost  and is necessary for
a beneficial lie

altered apparent goal states are again represented by the thick outline and labeled g

the agent then needs to make sure that the intersection of his apparent goal states and
his true goal states is not empty  although this is a necessary precondition for a successful
lie  it is of course not a sucient precondition for a successful lie  both of the lies in the
above example will be useful to agent a  regardless of the negotiation protocol that is being
used  pure deal  mixed deal  semi cooperative deal  or multi plan deal 

    beneficial lies with semi cooperative deals

it might seem that when agents are in a conict situation  the potential for beneficial lies
is reduced  in fact  beneficial lying can exist in conict situations 
 conict  between agents  goals means that there does not exist a mixed joint plan
that achieves both goals and is also individual rational  this is either because such a state
does not exist  or because the joint plan is too costly to be individual rational  even when
conict exists between goals  there might be common subgoals  and therefore a beneficial
lie may exist 
   

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

taking advantage of a common subgoal in a conict situation  let the initial

state of the world be as in figure     one agent wants the block currently in slot   to be
in slot    the other agent wants it to be in slot    in addition  both agents share the goal of
swapping the two blocks currently in slot    i e   reverse the stack s order  
the cost for an agent of achieving his goal alone is     negotiating over the true goals
using semi cooperative deals would lead the agents to agree to do the swap cooperatively
 at cost of   each   and then ip a coin  with a weighting of      to decide whose goal
will be individually satisfied  this deal brings them an overall expected utility of    i e  
 
                

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure     taking advantage of a common subgoal
what if agent a  lies and tells agent a  that his goal is   the black block is clear at
slot   and the white block is on the gray block   agent a  thus hides the fact that his
real goal has the stack of blocks at slot    and claims that he does not really care if the
stack is at slot      or    the cost for agent a  of achieving his apparent goal is    because
now he can supposedly build the reversed stack at slot   with a cost of    assuming that
agent a  reveals his true goal  the agents will still agree to do the swap cooperatively  but
now the weighting of the coin will be      this deal would give agent a  an apparent utility
of       i e                   which is also a   s real utility  i e                     a  s real utility 
however  is                         this lie is beneficial for a   
the situation is illustrated in figure     where agent a   s lie modifies his apparent goal
states so that they are closer to the initial state  but the plan still ends up bringing the
world to one of his real goal states 
in the example above  the existence of a common subgoal between the agents allowed
one agent to exploit the common subgoals  assuming  of course  that the lying agent knew
its opponent s goals   the lying agent relaxes his true goal by claiming that the common
subgoal is mainly its opponent s demand as far as he is concerned  he claims   he would
be satisfied with a much cheaper subgoal  if it is really necessary to achieve the expensive
subgoal  he claims   more of the burden must fall on his opponent

figure     lying in a conict situation

one might think that in the absence of such a common subgoal  there would be no
opportunity for one agent to beneficially lie to the other  this  however  is not true  as we
see below 

    beneficial lies with multi plan deals
another example of beneficial lying in a conict situation  the initial state s

can be seen in figure     similar to the example used in section     above  a   s goal is
to reverse the blocks in slot    and to leave the blocks in slot   in their initial position

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

agent a  might lie and claim that his goal is to reverse the blocks in slot   and leave the
blocks in slot   in their initial position  his real goal  or to have the white block be alone
in slot    it costs a    to achieve his apparent goal alone  to do the reverse alone would
cost him    and thus to achieve the imaginary part of his goal is cheaper  the agreement
will be               where  is again the mixed joint plan in which both agents cooperatively
achieve i s goal  it turns out to be cheaper for both agents to cooperatively carry out
a  s real goal than it is to cope with a   s imaginary alternative  a  s apparent utility will
be                             this is also a   s utility  a   s actual utility  however  will be
                            which is greater than the unvarnished utility of   that a  would get
without lying  so even without a common subgoal  a  had a beneficial lie  here we have
been introduced to a new type of lie  a kind of  interference decoy   that can be used even
when the agents  have no common subgoals 
i

   incomplete information about worth of goals
consider the situation where two agents encounter one another in a shared environment 
their individual goals are commonly known  because of prior knowledge about the type of
agent  some goal recognition process  etc    as well as the cost of achieving those goals  were
each agent to be alone in the world  in addition  there is no conict between these goals 
there exists some non empty set of states that satisfies both agents  goals 
the agents have upper bounds on their worth  but  in contrast to the public goals 
each upper bound is private information  not known to the other agent  this is a common
situation  as agents queue up to access a common resource  their goals will often be selfevident  for example  two agents approaching a narrow bridge from opposite ends may
know that the other wants to cross  but not know what the crossing is worth for the other
 e g   how long it is willing to wait   the agents need to agree on a deal  for example  who
will go first  and who will wait  
one simple way to design a negotiation mechanism that handles the lack of information
is to have agents exchange private information prior to the actual negotiation process  this
pre negotiation exchange of information is another variant on the    phase game mentioned
above  in the current case  agents exchange private information about worth  in this section 
we only consider the situation where agents are negotiating over mixed joint plans 
one question  then  is how should agents play this    phase game to best advantage 
as was mentioned above in sections     and      an agent generally has an incentive to
misrepresent the worth of his goal by lowering it the less an agent is willing to pay  the
less it will have to pay in a utility product maximizing mechanism  pmm   however  if
everyone lowers their worth they may not be able to reach any agreement at all  whereas
if they declared their true worth agreement would have been reached  agents might lower
their worth too much and be driven to an inecient outcome  this is an instance of the
free rider problem  every agent is individually motivated to lower his worth  and have
someone else carry more of the burden  the group as a whole stands to suffer  particularly
if agreements are not reached when they otherwise would have been 
we can exert control over this tendency to lower one s apparent worth by careful design
of the post exchange part of the negotiation mechanism  we are interested in designing a
mechanism that satisfies our desire for ecient  symmetric  simple  and stable outcomes  in
   

fizlotkin   rosenschein

our research on tods  we managed  in certain cases  to provide a post exchange mechanism
that satisfied all these attributes  and was also found to be incentive compatible the agents 
best strategy was to declare their true goals  in this section  we introduce two mechanisms
for private worth sods  one  strict   the other  tolerant   and analyze their affects on the
stability and eciency of negotiation outcomes  the strict mechanism turns out to be more
stable  while the tolerant mechanism is more ecient 

    strict and tolerant mechanisms

there are several cases that need to be addressed by any mechanism  and can be treated
differently by different mechanisms  for example  what should happen if one agent declares
his worth as being lower than his stand alone cost  i e   apparently he would not achieve
his goal were he to be alone  it is not worth it to him   should the other agent then still
be allowed to offer a deal  or is the negotiation considered to have failed at this point 
both mechanisms that we present below start the same way  the agents simultaneously
declare a worth value  claimed to be the worth they assign to the achievement of their goal 

 both goals are apparently achievable alone  if both agents declare a worth

greater than their stand alone cost  which is commonly known   the negotiation proceeds as if the worth declarations were true  the agents then use some product
maximizing mechanism over the negotiation set of mixed joint plans  with their declared worths as the baseline of the utility calculations  the result will be an equal
division of the apparent available utility between them 
 only one agent s goal is apparently achievable alone  if one agent declares a
worth greater than stand alone cost  and the other doesn t  then the former agent is
free to decide what to do  he can either propose a take it or leave it deal to the other
agent  if it s refused  he ll carry out his own goal alone   or he can simply bypass the
offer and just carry out his own goal  since his declared worth is greater than his
stand alone cost  it is rational for him to accomplish his goal by himself 
 both agents  goals are apparently unachievable alone  if both agents declare
worths lower than their stand alone costs  our two mechanisms differ as to how the
situation is handled 

  strict mechanism  there is a conict  and no actions are carried out  the
 

agents derive the utility of the conict deal 
tolerant mechanism  the agents continue in their negotiation as in the first
case above  i e   they use mixed joint plans  and divide the apparent available
utility between them   even though both agents claim to be unwilling to achieve
their goals alone  it may certainly be the case that together  they can carry out
a rational joint plan for achieving both of their goals 

the tolerant mechanism gives the agents a  second chance  to complete the negotiation
successfully and reach a rational agreement  whereas the strict mechanism does not forgive
their low worth declarations  and  punishes  them both by causing a conict  of course  if
both agents  true worths are really lower than their stand alone costs  the strict mechanism
   

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

causes an unnecessary failure  and is thus inecient   while the tolerant mechanism still
allows them to reach a deal when it is possible  we will see below  however  that tolerance
can sometimes lead to instability 
our approach through the rest of this section will be to consider the various relationships
among the two agents  worth values  their cost values  the interaction types  and the joint
plans that achieve both agents  goals  for each such relationship  we ll analyze the strategies
available to the agents  as mentioned above  we are here only considering situations where
both agents  goals are achievable by two agent mixed joint plans  e g   there are reachable
states that satisfy both agents  goals  
the idea of tidy agents and an agent cleaning up after himself  introduced above in
section    was used in situations where agents were willing to pay any price to achieve their
goals their worths were unbounded  there  worth could not be used as a baseline for the
utility calculation  instead  we found that there was a  minimal sucient  value to the
utility baseline that gave rise to an ecient and fair mechanism  a similar idea will also
be useful in our analysis below  the tidy agent baseline  explored above  also serves as a
minimal sucient declaration point when worths are private information 

    the variables of interest
in general  an agent would like to declare as low a worth as possible  but without risking a
conict  the lower the declaration of worth  the smaller his share of the joint plan will be 
unfortunately for the agent  if his declared worth is too low  it may eliminate the possibility
of reaching an agreement  a necessary and sucient condition for the negotiation set not
to be empty is that the sum and min conditions  from section      will hold  given the
declarations of worth   since we assume that there is a joint plan that achieves both
agents  goals  agreement will still be possible if among those plans there is at least one that
satisfies the sum and min conditions 
there are several variables that will play a role in our analysis below  first  each agent
i has a stand alone cost  known to all  and dependent only on his goal   denoted by c  
second  each agent has a true worth  privately known  that he assigns to the achievement
of his goal  denoted by w   t is the total cost of the minimal  total cost  joint plan that
achieves both agents  goals  m is the cost of the minimal role among all such joint plans
of cost t   below  we will analyze all possible configurations of these variables 
the analysis is presented according to each interaction type other than conict  i e   symmetric cooperative  non symmetric cooperative compromise  and symmetric compromise 
for each type  we will consider three subcases that depend on the relationships between c  
w   t   and m

    symmetric cooperative situation
in symmetric cooperative situations  one strategy that an agent can use is to declare as his
worth the minimum between his true worth  and the maximum of his stand alone cost and
the minimal role in the joint plan 
min sucient strategy  min w   max c   m    
i

fizlotkin   rosenschein

the motivation here is that the agent wants to declare the minimal worth sucient for
there to be an agreement  declaring c satisfies the sum condition  but to make sure that
it also satisfies the min condition  the agent must declare max c   m    to make sure that
this declaration is individual rational  he must not make a declaration greater than his true
worth  w   thus  he takes the minimum between w and the  c   m   maximum 
the min sucient strategy is only one possible strategy that might be adopted  however  if both agents adopt it  the strategy is in equilibrium with itself  in most cases   and
agreement is guaranteed  we will analyze the characteristics of this strategy below in six
cases

figure     both goals are achievable alone
the diagram in figure    describes  in a sense  the game in normal form  each agent
can declare as its worth any number from   to infinity  the outcome depends on the two
numbers declared  every point in the plain is a possible result  the colors of the regions
denote the types of outcomes 
note  for example  that if agent a  declares less than c    while agent a  declares more
than c    the outcome is that a  will decide what to do  offering a  a take it or leave it deal 
or going it alone   if a  and a  both offer too little  so that the sum is less than t    they
will reach conict  because we assume the agents are rational  we only consider the areas
in the plain framed by w  and w   rational agents would not declare a worth greater than
their true worths  
the difference between the strict and tolerant mechanisms mentioned above is the color
of the triangle to the lower left of the c  c  point  with the strict mechanism  it would be
white  conict   while with the tolerant mechanism it is still a region that allows subsequent
negotiation to occur  the only point that is in equilibrium in both mechanisms is the c   c 
point  which is reached by the min sucient strategy given above  thus  that strategy is
both stable and ecient in both strict and tolerant mechanisms in this situation

      one goal is achievable alone

fizlotkin   rosenschein

it is stable  with the tolerant mechanism  the min sucient strategy is ecient  it results
in the w  w  point   but it unfortunately is not stable assuming that one agent declares
w   the other agent can benefit by declaring t   w  instead of w   
in fact  the agents do not actually know what situation they are in  the one in figure   
or figure      so guaranteed beneficial divergence from the equilibrium point would really
require total knowledge of the situation and what your opponent is playing  thus  although
the min sucient strategy is not stable  agents may be unlikely to diverge because of
real world constraints on their knowledge 

    non symmetric cooperative compromise situation
in this section we continue our analysis into situations where for one agent  the situation is
cooperative  while for the other  it is a compromise situation  we will continue to analyze
the case where both agents use the min sucient strategy  agreement can only be reached
when the compromising agent contributes more than his stand alone cost to the joint plan 
this is because the minimal role is greater than his stand alone cost  the only way for
agents to reach an agreement is when the compromising agent is willing to do more than
its stand alone cost otherwise  there will be a conict 
      compromise is sufficient

both the strict and tolerant mechanisms  the min sucient strategy brings both agents

consider the situation  portrayed in figure     where w  is less than m   and it is not

the picture is identical for both the strict and tolerant mechanisms  if the agents

it is stable   however  if we enhanced the mechanism with conict resolution techniques 
and allowed the agents to negotiate over multi plan deals from section      or even semicooperative deals from section       we conjecture that the result c   w  would be both
stable and ecient  that enhancement  however  is beyond the scope of the work described
in this paper 
      no reason to compromise

in the situation shown in figure     the non compromising agent a  cannot achieve his
goal alone  the min sucient strategy will have him declare something less than c   either
w  or m    and the result will be that agent a  will have the option to decide on what to
do and the only reasonable decision will be for a  to achieve his goal alone  there is no
reason to compromise  
this result is both ecient and stable  in both the strict and tolerant mechanisms

    symmetric compromise situation
in this section we continue our analysis into situations where for both agents  they are in
a compromise situation  both agents will have to do more than their stand alone costs in
order to achieve both goals 
   conict is not ecient because the result in which one agent achieves his goal  rather than both agents
doing nothing  would be more ecient

in this section  we will propose another strategy that agents could use  namely the
min concession strategy 
min concession strategy  min w    c   t    c     c       
i

in this situation  the agent is choosing to propose  as his true worth  more than his
stand alone cost  to ensure that an agreement can be reached  however  he would like to
propose the minimal sucient concession  just enough to enable an agreement  the minconcession strategy has both agents make the same concession  the overall strategy that we
are analyzing  and that covers all cases in this section  is to use the min concession strategy
in symmetric compromise situations  but otherwise to use the min sucient strategy  as
presented above   agents know which kind of situation they are in  and thus what strategy
to use  because stand alone costs are common knowledge 
      agents can compromise equally

if agents are in a situation where both can compromise equally  as shown in figure     
and they both use the min concession strategy  they end up at the point  c      c    
 where     t   c    c       this point is both ecient and stable  under both the strict
and tolerant mechanisms 
      non symmetric compromise  but goals can be achieved

if agents are in a symmetric compromise situation  but one in which one agent needs to
compromise more than the other  as in figure      the use of the min concession strategy
results in the point  c     w   this point is a conict  and is unfortunately neither stable
nor ecient 
the result is not stable because a  could make a greater compromise and benefit from
it  the result is not ecient because even if only one agent could achieve its goal  that
would be superior to the conict outcome  it is not dicult to imagine other strategies that
would lead the agents to ecient solutions  e g   declare t   c for each agent i  as a tidy
agent would do in section     but they would not be stable  either  on the other hand  if

work described in this paper

consider the situation where one agent cannot compromise  because he could not even
achieve his own goal alone   shown in figure     in this case  if both agents use the minconcession strategy  the result will be  c      w   agent   will choose to then achieve his

    summary of strict and tolerant mechanisms

the results of the analysis above are summarized in figure     the tradeoff between
eciency and stability is apparent only in the symmetric cooperative case  where neither
agent is able to achieve its goal alone  with the strict mechanism  a conict is caused simply
because each agent will not declare a worth higher than its stand alone cost  and thus will
bring about immediate conict  the tolerant mechanism gives the agents a second chance
to reach agreement  but is unstable  as described above  
the above mechanism is not incentive compatible  the agents do not have an incentive
to declare their true worths  rather  they use the min sucient strategy to decide what
their optimal declaration is

theory  and correlated equilibria 
      bargaining theory

classic game theory  nash        zeuthen        harsanyi        roth        luce   raiffa 
      talks about players reaching  deals   which are defined as vectors of utilities  one for
each player   a bargaining game can end up in some possible outcome  i e   a  deal    each
player has a full preference order over the set of possible outcomes  this preference order
is expressed by his utility function  for each deal  there is a utility vector which is the
list of the utilities of this deal for every participant  there is a special utility vector called
 conict   or sometimes the  status quo point   which is the utility each player assigns to
a conict  that is  lack of a final agreement   classic game theory deals with the following
question  given a set of utility vectors  what will be the utility vector that the players
will agree on  under particular assumptions   in other words  classic bargaining theory is
focused on prediction of outcomes  under certain assumptions about the players and the
outcomes themselves 
nash  nash              showed that under some rational behavior assumptions  i e  
individual rational and pareto optimal behavior   and symmetry assumptions  players will
   

fizlotkin   rosenschein

reach an agreement on a deal that maximizes the product of the players  utility  see section     for a more complete discussion  
an alternative approach to negotiation  which looks upon it as a dynamic  iterative process  is discussed in the work of rubinstein and osborne  rubinstein              osborne
  rubinstein        
game theory work on negotiation assumes that the negotiation game itself is welldefined  it assumes that there is a set of possible deals that the players are evaluating using
certain utility functions  therefore  the deals and the players  utility functions induce a set
of utility vectors that forms the basis for the negotiation game 
in contrast to this analysis of a given  well defined negotiation encounter  we are exploring the design space of negotiation games  given a multiagent encounter  involving  for
example  task redistribution   we design an assortment of negotiation games  by formulating
various sets of possible deals and various kinds of utility functions the agents may have 
for any given negotiation game  we then use the above game theory approaches to analyze
it and to evaluate the negotiation mechanisms we propose 
game theorists are usually concerned with how games will be played  from both a
descriptive and normative point of view  ours is essentially a constructive point of view 
since game theory tells us  for any given game  how it will be played  we endeavor to design
games that have good properties when played as game theory predicts 
      equilibrium

game solutions in game theory consist of strategies in equilibrium  if somehow a social
behavior reaches an equilibrium  no agent has any incentive to diverge from that equilibrium
behavior  that equilibrium is considered to be a solution to the game  there may be one
or more  or no  strategies in equilibrium  and there are also different notions of equilibrium
in the game theory literature 
three levels of equilibrium that are commonly used in game theory are nash equilibrium 
perfect equilibrium  and dominant equilibrium  binmore        rasmusen         each level
of equilibrium enumerated above is stronger than the previous one  two strategies s  t are
in nash equilibrium if  assuming that one agent is using s   the other agent cannot do better
by using some strategy other than t   and vice versa  perfect equilibrium means that when
the game has multiple steps  and one player is using s   there exists no state in the game
where the other player can do better by not sticking to his strategy t   there do exist
situations where strategies might be in nash equilibrium  but not in perfect equilibrium 
in that case  although strategy t was best at the start of the game  as the game unfolds it
would be better to diverge from t   dominant strategy equilibrium means that no matter
what strategy your opponent chooses  you cannot do better than play strategy t   strategies
s and t are in dominant strategy equilibrium when s is the dominant strategy for one
player  and t is the dominant strategy for the other 
in our work  we generally use nash equilibrium  the weakest equilibrium concept  as our
requirement of a solution  this provides us with the widest range of interaction solutions 
at times  because the solution is not inherently in perfect equilibrium  we have introduced
additional rules on the interaction  to compel agents to follow particular nash equilibrium
   

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

strategies as the game progresses  such as introducing a penalty mechanism for breaking a
public commitment  
this provides an interesting example of the power we wield as designers of the game 
first  we would normally require perfect equilibria in multiagent encounters  but we can
adopt nash equilibria as sucient for our needs  then impose rules that keep agents from
deviating from their nash equilibrium strategies  second  the very strong requirement of
dominant equilibrium  which might be desirable when two arbitrary agents play a given
game  is not needed when the recommended strategies are commonly known nash equilibrium is then sucient 
      mechanism design and implementation theory

there are also groups of game theorists who consider the problem of how to design games
that have certain attributes  it is this area of mechanism design that is closest to our own
concerns  as we design protocols for automated agents 
mechanism design is also known in the game theory literature as the implementation
problem  the implementation question  binmore        fudenberg   tirole        asks
whether there is a mechanism  also called a game form   with a distinguishable equilibrium
point  dominant strategy  or perfect  or merely nash  such that each social profile  i e  
group behavior  is associated  when the players follow their equilibrium strategies  with the
desired outcome 
in other words  there are assumed to be a group of agents  each with its own utility
function and preferences over possible social outcomes  there is also a social welfare function
that rates all those possible social outcomes  e g   a socially ecient agreement may be
rated higher than a non ecient one   arrow         the question is then  can one design
a game such that it has a unique solution  equilibrium strategies   and such that when each
individual agent behaves according to this equilibrium strategy  the social behavior will
maximize the social welfare function  if such a game can be designed  then it is said that
the game implements the social welfare function 
as an example of a social welfare function  consider minimization of pollution  while
everyone may be interested in lowering pollution levels  everyone is interested in others
bearing the associated costs  a mechanism to implement this social welfare function might
include  for example  taxes on polluting industries and tax credits given for the purchase of
electric cars  this is precisely the kind of mechanism that would cause agents  following an
equilibrium strategy  to minimize pollution 
given a negotiation game that we have designed  i e   a set of deals and utility functions  
we also have to design the actual negotiation mechanism  one of the important attributes
of the negotiation mechanism is eciency  i e   maximization of the total group s utility 
this is the social welfare function that we are trying to implement  when we assume that
agents have incomplete information about one another s utility function  we basically have
a  negotiation  mechanism design problem 
however  unlike classic mechanism design in game theory  we are satisfied with a  negotiation  mechanism that has some nash equilibrium point that implements eciency  we do
not need uniqueness  nor do we need a stronger notion of equilibrium  i e   dominant equilibrium   the negotiation mechanism we design is intended as a suggestion to the community
   

fizlotkin   rosenschein

of agents  designers  along with a negotiation strategy  the negotiation mechanism and the
strategy are both part of the suggested standard  to make the standard self enforcing it is
sucient that the strategy that is part of the standard be in nash equilibrium 
      correlated equilibrium

players can sometime communicate prior to actually playing the game  by communicating 
the players can coordinate their strategies or even sign binding contracts about the strategies
they are about to use  contracts can be of various types  an agent can commit himself to
playing a pure strategy if the other agent commits to playing another pure strategy  agents
can also commit themselves to a contract in which they ip a coin and play their strategy
according to the coin 
a contract can thus be seen as an agreement between the players to correlate their
strategies  a correlated strategy in the general case is a probability distribution over all
possible joint activities  i e   strategy combinations  of the players  in order for the players
to play according to some correlated strategy  there should be a mediator to conduct the
lottery  choose the joint activity according to the agreed probabilities  and then suggest this
strategy to the players  in some cases the mediator is assumed to release to each player
information only about that player s action  strategy  in the chosen joint action  but not
the other player s action 
contracts between players can be binding  however  we cannot assume that contracts
are binding in all cases  even when contracts are not binding  some of them can be selfenforcing  a contract is self enforcing if each player that signs the contract cannot do
better by not following the contract  under the assumption that other agents are following
the contract  if the mediator s communications are observable by all the players  then
the only self enforcing non binding contracts are those that randomize among the nash
equilibria of the original game   myerson         pp       
self enforcing contracts on correlated strategy are called correlated equilibria  aumann
introduced the term correlated equilibrium  aumann         he defined the correlated equilibrium of a given game to be a nash equilibrium of some extension of the game  where
the players receive private signals before the original game is actually played  aumann also
showed  aumann        that correlated equilibrium can be defined in terms of bayesian
rationality  forges extended this approach to games with incomplete information  forges 
      
myerson showed that correlated equilibrium is a specific case of a more general concept of equilibrium  which he called communication equilibrium  in games with incomplete
information  myerson              
some of the deal types that we have defined above involve coin ipping  this is  of
course  directly related to the notion of correlated strategies  as in the correlated equilibrium theory  we also assume that agents are able to agree on deals  i e   contracts  that
involve some jointly observed random process  e g   a coin toss   however  unlike correlated
equilibrium theory  we do assume that contracts are binding  therefore  we assume that
agents will follow the contract  whatever the result was of the coin ip  even if it is no
longer rational for the agent to do so  relaxation of the binding agreement assumption

    related work in distributed artificial intelligence

there have been several streams of research in distributed artificial intelligence  dai 
that have approached the problem of multiagent coordination in different ways  we here
briey review some of this work  categorizing it in the general areas of multiagent planning 
negotiation  social laws  and economic approaches 
      multiagent planning

one focus of dai research has been that of  planning for multiple agents   which considers
issues inherent in centrally directed multiagent execution  smith s contract net  smith 
            falls into this category  as does other dai work  fox  allen    strohm       
rosenschein        pednault        katz   rosenschein         a second focus for research
has been  distributed planning   where multiple agents all participate in coordinating and
deciding upon their actions  konolige   nilsson        corkill        rosenschein   genesereth        rosenschein        durfee  lesser    corkill        zlotkin   rosenschein 
    b  ephrati   rosenschein        pollack        pope  conry    mayer        
the question of whether the group activity is fashioned centrally or in a distributed
manner is only one axis of comparison  another important issue that distinguishes between
various dai research efforts is whether the goals themselves need to be adjusted  that is 
whether there may be any fundamental conicts among different agents  goals  thus  for
example  georgeff s early work on multiagent planning assumed that there was no basic
conict among agent goals  and that coordination was all that was necessary to guarantee
success  georgeff              stuart         similarly  planning in the context of lesser

coordination of activities  e g   sensor network computations  among agents who have no
inherent conict with one another  though surface conict may exist    planning  here
means avoidance of redundant or distracting activity  ecient exploration of the search
space  etc 
another important issue is the relationship that agents have to one another  e g   the
degree to which they are willing to compromise their goals for one another  assuming that
such compromise is necessary   benevolent agents are those that  by design  are willing to
accommodate one another  rosenschein   genesereth         they have been built to be
cooperative  to share information  and to coordinate in pursuit of some  at least implicit 
notion of global utility  in contrast  multiagent system agents will cooperate only when
it is in their best interests to do so  genesereth  ginsberg    rosenschein         still
another potential relationship among agents is a modified master slave relationship  called
a  supervisor supervised  relationship  where non absolute control is exerted by one agent

       and the use of consensus mechanisms for aggregating subplans produced by multiple agents  ephrati   rosenschein      b   have all been explored  as well as related

in this paper  we have not been dealing with the classical problems of planning research
 e g   the construction of sequences of actions to accomplish goals   instead  we have taken
as a given that the agents are capable of deriving joint plans in a domain  and then considered how they might choose from among alternative joint plans so as to satisfy potentially
conicting notions of utility  to help the agents bridge conicts  we have introduced frameworks for plan execution  such as ipping a coin to decide which of two joint plans will be
carried out   but the actual base planning mechanism is not the subject of our work 
      axiomatic approaches to group activity

there exists a large and growing body of work within artificial intelligence that attempts
to capture notions of rational behavior through logical axiomatization  cohen   levesque 
            rao  georgeff    sonenberg        rao   georgeff              georgeff  
lansky        georgeff        belegrinos   georgeff        grosz   kraus        konolige 
      morgenstern              kinny   georgeff         the approach usually centers
on a formalized model of the agent s beliefs  desires  and intentions  the so called  bdi
model    hughes   cresswell        konolige         the purpose of the formal model is
to characterize precisely what constitutes rational behavior  with the intent to impose such
rational behavior on an automated agent  the formal axioms might be used at run time
to directly constrain an agent s decision process  or  more likely  they could be used at
compile time to produce a more ecient executable module 
the focus of this research  coming as it does from a single agent artificial intelligence
perspective  is on the architecture of a single automated agent  for example  cohen and
levesque have explored the relationship between choice  commitment  and intention  cohen
  levesque              an agent should commit itself to certain plans of action  and
remain loyal to these plans as long as it is appropriate  for example  when the agent discovers
a plan is infeasible  the plan should be dropped  
even when looking at multiagent systems  these researchers have examined how a member of a group should be designed again  looking at how to design an individual agent so
that it is a productive group member  for example  in certain work  kinny et al        
axioms are proposed that cause an agent  when he discovers that he will fail to fulfill his
role in a joint plan  to notify the other members of his group  axiomatizations  however 
might need to deal with how groups of agents could have a joint commitment to accomplishing some goal  cohen   levesque         or how each agent can make interpersonal
commitments without the use of such notions  grosz   kraus         another use for the
bdi abstractions is to allow one agent to reason about other agents  and relativize one s
intentions in terms of beliefs about other agents  intentions or beliefs 
axiomatic approaches tend to closely link definitions of behavior with internal agent
architecture  thus  the definition of commitment explored by cohen and levesque is intended to constrain the design of an agent  so that it will behave in a certain way  our
   

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

work  on the other hand  takes an arms length approach to the question of constraining
agents  public behavior  the rules of an encounter are really a specification of the domain
 not of the agent   and an agent designer is free to build his agent internally however he
sees fit  the rules themselves  however  will induce rational designers to build agents that
behave in certain ways  independent of the agents  internal architectures 
      social laws for multiple agents

various researchers in distributed artificial intelligence have suggested that it would be
worthwhile to isolate  aspects of cooperative behavior   general rules that would cause
agents to act in ways conducive to cooperation  the hypothesis is that when agents act in
certain ways  e g   share information  act in predictable ways  defer globally constraining
choices   it will be easier for them to carry out effective joint action  steeb  cammarata 
hayes roth    wesson        cammarata  mcarthur    steeb        mcarthur  steeb   
cammarata        
moses  shoham  and tennenholtz  tennenholtz   moses        moses   tennenholtz 
      shoham   tennenholtz      b      a  moses   tennenholtz        shoham   tennenholtz         for example  have suggested applying the society metaphor to artificial
systems so as to improve the performance of agents operating in the system  the issues
that are to be dealt with when analyzing a multiagent environment concern synchronization  coordination of the agents  activities  cooperative ways to achieve tasks  and how safety
and fairness constraints on the system can be guaranteed  they propose coordinating agent
activity to avoid conicts  the system will be structured so that agents will not arrive at
potential conict situations 
thus these social laws are seen as a method to avoid the necessity for costly coordination
techniques  like planning or negotiation  with agents following the appropriate social laws 
the need for run time coordination will be reduced  this is important  because although
agent designers may be willing to invest a large amount of effort at design time in building
effective multiagent systems  it is often critical that the run time overhead be as low as
possible 
there is a similarity between this use of pre compiled  highly structured social laws 
and our development of pre defined interaction protocols  however  the social law approach
assumes that the designers of the laws have full control over the agents  agents are assumed to follow the social laws simply because they were designed to  and not because they
individually benefit from the social laws  obeying the social laws may not be  stable  
assuming that everyone else obeys the laws  an agent might do better by breaking them 
our approach is concerned with social conventions that are stable  which will be suitable
for individually motivated agents 
      decision theoretic approaches

there is related work in artificial intelligence that addresses the reasoning process of a single
agent in decision theoretic terms  in certain work  horvitz        horvitz  cooper    heckerma        russell   wefald         decision theoretic approaches are used to optimize the
value of computation under uncertain and varying resource limitations  etzioni considered
using a decision theoretic architecture  with learning capabilities  to control problem solving
   

fizlotkin   rosenschein

search  etzioni         for an introductory treatment of decision theory itself  see raiffa s
classic text on the subject  raiffa        
classical decision theory research considers an agent that is  playing against nature  
trying to maximize utility in uncertain circumstances  a key assumption is that  nature s 
behavior is independent of the decision made by the agent  of course  this assumption does
not hold in a multiagent encounter 
the concept of  rationality   usually expressed in decision theoretic terms  has been
used to model agent activity in multiagent encounters  rosenschein   genesereth       
genesereth et al          here  axioms defining different types of rationality  along with
assumptions about the rationality of others  led agents to particular choices of action  in
contrast to this work  our research employs standard game theory notions of equilibrium
and rationality  other discussions of the use of rationality in general reasoning can be found
in doyle s research  doyle              
another decision theoretic approach  taken by gmytrasiewicz and durfee  has been
used to model multiagent interactions  gmytrasiewicz  durfee    wehe      a      b 
gmytrasiewicz   durfee               it assumes no predefined protocol or structure to
the interaction  in marked contrast to our research on protocol design   the research uses
a decision theoretic method for coordinating the activities of autonomous agents called the
recursive modeling method  each agent models the other agents in a recursive manner 
allowing evaluation of the expected utility attached to potential actions or communication 
      economic approaches

there have been several attempts to consider market mechanisms as a way of eciently
allocating resources in a distributed system  among the ai work is that of smith s contract
net  smith              sandholm         malone s enterprise system  malone et al         
and wellman s walras system  wellman        
the contract net is a high level communication protocol for a distributed problem
solving system  it enables the distribution of the tasks among the nodes that operate in
the system  a contract between two nodes is established so that tasks can be executed 
each node in the net can act either as a manager or as a contractor  a task that has been
assigned to a node can be further decomposed by the contractor  a contract is established
by a bidding scheme that includes the announcement of the task by the manager  and bids
sent in by the potential contractors 
enterprise  malone et al         is a system that was built using a variation of the contract net protocol  the distributed scheduling protocol locates the best available machine
to perform a task  this protocol is similar to the contract net  but makes use of more
well defined assignment criteria 
another system  wellman        that takes an economic approach in solving a distributed problem through the use of a price mechanism has been explored by wellman 
wellman uses the consumer producer metaphor to establish a market pricing based mechanism for task redistribution that ensures stability and eciency  all agents act as both
consumers and producers  each distinct good has an auction associated with it  and agents
can get the good by submitting bids in the auction for that good  the system developed
by wellman  walras  computes for each market the equilibrium price 
   

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

there are two main differences between these economic approaches and our work on
mechanism design  first  there is an underlying assumption in the economic approach that
utility is explicitly transferable  e g   money can be used   our work does not involve any
need for explicit utility transfer  instead  we exploit various methods for implicit utility
transfer  for example  sharing work in a joint plan  tossing a coin  etc  of course  this
constrains the available coordination mechanism  but removes an assumption  that is  the
existence of money  that may not be suitable in certain multiagent environments  second 
the economic models can deal with n agents in a market  while our work above deals with
two agent encounters  however  other work of ours deals with n agent negotiation as a
coalition formation problem  zlotkin   rosenschein        
      negotiation

negotiation has been a subject of central interest in dai  as it has been in economics and
political science  raiffa         the word has been used in a variety of ways  though in
general it refers to communication processes that further coordination  smith        lesser
  corkill        kuwabara   lesser        conry et al         kreifelts   von martial 
      kraus  ephrati    lehmann         these negotiating procedures have included the
exchange of partial global plans  durfee        durfee   lesser         the communication
of information intended to alter other agents  goals  sycara               and the use of
incremental suggestions leading to joint plans of action  kraus   wilkenfeld        
interagent collaboration in distributed problem solving systems has been explored in
the ongoing research of lesser  durfee  and colleagues  much of this work has focused on
the implementation and analysis of data fusion experiments  where systems of distributed
sensors absorb and interpret data  ultimately arriving at a group conclusion  durfee  
lesser        decker   lesser      a  l aasri  l aasri    lesser         agents exchange
partial solutions at various levels of detail to construct global solutions  much of the work has
examined effective strategies for communication of data and hypotheses among agents  and
in particular the kinds of relationships among nodes that can aid effective group analysis 
for example  different organizations  and different methods for focusing node activity  can
help the system as a whole be far more ecient 
there are two main distinctions between our work and the work of lesser and his
colleagues  first  the underlying assumption of the bulk of lesser s work is that agents
are designed and implemented as part of a unified system  and work towards a global goal 
our agents  on the other hand  are motivated to achieve individual goals  second  unlike
our formal approach to mechanism design  lesser s work has historically been heuristic
and experimental  although his more recent work has explored the theoretical basis for
system level phenomena  decker   lesser            a      b  
sycara has examined a model of negotiation that combines case based reasoning and
optimization of multi attribute utilities  sycara               in particular  while we assume
that agents  goals are fixed during the negotiation  sycara is specifically interested in how
agents can inuence one another to change their goals through a process of negotiation
 information transfer  etc   
kraus and her colleagues have explored negotiation where the negotiation time itself is an
issue  kraus   wilkenfeld        kraus        kraus  wilkenfeld    zlotkin         agents
   

fizlotkin   rosenschein

may lose value from a negotiation that drags on too long  and different agents are asymmetric
with regard to the cost of negotiation time  agents  attitudes towards negotiation time
directly inuences the kinds of agreements they will reach  interestingly  however  those
agreements can be reached without delay  there is an avoidable ineciency in delaying
agreement  our work  in contrast  assumes that agent utility remains constant throughout
the negotiation process  and so negotiation time does not inuence the agreement  some
of kraus  work also assumes explicit utility transfer  while our work  as mentioned above 
does not  
gasser has explored the social aspects of agent knowledge and action in multiagent
systems   communities of programs    gasser               social mechanisms can dynamically emerge  communities of programs can generate  modify  and codify their own
local languages of interaction  gasser s approach may be most effective when agents are
interacting in unstructured domains  or in domains where their structure is continuously
changing  the research we present  on the other hand  exploits a pre designed social layer
for multiagent systems 
other work that focuses on the organizational aspects of societies of agents exists  fox 
      malone        
ephrati and rosenschein used the clarke tax voting procedure as a consensus mechanism  in essence to avoid the need for classical negotiation  ephrati   rosenschein       
    c      a   the mechanism assumes the ability to transfer utility explicitly  the clarke
tax technique assumes  and requires  that agents are able to transfer utility out of the
system  taxes that are paid by the agents   the utility that is transferred out of the system
is actually wasted  and reduces the eciency of the overall mechanism  this  however  is
the price that needs to be paid to ensure stability  again  the work we present in this paper
does not assume the explicit transfer of utility  also  the negotiation mechanism ensures
stability without the ineciency of transferring utility out of the system  however  voting
mechanisms like the clarke tax can deal with n agent agreement  not the two agent agreement of our research   and also demonstrates a kind of dominant equilibrium  in contrast
to our weaker notion of nash equilibrium  

    conclusions
in this paper we have explored state oriented domains  sods   in state oriented domains
the current description of the world is modeled as a state  and operators cause the world
to move from one state to another  the goal of an agent is to transform the world into
one of some collection of target states  in sods  real conict is possible between agents 
and in general  agents may find themselves in four possible types of interactions  symmetric
cooperative  symmetric compromise  non symmetric cooperative compromise  and conict 
agents can negotiate over different deal types in each of these kinds of interactions  in
particular  we introduced the semi cooperative deal  and multi plan deals  for use in conict situations  the unified negotiation protocols  product maximizing mechanisms based
on either semi cooperative deals or multi plan deals  provide a suitable basis for conict
resolution  as well as for reaching cooperative agreements 
strategic manipulation is possible in sods  in a state oriented domain  an agent might
misrepresent his goals  or his worth function  to gain an advantage in a negotiation  the
   

fimechanisms for automated negotiation

general approach by a deceitful agent would be to pretend that its worth is lower than it
actually is  this can be done directly  by declaring low worth  in certain mechanisms   or
by declaring a cheaper goal  in the case where stand alone cost is taken to be the implicit
worth baseline   we were able to construct incentive compatible mechanisms to be used
when worths are unknown  but were unable to do so for sods when goals are unknown
