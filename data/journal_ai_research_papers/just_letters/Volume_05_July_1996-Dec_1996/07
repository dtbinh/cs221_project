   characterizing decomposable models

purpose find characterization decomposable models  or equivalently  chordal
graphs  terms properties independence relationships  carried
adding single property set axioms  c  c   characterizing dependency models
isomorphic undirected graphs 
let us consider following axiom 
 c   strong chordality 
 i  ff  jz           ju nf   g     ff  jz      ff  jz       ff  fi      u  z

u n fff  fi    g 

axiom establishes condition allows us reduce size conditioning
set separating two variables   namely two variables set
conditionally independent  going demonstrate adding axiom strong
chordality axioms found pearl paz  c  c   associated graph necessarily
becomes chordal graph vice versa  therefore  shall obtain characterization
decomposable models  pearl        proposed axiom slightly different c  
necessary  though sucient condition chordality  called axiom chordality

c  z      obtain  ff  j    ff  j    however  set axioms c  c 
c  constitute characterization chordal graphs  graph depicted figure
   b  shows  graph chordal  satisfies c  c  c   using c  instead
c  shall obtain desired result 

theorem   dependency model isomorphic chordal graph if  if 
satisfies axioms c  c  

proof  first  let us prove sucient condition  using pearl paz result  c  

c  deduce isomorphic associated graph g  therefore independence
equivalent separation g  prove g chordal 
let us suppose g chordal  then  g  cycle t  t       tn   tn t    n   
without chord  i e    i  j s t            j n  edges ti  tj belong em
 except edge t   tn

let us consider nodes t  tn     set nodes z   u n ft           tn g  first 
going prove independence statement  t   tn   jz   t    tn  
true   i  t    tn   jz   t    tn   could find chain linking t  tn  
containing nodes z   t    tn   i e   chain linking t  tn   containing nodes
ft           tn   g  case would edge linking t  node tj  
  j n      contradicts assumption cycle chord  therefore 
 t   tn   jz   t    tn   
hand  nodes t  tn connected edge  once
cycle chord   separated u nft    tn g  therefore
 t    tn ju nft    tn g   now  using c   deduce either  t   tn   jz   t     t   tn   jz  
tn    either case chain linking t  tn   blocked separating
set  first case chain t  tn tn     second case t  t       tn   tn    
therefore  obtain contradiction  hence graph g chordal 
now  let us prove necessary condition  using pearl paz s result 
isomorphic graph g  properties c  c  hold 
let us suppose c  hold  then  find nodes ff  fi    subset
nodes z  ff  jz            ju n f   g    i  ff  jz      i  ff  jz

 i  i e   ft       tng    z          however   ff  fijz       know every chain
linking must contain node z       particular  previously
found chain  ft       tn g    z             therefore  node tk
tk     let us consider node tk      ff  jz       transitivity  c   
obtain  ff  tk  jz        tk     jz        first independence assertion
cannot true  chain fft       tk   tk   contain node z      
therefore   tk     jz         tk     jz      then  transitivity 
would obtain  ff  tk  jz      ff  jz      statements false  first
one existence chain fft       tk   tk   second one
hypothesis  so   i  tk     jz      reasoning allows us assert
 i  ff  fijz      i  tk    fijz      so  found node tk   adjacent   tk
satisfying properties ff  completely analogous reasoning applied node tk  
proves  tk     tk   jz         i  tk     tk   jz       i  tk     tk   jz      so 
replaced nodes two nodes adjacent satisfying properties  note
case one tk   tk   matter
subsequent argument 
now   i  tk     tk   jz      tk     tk   jz       deduce
chain tk   s       sm tk   g si    z    i node sh   sh    
simplify notation  let us call s    tk     sm     tk     assume  i  j

establish another interesting characterization chordal graphs  adding

axiom c  asserts whenever two nodes adjacent  are independent  
find separating set whose nodes adjacent other  i e   complete
separating set 

theorem   dependency model isomorphic chordal graph if  if

proof  let us prove necessary condition  graph g associated chordal 

theorem   know properties c  c  c  hold 
let us suppose c  hold  then     ff  ju n
fff  fig  w u n fff  fig either  i  ff  fijw    jw j           w
    ju n f   g  
let w  separating set minimal size   i e    ff  jw    i  ff  js  
 s w   we know least one separating set type exist 
 ff  fiju n fff  fig  holds   then  deduce jw j           w 
    ju n f   g   let us define z   w  n f   g  thus   ff  jz      
    ju n f   g  and  applying c   obtain either  ff  jz      ff  jz      i e  
 ff  fijw  n fg   ff  fijw  n f g   contradicts minimality w    therefore 
c  true 
prove sucient condition  let us suppose g chordal  then 
cycle t  t       tn   tn t    n    without chord  so  nodes t  tn   adjacent 
hence separated  let w separating set t  tn     i e   satisfying
 t   tn   jw    tn   w ft          tn   g   w       otherwise could find chain
linking t  tn   would blocked w   thus contradicting  t    tn   jw   
so  every separating set w contains tn ti     n      hence jw j      now 
applying c   deduce  i  tn   tiju n ftn   ti g   i e   tn ti adjacent nodes 
contradicts assumption cycle chord  then  conclusion
graph chordal

bayesian networks data computationally complex  example  algorithms  spirtes  glymour    scheines        start complete undirected graph 
try remove edges testing conditional independence linked nodes 
using conditioning sets small possible  thus reducing complexity increasing

 i  ff  fijz      i  ff  fijz      ff  fijz          i     ju n f   g  
could use rule simultaneously allows us remove edge ff fi
current graph  fix edge   true edge graph 
similarly  property c  could give rise following rule  trying remove
