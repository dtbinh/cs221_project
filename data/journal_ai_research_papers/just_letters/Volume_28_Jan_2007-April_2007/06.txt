abstract
we study auctions with severe bounds on the communication allowed  each bidder
may only transmit t bits of information to the auctioneer  we consider both welfare  and
profit maximizing auctions under this communication restriction  for both measures  we
determine the optimal auction and show that the loss incurred relative to unconstrained
auctions is mild  we prove non surprising properties of these kinds of auctions  e g   that
in optimal mechanisms bidders simply report the interval in which their valuation lies
in  as well as some surprising properties  e g   that asymmetric auctions are better than
symmetric ones and that multi round auctions reduce the communication complexity only
by a linear factor 

   introduction
recent years have seen the emergence of the internet as a platform of multifaceted economic
interaction  from the technical level of computer communication  routing  storage  and computing  to the level of electronic commerce in its many forms  studying such interactions
raises new questions in economics that have to do with the necessity of taking computational considerations into account  this paper deals with one such question  how to design
auctions optimally when we are restricted to use a very small amount of communication 
this paper studies the effect of severely restricting the amount of communication allowed
in a single item auction  each bidder privately knows his real valued willingness to pay for
the item  but is only allowed to send k possible messages to the auctioneer  who must
then allocate the item and determine the price on the basis of the messages received   for
example  a bidder may only be able to send t bits of information  in which case k    t    the
simplest case is k      i e   each bidder sends a single bit of information  this is in contrast
to the usual auction design formulation  in which bidders communicate real numbers 
while communicating a real number may not seem excessively burdensome  there are
several motivations for studying auctions with such severe restrictions on the communication  first  if auctions are to be used for allocating low level computing resources  they

should use only a very small amount of computational effort  for example  an auction for
routing a single packet on the internet must require very little communication overhead 
certainly not a whole real number  ideally  one would like to waste only a bit or two on the
bidding information  perhaps piggy backing on some unused bits in the packet header of
existing networking protocols  such as ip or tcp   second  the amount of communication
also measures the extent of information revelation by the bidders  usually  bidders will be
reluctant to reveal their exact private data  e g   rothkopf  teisberg    kahn         this
work studies the tradeoff between the amount of revealed data and the optimality of the
auctions  we show that auctions can be close to optimal even using a single yes no question per each bidder  our results can also be applied to various environments where there
is a need for discretize the bidding procedure  one example is determining the optimal bid
increment in english auctions  harstad   rothkopf         finally  a restriction on communication may sometimes be viewed as a proxy for other simplicity considerations  such
as simple user interface or small number of possible payments to facilitate their electronic
handling  a recent paper  blumrosen   feldman        shows that the ideas illustrated
in this work extend to general mechanism design frameworks where the requirement for a
small number of actions per each player are natural and intuitive 
we examine the effect of severe communication bounds on both the problem of maximizing social welfare and that of maximizing the sellers expected profits  the latter under
the restrictions of bayesian incentive compatibility and interim individual rationality of
the bidders  and under a standard regularity condition on the distribution of bidders valuations   we study both simultaneous mechanisms  in which the bidders send their bids
without observing any actions of the other bidders  and sequential mechanisms where messages may depend on previous messages  we find that single item auctions may be very
close to fully optimal despite the severe communication constraints  this is in contrast to
combinatorial auctions  in which exact or even approximate efficiency is known to require
an exponential amount of communication in the number of goods  nisan   segal         
both for welfare maximization and revenue maximization  we show that the optimal
  bidder auction takes the simple form of a priority game in which the player with the
highest bid wins  but ties are broken asymmetrically among the players  i e   some players
have a pre defined priority over the others when they send the same message   we show
how to derive the optimal values for the parameters of the priority game  these optimal
mechanisms are asymmetric by definition  although the players are a priori identical  the
asymmetry is in contrast with optimal mechanisms with unconstrained communication 
where symmetric mechanisms achieve optimal welfare  the second price auction  vickrey 
      and optimal profit  the myerson auction  myerson        for symmetric bidders  
furthermore  we show that for any number of players  as the allowed number of messages
grows  the loss due to bounded communication is in order of o  k      the bound is tight
for some distributions of valuations  e g   for the uniform distribution   in addition  we
consider the case in which the number of players grows while each player has exactly two

fiauctions with severely bounded communication

possible messages  we show that priority games are optimal for this case as well  and we
also characterize the parameters for the optimal mechanisms and show that they can be
generated from a simple recursive formula  we offer an asymptotic bound on the welfare
and profit losses due to bounded communication as the number of players grows  it is o  n   
for the uniform distribution   all the optimal mechanisms in this paper are deterministic 
but they are optimal even if the auctioneer is allowed to randomize  
our analysis implies some expected as well as some unexpected results 
 low welfare and profit loss  even severe bounds on communication result in
only a mild loss of efficiency  we present mechanisms in which the welfare loss and
the profit loss decrease exponentially in the number of the communication bits  and
quadratically in the number k of the allowed bids   for example  with two bidders
whose valuations are uniformly distributed on         the optimal   bit auction brings
expected welfare        compared to the first best expected welfare       
 asymmetry helps  asymmetric auctions are better than symmetric ones with the
same communication bounds  for example  with two bidders whose valuations are
uniformly distributed in         symmetric   bit auctions only achieve expected welfare
of        compared to       for asymmetric ones  we prove that both welfare  and
profit maximizing auctions must be discriminatory in both allocation and payments 
 dominant strategy incentive compatibility is achieved at no additional
cost  the auctions we design have dominant strategy equilibria and are ex post individually rational    yet are optimal even without any incentive constraints  for welfare
maximization   or among all bayesian nash incentive compatible and interim individually rational auctions  for profit maximization   this generalizes well known results
for the case without any communication constraints 
 bidding using mutually centered thresholds is optimal  we show that in the
optimal auctions with k messages  bidders simply partition the range of valuations into
k interval ranges and announce their interval  in   bidder mechanisms  each threshold
will have the interesting property of being the average value of the other bidder in the
respective interval  we denote such threshold vectors as mutually centered 
 sequential mechanisms can do better  but only up to a linear factor  allowing players to send messages sequentially rather than simultaneously can achieve
a higher payoff than in simultaneous mechanisms  however  the payoff in any such
multi round mechanism among n players can be achieved by a simultaneous mechanism in which the players send messages which are longer only by a factor of n  this
result is surprising in light of the fact that in general the restriction to simultaneous
communication can increase communication complexity exponentially  our results
   the mechanisms are optimal even when the auctions are run repeatedly  as long as the bidders values
are uncorrelated over time 
   a mechanism is ex post individually rational if a player never pays more than her value  interim individual rationality is a weaker property  in which a player will not pay more than his value on average 
individual rationality constraints are essential for the study of revenue maximization  otherwise  the
potential revenue is unbounded

for sequential mechanisms are very robust in several aspects  they allow the players
to send messages of various sizes and in any order  and they allow the auctioneer to
adaptively determine the order and the size of the messages based on the history of
the messages  the auctioneer may also use randomized decisions 
although the welfare maximizing mechanisms are asymmetric  symmetric mechanisms
can also be close to optimal  we show that as the number k of possible messages grows 
while the number of players is fixed  the loss in optimal symmetric mechanisms converges
to zero at the same rate as the loss in efficient priority games  the optimal loss in
symmetric and asymmetric mechanisms  however  differs by a constant factor  on the other
hand  when we fix the number of messages  we show that the optimal loss in asymmetric
mechanisms converges to zero asymptotically faster than in optimal symmetric mechanisms
 o  n    compared to o  logn
n    for the uniform distribution  
we now demonstrate the properties above with an example for the simplest case  a
  bidder mechanism where each player has two possible bids  i e     bit  and the values are
distributed uniformly 
example    consider two players  alice and bob  with values uniformly distributed between
        a   bit auction among these players can be described by a  x  matrix  where alice
chooses a row  and bob chooses a column  each entry of the matrix specifies the allocation
and payments given a combination of bids  the mechanism is allowed to toss coins to
determine the allocations  figure   describes an example for such a mechanism  and we
denote this mechanism by g   
a strategy defines how a player determines his bid according to his private value  we
first note that in g    both players have dominant strategies  i e   strategies that are optimal
regardless of the actions of the other players  consider the following threshold strategy 
 bid   if your valuation is greater than      else bid    clearly  this strategy is dominant
for alice in g    when her valuation is smaller than    she will gain a negative utility if she
bids    when her valuation is greater than      bidding   gives her a utility of zero  but
she can get positive utility by bidding    similarly  a threshold strategy with the threshold
 
  is dominant for bob 
the social welfare in a mechanism measures the total happiness of the players from
the outcome  or in our case  the value of the player that receives the item  the expected
welfare in g    given that the players follow their dominant strategies  is easily calculated to
  
be   
         both players will bid   with probability          and the expected welfare in
this case equals the expected value of bob           similar computations show that the expected
welfare is indeed 
 






      
 
        
          
 
        
  
       
       
            
 
    
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
  
we see that despite restricting the communication from an infinite number of bits to
 
a single bit only  a relatively small welfare loss of   
was incurred  of course  a random
allocation that can be implemented without communication at all will result in an expected
welfare of      and this may be regarded as our naive benchmark 
   

fiauctions with severely bounded communication

it turns out that the mechanism described in figure   maximizes the expected welfare 
no other   bit mechanism achieves strictly higher expected welfare with any pair of bidders
strategies  that is  regardless of the concept of equilibrium we use   we note that the optimal
mechanism is asymmetric  a priority game   ties are always broken in favor of bob  and
that this mechanism is optimal even when randomized decisions are allowed  note that
the optimal symmetric   bit mechanism uses randomization  but only achieves an expected
welfare of        the mechanism is illustrated in appendix a   and see also footnote     
finally  we note that the optimal thresholds of the players are mutually centered  that
is  alices value    is the average value of bob when he bids   and bobs value    is the average
value of alice when she bids    the intuition is simple  given that bob bids    his average
value is               for which values of alice should an efficient mechanism give her the
item  clearly when her value is greater than the average value of bob  therefore  alice
should use the threshold     

the most closely related work in the economic literature is by harstad and rothkopf
        who considered similar questions in cases of restricting the bid levels in oral auctions
to discrete levels  and by wilson        and mcafee        who analyzed the inefficiency
caused by discrete priority classes of buyers  in particular  wilson showed that as the number k of priority classes grows  the efficiency loss is asymptotically proportional to k     while
in the work of wilson the buyers aggregate demand is known while supply is uncertain 
in our model the demand is uncertain  both wilson and harstad and rothkopf restrict
attention to symmetric mechanisms  while we show that creating endogenous asymmetry
among ex ante identical buyers is beneficial  another related work is by bergemann and
pesendorfer         where the seller can decide on the accuracy by which bidders know their
private values  this problem is different than ours  since the bidders in our model know
their valuations  the work by parkes        is also related  he compared the efficiency
of simultaneous and sequential auctions under uncertainties on the values of the players 
recent work also studied similar discrete bid model in the context of ascending auctions
and auctions that use take it or leave it offers  kress   boutilier        sandholm   gilpin

cumulative probability functions fi   in some parts of our analysis    we assume the existence
of an always positive probability density function fi   we will sometime treat the seller as
one of the bidders  numbered    the seller has a constant valuation v  for the item  we
consider a normalized model  i e   bidders valuations for not having the item are a

each bidder i can send a message of ti   lg ki   bits to the mechanism  i e   player i can
choose one of possible ki bids  or messages   denote the possible set of bids for bidder i

   for simplicity  we use the range        in some parts of the paper  using the general interval will be
required  though  for the characterization of the optimal mechanisms  mainly due to the reduction we
use for maximizing the revenue that translates the original support to their virtual valuations that are
drawn from another interval 
   that is  in the characterization of the optimal mechanisms in sections     and   and when using the
concept of virtual valuation in sections     and    
   note that we allow non deterministic allocations  but we ignore non deterministic payments  since we
are interested in expected values  using lottery for the payments has no effect on our results

optimal welfare and profit  in section   we will present the characterization of the welfareoptimal and profit optimal n bidder mechanisms with   possible bids for each bidder  the

   note that ex ante ir  i e   when bidders do not know their type when choosing their strategies  is noninteresting in this model  since the auctioneer can then simply ask each bidder to pay her expected
valuation 

   

fiauctions with severely bounded communication

characterization of the optimal mechanisms in the most general case  n bidders and k possible bids  remains an open question  anyway  our asymptotic analysis of the optimal welfare
loss and the profit loss  in section    holds for the general case  and shows asymptotically
optimal mechanisms 
we first show that the allocation rules in efficient mechanisms have a certain structure
we call priority games  the term priority game means that the allocation rule uses an
asymmetric tie breaking rule  the winning player is the player with the highest priority
among the bidders that bid the highest  one consequence is that the bidder with the lowest
priority will win only when his bid is strictly higher than all other bids  note that the
term priority game refers to the asymmetry in the mechanisms allocation function  but
additional asymmetry will also appear in the payment scheme  a modified priority game
has a similar allocation  except the item is not allocated when all the bidders bid their
lowest bid   we will mostly be interested in such mechanisms when the players have the
same bid space i  
definition     a game is called a priority game if it allocates the item to the bidder i that
bids the highest bid  i e   when bi   bj for all j    i  the allocation is ai  b      and aj  b     
for j    i   with ties consistently broken according to a pre defined order on the bidders 
a game is called a modified priority game if it has an allocation as of a priority game 
except when all bidders bid    the seller keeps the item 
it turns out to be useful to build the payment scheme of such mechanisms according to
a given profile of threshold strategies 
definition     an n bidder priority game based on a profile of threshold values vectors


t    t         tn    ni    k    where for every i  ti   ti        tik   is a mechanism
whose allocation is a priority game and its payment scheme is as follows  when bidder j
wins the item for a vector of bids b she pays the smallest valuation she might have and
still win the item  given that she uses the threshold strategy sj based on tj   i e  pj  b   


min vj  aj  sj  vj    bj         we denote this mechanism as p gk   t    a modified priority
game with a similar payment rule is called a modified priority game based on a profile of


threshold value vectors  and is denoted by m p gk   t   
for   bidder games  we may use the notations p gk  x  y   m p gk  x  y   where x  y are
some vectors of threshold values   the mechanisms p gk  x  y  and m p gk  x  y  are presented in figure    note p gk  x  y  and m p gk  x  y  differ only when bidder a bids  
 i e   the first line of the games matrix  
we now observe that priority games and the modified priority games  with the payments
schemes that were described above  have two desirable properties  they admit a dominantstrategy equilibrium  and they are ex post individually rational when the players follow
these dominant strategies 
as for the dominant strategies  a well known result in mechanism design  see mookherjee
  reichelstein       and also lemma   in segal        states that for any monotone  
   modified priority games can be viewed as priority games that treat the seller as one of the bidders with
the lowest priority  then  the seller always bids his second lowest bid  
    a mechanism is monotone if the probability that some bidder wins increases as he raises his bid  fixing
the bids of the other bidders  see definition    below for our model

allocation rule there is some transfer  i e   payment  rule that would implement the desired
allocation in dominant strategies  for deterministic auctions  to support this equilibrium 
each winning bidder should pay the smallest valuation for which she still wins  fixing the
behavior of the other bidders   the payments in definition    are defined in this way  and
therefore they support the dominant strategy implementation  it follows that the threshold




strategies based on the threshold values vector t are dominant in both p gk   t   and


m p gk   t    it is clear from the definition of priority games and modified priority games
that  when playing their dominant threshold strategies  winning players will never pay more
than their value  and losing players will pay zero  ex post ir follows 
actually  the observation about the payments that lead to dominant strategies is even
more general  we observe that monotone mechanisms reveal enough information  despite
the communication constraints  to find transfer rules that support the dominant strategy
implementation  therefore  when characterizing the optimal mechanisms we can focus on
defining monotone allocation schemes under the communication restrictions  and the transfers that lead to dominant strategy equilibria can be concluded for free  in other words 
we can use the   stage approach that is widely used in the mechanism design literature also
for bounded communication settings  first solve the optimal allocation rule  and then construct transfers that satisfy the desired incentive compatibility and individual rationality
constraints 
remark    this argument holds for more general environments  in environments in which
each player has a one dimensional private value and a quasi linear utility  if a non monetary
allocation rule can be implemented in dominant strategies with some transfers  then any
communication protocol   realizing this rule also reveals enough information to construct
supporting transfers for the dominant strategies  to see this  recall that in direct revelation
mechanisms  i e   with unbounded communication   if the allocation rule proves to be
monotonic  there are transfers that support a dominant strategy equilibrium  the transfers
will be defined according to some allocation dependent thresholds  e g   for a deterministic
allocation rule every bidder should pay the smallest valuation for which she still wins  by
standard revelation principle arguments  any monotonic allocation rule in bounded communication mechanisms  can be viewed as a monotonic direct revelation mechanism with
unbounded communication  and therefore such supporting transfers exist  the supporting
transfers are determined by the changes in the allocation rule as the valuation of each bidder
increases  so the transfers change as the allocation rule changes  thus  with the same communication protocol that is used for determining the allocation  we can reveal the transfers
that support a dominant strategy implementation 
    the efficiency of priority games
the characterization of the welfare maximizing mechanism is done in two steps  we first
show that the allocation scheme in   bidder priority games is optimal     afterwards  we
will characterize the strategies of the players that lead to welfare maximization in priority
    here we deal with simultaneous communication  i e   where all bidders send their messages simultaneously  our observation is not true for sequential mechanisms  see section

in the following theorem we prove that priority games are welfare maximizing  the
proof is composed of four steps  we first show that we can assume that the bidders in the
optimal mechanisms use threshold strategies  then  we show that the allocation in the optimal mechanisms is  w l o g   monotone and deterministic  we then show that the optimal
mechanisms do not waste communication  i e   no two rows or two columns in the
allocation matrix of the optimal mechanism are identical  finally  we use these properties 
together with several combinatorial arguments  to derive the optimality of priority games 
theorem       priority games efficiency  for every pair of distribution functions of
opt
the bidders valuations  and for every v    the optimal welfare  i e   w  k
  is achieved in
either a priority game or a modified priority game  with some pair of threshold strategies  
proof  we first prove the theorem given that the seller has a low reservation value  i e  
v   a  recall that at this point we aim to find the welfare maximizing allocation scheme 
without taking the incentives of the bidders into account  the proof uses the following
three claims  for a later use  claims     and     are proved for n players 
claim       optimality of threshold strategies  given any mechanism g  gn  k       kn    
there exists a vector of threshold strategies s that achieve the optimal welfare in g among
all possible strategies  i e   w g  s    maxse w g  se  
proof   sketch   a formal proof is given in appendix a   
given a profile of welfare maximizing strategies in g  we can modify the strategy of each
bidder  w l o g   bidder    to be a threshold strategy maintaining at least the same expected
welfare  the idea is that fixing the strategies s  of the other bidders  the expected welfare

achieved when bidder   bids some bid b  is a linear function in bidder is value v    the
maximum of all these linear functions is a piecewise linear function  and it specifies the
optimal welfare as a function of v    bidder   can use a threshold strategy according to the
breaking points of this piecewise linear function that choose the welfare maximizing linear
function at each segment  clearly  there are at most k    breaking points 
claim       optimality of deterministic  monotone mechanisms  for every n and
k         kn   there exists a mechanism g  gn  k       kn   with optimal welfare  i e   there exists
opt
a profile s of strategies such that w g  s    wn  k
  which is monotone  deterministic
       kn  
 i e   the winner is fixed for each combination of bids  and in which the seller never keeps
the item 
proof  consider a mechanism g  gn  k       kn   and a profile s of strategies that maximize
opt
the expected welfare  that is  w g  s    wn  k
  a social planner  aiming to maximize
       kn  
the welfare  will always allocate the item to the bidder with the highest expected valuation 
that is  for each combination of bids b    b        bn   we will allocate the item  i e   ai  b      
to a bidder i such that i  argmaxj  e vj  sj  vj     bj     the expected welfare clearly did
not decrease  in addition  we always allocate the item  we assume that v   a   and the
allocation is deterministic  finally  we can assume  w l o g   that for each bidder i the bids
names  i e       etc   are ordered according to the expected value this bidder has 
then  the mechanism will also be monotone  if a winning bidder i increases his bid  his
expected valuation will also increase  while the expected welfare of all the other bidders will
not change  thus  bidder i will still have the maximal expected valuation 
claim       additional bids strictly help  consider a deterministic  monotone mechanism g  g  k in which the seller never keeps the item  if g achieves the optimal expected
welfare  then in the matrix representation of g no two rows  or columns  have an identical
allocation scheme 
proof  the idea that an optimal protocol exploits all its communication resources is intuitive  although it does not hold in all settings  a trivial example is calculating the parity of
two binary numbers  more involved examples can be found in kushilevitz   nisan        
we do not have a simple proof for this statement in our model  and the proof is based on
lemma a   in the appendix in the following way  consider such an optimal mechanism
g  g  k with two identical rows  this mechanism achieves the optimal welfare when the
players use some profile of strategies s  gs monotonicity implies that the two identical rows
are adjacent  thus  there is a mechanism with ge  g   k  k  with k    possible bids for
the rows bidder that achieves exactly the same expected welfare as g  when the identical
rows are united to one   this welfare is achieved with the same strategies s of the bidders 
where the rows player bids the united row instead of the two identical rows  the claim will
now follow from lemma a   in the appendix  according to this lemma  the optimal welfare
from a game where both bidders have k possible bids cannot be achieved when one of the
opt
opt
bidders has only k    possible bids  i e   w  k
  w   k  k 
  
now  due to claim      there is a deterministic  monotone game in which the item
opt
must be sold that achieves w  k
  in such games  the allocation scheme in some row i looks

like  a       a  b   b   due to claim      in the matrix representation of this optimal game 
there are no two rows with the same allocation scheme  there are k   possible monotone
rows for the game matrix  with prefix of   to k as   but our mechanism has only k rows 
similarly  we have k different columns  of possible k    in the mechanism  assume that
the row  b  b       b  is in g  then  the column  a  a       a  is clearly not in g  therefore 
our game matrix consists of all the columns except  a  a       a   which compose the priority
game where b  a  if the row  b  b       b  is not in g  then g is the priority game where
a  b 
next  we complete the proof for any sellers valuation v    consider a mechanism h  g  k
and a pair of threshold strategies based on some threshold value vectors x
e  ye that achieve
the optimal welfare among all mechanisms and strategies  due to claim      such strategies
exist   we will modify h  such that the expected welfare  with x
e  ye  will not decrease  let
a be the smallest index such that e va  f
xa  va  xg
 

v
 
let
b be the smallest index
a  
 
such that e vb  yeb  vb  yg
b      v    if a     or b      the item is never allocated to the
seller  and the efficient mechanism is as if v   a 
when a  b      consider some vector of bids  i  j   when i   a and j   b  the expected
valuations of both a and b are smaller than v    thus  the seller should keep the item for
optimal welfare  when i   a and j  b  the expected welfare of bidder b is above v    and
as expected welfare is below v    thus we can allocate the item to b and the welfare will not
decrease  similarly  we should allocate the item to a when i  a and j   b  when i   a 
the allocation is done regardless to i  thus we can assume that xa is the first threshold  i e  
a       and similarly b     
now  we show the optimal allocation for combinations of bids  i  j  such that i  a and
j  b  here  the item will not be allocated to the seller  so we actually perform an auction
with k    possible bids for each bidder  when the bidders valuation are in the range  f
x       
 ye        note that the proof  above  for the case of v   a holds for such ranges  so the
optimal welfare is achieved in a priority game  altogether  the optimal mechanism turns
out to be a modified priority game 
    efficient   bidder mechanisms with k possible bids
now  we can finally characterize the efficient mechanisms in our model  it turns out that
the optimal threshold values for priority games are mutually centered  i e   each threshold
is the expected valuation of the other bidder  given that the valuation of the other bidder
lies between his two adjacent thresholds 
definition     the threshold values x    x    x         xk    xk    y    y    y         yk    yk   for
bidders a  b respectively are mutually centered  if the following constraints hold

it is easy to see that given any pair of distribution functions  a pair 
x 
y of mutuallycentered vectors is uniquely defined  when xk   yk and  w l o g   y   x     the basic
   

fiblumrosen  nisan   segal

idea is that if x  is known  we can clearly calculate y   the smallest value that solves
x    evb  vb  y   vb  y      similarly  it is easy to see that all the variables xi and yi can
be considered as continuous  monotone functions of x    now  let z be the solution for the
equation yk    e va  xk   va  z   for satisfying all the   k     equations  z must
equal xk   since z is also a continuous monotone function of x    there is only a single value
of x  for which all the equations hold 
the following intuition shows why the optimal thresholds in priority games must be
mutually centered  assume that alice bids i  that is  her value is in the range  xi   xi      in
a monotone mechanism  the mechanism designer has to decide what is the minimal value for
which bob wins when alice bids i  if the value of bob is at least the average value of alice 
given that she bids i  then bob should clearly receive the item  therefore  bobs threshold
will be exactly this expected value of alice  the proof has to handle few subtleties for
which the intuition above does not suffice  like the characterization of the first thresholds in
the optimal modified priority games  see below   thus we will derive the mutually centered
condition from the solution of the optimization problem

the following theorem says that if the valuation of the seller for the item  v    is small
enough  e g   a   the efficient mechanism is a priority game based on xw and y w  which are
mutually centered   otherwise  the optimal welfare can be achieved in a modified priority
game based on x and y 
theorem      for any pair of distribution functions of the bidders valuations  and for

   in particular  p gk  xw   y w   achieves

now  we no longer assume v    a  according to theorem      if the optimal welfare is

we demonstrate the characterization given above by showing an explicit solution for the

    the results are not surprising  since except for the case when one of the bidders bids    we have a priority

proof  according to theorem     optimal welfare is achieved with p gk  x  y   when x  y are
mutually centered  with uniform distributions  this derives the following constraints  for
i  
which the given vectors x  y are the unique solution   ik  xi   yi   yi
yi   xi  x
 
to see how the above constraints are implied  note that the conditional expectation of the
second players value  given that his value is uniformly distributed between yi  and yi   is
exactly yi   yi  
 
and y    x       implying
for example  when k     we have the constraints x      y
 
that x        and y        as in the optimal   bit mechanism from example    the
optimal mutually centered thresholds for k     are  for instance  x                         and

    profit optimal   bidder mechanisms with k possible bids
now  we present profit maximizing   bidder mechanisms  most results in the literature on
profit maximizing auctions assume that the distribution functions of the bidders valuations
are regular  as defined below   when the valuations of all bidders are distributed with the
same regular distribution function  it is well known that vickreys  nd price auction  with
an appropriately chosen reservation price  is profit optimal  vickrey        myerson       
riley   samuelson        with unbounded communication 
definition      myerson        let f be a probability density function  and let f be its
cumulative function  we say that f is regular  if the function
ve v    v 

   f  v 
f  v 

is monotone  strictly increasing function of v  we call the function ve   the virtual valuation
of the bidder 
for example  when the bidders valuations are distributed uniformly on         a bidder
with a valuation v has a virtual valuation of ve v     v    
definition     the virtual surplus in a game is the virtual valuation of the bidder  including the seller     who receives the item 
a key observation in the work of myerson         which we also use  is that in a
bayesian nash equilibrium  the expected profit equals the expected virtual surplus  in interim individually rational equilibria where losing bidders are not getting any surplus   we
use this property to reduce the profit optimization problem to a welfare optimization problem  for which we have already given a full solution  myersons observation was originally
proved for direct revelation mechanisms  we observe here that myersons observation also
holds for auctions with bounded communication  that is  given a k bid mechanism  the
expected profit in every bayesian nash equilibrium equals the expected virtual surplus 
proposition      let g  gn k be a mechanism with a bayesian nash equilibrium s  
 s         sn   and interim individual rationality  then  the expected revenue achieved by s in
g is equal to the expected virtual surplus of s in g 
    the sellers virtual valuation is defined to be his original valuation  v    

   

fiauctions with severely bounded communication

proof  consider the following direct revelation mechanism gd   each player i bids her true
valuation vi   the mechanism calculates si  vi   for every i  and determines the allocation
and payments according to g  an easy observation is that gd is incentive compatible  i e  
truthful bidding is a bayesian nash equilibrium for the players  and interim individually
rational  according to myerson observation for direct revelation mechanisms  the expected
revenue in gd is equal to the expected virtual surplus  however  for every combination
of bids  both mechanism output identical allocations and payments  thus  the expected
revenue and the expected virtual surplus are equal in both mechanisms 
according to theorem      the optimal welfare is achieved in either a priority game
or a modified priority game  in a model where bidders consider their virtual valuations as
their valuations  let m p g e
x  ye  or p g x  y  be the mechanisms which are the candidates to
achieve the optimal welfare  see theorem     for a full characterization   now  consider the
same mechanisms  except each payment e
c in them is replaced by the respective true valuation c   ve   e
c   i e   e
c   ve c     denote these mechanisms by p gk  xr   y r    m p gk  xr   y r   
these mechanisms achieve the optimal profit in our  original  model  note that the distribution functions must be regular  but not necessarily identical  for this reduction to
work 
theorem      when both bidders valuations are distributed with regular distribution functions  the mechanism m p gk  xr   y r   or the mechanism p gk  xr   y r    see definitions above 
achieve the optimal expected profit among all profits achievable in an interim ir bayesianopt
nash equilibrium of a mechanism in g  k  i e   r  k
  
x  ye  and  x  y  defined above  the mechanism
proof  consider the threshold value vectors  e
m p g e
x  ye  is efficient in the model where the bidders consider their virtual valuations as
their valuation  the same proof holds if p g x  y  is the efficient mechanism   the density
function f is regular  and therefore the virtual valuation ve   is strictly increasing  thus 
m p gk  xr   y r    when the bidders use their original valuations  will have exactly the same
allocation for every combination of bids as m p gk  e
x  ye   when the bidders consider their
virtual valuations as their valuations   we conclude that m p gk  xr   y r   achieves the optimal
expected virtual surplus and thus also the optimal profit 
as in the case of welfare optimization  we give an explicit solution for the case of
uniform distribution functions  this is a direct corollary of theorem      note that the
optimal profit is achieved in a modified priority game  this holds since for the uniform
distribution the bidders expected virtual valuation is negative when they bid    so an
efficient mechanism will not sell the item when all bidders bid   
corollary      when the bidders valuations are distributed uniformly on        and v      
the modified priority game m p gk  x  y  achieves the optimal expected profit among all the
profits achievable in interim ir bayesian nash equilibria of mechanisms in g  k   where

   optimal mechanisms for n bidders with two possible bids
in this section we consider games among n bidders where each bidder has   possible bids
 i e   they can send only   bit to the mechanism   we give the characterization of the optimal
mechanisms for general distribution functions  the characterization of the optimal n bidder
mechanism with k possible bids seems to be harder  and it remains an open question  the
difficulty stems from the fact that the monotonicity of the allocation rule does not dictate
the exact allocation rule in the general case  rather  there are many possible allocation
schemes that we cannot rule out before we know the strategies of the bidders    therefore 
it seems that one should solve the involved combinatorial problem of finding the optimal
allocation rule together with finding the optimal payments  priority games with   possible
bids per player can be interpreted as a sequence of take it or leave it offers  the player with
the highest priority in this interpretation is the first player to be offered  if he accepts the
offer  i e   bids    he will receive it  see the work by sandholm and gilpin        for the
analysis of such take it or leave it mechanisms  moreover    bit priority games are actually
a solution to a full information version of the secretary problem  e g   gilbert   mosteller 
      ajtai  megiddo    waarts         a decision maker meets the players  or potential
secretaries to be hired   one after another  and should search for the player with the highest
value  the decision maker knows the underlying probability distributions  the decision 
however  should be made online  a player that does not receive the item upon arrival
will never receive the item 
    the characterization of the optimal mechanisms
we first observe that priority games also maximize the welfare in n bidder games with   possible bids  this is easier to see than in the k possible bids case  by claim     in theorem     
the bidders will use threshold strategies  an efficient mechanism will allocate the item  for


each combination of bids b   to the bidder with the highest
 he bids bi 

when
 expected welfare
given that the distributions are i i d  if xi  xj then e vi vi   xi   b   e vj vj   xj   b 
and e  vi  vi   a  xi      e  vj  vj   a  xj      therefore  ties will be broken according to the
order of the thresholds  if the sellers reservation price v  is high enough  the efficient
mechanism will be a modified priority game   
we now show the characterization of the optimal thresholds for the priority games  we
show that the optimal mechanisms use fully discriminatory payments  the bidder with the
highest priority in the priority game pays the highest payment when she wins  and so forth 
the optimal modified priority game is given by a simple recursive formula  when the seller
allocates the item for when all bids are zero  the constraints become cyclic 
    consider  for example  a   bidder   bid priority game  where the item is allocated to the player with
the second highest priority when all the players bid their highest bid  this mechanism is also monotone
with no identical actions for the players 
    to see this  we must note that in an efficient mechanism the seller will never keep the item when one of
the bidder bids    then  a threshold higher than v  for this bidder will gain a higher welfare

we will now prove that either the mechanism p g   
x   or the mechanism m p g   
y   achieve
the optimal welfare  as the thresholds description shows  the thresholds for the modified
priority game  i e   when the seller keeps the item when all bids are zero  are defined by
a simple  easy to compute recursive formula  the optimality of these thresholds can be
shown by the following intuitive argument  consider a new bidder i that joins a set of i   
bidders  an efficient auction will allocate the item to bidder i if and only if his value is
greater than the optimal welfare achievable from the first i    bidders  therefore  the
threshold for each bidder will equal the optimal welfare gained from the preceding bidders 
and indeed  with probability of    f  yi     bidder is valuation will be greater than the
expected
from the other bidders  yi    and his average contribution will

  welfare attained
be e v v   ym   b     with probability of f  yi    he will not contribute to the optimal
welfare which remains yi    this intuition shows why the profit maximizing thresholds
above  equations      are independent of the number of players  what enables an online
implementation of the profit maximizing auctions 
theorem      when the bidders valuations are distributed with the same distribution func

tion  the mechanism p g

welfare  in particular  when v    a  p g

proof  we already observed that there exists a priority game that achieves the optimal
welfare with threshold strategies  consider a priority game among n bidders  indexed
by their priorities  i e            n    every bidder wins the item if he bids   and

as in section    we characterize the profit optimal mechanism by a reduction to the
welfare optimizing problem  again  the reduction can be performed only for regular distributions  consider the model where bidders take their virtual valuations as their valuations 
let p g   e

theorem      when the bidders valuations are distributed with the same regular distribution function  the mechanism p g   u  or the mechanism m p g   z  achieves the optimal
expected profit among all the profits achievable with a bayesian nash equilibrium and interim ir 
proof  this is a corollary of theorem      the reduction is done as in theorem      and it
is possible due to the regularity of the distribution function 
again  the optimal thresholds for the modified priority game can be given by a simple
recursive formula with an intuitive meaning  the recursion is identical to the welfare optimizing formula  equation     and the only difference is in the value of the first threshold
that should hold y    ve   v     the intuition is that given that the best revenue achievable
from the first i    bidders is yi    with probability f  yi    a new player i will not be
able to pay a higher price  due to the individual rationality restriction  and therefore the
optimal revenue remains yi    when his value is greater than yi    he cannot be charged
more than his average value  e v yi   v  b   
now  we give explicit solutions for the uniform distribution on the support         the
following recursive constraints characterize the efficient and profit optimal mechanisms 
these are the constraints given in theorems     and     for uniform distributions

   asymptotic analysis of the welfare and profit losses
in this section  we measure the performance of the optimal mechanisms presented in earlier
sections  although we did not present a characterization of the optimal mechanisms in the
general model of k possible bids and n bidders  we present here mechanisms for this general
case that are asymptotically optimal  for simplicity  we assume that the valuations range
is         all the results apply for a general range  a  b  which only changes the constants in
our analysis  
we analyze the welfare loss  subsection       the profit loss  subsection       and finally 
in subsection     we measure the profit loss and the welfare loss in   bit mechanism with
n bidders  all the result are asymptotic with respect to the amount of the communication 
except in section     where it is with respect to the number of bidders 
    asymptotic bounds on the welfare loss
the next theorem shows that no matter how the bidders valuations are distributed  we can
always construct mechanisms such that the welfare loss they incur diminishes quadratically
in k  this is true for any number of bidders we fix  when k    n   in particular  the efficient
mechanism presented in theorem     incurs a welfare loss of o  k      the intuition behind
the proof  given the distribution functions of the bidders  we construct a certain threshold
strategy  which will be dominant for all bidders  when using this strategy  each bidder will
bid any bid i with probability smaller than k    this way  the probability that a welfare loss
may occur is o  k     for two players  for instance  a welfare loss will be possible only on the
diagonal of the games matrix   the average welfare loss will also be o  k     resulting in a
total expected loss of o  k     
theorem      for any  fixed  number of bidders n  and for any set of distribution functions
of the bidders valuations  there exist a set of mechanisms gk  gn k  k    n       n           
that incur an expected welfare loss of o  k       these results are implemented in dominant
strategies with ex post individual rationality 
the requirement that k    n  here and in proposition     below  is due to the construction of the symmetric mechanism in the following proof  these results hold even without
this requirement  as shown by an asymmetric construction for a more general setting in the
work of blumrosen and feldman

proof  the proofs idea  we construct a priority game in which all bidders have the same
dominant threshold strategy  such that the probability for a bidder to bid each bid is smaller
than nk   this is done by dividing the density functions of all the bidders to nk intervals with
equal mass  then combining these thresholds to a vector of k threshold values  because the
bidders use the same threshold strategy  a welfare loss is possible only when more than one
bidder bids the highest bid  this observation leads to the upper bound 
 
p
let          n be integers such that ni   i   k     and for every i  i  nk   
 clearly such numbers exist   for every bidder i  let y i    y i        yi i   be a set of threshold
values that divide her distribution function fi to i     segments with the same mass  when
y i      yi i          i e   for every bid j  fi  yj      fi  yj     i     
s
s
let x     ni   y i    v      x    k     be the union of all the threshold values  we add
arbitrary threshold values if the size of x is smaller than k      let x       x         xk      
be a threshold value vector created by ordering the threshold values in x from smallest to
largest  now  consider the n bidder mechanism m p gk  e
t  where e
t    x      x   the threshold
strategy based on x is dominant for all the bidders  with ex post ir  by the construction
  
of the sets y          y n   every bidder will bid any particular bid w p    n
k  
next  we will bound the welfare loss  we divide the possible cases according to the
number of bidders who bid the highest bid  since all the bidders use the same threshold
strategy  if only one bidder bids the highest bid  no welfare loss is incurred  he will definitely
have the highest valuation   if more than   bidder bid the highest bid i  the expected welfare
loss will not exceed xi    xi   for a set of bidders t  n   denote the probability that all
the bidders in t bid i by p r t   i   and the probability that all the bidders not in t have
bids smaller than i by p r n   t   i   thus  the expected welfare loss is smaller than  when

when the valuations of all the bidders are smaller than v    there is no welfare loss  it is

price distortion   the price distortion in our model is the maximum difference between the
prices that different bidders are facing for the item given the others bids  and it can be
bounded above by k     indeed  a small price distortion ensures both that the probability of
an inefficient allocation is small and that the inefficiency is small when it does occur 
theorem     is related to proposition   in the paper by nisan and segal         nisan
and segal showed that discretizing an exactly efficient continuous protocol communicating
d real numbers yields a truly polynomial approximation scheme that is proportional to
d  i e   for any      we can realize an approximation factor of     using a number of
bits which is polynomial in log        here  we discretize a continuous efficient auction
 e g   first price auction   where d is the number of bidders  discretization then achieves an
approximation error that is exponential in the  minus  number of bits sent per bidder  i e  
asymptotically proportional to k    however  here we care about average case approximation
which is even closer  because worst case approximation within an error of  ensures an
average case approximation within    the probability that an error is made is itself in the
order of   
we now show that the asymptotic upper bound above is tight  i e   for some distribution
functions  and in particular  for the uniform distribution  the minimal welfare loss is exactly
proportional to k     we show this for any constant number of bidders 
theorem      assume that the bidders valuations are uniformly distributed and that v   
   then  the efficient   bidder mechanism p gk  x  y  described in corollary     incurs a
 
welfare loss of exactly    k  
    moreover  for any  fixed  number of bidders n and for any
v    there exists a positive constant c such that any mechanism g  gn k incurs a welfare
loss  c  k    
proof  we first prove the first part of the theorem  regarding   bidder mechanisms  note
that the given mechanism can make non optimal allocation only for combinations of bids
that are on the diagonal or on the lower secondary diagonal in the matrix representation
of the   bidder game  i e   when ba   bb or when ba   bb       for such bids  i  j   the
 
overlapping segment of  xi   xi     and  yj   yj     is of size  k 
  given such vector of bids
 i  j   if one of the valuations is not in this overlapping segment  the allocation is optimal
 note that we allocate the item to b on the main diagonal  and to a on the secondary
 
diagonal   the probability that both valuation are in this overlapping range is   k  
  
the expected valuation in our priority game  when both valuation are in this overlapping
segment  is exactly in the middle of this segment  the expected valuation in the optimal
auction  with unbounded communications   restricted to this overlapping interval  will be
 
in the    point of this range  thus  the welfare loss is    of the segment  i e        k 
  thus 
for every vector of bids on the main diagonal or on the secondary diagonal the expected
 
welfare loss is      k  
    there are   k     such vector of bids  thus the total welfare loss
is exactly

 
 
   k   

a similar argument shows that even when the sellers valuation v  is non zero  the welfare
 
loss is asymptotically greater than   k  
    let z         zm be the sizes of the overlapping
segments  only when the valuations of both bidders are greater than v     clearly  m   k

the proof of the second statement is easily derived  consider only the case where bidders
  and   have valuations above      and the rest of the bidders have valuations below      this
occurs with the constant probability of   n   the best a mechanism can do is to always
allocate the item to one of   or    but due to the first part of the theorem  in any   bidder
mechanism a welfare loss of proportional to k   will be incurred  the fact that the valuation
range is           and not        only changes the constant c   this will hold for any opportunity
cost v  of the seller  thus  any mechanism will incur a welfare loss of   k     
note that the same asymptotic results hold even if we restrict attention to symmetric
mechanisms  actually  we prove the upper bound in theorem     by constructing a symmetric mechanism  we can allocate the item to all the bidders who bid the highest bid with
equal probabilities   however  asymmetric mechanisms do incur a strictly smaller welfare
loss than symmetric mechanisms  for example  when the valuations are distributed uni 
formly  the optimal welfare loss is    k  
   by theorem      compared with an optimal

welfare loss of  k   attained by symmetric mechanisms    i e   the welfare loss in asymmetric
mechanisms is about   times better   this observation is interesting in light of the results of
harstad and rothkopf        and wilson         harstad and rothkopf studied symmetric
english auctions  and analyzed the optimal price jumps in such auctions  our results show
that non anonymous prices  i e   different jumps for each bidder  can achieve better results
than symmetric  or anonymous  jumps  we also characterize the optimal price jumps for
such auctions  mutually centered threshold values   wilson also studied only symmetric
priority classes in his model  and also gives a convergence rate of n   for the efficiency loss
 where n is the number of priority classes   we show that asymmetric mechanisms can
incur smaller efficiency loss  although the asymptotic convergence rate is the same 
one obvious drawback of our characterization of the optimal mechanisms is that the
design is not detail free  as in wilsons doctrine   we must know the priors of the
bidders for designing the mechanisms  but can we design a mechanism that regardless of
the distribution functions  will always incur a low welfare loss  the answer is that we
can  but they will not be as efficient as in the commonly known priors case  we observe
that a simple  symmetric mechanism that use equally spaced thresholds  i e   p gk  x       x  
 
x       k    k         k 
k         incurs a welfare loss not greater than k for all possible distribution
functions  it is not hard to verify that this is actually the best that can be done by
detail free mechanism  for any mechanism there exist distribution functions for which
the expected welfare loss is at least in order of k    for severely low communication  the
difference between the detail free mechanisms and prior aware mechanisms  with loss of
    in
we use the fact that when z    z         zm   is in the mth dimensional simplex 
pmthe  left inequality
 
i   zi  m   
    it is easy to show that efficient symmetric mechanisms are similar to priority games  except the item
is allocated with equal probabilities in cases of ties  the thresholds of the bidders simply divide the
valuations range to identical segments  then  it is straightforward to show that the welfare loss is
exactly  k

o  k       may be substantial  note that without communication constraints  socially efficient
results can be achieved by detail free mechanisms  second price  vickrey  auctions 
    asymptotic bounds on the profit loss
as done in theorem      the profit optimization problem can be reduced to a welfareoptimization problem by maximizing the expected virtual surplus 
proposition      assume that the bidders valuations are distributed with regular distribution functions  then  for any number of bidders n  there exist a set of mechanisms gk  gn k
 k    n       n           that incur a profit loss of o  k      the profit loss is compared with
the optimal  individually rational mechanism that is unconstrained in communication 
proof  consider the model where bidders consider their virtual valuations vei  vi   as their
valuations  as the range of the valuations in this model  we take the union of the ranges
of all the bidders virtual valuations  denote this range as       let ge  gn k be the
mechanism that achieves the maximal welfare in this model  due to theorem      ge incurs
a welfare loss smaller than c  k     for some positive constant c  the constant takes into
account the size of the virtual valuations range      let g be the mechanism with the
same allocation as in ge  only each payment qei for bidder i in ge is replaced with qi   vei    qei  
in g  i e   qei   vei  qi    since each vei is non decreasing  by their regularity   the allocation
rules in g and ge are identical for every bids combination  thus  g achieves the maximal
expected virtual surplus  and the loss of expected virtual surplus is smaller than c  k     the
proposition follows 
again  this upper bound is asymptotically tight  with the uniform distribution  any
mechanism incurs a profit loss of   k      this result is derived from theorem     using
similar arguments as in proposition     
proposition      assume that the bidders valuations are distributed uniformly  then  for
any  fixed  number of bidders n  there exists a positive constant c such that any mechanism
g  gn k incurs a profit loss  c  k    
so far  we assumed that the bidders valuations are drawn from statistically independent distributions  we now point out that the relaxation to general joint distributions is
non interesting in our model  specifically  we can show that the trivial priority game for
which all the bidders use the threshold strategy based on the vector x       k    k         k 
k     
always incurs an expected welfare loss smaller than k    and no mechanism can do asymptotically better  in other words  there exists some joint distribution function for which any
mechanism incurs a welfare loss proportional to k   
    asymptotic bounds for a growing number of bidders
in this subsection  we fix the size of communication allowed  to two possible bids   and we
show asymptotic bounds as a function of the number of bidders rather than the amount
of communication  unfortunately  we have been able to prove such bounds only for the
uniform distribution

when we restrict our attention to symmetric mechanisms  the solution is simple  using
 
the threshold x   n n   for all bidders  achieves the maximal expected welfare  and we
  
have the exact formula showing that the optimal welfare loss is o  logn
n   
we now show that optimal asymmetric mechanisms incur asymptotically smaller welfare
and profit losses of o  n     these mechanisms fully discriminate between the agents

when a bidder wins after bidding    the maximal welfare loss is    xi   when all bidders

   sequential auctions
in sequential mechanisms  bidders split their bids into smaller messages and send them
in an alternating order  in this section  we show that sequential mechanisms can achieve
better results  however  the additional gain  in the amount of communication  is only up
to a linear factor in the number of bidders 
a sequential mechanism is a mechanism in which each bidder may send several separate
messages  in some order  not necessarily in a round robin fashion   at each stage  each
bidder knows what messages the other bidders have sent so far  after all the messages
are sent  the mechanism determines the allocation and payments  we study a general
framework where the auctioneer can adaptively determine the order of the messages and
their sizes according to the message history  the auctioneer can also use randomization in
its decisions  we measure the communication volume in a mechanism by the number of
bits actually transmitted 
definition     the communication requirement of the mechanism is the maximal amount
of bits which may be transmitted by the bidders in this mechanism 
a strategy for a bidder in a sequential mechanism is a threshold strategy if in each stage
i of the game the bidder determines the message she sends by comparing her valuation to
some threshold values x       xi  where this bidder has i     possible bids in stage i  
example    the following sequential mechanism has a communication requirement of  
 see figure      alice sends one bit to the mechanism first  bob  knowing alices bid  also
sends one bit  when alice bids    bob wins if he bids   and pays      if he bids zero alice
wins and pays zero  when alice bids    bob also wins when he bids    but now he pays     
if he bids zero  alice wins again  but now she pays     
it is easy to see that this mechanism has a bayesian nash equilibrium   that achieves
an expected welfare of        we saw that the efficient simultaneous mechanism with a

    in the priority games based on the thresholds

communication requirement of   bits is        see section     we conclude that sequential
mechanisms can gain more efficiency than simultaneous mechanisms 
note that throughout the paper we searched for optimal mechanisms among all the
mechanisms with bayesian nash equilibria  but we managed to implement this optimum
in dominant strategy  in sequential mechanisms it is less likely to find dominant strategy
implementations  thus our above example uses bayesian nash implementation  our result below  however  do not assume any particular equilibrium concept in the sequential
mechanisms 
how significant is the extra gain from sequential mechanisms over simultaneous mechanisms  the following theorem states for every sequential mechanism with a communication
requirement of m there exists a simultaneous mechanism that achieves at least the same
welfare with a communication requirement of nm  where n is the number of bidders     
note that in general  e g   kushilevitz   nisan         multi round protocols can reduce
the communication by an exponential factor  we observe that the gain from sequential
mechanism is actually even smaller  in many environments  all messages are sent to a centralized authority  auctioneer   therefore  extra bits of communication will be required to
inform the bidders about the previous messages of the other bidders  the following theorem
holds for any order of transmission and any size of the sub messages  even if these values
are adaptively determined according to previous messages 
the goal of this section is to show that the gain from sequential auctions  compared
to simultaneous auctions  is mild  we do not offer a comprehensive analysis of this case 
not present welfare maximizing and revenue maximizing auctions  several recent papers
studied different aspects of sequential auctions with similar constraints  sandholm and
gilpin        analyzed sequential auctions designed as sequences of take it or leave it offers 
a paper by kress and boutilier        studied sequential single item auctions with discrete
price increment  where information can be used in subsequent stages  the work of parkes
       studied information elicitation in simultaneous and sequential auctions when the
values are uncertain 
first  we observe that we can assume that the welfare maximizing strategies of the
bidders are threshold strategies  again  we show that for each message chosen by bidder
i  the welfare is a linear function in vi   to show this we should use a backward induction
argument  in the last message  the bidders will clearly use thresholds  therefore  in previous
stages the welfare  as a function of vi fixing the strategies of all the other bidders  is a linear
combination of linear functions which is itself a linear function  the maximum over linear
function is a piecewise linear function and the thresholds will be its crossing points 
theorem      let h be an n bidder sequential mechanism with a communication requirement m  then  there exists a simultaneous mechanism g that achieves  with dominant
strategies  at least the same expected welfare as h  with a communication requirement smaller
than nm 
proof  consider an n bidder mechanism h with a bayesian nash equilibrium  and with
communication requirement m  for simplicity  assume n divides m  i e   each bidder sends
    note that in sequential mechanisms the bidders must be informed about the bits the other bidders sent
 we do not take this into account in our analysis   so the total gain in communication can be very mild

bits   there exists a profile s    s         sn   of threshold strategies that achieves the
optimal welfare in h  first  we give an upper bound for the total number of thresholds
each bidder uses in the game  for a bidder i  let  i        ki i be the  positive  sizes of the ki
messages she sends in h  let ji     j  ki   be the number of bits that were sent by all
the bidders  including i   before bidder i sends his jth message  when choosing a message
i
of size ji   the bidder uses up to  j    thresholds  in each stage  every bidder can use a
different set of thresholds  for every
history of the game  thus  for sending her jth

message she can use up to  
     different thresholds  summing up  bidder i uses

pki  i  i
at most t  i    j     j   j    thresholds  now  assume  w l o g   that the bidders are
numbered according to the order they send their last messages  i e   k     k           knn   
recall that the total number
 of bits sent
 by the bidders is m  when sending the last message 
m k

bidder   thus uses  
 
      m different thresholds  since each messages have
  

m  k

 
a non zero size  bidder   will have at most  
  k        m  different thresholds
for the last stage  similarly  every bidder i can use at most  mi   thresholds for his last
message  but therefore  for her before last message bidder i uses at most  mi  different
thresholds  the worst case occurs when one bidder sends one bit between bidder is   last
messages   it follows that the maximal number of different thresholds for bidder i is

now  let g be a simultaneous mechanisms in which each bidder simply informs the
mechanism between which of the thresholds he uses in h his valuation lies  clearly  for every
set of valuations of the bidders  this allocation in g and h is identical  due to the inequality
above  m  i     bits suffice for bidder i to express this p
number  we conclude that the
number of bits sent by all the bidders in g is smaller than  ni    m  i        nm  n n  
 
 
finally  we mention that we can set the allocation scheme and the payment scheme in
g such that the threshold strategies based on the thresholds in s will be an equilibrium and
the expected welfare will not decrease  as shown in section    we turn this mechanism to be
monotone by allocating the item deterministically to the bidder with the highest expected
value  in each combination of bids  a dominant strategy equilibrium follows 
this analysis holds for any order and sizes of the bidder messages  even when they
depend on the history of the messages  since counting the number of thresholds can be still
done in the same way 

   future work
this paper concerns single item auctions that are severely limited in their ability to elicit
information from the bidders  only a few possible bids are available for each player although
each player may have a continuum of types  we give a comprehensive analysis of such
   

fiblumrosen  nisan   segal

auctions  and present welfare  and revenue maximizing mechanisms under these restrictions 
we asymptotically analyze the losses in these optimal mechanisms compared to auctions
with unrestricted communication  and we also compare them to auctions where the bidders
messages are sent sequentially 
we leave several questions open  the most obvious problem is the exact characterization
of the optimal mechanisms for an arbitrary number of players and an arbitrary number of
possible bids  this paper fully characterized the optimal   bidder k bid auctions and the
optimal n bidder   bid auctions  but only presented asymptotically optimal results for the
general case of n players and k bids  also  future work may provide an asymptotic analysis
of the welfare  and the revenue loss as a function of both k and n  we provided a separate
asymptotic analysis by each of these variables  
an additional interesting question is regarding the gain from allocating the bits of communication non uniformly among the agents  while in simple domains  like   bidder simultaneous auctions  uniform distribution of the communication seems to be the best option 
this would be unclear  and probably untrue  in more general settings  in addition  it seems
that the concepts and methods presented in this work extend to more general frameworks 
like general single parameter mechanism design settings and mechanism design with interdependent values  some extensions are given in the recent work by blumrosen   feldman 
      
finally  this work presented a partial study of sequential auctions with communication
restrictions  this kind of auctions captures many reasonable real life settings  and seems
to be analytically challenging  we did not present a characterization of the optimal sequential mechanisms in this paper  nor a direct comparison of simultaneous and sequential
mechanisms with the same communication requirement  future work may also compare
prior aware sequential mechanisms and detail free sequential mechanisms  a similar comparison for simultaneous mechanisms showed that detail free mechanism can only achieve
trivial results   another possible extension would be to take an integrated approach and
study settings with partially known priors

strategy  and the welfare will not decrease 
assume si is not a threshold strategy  therefore  there must be        a  b        
 such that si      si      m but si       m  where m is some bid of player i   we will
show that a strategy vector s identical to s   except that for every such  si      m  we
have that w g  s   w g  s   
denote the probability that all players except i bids bi as p r bi    thus  the expected
welfare from a game g given that bidder i with valuation vi bids m and that the other
players use strategies si is

note that this expected welfare is a linear function of vi   and we denote it by h m   vi  
t m   the constants h m  and t m  depend on the bid m  
we know that s achieve optimal welfare in g and that si      m  therefore  there is
no other bid l such that if si      l  the expected welfare will increase  i e

similarly  because si      m 
l    m

because  is a convex combination of  and   and due to equations    and    
l    m h m      t m   h l      t l 
thus  the expected welfare for player i  given vi     is maximal when she bids m  therefore  when modifying si such that si      m the total expected welfare will not decrease 
we can repeat this process until si becomes a threshold strategy   
a   optimal mechanisms use all the possible bids

let x    vb b   b     and let x
e       x    x    x         xk        we will create a new
game ge by adding the line  b       b  as the first line  it is easy to see that the allocation
 
in g and ge is identical in all rows except the new one  when va      x    and vb      y   
ge allocates the item to b where g allocated the item to a  the distribution functions are

x    evb  vb     vb  y     the expected welfare has strictly increased  for higher bids of
bidder b  the allocation in the first row will clearly be efficient now  therefore no welfare
loss was incurred 
case    the row  b       b  does not appear in gs game matrix 
due to the monotonicity  g must have two rows i and i     and two columns j and j    
such that we allocate the item to b when the bids are  i  j    i  j      and to a when the
bids are  i      j    i      j       we will create a mechanism ge by adding a row i  identical
to row i     except that b wins in index j      the new threshold is constructed as follows 
if e vb  yj  vb  yj       xi    
 
 
let xi     e vb  yj  vb  yj      and let x

let xi   e vb  yj    vb  yj     and let x

yj      e va  xi    va  xi       xi     it follows that the expected welfare has strictly
increased in the entry  i    j       and has not decreased in all other entries 
a   optimal symmetric   bit mechanisms
following are the optimal   bit   bidder mechanisms assuming independent uniform distribution for all values  the socially efficient symmetric   bit mechanism achieves an expected
welfare of       compared to       that is achieved in an asymmetric   bit mechanism and
    that is achieved with unrestricted communication  similarly  the revenue maximizing
symmetric   bit mechanism below achieves an expected profit of       compared to      with
  bit symmetric mechanisms and              with unrestricted communication  secondprice auction with a reserve price  
the following mechanism achieves the optimal welfare among all the symmetric   bit
mechanisms 
 
 

 
w p     a wins  pays  
w p     b wins  pays  
a wins and pays   

 
b wins and pays

a wins  pays   
b wins  pays   

proving the social efficiency of the mechanism can be done by the following idea  first
note that a symmetric  efficient mechanism will clearly allocate the item to the player that
