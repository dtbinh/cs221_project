   introduction
multiagent environments often inhabited heterogeneous  selfish agents  continually
interacting sharing common goals  settings  agents may diverse
even conflicting preferences  therefore  reaching consensus among agents long

celebrated gibbard satterthwaite theorem  gibbard        satterthwaite       
establishes deterministic voting protocol non dictatorial  
elections agent better voting untruthfully  consequently  possible
design nonmanipulable voting system guarantee voters act honestly 
fortunately  reasonable make assumption agents computationally bounded  therefore  although principle agent may able manipulate
election  computation required may infeasible  motivated researchers
study computational complexity manipulating voting protocols  indeed 
demonstrated several voting protocols n p hard manipulate single
voter  bartholdi  tovey    trick      a  bartholdi   orlin         hereinafter mainly
focus attention setting multiple manipulators collude order achieve
certain outcome  setting  manipulation even harder  known
coalitional manipulation problem n p hard numerous voting protocols  even
number candidates constant 
results suggest computational complexity may cure malady
called manipulation  computer science  though  notion hardness usually
considered sense worst case complexity  indeed  results complexity
manipulation use n p hardness complexity measure  therefore  could still
case instances problem easy manipulate  put differently 
strategic voter may usually succeed finding beneficial manipulation  efficiently 
even problem hard worst case  so  truly significant issue
average case complexity manipulations 
sadly  far attempts design voting protocol resistant manipulations
average case failed  suggests manipulation problem inherently
easy average case pushes us analytically support claim  must
characterize settings protocols easily manipulated average case 
relatively little known theory average case complexity exists  trevisan        
theory introduces concept distributional problems  defines reduction
distributional problems is  known average case complete
problems  however  goal existing theory define problem hard
average case  provide criteria deciding problem easy 
paper  engage novel average case analysis  based criteria propose 
coming interesting distribution problem instances respect
average case complexity computed difficult task  solution may controversial  analyze problems whose instances distributed respect junta
distribution  distribution must satisfy several conditions   arguably  guarantee focuses instances harder manipulate  consider protocol
susceptible manipulation polynomial time algorithm usually
manipulate it  probability failure  when instances distributed according
junta distribution  must inverse polynomial  algorithm known heuristic
polynomial time algorithm 
use new methods analytically establish following result  important
family voting protocols  called scoring protocols  susceptible coalitional manipulation
   dictatorial protocol  agent dictates outcome regardless others choices
