abstract
merging operators aim at defining the beliefs goals of a group of agents from the
beliefs goals of each member of the group  whenever an agent of the group has preferences
over the possible results of the merging process  i e   the possible merged bases   she can
try to rig the merging process by lying on her true beliefs goals if this leads to a better
merged base according to her point of view  obviously  strategy proof operators are highly
desirable in order to guarantee equity among agents even when some of them are not
sincere  in this paper  we draw the strategy proof landscape for many merging operators
from the literature  including model based ones and formula based ones  both the general
case and several restrictions on the merging process are considered 

   introduction
merging operators aim at defining the beliefs goals of a group of agents from the beliefs goals of each member of the group  though beliefs and goals are distinct notions 
merging operators can typically be used for merging either beliefs or goals  thus  most of
the logical properties from the literature  revesz              konieczny   pino perez       
      for characterizing rational belief merging operators can be used for characterizing as
well rational goal merging operators 
whatever beliefs or goals are to be merged  there are numerous situations where agents
have preferences on the possible results of the merging process  i e   the merged bases   as
far as goals are concerned  an agent is surely satisfied when her individual goals are chosen
as the goals of the group  in the case of belief merging  an agent can be interested in
imposing her beliefs to the group  i e   convincing the other agents   especially because
the result of a further decision stage at the group level may depend on the beliefs of the
group 
so  as soon as an agent participates to a merging process  the strategy proofness problem
has to be considered  the question is  is it possible for a given agent to improve the result of
the merging process with respect to her own point of view by lying on her true beliefs goals 
given that she knows  or at least she assumes  the beliefs goals of each agent of the group
and the way beliefs goals are merged 
as an illustration  let us consider the following scenario of goal merging  that will be
used as a running example in the rest of the paper

example   three friends  marie  alain and pierre want to spend their summer holidays
together  they have to determine whether they will go to the seaside and or to the mountains  or to stay at home  and also to determine whether they will take a long period of
vacations or not  the goals of marie are to go to the seaside and to the mountains if it is
for a long period  otherwise she wants to go to the mountains  only  or to stay at home  the
goals of alain are to go to the seaside if it is for a long period  or to go to the mountains
if it is for a short period  finally  pierre is only interested in going to the seaside for a
long period  otherwise he prefers to stay at home  if one uses a common merging operator
for defining the choice of the group   then the goals of the group will be either to go to the
seaside for a long period  or to go to the mountains or to stay at home for a short period 
accordingly  the group may choose to go to the seaside  only  for a long period  which is not
among the goals of marie  however  if marie lies and claims that  for a short period  she
wants to go to the mountains only  or to stay at home  then the result of the merging process
will be different  indeed  in this case  the goals of the group will be to go to the mountains
for a short period  or to stay at home  which corresponds to the goals of marie 
similarly  the strategy proofness issue has to be considered in many belief merging scenarios  just because rational decision making typically takes account for the true state
of the world  when agents have conflicting beliefs about it  belief merging can be used
to determine what is the true state of the world for the group  manipulating the belief
merging process is a way for an agent to change the resulting beliefs at the group level so as
to make them close to her own beliefs  as a consequence  the decisions made by the group
may also change and become closer to those the agent would made alone  for instance 
assume that the three friends agree that the mountains must be avoided when the weather
is bad  if the beliefs of the group is that the weather is bad  then the decision to go to
the mountains will be given up  if pierre believes that the weather is bad  then he may
be tempted to make the weather is bad accepted at the group level  therefore  a collective
decision will be not to go to the mountains 
there are several multi agent settings in which some agents exchange information and
must make individual decisions based on their beliefs  in many scenarios  agents are tempted
to get an informational advantage over other agents  which can be achieved by gathering as
much information as possible and by hiding their own ones  indeed  being better informed
may help an agent making better decisions than the other agents of the group  for instance 
shoham and tennenholtz        investigate non cooperative computation  each agent delivers some piece of information  truthfully or not   all such pieces are used to compute
the value of a  commonly known  function  and this value is given back to the agents  the
aim of each agent is to get the true value of the function  and if possible to be the only
one to get it  in the work of shoham and tennenholtz         information is considered at
an abstract level  assuming that information represent beliefs and the function is a belief
merging operator  each agent wants to get the true merged base and possibly to be the only
one to get it  contrastingly  in other scenarios  where decisions have to be made collectively
and are based on the beliefs of the group  agents are satisfied if the beliefs of the group
   formally  the model based operator  dh     using the hamming distance and the sum aggregation function  defined in section

are close to their own beliefs  in this paper  we focus on such an issue  which has to be
addressed in many everyday life situations  let us illustrate this on an example 
example   there is a position available in some university  the committee in charge
of the recruitment has to determine the right profile for this position  four criteria are
considered  research skills  teaching skills  relationship skills  and the past positions of the
candidate  suppose that a member of the committee believes that the important criteria for
the job are research skills and relationship skills  and that it is better to recruit a candidate
who got a good position in the past  she will be pleased by the recruitment if the group shares
her beliefs about the right profile  so she can be tempted to manipulate the merging process
in order to achieve such a situation 
determining whether a belief goal merging operator is strategy proof  and in the negative case  identifying restrictions under which strategy proofness can be ensured is thus an
important issue  indeed  merging operators are intended to characterize the beliefs goals
of a group of agents  from the beliefs goals of each agent from the group  obviously  this
objective cannot be reached if the agents do not report their true beliefs goals  which
can easily be the case when manipulable merging operators are used  since agents will be
tempted to manipulate the process in such a case  
since merging operators are typically used in artificial systems  one can wonder whether
strategy proofness is really a relevant issue in this context  the answer actually depends
on the sophistication of the agents under consideration  thus  in a distributed database
setting  the  low level  agents  i e   the databases  have typically no evaluation preference
on the merged base  and the strategy proofness issue does not make sense  it is not the
same story when the agents have goals and reasoning capacities  in this case  it cannot be
discarded that some agents will be able to foresee weakenesses in the aggregation process
and to exploit them for their own benefits  when high level artificial agents are involved 
the strategy proofness problem is even more stricking than in the case of human agents
because of the superior computational abilities of artificial systems 
the strategy proofness issue has been studied for years in the domain of social choice
theory  arrow  sen    suzumura         an important objective is to design preference
aggregation procedures  and  in particular  voting procedures  which are strategy proof  a
very famous result  known as gibbard sattherwaite theorem  is that this objective cannot
be reached in an absolute manner  under a number of sensible requirements  no strategyproof voting procedure may exist  gibbard        satterthwaite         strategy proofness
can only be achieved by relaxing some of those requirements  which is enough to escape
from gibbard sattherwaite theorem  we shall return to this topic in section   where the
connections between belief merging and preference aggregation will be considered in more
depth 
the very objective of this paper is to draw the strategy proofness landscape for many
merging operators from the literature  including model based ones and formula based ones 
we focused on operators for merging bases that are sets of propositional formulas  where no
priorities between the bases are available  the  classical  propositional logic framework can
be argued as a representation setting expressive enough for many ai scenarios  furthermore 
it is natural to investigate first the key problems raised by aggregation and manipulation in
this simple setting  before considering more sophisticated logics  for each operator under

consideration  we aim at determining whether it is strategy proof in the general case  and
under some restrictions on the merging process  including the number of agents and the
presence of integrity constraints  and on the set of available strategies for the agents 
the rest of the paper is organized as follows  in section    some formal preliminaries are
provided  in section    the definitions of the main propositional merging operators from the
literature are recalled  several definitions of strategy proofness based on a general notion of
satisfaction index are given in section   and our strategy proofness results are reported in
section    they are discussed in section    then  connections with social choice theory
and other related works are pointed out in section    just before the conclusion  proofs are
reported at the end of the paper 

   formal preliminaries
we consider a propositional language l defined from a finite  and non empty  set of propositional variables p and the standard connectives  including    the boolean constant always
true  and   the boolean constant always false 
an interpretation  or world   is a total function from p to         denoted by a bit
vector whenever a strict total order on p is specified  the set of all interpretations is noted
w  an interpretation  is a model of a formula   l if and only if it makes it true in the
usual truth functional way 
   denotes the set of models of formula   i e           w          in order to
avoid too heavy notations  we identify each interpretation  with the canonical term on p
which has  as its unique model  for instance  if p    a  b  and  a        b        is
identified with the term a  b 
a formula  from l is consistent if and only if          is a logical consequence of a
formula   noted      if and only if         two formulas are logically equivalent   
if and only if they share the same models 
a belief goal base k denotes the set of beliefs goals of an agent  it is a finite and
consistent set of propositional formulas  interpreted conjunctively vwhen k is a belief goal
b denotes the singleton base containing the conjunction k of all formulas from
base  k
k  a base is said to be complete if and only if it has exactly one model  each belief goal
base k characterizes a bipartition of the set of all interpretations  the models of k are the
interpretations which are acceptable for the agent  and the countermodels are not  when
k is a belief base  an interpretation  is acceptable when there is enough evidence that  is
the true state of the world  when k is a goal base   is acceptable when it is sufficiently
desired  such a bipartition can be considered as an approximation of the full belief goal
preference structure of the corresponding agent  in the belief case   is at least as preferred
as    means that the fact that  is the true state of the world is at least as plausible as
the fact that    is the true state of the world  in the goal case   is at least as preferred as
   means that the fact that  would be the true state of the world is at least as desired
as the fact that    would be the true state of the world 
a belief goal profile e is associated with the group of n agents involved in the merging
process  it is a non empty multi set  bag  of belief goal bases e    k            kn    hence
different agents are allowed to exhibit identical bases   note that profiles are non ordered
 multi  sets  thus  the profile representation of groups of agents induces an anonymity prop

of the merging process only depends on the bases themselves  i e   exchanging the bases of

the associated strict ordering defined by       w    e    if and only if  e    and
    e  
the result of the merging of  the bases from  a profile e with the merging operator   
under the integrity constraints  is the base  noted    e   called the merged base  the
integrity constraints consist of a consistent formula  or  equivalently  a  finite  consistent
conjunction of formulas  the merged base has to satisfy  it may represent some physical laws 
some norms  etc    in other words  models of the merged base are models of the integrity
constraints 

   merging operators
we recall in this section the two main families of merging operators from the literature  the
first family is defined by a selection of some interpretations  model based operators   the
second family is defined by a selection of some formulas in the union of the bases  formulabased operators   for more details on those two families  see for example  konieczny  lang 
  marquis        
    model based operators
the first family is based on the selection of some models of the integrity constraints  the
closest ones to the profile  closeness is usually defined from a notion of distance and an
aggregation function  revesz        konieczny   pino perez              lin   mendelzon 
      liberatore   schaerf        
definition    pseudo distances 
 a pseudo distance between interpretations is a total function d   w  w   r  s t 
for any             w  d          d         and d            if and only if        
 a distance between interpretations is a pseudo distance that satisfies the triangular
inequality              w  d         d           d            
two widely used distances between interpretations are dalal distance  dalal        
denoted dh   that is the hamming distance between interpretations  the number of propositional atoms on which the two interpretations differ   and the drastic distance  denoted
  

fieveraere  konieczny   marquis

dd   that is one of the simplest pseudo distances one can define  it gives   if the two interpretations are the same one  and   otherwise 
definition    aggregation functions  an aggregation function f is a total function associating a nonnegative real number to every finite tuple of nonnegative real numbers s t 
for any x            xn   x  y  r   
 if x  y  then f  x            x          xn    f  x            y          xn

widely used functions are the max  revesz        konieczny   pino perez         the

leximax gm ax  konieczny   pino perez              
the chosen distance between interpretations induces a distance  between an interpretation and a base  which in turn gives a distance between an interpretation and a profile 
using the aggregation function  this latter distance gives the needed notion of closeness represented by a pre order on w induced by e  noted e   such a pre order can be interpreted
as a plausibility ordering associated with the merged base 
definition    distance based merging operators  let d be a pseudo distance between
interpretations and f be an aggregation function  the result  d f
  e  of the merging of e
given the integrity constraints  is defined by 
 
 
  d f
  e     min     e                      e  

where the pre order e on w induced by e is defined by 
  e    if and only if d   e   d      e   where
 d   e    fke  d   k    where
 d   k    min    k d        
observe that dd f    e  would be a more correct notation than d   e   however  since
there is no ambiguity in the choice of the function f and the distance between interpretations
d in the following  we prefer the lighter notation d   e  
let us step back to the example given in the introduction in order to illustrate modelbased merging operators 
example   consider the set p with three propositional variables l long period   s easide 
and m ountains   taken in this order  the goals of the three agents are then given by the
following bases   k                       maries wishes    k                  alains wishes 
and  k                  pierres wishes   there is no integrity constraint       
   abusing words since it is not a distance from the mathematical standpoint

    formula based operators
the other main family of merging operators gather the so called formula based operators
or syntax based operators  formula based operators are based on the selection of consistent subsets of formulas in the union of the bases of the profile e  several operators are
obtained by letting vary the selection criterion  the result of the merging process is the
set of consequences that can be inferred from all selected subsets  baral  kraus  minker   
subrahmanian        rescher   manor        konieczny         for these operators  the
syntactic form of the bases may easily influence the result of the merging process  replacb              n   may

lead to change the corresponding merged base  while this is not the case for model based
operators

all consistent m that satisfy 
 m  k      and

when maximality must be taken with respect to cardinality  instead of set inclusion   we
shall use the notation maxconscard  k

observe that set theoretic union  and not multi set union  is used here 
the following operators have been defined so far  baral  kraus    minker        baral

 otherwise 
those operators clearly select as much formulas as they can from the union of the bases 
under the consistency requirement  the differences between them lie in the meaning of
as much  those operators were defined by baral et al          except  c  which is a
modification of  c  that ensures consistency  indeed  unlike the other operators listed here 
c  operator
 c 
 may generate inconsistent merged bases  as the empty disjunction   a  
has also been introduced by baral et al          and shown equivalent to  c   this is why
it is not listed above   an important drawback of those operators is that they do not take
account for the sources from which the formulas are issued   nevertheless  they have an
appealing  simple definition 
to illustrate the behaviour of formula based operators  let us step back to the example
given in the introduction  since the absence of constraints makes the operators  c     c 
and  c  coincide  we shall add the following constraint     l  s  i e   it turns out that
the group will have to take holidays for a long period and that they cannot go to the seaside 
example   suppose that marie  alain and pierres goals are encoded by the following
bases  k     l  s  l  m   k     l  s  s  m   and k     l  s  m   with the
integrity constraints    l  s  maxcons e    contains two sets   l  m  s  m  and
c 
c 
c 
 m   we get  c 
  e        e        e   l  s  m  and    e    
the syntax sensitivity of those operators is due to the fact that the comma symbol
  which appears in the expression of the bases  is a specific  yet not truth functional 
connective  konieczny  lang    marquis        that is usually not equivalent to standard
conjunction in the formula based framework  such operators may easily lead to merged
bases which differ from their counterparts where commas are replaced by conjunctions in
the input bases  for example  with       k     a  b   k      a  b   and k

remark   observe that  c  is equivalent to the model based operator dd     dd  gm ax  
c
indeed   c  returns the disjunction of the maximal  for cardinality  consistent subsets of
the profile under the constraints  this is exactly what the operator dd     dd  gm ax
achieves since it amounts to define the set of models of the merged base as the set of interpretations that satisfy the constraints and a maximal number of bases of the profile  i e  
the interpretations that are models of a maximal  for cardinality  consistent subset of the
profile under the constraints

   strategy proofness
the strategy proofness issue for a merging operator can be stated as follows  is it possible
for a given agent to improve the result of the merging process with respect to her own
point of view by lying on her true beliefs goals  given that she knows the beliefs goals of
each agent of the group and the way beliefs goals are merged  if this question can be
answered positively  then the operator is not strategy proof  the agent may benefit from
being untruthful   thus  a merging operator is not strategy proof if one can find a profile
e    k            kn   which represents the bases of the other agents  an integrity constraint  
and two bases k and k   s t  the result of the merging of e and k   is better for the agent
than the result of the merging of e with her true base k  called the initial base  
definition    strategy proofness  let i be a satisfaction index  i e   a total function
from l  l to ir 
 a profile e is said to be manipulable by a base k for i given a merging operator  and
an integrity constraint  if and only if there exists a base k   such that i k    e t
 k         i k    e t  k    
 a merging operator  is strategy proof for i if and only if there are no integrity
constraint  and profile e    k            kn   such that e is manipulable for i 
given two bases  interpreted conjunctively  k  k   the value of i k  k   is intended to
indicate how much a base k is close to the merged base k   the need for such satisfaction
indexes comes from the fact that the only information given by each agent is her own base
k  if the full preference structure over sets of interpretations were available for each agent

as an additional input  e g   under the form of a utility function   then one could use it to
define strategy proofness directly for a given agent  as it is done in social choice theory 
arrow et al         and not in a uniform way for all agents  this explains why we call i a
satisfaction index and not a utility function 
clearly  there are many different ways to define the satisfaction of an agent given a
merged base  while many ad hoc definitions can be considered  we consider the following
three indexes which are  according to us  the most meaningful ones when no additional
information about the agents are available  as far as we know  this is the first time such
indexes are considered in the context of pure propositional merging 
the first two indexes are drastic ones  they range to         so the agent is either fully
satisfied or not satisfied at all 
definition    weak drastic index 

 
idw  k  k    
 

if k  k is consistent 
otherwise 

this index takes value   if the result of the merging process  noted k in the definition  is consistent with the agents base  k   and   otherwise  it means that the agent is
considered fully satisfied as soon as its beliefs goals are consistent with the merged base 
definition    strong drastic index 

ids  k  k    

 
 

if k    k 
otherwise 

this index takes value   if the agents base is a logical consequence of the result of the
merging process  and   otherwise  in order to be fully satisfied  the agent must impose her
beliefs goals to the whole group 
the last index is not a boolean one  leading to a more gradual notion of satisfaction 
the more compatible the merged base with the agents base the more satisfied the agent 
the compatibility degree of k with k is the  normalized  number of models of k that
are models of k as well

fithe strategy proofness landscape of merging

   consider a merging operator  that generates only consistent bases   if it is strategyproof for ip   then it is strategy proof for ids  
on the other hand  it is easy to prove that strategy proofness for idw and strategyproofness for ids are logically independent in the general case  an operator can be strategyproof for one of them without being strategy proof for the other  and it can be strategy proof
for both of them or for neither

table    dh   is not strategy proof for ids  
in the rest of this paper  we shall focus on those three indexes  idw   ids and ip   note
that investigating other indexes can be interesting  in particular  the probabilistic index
can be viewed as a rough measure of similarity between the bases  could more complex
similarity measures between sets  see e g   tversky        also prove useful to define other
sensible indexes is an interesting question that we let for further research 

   strategy proofness results
in the general case  both the family of model based operators and the family of formulabased operators are not strategy proof for the three indexes we consider  this means that
there are operators from those families which are not strategy proof  however  imposing
further restrictions may lead to some strategy proofness results  considering them in a
systematic way allows us to draw the strategy proofness landscape for both families 
in the following  we consider four natural restrictions for the merging process  as listed
below 
   i e     e  is always consistent 

  

fieveraere  konieczny   marquis

 a first restriction concerns the number of bases to be merged  the question is the
following  does the number of bases involved in the merging process have an influence
on the strategy proofness of an operator  in general  we can answer positively to
this question  more precisely  there is a distinction between the cases   e      and
  e       in some situations  no manipulation is possible with two bases  while
with more bases  it becomes possible  since a base     typically plays the role of a
neutral element for all the operators we consider  i e      e      e t       if an
operator is not strategy proof for profiles with n bases  then it is not strategy proof
for profiles with m   n bases 
 a second parameter is the completeness of the beliefs goals of the agent who aims at
manipulating  in some cases  having such strong beliefs goals renders any manipulation impossible  working with complete bases  i e   singleton sets of models  makes
the merging process close to a uninominal vote  i e   a vote for a unique interpretation 
 a third significant parameter is the presence of integrity constraints  on the one hand 
having nontrivial integrity constraints        can make a manipulation possible 
while it is not the case when no integrity constraints are considered  and the converse
also holds 
 another restriction bears on the available manipulations  in the general case the untruthful agent is free to reporting any base  even if it is quite far from her true base 
however  there are numerous situations where the other agents participating to the
merging process have some information about her true base  in these cases  the agents
have to report some bases close to the real ones  two particular manipulations will
be studied  erosion manipulation when the agent pretends to believe desire more that
she does  the agent gives only some parts of its models   and dilatation manipulation
when the agent pretends to believe desire less that she does  the agent gives only
parts of its countermodels  
    model based operators
the first result is that there is no general strategy proofness result  i e   for any aggregation
function and any distance  for model based operators  this is not very surprising when
one reminds the existence of gibbard satterthwaite theorem  which states that there is no
good strategy proof preference aggregation method  see section    
however  some quite general strategy proofness results can be obtained  the following
theorem gives some of them  organized from the most general one  for any aggregation
function when the drastic distance dd is considered   to more specific ones  for any distance
d when the aggregation function is   
theorem  
 let f be any aggregation function  dd  f is strategy proof for ip   idw and ids  
 let d be any distance  provided that only two bases are to be merged  d 
  is strategyproof for the indexes idw and ids  
  

fithe strategy proofness landscape of merging

 for any distance d  d 
is strategy proof for the indexes ip   idw and ids when the

initial base k is complete 
it is interesting to note that dd    which coincides with dd  gm ax   is close to a voting
procedure called approval voting  brams   fishburn         where each agent can vote for
 approve  as many candidates as she wants  and the elected candidates are the ones who
get the greatest number of votes 
as shown by the running example  the family of merging operators dh  f obtained
by considering the hamming distance and letting the aggregation function f vary is not
strategy proof  let us now focus on this family  and consider successively the two operators
obtained by considering  and gm ax as aggregation functions 
as to dh     the number of bases  the presence of integrity constraints and the completness of the bases are significant  for this operator  the next theorem makes precise the
boundaries between strategy proofness and manipulation  in the following properties  k
represents the initial base and   e  the number of bases in the profile e  
theorem  
 dh   is strategy proof for idw or ids if and only if      and   e       or k is
complete 
 dh   is strategy proof for ip if and only if k is complete 
in contrast to dh     dh  gm ax is not strategy proof even in very restricted situations

    ensuring strategy proofness  the case of complete bases
let us now focus on a very specific case  the situation where every base is complete  while
this situation is rather infrequent when dealing with usual belief bases  it can be imposed
in a goal merging setting  especially if it guarantees strategy proofness  this explains why
we consider such a case in this paper  as said above  it is also interesting because of the
relationship with uninominal voting systems if one interprets each complete base as a vote
for the corresponding interpretation 
theorem   the strategy proofness results reported in table   hold  under the restriction
that each base is complete  f stands for any aggregation function  and d for any distance  
sp means strategy proof   sp means non strategy proof  even if   e      and     
sp means non strategy proof  even if either   e      or      but strategy proof  if
both   e      and      finally  sp  means non strategy proof  even if   e       but
strategy proof  whenever     
as theorem   shows  no operator among the dh  gm ax and the  c
 ones ensures
full strategy proofness in the restricted case where two complete bases are merged and
no integrity constraint is considered  contrastingly  all the other operators offer strategyproofness for the three indexes whenever every base is complete 
    dalal index
as explained before  the fact that ip is based on model counting allows some form of
graduality in the corresponding notion of satisfaction  and this contrasts with the drastic
indexes  actually  other non drastic indexes can be defined  in particular  in cases where
the agent knows that the result could not fit her beliefs goals  e g   if her beliefs goals are

not consistent with the integrity constraints   she still can be interested in achieving a result
that is close to her beliefs goals  closeness can be captured by a notion of distance  and a
possible satisfaction index is the following dalal index 
definition     dalal index  idalal  k  k       

min  dh   k       k  
 
  p 

as far as we know  this index has never been carried out  for the sake of homogeneity
with previous indexes  the greater idalal  k  k   the more satisfied the agent associated
with k  idalal grows antimonotonically with the hamming distance between the two bases
under consideration  i e   the minimal distance between a model of the first base and a
model of the second one  thus  this index takes its minimal value when every variable must
be flipped to obtain a model of k from a model of k  while it takes its maximal value
whenever k is consistent with k  no flip is required  
a direct observation is that idalal  k  k    idw  k  k    whatever the bases k and
k   investigating the strategy proofness of a profile e for the dalal index given a merging
operator  and an integrity constraint  makes sense only in the situation k    e  is
inconsistent  indeed  in the remaining case  idalal  k    e   takes the maximal value  
and no manipulation is possible 
in contrast to the three previous indexes we have considered  merging operators are not
strategy proof for idalal   even in very restricted situations 
theorem   none of dd     dd  gm ax   dh   or dh  gm ax is strategy proof for idalal  
even in the restricted case where e consists of two complete bases

theorem   none of the  c
 operators  hence  none of the   operators  is strategy proof

    restricted strategies
there are situations where the other agents participating to the merging process have some
information about the bases of the other agents  for instance  in cooperative problem
solving  it can be decided that whenever an agent is able to answer a query within a
limited amount of time  she has to communicate it to the other agents  contrastingly  the
communication protocol may force an agent to inform the other agents that she is definitely
not able to answer the query  such information exchanges allow the other agents to get a
partial view of the models or the countermodels of the true beliefs goals of the agent  and if
this conflicts with the reported beliefs goals  the untruthful agent can be unmasked  that
is clearly a wrong thing for the untruthful agent since her opinion could then be ignored 
she can even be punished for her guilty behaviour 
we consider here two restrictions on available manipulations  and the corresponding
notions of strategy proofness   erosion manipulation is when the agent pretends to believe desire more that she does  the agent gives only some parts of its models   and dilatation manipulation is when the agent pretends to believe desire less that she does  the agent
gives only parts of its countermodels  
definition     erosion and dilation 
 erosion manipulation holds when the reported base k   is logically stronger than the
true one k  k      k
 dilation manipulation holds when the reported base k   is logically weaker than the
true one k  k    k    
erosion  resp  dilation  manipulation is safe for the untruthful agent when the other
agents may only have access to a subset of the countermodels  resp  models  of her true
beliefs goals  while it is unsafe in general when the other agents may have access to a subset
of the models  resp  countermodels  
the next theorem gives the dilation strategy proofness of model based operators 
theorem    let d be a pseudo distance and let f be an aggregation function  d f
is

dilation strategy proof for the indexes ip   idw and ids  
this result has to be compared with the ones in the unrestricted case  previous sections  
where most of the operators are not strategy proof 
it is not the same story for erosion  one can easily find profiles that can be manipulated
using erosion manipulation  see the running example   interestingly  focusing on erosion
strategy proofness proves sufficient in some situations  indeed  when d is any distance  
is the aggregation function and any drastic index id are considered  d 
is strategy proof

for id if and only if it is erosion strategy proof for id  
theorem    let d be any distance  if d 
is not strategy proof for the index idw  resp 

ids    then it is not erosion strategy proof for idw  resp  ids   
this result has a corollary  showing that it it enough to focus on each complete base
that implies k to determine whether a profile e is manipulable by a base k for idw  
  

fithe strategy proofness landscape of merging

   discussion
in this paper  we have drawn the strategy proofness landscape for many merging operators 
including model based ones and formula based ones  while both families are not strategyproof in the general case  we have shown that several restrictions on the merging framework
or on the available strategies may lead to strategy proofness 
as to model based operators  the choice of a right distance appears crucial  thus 
model based operators are strategy proof when based on the drastic distance  while they
are typically not strategy proof when based on dalal distance 
among formula based merging operators  c 
 achieves the highest degree of strategyproofness in the sense that it is strategy proof for the drastic indexes 
most of the results are summed up in table    sp means strategy proof and sp means
not strategy proof   for space reasons  the results on restricted strategies are not reported
there  see section       as well as the ones concerning complete bases  see table    
from the derived results  it appears that strategy proofness is easier to achieve with
formula based operators than with model based ones  especially when the bases are singlec
tons  i e   with the  ci operators   this could be explained by the fact that the latter
operators obey an all or nothing principle  a base is either selected as a whole  and included as such in a maxcons  or it is not selected at all  and this may forbid some subtle
manipulations 
we have also exhibited some restricted strategies that constrain the agent who wants
to manipulate  for example  all model based operators are strategy proof for dilation 
most of the results of this paper are based on three satisfaction indexes  that are 
according to us  the most natural ones when no additional information about the merging
process is available  these three indexes share the property that if two bases are jointly
inconsistent  then the satisfaction is minimal  we call it the consistency property  in
order to handle scenarios where the consistency property is not discriminant enough  we
introduced the dalal index  it turns out that none of the operators considered in the paper
is strategy proof for this index 
the choice of a satisfaction index has  by definition  a major impact on the existence
of manipulation  as explained before  if the full preferences of all the agents over sets of
interpretations were available  strategy proofness could be easily defined as in social choice
theory  a manipulation occurs if and only if the merged base obtained when the agent lies
is strictly preferred  w r t  her own preference  to the the merged base obtained when she
reports her true base  when such information are not available  several choices for an
index are possible  capturing different intuitions 
when beliefs are to be merged  indexes satisfying the consistency property seem more
suited than the remaining ones  indeed  for the latter indexes  even if a merged base is close
to the agents beliefs  it is still not compatible with them  drawing such a conclusion is not
so easy when goals are to be merged  since for instance  it can be the case that for some

agents  the more goals satisfied  the better  nevertheless  our three satisfaction indexes idw  
ids and ip are still meaningful in such scenarios  since an agent is typically more satisfied if
the goals of the group are compatible with her own ones than if it is not the case 
in light of our study  strategy proofness appears as a property independent of the computational complexity of query answering from a merged base  see konieczny et al         
it means that having a low high complexity does not prevent imply strategy proofness 
strategy proofness appears also independent of the fact that the operator satisfies the
rationality postulates given by konieczny and pino perez               indeed  as a direct
consequence of theorems   and    we have that some majority  resp  arbitration  merging
operators  konieczny   pino perez        are strategy proof  while others are not  thus 
satisfying the rationality postulates for merging proves not sufficient to ensure strategyproofness or manipulability  nevertheless  we can note that arbitration operators  like
d gm ax   are more sensitive to manipulation than majority operators  like d    this is
easily explained by the fact that arbitration operators are egalitarist ones  they aim at
giving a result that is close to each base of the profile  intuitively  a small change in a
base can heavily change the whole result  contrastingly  majority operators  that listen to
majority wishes for defining the merged base  often do not take into account bases that are
far from the majority  so  when using majority operators  it is likely that a small change
in a base has no impact on the merged base 
thus  strategy proofness can be viewed as a further dimension that can be used to
compare merging operators  besides the computational complexity and rationality criteria 
its independence to the latter criteria may also explain why no strategy proofness results
for wide families of operators seem to exist 

   related work
as explained through this paper  the manipulation problem has been studied extensively
in social choice theory for years  in the next subsection we will relate our work to this
stream of research  in a second subsection we mention some other related work concerning
the strategy proofness issue for weighted bases 
    social choice theory
in the propositional merging framework considered in the paper  the beliefs goals k of each
agent induce a two strata partition of the interpretations  all the models of k are equally
preferred  and strictly preferred to its countermodels  which are equally disliked  when
agents report full preference relations  that can be encoded in various ways  e g   explicitly 
or by a prioritized base  an ordinal conditional function  etc    the aggregation problem
consists in defining a global preference relation from individual preference relations  this
problem has been addressed for centuries in social choice theory  this can be traced back
at least to condorcet        and borda        
in social choice theory  arrow et al          the strategy proofness problem has received great attention  in this framework  an agent a is untruthful when she reports a
preference relation  a complete pre order over the set of alternatives  that is not the true
one  a social choice function  associating an alternative to a profile of such preference
relations  is not strategy proof when the alternative chosen by the function when a lies
  

fieveraere  konieczny   marquis

is ranked higher for a than the alternative chosen when she reports her true preferences 
one of the most famous result in social choice theory is that there is no good strategyproof preference aggregation procedure  this result is known as gibbard satterthwaite
impossibility theorem  gibbard        satterthwaite        moulin        
formally  consider a set of agents  individuals  n               n   and a set of alternatives
a    a  b          each agent i has a preference relation on those alternatives  that is supposed
to be a complete  reflexive and transitive binary relation  noted i   a preference profile
p                n   assigns a preference relation to each agent  let us note p the set of
all possible preference profiles  a given preference profile can be noted p    pi   i   
i  n   where pi denotes the profile p without  the preferences of  individual i  a social
choice function f is a mapping from p to a  a social choice function is manipulable if
there is an individual i  n   a preference relation     and a preference profile p such that
f  pi    i    i f  p    i e   when there is an agent i that is best satisfied with the result when
she claims her preferences are  i instead of her true preference i   if a social choice function
is not manipulable  it is said to be strategy proof  a social choice function is dictatorial if
there is an individual i  n  the dictator   such that f  p   i a for all a  a and for all
p  p  a social choice function is onto if for each alternative a  a there is a preference
profile p  p such that f  p     a  then gibbard satterthwaite theorem  gibbard       
satterthwaite        can be stated as 
theorem     gibbard        satterthwaite        if a contains at least three alternatives  then there is no social choice function f that is onto  strategy proof and non dictatorial 
since this result has been stated  there has been a lot of work for deriving strategyproofness results under some restrictions  see kelly        arrow et al          in some
sense  our work is relevant to such approaches  nonetheless  our work is original   as far as
we know   from two points of view  on the one hand  the preference relations considered
here are two strata total pre orders  and not arbitrary pre orders  on the other hand  the
result of a merging process is usually not a single interpretation but still a two strata total
pre order  and the number of models of the merged base is not constrained a priori   this
leads to more complex notions of strategy proofness where different definitions are possible 
depending on an index which formalizes one of the various intuitive notions of how satisfied
an agent is by the result of the merging process 
in social choice theory  there are also some works on social choice correspondences  that
are mapping from p to  a   and that are closer to our framework than social choice functions  the data coming from individuals are preference relations on a  and the problem is
to shift them to preference relations on  a   the standard way to achieve it is to consider
that even if a set is chosen by the correspondence  then ultimately only one alternative will
be realized  and to suppose that each individual has a subjective probability measure on
this realization  then a social choice correspondance is strategy proof if it is not possible
for an individual to increase her expected utility of the result  in this case  results similar to gibbard satterthwaite theorems can be derived  see e g   barbera  dutta    sen 
      chin   zhou        duggan   schwartz         these works are related to the one
conducted in this paper  but they all suppose that each agent makes available not only its
full preference relation on alternatives under the form of a utility function  typically not
reducible to a two strata complete pre order  but also its subjective probability measure

on alternatives  contrastingly  in this work  the only information coming from each agent
is the corresponding base  which typically approximates her full preference relation  and is
of pure ordinal nature 
    strategy proofness for weighted bases merging
a study of strategy proofness of some merging operators has been carried out by meyer 
ghose  and chopra         the framework they consider is distinct from the one used
in our work  on the one hand  agents may report full preference relations  encoded as
ordinal conditional functions  also called  functions  see spohn         on the other hand 
the merging operators under consideration escape gibbard satterthwaite theorem since
meyer et al         make a commensurability assumption between the agents preference
relations  the same remark applies also to possibilistic base merging as defined by benferhat 
dubois  kaci    prade         roughly  this commensurability assumption amounts to
consider that the weights  or the levels  associated to formulas have the same meaning
for all the agents  i e   that a weight   for agent   is the same that a weight   for agent
   the commensurability assumption is sensible in many situations  but when dealing
with agents preferences  commensurability must be used carefully  for human agents  it
is commonly accepted in social choice theory that this assumption is very strong  arrow
       illustrates this idea by quoting bentham 
 this is vain to talk of adding quantities which after the addition will continue
distinct as they were before  one mans happiness will never be another mans
happiness  a gain to one man is no gain to another  you might as well pretend
to add    apples to    pears   
the notion of strategy proofness and the merging operators of meyer et al         and
chopra  ghose  and meyer        are defined in the framework of ordinal conditional functions  in this section  we study the corresponding operators in the pure propositional
framework  i e   when the profile contains flat belief goal bases  in order to compare them
with our approach 
an ordinal conditional function  ocf   is a total function from the set of interpretations w to the set of non negative integers  originally  an ocf maps an interpretation
to the class of ordinals  and is such that at least one interpretation is mapped to zero 
but considering integers is sufficient here   intuitively  the greater the number  the less
credible the interpretation  to each ocf  one can associate a base bel   defined as
 bel         w        min  w           the aim of ocf merging operators is 
from a profile of ocfs e                n   to define an ocf   e  that best represents the
profile  the operators studied by meyer et al         are the following ones 
 max  e      maxi e i    

      if i      j    for all i   j  e
 min   e     
  mini e i        otherwise 

     if i      j    for all i   j  e
 min   e     
mini e i        otherwise

the straightforward way to translate the framework of propositional merging into ordinal conditional functions is to consider a propositional base as a special case of ocf  a
propositional base is a two strata ocf  with the models of the bases having rank   and the
countermodels having rank    if we consider only two strata ocfs i and note ki   bel i  
and    bel     the previous definitions of merging operators give 
v
 max  e   min   e   e if consistent and max  e   min   e     otherwise 
v
w
 min   e   e if consistent and min   e   e otherwise 
   e   dd    e  
the resulting propositional merging operators max   min    min    and  are quite
simple and well known  max  or equivalently min    is the so called basic merging operator  in absence of integrity constraints   konieczny   pino perez         min  is the
  quota operator defined by everaere  konieczny  and marquis         without integrity
constraints    corresponds to the intersection operator defined by konieczny        
all those operators are strategy proof for our indexes 
theorem    max   min    min    and  are strategy proof for idw   ids and ip  
besides those operators  meyer  chopra and ghose also proposed general definitions of
strategy proofness for ocf merging  more precisely  they have studied two properties  the
first one is the  ip  property  meyer et al         
definition     ip  an ocf merging operator  satisfies the  ip  property if and only
if for every ocf profile e  for every agent i  we have whatever the ocf 
  w     e     i         rep e   i        i    
where rep e   i     is the profile identical to e except that the ocf i is replaced by  
focusing on two strata ocfs  we say that a merging operator    bel     is strategyproof for  ip  if and only if  satisfies the  ip  property for every agent given any profile 
we have obtained the following characterization 
theorem     is strategy proof for  ip  if and only if for every profile e and every pair
of bases k and k    
 k   e t  k       e t  k       and
 k   e t  k       e t  k      
the second strategy proofness property that meyer  chopra and ghose have investigated is  wip  
  

fithe strategy proofness landscape of merging

definition     wip  an ocf merging operator  satisfies the  wip  property if and
only if for every profile e  for every agent i  we have whatever the ocf  
w    e     i      w    rep e   i        i     
 wip  is weaker than  ip  in the sense that if an ocf merging operator  satisfies
 ip  for an agent i  then  satisfies  wip  for i  but the converse does not always hold  
again  focusing on two strata ocfs  we say that a merging operator    bel     is
strategy proof for  wip  if and only if  satisfies the  wip  property for every agent
given any profile

let us note  the exclusive or operator  i e   k  k       k   k        k  k     
then  wip  can be characterized in our framework by  
theorem    let iwip  k  k    
if it is strategy proof for iwip  

 
   kk       

 satisfies the  wip  property if and only

note that the wip index iwip is very close to the probabilistic index ip   the probabilistic index measures the closeness of the merged base to the agent base  whereas the wip
index measures the difference between the merged base and the agent base 
however  the corresponding notion of strategy proofness  and a fortiori the one induced
by  ip   appears too strong in the pure propositional setting  consider the following belief
merging scenario 
example   consider k   a and k    b we have dh     k  k      a  b  if the
agent gives k      a  b  instead of k  then the merged base is dh     k     k      a 
accordingly  this an example of manipulation for  wip   iwip  dh     k  k            
iwip  dh     k     k           
in this example  the untruthful agent actually manages to change the merged base to
one which is more similar to her initial base  with respect to iwip    this is because she is
not fully satisfied by the merged base equivalent to a  b but still strictly prefers her initial
base  a   despite the fact that a  b refines her own beliefs  accordingly  such an agent
wants to preserve both her beliefs and her ignorance  in many scenarios when an agent
participates to a merging process in order to get new information  this is counter intuitive 
chopra et al         give more general definitions of strategy proofness  by considering other
similarity relations  in the propositional case  they all suffer from the same above mentioned
drawback  this explains why we did not investigate the strategy proofness of the purely
propositional model based operators and formula based operators for criteria like  wip 
or  ip  

   conclusion
investigating the strategy proofness of merging operators is important from a multi agent
perspective whenever some agents can get the information conveyed by the other agents
participating to the merging process  when strategy proofness is not guaranteed  it may be
questioned whether the result of the merging process actually represents the beliefs goals
of the group

in this paper  we have drawn the strategy proofness landscape for many existing merging
operators  including model based ones and formula based ones  both in the general case and
under several natural restrictions  strategy proofness appears as independent of complexity
and rationality aspects  and can be used as such  as a further criterion to evaluate merging
operators  all those results have been discussed in section   
this work calls for a number of perspectives  a first perspective is to identify the complexity of determining whether a profile can be manipulated by a base given an operator 
indeed  using a merging operator that is not strategy proof is not necessarily harmful if finding out a strategy is computationally hard  such a complexity issue has been investigated for
voting schemes  conitzer   sandholm        conitzer  lang    sandholm        conitzer
  sandholm      a      b  when individual preferences are given explicitly  which is not
the case in our framework   a first result follows easily from theorem     if the distance d
between interpretations can be computed in polynomial time in the input size  which is not
a strong assumption   determining whether a given profile can be manipulated by a base
p
for a drastic index given d 
 and  is in    
in social choice theory  the gibbard sattertwhaite theorem states that every sensible
social choice function is manipulable  taking into account the fact that the agents are
tempted to manipulate transforms the aggregation process into a game between agents 
for ensuring strategy proofness  it can prove sufficient to build a game where telling the
truth is an optimal strategy for each agent  how to achieve it is the aim of implementation
theory  also called mechanism design   see e g   maskin   sjostrom        a perspective
is to determine whether building such mechanisms is possible in a belief merging setting in
order to force the agents to tell the truth  most of the work on mechanism design assume
transferable utility  and use payments as part as the process  importing such ideas in a
fully qualitative framework surely is a hard task 
another interesting perspective is to study the strategy proofness problem when coalitions are allowed  instead of considering manipulation by single agents  one can be interested in manipulation by coalition of agents who coordinate to improve the result for the
coalition  see  meyer et al         chopra et al         for such a definition in a different
framework  since manipulation by a single agent is a particular case of manipulation by a
coalition  and since we have seen that many operators are not strategy proof for a single
agent  it is clear that strategy proofness results for coalitions will be very hard to achieve

theorem  
 let f be any aggregation function  dd  f is strategy proof for ip   idw and ids

 let f be any aggregation function  dd  f is strategy proof for ip   idw and ids  
the proof is organized in three steps  by reduction ad absurdum  we show that the
minimal drastic distance between a model of  and e t  k  is equal to the minimal
drastic distance between a model of  and e t  k      then  it is easy to show that
the number of ks models is greater in e t  k  than in e t  k      finally  we prove
that the number of countermodels of k is greater in e t  k     than in e t  k   which
entails a contradiction 
   i e     e  is always consistent

from theorem    we know that if any operator dd  f is strategy proof for ip   it is also
strategy proof for both idw and ids  indeed  dd  f  e  is always consistent   so it is
sufficient to prove the strategy proofness of dd  f for ip to prove its strategy proofness
for the three indexes 
let us prove it by reductio ad absurdum  assume that there is an operator dd  f   where
dd is the drastic distance and f is any aggregation function  that is not strategy proof
for ip   then there exist an integrity constraint   a profile e  and two bases k and
k   s t  ip  k  dd  f   k  t e     ip  k  dd  f   k     t e    which is equivalent to
   k    e  dd  f k  
   e  dd  f k  

 

   k    e  dd  f k     
   e  dd  f k     

where e  dd  f k is a light notation for dd  f   k  t e    let us note dmin  e tdd  f
 k     min  dd    e t  k               we now show that dmin  e tdd  f  k    
dmin  e tdd  f  k      
 let us first notice that we have ip  k  e  dd  f k        if ip  k  e  dd  f k      
then the probabilistic satisfaction index takes its maximal value  so it is impossible to increase it 
since ip  k  e  dd  f k       we have that    k  e  dd  f k        e  dd  f k   
so at least one model of e  dd  f k does not belong to k 
      k     dd      e t  k     dmin  e tdd  f  k   
since       k     we have dd      k      and this distance is maximal
 because we use the drastic distance   we get immediately that dd      k  
dd      k      hence dd      e t k    dd      e t k       because the aggregation
function f satisfy non decreasingness   since dd      e t  k     dmin  e tdd  f
 k    we get dmin  e tdd  f  k    dd      e t  k       since dd      e t  k      
dmin  e tdd  f  k      by definition of min and since        we have
dmin  e tdd  f  k    dmin  e tdd  f  k         
 we can also conclude that ip  k  e  dd  f k           if ip  k  e  dd  f k          then
ip  k  e  dd  f k     is minimal  so the value taken by ip has not increased  and
this contradicts the assumption  manipulation  
if ip  k  e  dd  f k           then we can find at least one model of k   in
e  dd  f k          k   dd      e t k        dmin  e tdd  f  k       since      k 
we have dd      k      and since this distance is minimal  we get dd      e t
 k    dd      e t  k       and then dd      e t  k    dmin  e tdd  f  k      
because dd      e t  k        dmin  e tdd  f  k       furthermore  since dd      e t
 k    dmin  e tdd  f  k   by definition of min and because        we have 
dmin  e tdd  f  k    dmin  e tdd  f  k         
  

fithe strategy proofness landscape of merging

from the inequations     and       we get 
dmin  e tdd  f  k     dmin  e tdd  f  k      

   

let us show now that we can only increase the number of countermodels of k in
e  dd  f k     and decrease the number of models of k in e  dd  f k    
 let  be a countermodel of k which is a model of e  dd  f k       k  
 e  dd  f k  
since     k  we have dd    k      and this distance is maximal  hence
dd    k   dd    k      so 
dd    e t  k    dd    e t  k     

   

because the aggregation function f satisfies non decreasingness 
since     e  dd  f k  we have dd    e t  k     dmin  e tdd  f  k    with     
we get dmin  e tdd  f  k    dd    e t  k      
since dmin  e tdd  f  k     dmin  e tdd  f  k      with      we obtain  dmin  e tdd  f
 k       dd    e t  k       by definition of min and since       because    
e  dd  f k   we deduce that  is a model of e  dd  f k     we can conclude that
every model of e  dd  f k which is not a model of k is a model of e  dd  f k    
hence   k    e  dd  f k    k    e  dd  f k     
 finally  let  be a model of k which is a model of e  dd  f k         k   e  dd  f
k      since     k  we have dd    k      and this distance is minimal  hence
dd    k   dd    k      so 
dd    e t  k    dd    e t  k     

   

because the aggregation function is non decreasing 
since     e  dd  f k     we have dd    e t  k        dmin  e tdd  f  k       with
     we get dd    e t  k   dmin  e tdd  f  k       since dmin  e tdd  f  k    
dmin  e tdd  f  k      with      we obtain dd    e t  k   dmin  e tdd  f  k    by
definition of min and since       because     e  dd  f k      we deduce that 
is a model of e  dd  f k  we can conclude that every model of e  dd  f k   which
is a model of k is a model of e  dd  f k  it follows that  k    e  dd  f k     
 k    e  dd  f k  
since we can only increase the number of countermodels of k in e  dd  f k   and
decrease the number of models of k in e  dd  f k     the proportion of models of k in
e  dd  f k   is smaller than in e  dd  f k  this contradicts the assumption and shows
that dd  f is strategy proof for ip  
 let d be any distance  provided that only two bases are to be merged  d

in this proof  we first show that the merging of two bases is consistent with each base 
then  the property follows directly 
strategy proofness for the two drastic indexes is a direct consequence of the following
property

we show that d

by symmetry   reductio ad absurdum  let us suppose that for two bases k  and k   
d 
    k    k     is inconsistent with k    we can deduce that 
      k        k    d   k   d  k      d      k   d  k    
where k   d  k  is a light notation for d 
    k    k     
since     k    d   k         we get that       k        k    d   k     
d      k      d      k     in particular  if we consider      k  s t  d            d      k   
 such an   exists by definition of d      k      we have  d     k      d           
d      k     similarly  if we consider      k  s t  d            d      k     we get 
d     k      d            d             
by definition of d  we have     k    d     k     d        in particular  d     k    
d          by transitivity of   and with      we get d           d            d          
this contradicts the triangular inequality 

let us now prove the main theorem 
weak drastic index  for two bases k  and k    we always have idw  k    k    k        
because d 
    k    k      k  is consistent  lemma     so no manipulation is possible
 idw is maximal

d 
 
ids  k    d 
    k    k       ids  k        k    k     

for the strong drastic index  this means exactly that 
d

d 
    k    k      with      we can conclude that      k  as well 

since we have      k  k    we can conclude that for every model  of d

d 
we have d    k    k          so         k    k      d   k      d   k        
hence     d

is possible

 for any distance d  d

proof 
theorem   entails straightforwardly the  part of the proof  taking the
hamming distance dh for d 
for the  part of the proof  we shall show by examples of manipulation that dh   is not
strategy proof in other cases 
 the first examples show that dh   is not strategy proof for idw or ids if       or
  e         and if k is not complete

we consider the constraint    ab and the two bases k  and k  defined by their
set of models   k               and  k            we have  dh     k    k

since manipulability for idw holds  manipulability for ip holds as well  cf  theorem    
 as to ids   we first show that dh  gm ax is strategy proof for this index if     
  e      and k is complete  then  we give examples of manipulation if       or
  e        or k is not complete 
 d h  gm ax is strategy proof when e    k    k    and      if k  is complete 
we consider e      k     k    with k     k    complete  thanks to the forthcoming
lemma    we know that if the operator is manipulable  it is manipulable for
a complete base   and      let   p    n and let d k     k      m  n 
then there exists a model   of k  s t  dh  k            m  by definition of the
hamming distance    can be generated from   by flipping m variables  since
k    and   differ on the truth values of m variables x            xm   
if m    k      m odd   then d    e        k      k   otherwise m    k  m
even  and d    e        k  k   in the first case  m odd   there exist at least two
interpretations  and    s t  d   e       d      e       d    e      for instance   is
generated from   by flipping x            xk and    is generated from   by flipping
xk             xm   
a similar conclusion can be derived in the second case  m even  as soon as k    
in these two cases  d h  gm ax  e     has at least two models  hence we cannot have
d h  gm ax  e      k  with k  complete  e cannot be manipulated by k  for ids  
the remaining case is d    e               it imposes that k     k  is consistent 
since k    is complete  we have d h  gm ax  e      k      hence no manipulation is
dh  gm ax
possible for ids  since  
 e      k  if and only if k   k    if and only if

fithe strategy proofness landscape of merging

 we first give an example of manipulation of  c 
 for ip   with   e       a complete
base k    and     
consider e    k    k     with k     a  b  and k      a  b    then  c 
   e     
 
     a  b  instead of k   then
and ip  k     c

 c 
    k    k      a  b  and ip  k         k    k            so e is manipulable by k 
c 
c 
for ip   the same example holds for  c 
   it remains to note now that          
 c 
  to conclude the first point of the proof 
  c 
 is strategy proof for idw and ids  
weak drastic index 
for any k  e there are two cases 
 k
subset m of
s   is consistent  then there is at least one maximal consistent
c 
ki e ki which contains  and all the formulas of k  so    e t k    m r
 where r denotes the disjunction of the other maxcons  is consistent with k   
so idw  k   c 
  e t  k        and no manipulation is possible 
 
 k   is not consistent  since for any k     we have  c 
  e t  k          we also
c 
 
have idw  k     e t  k         and no manipulation is possible 

strong drastic index 
by reductio ad absurdum  assume that  c 
 is not strategy proof for ids   it means
that
k s t   c 
   
  e t  k       k 
 
k   s t   c 
  e t  k       k 

   

from statement     we get that m  maxcons e t  k         m    k  so if we
 
 
 
consider  c 
  e t  k   t  k    every m  maxcons e t  k   t  k     is of the
 
c 
 
form m   k   so m    k and    e t  k   t  k      k    
from statement     we get that m  maxcons e t  k      m     k  since m is a
maximal subset  it means that m  k is not consistent  so if we consider  c 
  e t
 k     t  k    then m  m     with m    maxcons e t  k     t  k      so m    k
 
is not consistent  hence m       k and  c 
  e t  k  t  k        k  which contradicts
   
  c 
 is strategy proof for idw and ids if and only if

since  c 
         it follows immediately from the above proof for   that    is

for showing that manipulation is possible for  c 
 if       even with two bases and a
complete initial base k    consider the following example  let k     ab   k     a  
   b and k      a   we have c 
   k    k      a  which is inconsistent with k

of maxcons  ke k      since k       m is consistent with   k  is a model

  e   by definition
c   e   k is consistent 
of the operator   we also have k     c 
 e  
hence

 


and this prevents e from being manipulable by k  for idw given c 
 and  
 k       by definition of the operator  for any base k   and any profile e  
 
 
 especially the profile obtained by removing k  from e   we have c

for showing that manipulation is possible for  c

 if k  is consistent with   then there are two cases

c

c 
in the first case   c 
   k    k        k  and     k    k        k  so ip takes its
maximal value  and no manipulation is possible 
c

c

c 
let us consider the second case for  c 
  the case for   is similar   we assume
c

c

that  c 
   k    k       k   k      
c

c 
 
since for every base k     the definition of  c 
 requires that we have     k   
c

c

k         and since we have k        c 
   k    k      the following inequation
 
holds for every base k

if k    k    is consistent  then  c 
   k    k      k   k     hence
c

 
   k     c 
   k    k           is minimal since we have assumed that k  k  
is inconsistent 
if k    k    is inconsistent  then there are two cases 
c

 
 k     is inconsistent and k    is inconsistent  we have  c 
   k    k     
c

  since we have assumed k    consistent  we also have  c 
   k    k     
k     hence

and
c

since the numerators of the two fractions coincide while    k            
no manipulation is possible in this case 
 
 k     is consistent or k    is consistent  we have  c 
   k    k     
 
 k   k       since k   k    is inconsistent  we have

now  since k    k    is inconsistent  we have     k    k         
   k            k       similarly  since k   k    is inconsistent  we
have     k   k             k           k       subsequently  suppose

c 
that we have ip  k     c 
   k    k        ip  k        k    k       this is the
case if and only if    k   k          k           k            k  
      k            k       
if we note a      k   k       and b      k       then there exist two
natural integers a  and a   such that    k        a   a  and    k        
a   a     replacing in the previous inequation  it comes

c

a a   a    b     a   a    a   a     b 
which simplifies to     aa     a  a     a  c  which is impossible  hence no
manipulation is possible in this case as well 
 
c 
 
 if k  is not consistent with   then  since e      c 
  e       and    e       
c

c

 
c 
 
we have  e     ip  k     c 
  e        and ip  k       e         so no manipulation
is possible 
c

c

for the  part of the proof  the following example shows that strategy proofness
c
c
c 
for ip does not hold any longer for  c 
 or   when   e        even if the initial base is complete and      we consider k     a  b   k     a  b  and
k     a   with the integrity constraint       there are two maximal consistent sets in maxcons  k    k    k        m     a  b     and m     a      hence
c
c
 
c 
 c 
   k    k    k       a  b    a   we get ip  k        k    k    k            if
agent   gives k      a  b  instead of k    then there are two maximal consistent sets m      a  b      m      a  b  a     in maxcons  k     k    k        so
c
c
 
 
c 
 
 c 
   k    k    k       a  b    a  b   we get ip  k        k    k    k            so
this is an example of manipulation of  c 
  for ip  
c

since  c 
         this example shows the manipulability of   as well

theorem    let d be a pseudo distance and let f be an aggregation function  d f
is

dilation strategy proof for the indexes ip   idw and ids  
proof 
the idea is that if the untruthful base k   contains all the models of the true
base k  then the merged base when k   is provided contains at most the same models of k
as those appearing in the merged base when k is reported  and more countermodels of k 
so no manipulation is possible 
from theorem    it is sufficient to show that d f
 is strategy proof for ip   by reductio ad
absurdum  let us suppose that there is an operator d f
   where d and f are respectively a
pseudo distance and an aggregation function  which is manipulable by dilation for ip   under
this assumption  we can find an integrity constraint   a profile e  two bases k and k  
d f
 
with k    k     s t  ip  k  d f
   k  t e     ip  k     k   t e    using the light notation
e   k instead of d f
   k  t e   we have 
   k    e   k     
   k    e   k  
 
 
   e   k  
   e   k     
since k    k     for any pseudo distance d  we have   w  d   k   d   k      so  for any
aggregation function f  that satisfies non decreasingness  
  w  d   e t  k    d   e t  k      

   

let us note dmin  e t  k     min  d   e t  k               with      we can
immediately infer  dmin  e t  k    dmin  e t  k       two cases have to be considered 
 dmin  e t  k     dmin  e t  k          
if   is a model of k   then  since k    k     d     k    d     k          so d     e t
 k     d     e t  k        if furthermore   is a model of e   k     then d     e t
 k        dmin  e t  k       and d     e t  k     dmin  e t  k       by definition of
min  we have d     e t  k    dmin  e t  k    because        so we can conclude
that dmin  e t  k    dmin  e t  k       but this contradicts      so  no model of
k   is a model of e   k     consequently  ip  k  e   k         and is minimal  and
this prevents from any manipulation for d f
   so  we can exclude case     
 dmin  e t  k     dmin  e t  k           
if  is a model of e   k  then we have both      and d   e t  k     dmin  e t
 k    so  d   e t  k     dmin  e t  k      with the equation       furthermore 
with the inequation      we infer that d   e t  k    d   e t  k       hence 
d   e t  k       dmin  e t  k       since  is a model of   we can finally infer that

 is a model of e   k   as well  so we have that any model of e   k is a model of
e   k     and then 
   e   k       e   k      
   
we can deduce as well that any model of e   k which is a model of k   is a model
of e   k    and of k   so 
   k    e   k       k    e   k      
furthermore  if      k   is a model of e   k     then we have both 
 d     e t  k        dmin  e t  k        dmin  e t  k   with       and
 d     e t  k     d     e t  k      because k    k     since d     k       we have
d     k         too 
we obtain  d     e t k     dmin  e t  k   and        so   is a model of e   k 
then we can state    k    e   k       k    e   k       so we get 
   k    e   k        k    e   k      

    

with     and       we get immediately that

shows that  is not manipulable for ip   which contradicts the assumption  so case

theorem    let d be any distance  if d 
is not strategy proof for the index idw  resp 

ids    then it is not erosion strategy proof for idw  resp  ids   
proof 

we first need the following lemma 

lemma   let d be a pseudo distance and let f be an aggregation function  if a profile e
is manipulable by k for idw  resp  ids   given d f
 and   then one can find a complete base
k    the base the agent gives instead of her true base k  s t  idw  k    e t  k        
idw  k    e t  k     resp  ids  k    e t  k         ids  k    e t  k     
proof 
this lemma is mainly a consequence of the definition of the distance between an
interpretation and a base k     as the minimal distance between an interpretation and a model
    of the base  the complete base whose unique model is     allows as well a manipulation
weak drastic index

we suppose that d f
 is manipulable for idw   i e   we can find an integrity constraint   a

d f
 
idw  k  d f

this is equivalent to  idw  k  e   k      and idw  k  e   k          where d f

is noted e   k for simplifying notations 
statement      states that idw  k  e   k       no model of k   is a model of e   k

     k          d     e t  k       d   e t  k      

    

since in      the choice of    can be made apart from        is equivalent to 
       k         k    d      e t  k     d   e t  k   

    

let        k   s t  d     k       d            we consider the complete base k    s t   k               
we shall show in the rest of the proof that d f
 is manipulable with that base  if the agent
whose beliefs goals are k gives k    as a base instead of k  then  since d     k        d     k     
we have 
d     e t  k         d     e t  k      
    
and then 
      d     e t  k        d   e t  k      

    

with      and      
furthermore  since the aggregation function f is non decreasing  by definition  and since
k       k     we have       d   e t  k       d   e t  k        so we get immediately with
     
       d     e t  k        d   e t  k       
    
d f
  
  
so   is a model of d f

idw  k  d f
   k  t e     idw  k     k   t e    this shows that  is manipulable
  
for a complete base k

let us note dmin  e td f
  k      min  d   e t  k                since   is a model of

  e t  k       we have d     e t  k        dmin  e td f

d     e t  k         dmin  e td f

by definition of min and since        we also have  d     e t  k        dmin  e td f
  k    
so we get 
 
d f
  
dmin  e td f
    
  k     dmin  e t  k    

on the other hand  since k       k     we have    w  d   k      d   k       since the

dmin  e t  k     then  with       we obtain d     e t  k      dmin  e t  k     since
  
       we have that   is a model of d f

d f
 
  
  
then  since dmin  e td f
  k      dmin  e t  k     we have d   e t  k      dmin  e t
 
 k       with       we get d   e t  k       dmin  e td f
  k    
 
then  by definition of min we have d   e t  k        dmin  e td f
  k    
 
this implies that  is a model of d f
  e t  k    too  because        so we can write

d f
  
 
 
d f

we get then a manipulation for ids with a complete base k      and this completes the proof
of the lemma 

let us now give the proof of the main theorem 
weak drastic index  by reductio ad absurdum  we assume that d

this means there is no model of k   which is a model of d 
  e t  k    and that there
d 
is at least one model   of k   which is a model of   e t         we can express those
facts by two statements

hence

let us now define a new base k            since we have supposed the operator not
manipulable by erosion and since k       k  we can then state that it is strategy proof for
d 
  
idw with k      idw  k  d

from equation       we can infer that idw  k  d

this contradicts the triangular inequality  so  if manipulation is possible  then it is possible

max  or equivalently min    is strategy proof for ip   indeed  if e is
consistent  then all the models
v of the merged base are models of k   e  thus the satisfaction

v then the merged base is valid  assume that
agent   reports k   instead of k    if k     k            kn   isvconsistent  then no model of

of the merged base  so  in order to increase the value of the ip index  it is not possible
to increase the number of models of k  in the result of the merging  hence one needs to
decrease the number of countermodels of k  in the merged base  but we shall
show that

it is not possible  assume that agent   reports k   instead of k    if k     kv

theorem     satisfies the  ip  property if and only if for every profile e and every pair
of bases k and k    
 k   e t  k       e t  k       and
 k   e t  k       e t  k      
proof 
suppose that a merging operator    bel     does not satisfy the  ip 
property  then there is a profile e  an agent i  an ocf   an interpretation   w s t 
   e     i          rep e   i        i    
where rep e   i     is the profile identical to e except that the ocf i is replaced by   in
the following we note  e t  k   for bel   e    it is the initial merged base when agent
i reports her true base k  bel i    and we note  e t  k      for bel   rep e   i      
it is the merged base obtained by replacing the base k of agent i by another k    bel   
focusing on two strata ocfs  this inequation entails that    e     i         and
   rep e   i        i          since    rep e   i        i           is a model
of both  e t  k      and of k      or  is a countermodel of both  e t  k      and of k
     
to get    e     i          there are also two cases 
 either   e        and i         then  is a model of k and a countermodel
of  e t  k    since  is a model of k  with      we know that  is a model of
 e t  k       then  is a model of k  of   e t  k    and not of  e t  k      
it entails that
k   e t  k        e t  k      
 or   e        and i         then  is a countermodel of k and a model of  e t
 k    since  is a countermodel of k  with       we know that  is a countermodel
of  e t  k       then  is a model of k  of  e t  k   and not of  e t  k      
it entails that
k   e t  k        e t  k      
hence it is not the case that both
 k   e t  k       e t  k       and

 k   e t  k       e t  k      
are satisfied 
as to the converse  suppose that there is a profile e  an agent i with a base k  and another
base k   s t  
k   e t  k        e t  k     
or
k   e t  k        e t  k      
in the first case  there is a model  of k   e t  k   which is a countermodel of
 e t  k       
  e         i           rep e   i           
so
   e     i          rep e   i        i     
in the second case  there is a model  of k   e t  k   which is a countermodel of
 e t  k      
  e         i           rep e   i           
so
   e     i          rep e   i        i

in the following we note  e t  k   for bel   e    that is the initial merged base when
agent i reports her true base k  bel i    and we note  e t  k      for bel   rep e   i  
    i e   the merged base obtained by replacing the base k of the agent i by another

 either   e        and i         this is equivalent to     k   e t  k

we deduce the following equation

similarly  we get

   k   e t  k             k   e t  k           
which is equivalent to
iwip  k   e t  k      iwip  k   e t  k
