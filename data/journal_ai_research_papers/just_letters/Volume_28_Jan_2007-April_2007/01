   introduction
merging operators aim defining beliefs goals group agents beliefs goals member group  though beliefs goals distinct notions 
merging operators typically used merging either beliefs goals  thus

      characterizing rational belief merging operators used characterizing
well rational goal merging operators 
whatever beliefs goals merged  numerous situations agents
preferences possible results merging process  i e   merged bases  
far goals concerned  agent surely satisfied individual goals chosen
goals group  case belief merging  agent interested
imposing beliefs group  i e   convincing agents   especially

example   three friends  marie  alain pierre want spend summer holidays
together  determine whether go seaside and or mountains  stay home  determine whether take long period
vacations not  goals marie go seaside mountains
long period  otherwise wants go mountains  only  stay home 
goals alain go seaside long period  go mountains
short period  finally  pierre interested going seaside
long period  otherwise prefers stay home  one uses common merging operator
defining choice group   goals group either go
seaside long period  go mountains stay home short period 
accordingly  group may choose go seaside  only  long period 
among goals marie  however  marie lies claims that  short period 
wants go mountains only  stay home  result merging process
different  indeed  case  goals group go mountains
short period  stay home  corresponds goals marie 
similarly  strategy proofness issue considered many belief merging scenarios  rational decision making typically takes account true state
world  agents conflicting beliefs it  belief merging used
determine true state world group  manipulating belief
merging process way agent change resulting beliefs group level
make close beliefs  consequence  decisions made group
may change become closer agent would made alone  instance 
assume three friends agree mountains must avoided weather
bad  beliefs group weather bad  decision go
mountains given up  pierre believes weather bad  may
tempted make weather bad accepted group level  therefore  collective
decision go mountains 
several multi agent settings agents exchange information
must make individual decisions based beliefs  many scenarios  agents tempted
get informational advantage agents  achieved gathering
much information possible hiding ones  indeed  better informed
may help agent making better decisions agents group  instance 
shoham tennenholtz        investigate non cooperative computation  agent delivers piece information  truthfully not   pieces used compute
value  commonly known  function  value given back agents 
aim agent get true value function  possible
one get it  work shoham tennenholtz         information considered
abstract level  assuming information represent beliefs function belief
merging operator  agent wants get true merged base possibly
one get it  contrastingly  scenarios  decisions made collectively
based beliefs group  agents satisfied beliefs group
   formally  model based operator  dh     using hamming distance sum aggregation function  defined section
