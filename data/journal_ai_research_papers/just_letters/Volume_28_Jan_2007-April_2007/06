recent years seen emergence internet platform multifaceted economic
interaction  technical level computer communication  routing  storage  computing  level electronic commerce many forms  studying interactions
raises new questions economics necessity taking computational considerations account  paper deals one question  design
auctions optimally restricted use small amount communication 
paper studies effect severely restricting amount communication allowed
single item auction  bidder privately knows real valued willingness pay
item  allowed send k possible messages auctioneer  must
allocate item determine price basis messages received   for
example  bidder may able send bits information  case k    t   
simplest case k      i e   bidder sends single bit information  contrast
usual auction design formulation  bidders communicate real numbers 
communicating real number may seem excessively burdensome 
several motivations studying auctions severe restrictions communication  first  auctions used allocating low level computing resources

sequential mechanisms robust several aspects  allow players
send messages various sizes order  allow auctioneer
adaptively determine order size messages based history
