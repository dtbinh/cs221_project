abstract
encouraging voters to truthfully reveal their preferences in an election has long been
an important issue  recently  computational complexity has been suggested as a means of
precluding strategic behavior  previous studies have shown that some voting protocols are
hard to manipulate  but used n p hardness as the complexity measure  such a worst case
analysis may be an insufficient guarantee of resistance to manipulation 
indeed  we demonstrate that n p hard manipulations may be tractable in the averagecase  for this purpose  we augment the existing theory of average case complexity with
some new concepts  in particular  we consider elections distributed with respect to junta
distributions  which concentrate on hard instances  we use our techniques to prove that
scoring protocols are susceptible to manipulation by coalitions  when the number of candidates is constant 

   introduction
multiagent environments are often inhabited by heterogeneous  selfish agents  continually
interacting but sharing few common goals  in such settings  agents may have diverse  or
even conflicting  preferences  therefore  reaching consensus among agents has long been
an important issue 
a general  well studied and well understood scheme for preference aggregation is voting 
the agents reveal their preferences by ranking a set of candidates  and a winner is determined
according to a voting protocol  the candidates in the election can be beliefs  plans  ephrati
  rosenschein         schedules  haynes  sen  arora    nadella         or indeed many
other less obvious entities  such as movies  ghosh  mundhe  hernandez    sen        
applications of voting  in place of other methods  are motivated by theoretical guarantees
provided by various voting protocols  for instance  ghosh et al         present a movie
recommender system that relies on voting  and makes use of voting properties to generate
convincing explanations for different recommendations 
there is  however  an obstacle that has always plagued voting theory  and social choice
theory in general  strategic behavior on the part of voters  in our setting  a self interested
agent may reveal its preferences untruthfully  if it believes this would make the final outcome
of the elections more favorable for it  manipulation is generally regarded as a problem  since
it makes the actual ballot into a complex game  where the voters react and counter react to
the strategies of others  not only does this require a larger investment of  computational 
resources by voters  it may result in a socially undesirable alternative being chosen

the celebrated gibbard satterthwaite theorem  gibbard        satterthwaite       
establishes that in any deterministic voting protocol that is non dictatorial   there are
elections where an agent is better off by voting untruthfully  consequently  it is not possible
to design a nonmanipulable voting system so as to guarantee that voters act honestly 
fortunately  it is reasonable to make the assumption that the agents are computationally bounded  therefore  although in principle an agent may be able to manipulate
an election  the computation required may be infeasible  this has motivated researchers
to study the computational complexity of manipulating voting protocols  indeed  it has
been demonstrated that several voting protocols are n p hard to manipulate by a single
voter  bartholdi  tovey    trick      a  bartholdi   orlin         hereinafter we mainly
focus our attention on a setting in which multiple manipulators collude in order to achieve
a certain outcome  in this setting  manipulation is even harder  it is known that the
coalitional manipulation problem is n p hard in numerous voting protocols  even when the
number of candidates is constant 
these results suggest that computational complexity may be the cure to the malady
called manipulation  in computer science  though  the notion of hardness is usually
considered in the sense of worst case complexity  indeed  most results on the complexity
of manipulation use n p hardness as the complexity measure  therefore  it could still be
the case that most instances of the problem are easy to manipulate  to put it differently  a
strategic voter may usually succeed in finding a beneficial manipulation  and do so efficiently 
even when the problem is hard in the worst case  if so  the truly significant issue is the
average case complexity of manipulations 
sadly  so far all attempts to design a voting protocol that is resistant to manipulations
in the average case have failed  this suggests that the manipulation problem is inherently
easy in the average case  and pushes us to analytically support this claim  we must
characterize settings and protocols that can easily be manipulated in the average case 
a relatively little known theory of average case complexity exists  trevisan         that
theory introduces the concept of distributional problems  and defines what a reduction
between distributional problems is  it is also known that there are average case complete
problems  however  the goal of the existing theory is to define when a problem is hard in
the average case  it does not provide criteria for deciding when a problem is easy 
in this paper  we engage in a novel average case analysis  based on criteria we propose 
coming up with an interesting distribution of problem instances with respect to which
the average case complexity is computed is a difficult task  and our solution may be controversial  we analyze problems whose instances are distributed with respect to a junta
distribution  such a distribution must satisfy several conditions  which  arguably  guarantee that it focuses on instances that are harder to manipulate  we consider a protocol to
be susceptible to manipulation when there is a polynomial time algorithm that can usually
manipulate it  the probability of failure  when the instances are distributed according to a
junta distribution  must be inverse polynomial  such an algorithm is known as a heuristic
polynomial time algorithm 
we use these new methods to analytically establish the following result  an important
family of voting protocols  called scoring protocols  is susceptible to coalitional manipulation
   in a dictatorial protocol  there is an agent that dictates the outcome regardless of the others choices 

   

fijunta distributions

when the number of candidates is constant  specifically  we contemplate sensitive scoring
protocols  which include such well known protocols as borda and veto  to accomplish this
task  we define a natural distribution  over the instances of a well defined coalitional
manipulation problem  and show that this is a junta distribution  furthermore  we present
the manipulation algorithm greedy  and prove that it usually succeeds with respect to
   the significance of this result stems from the fact that sensitive scoring protocols are
n p hard to manipulate  even when the number of candidates is constant  we support
our claim that junta distributions provide a good benchmark by proving that greedy also
usually succeeds with respect to the uniform distribution 
we also show that all protocols are susceptible to a certain setting of manipulation 
where the manipulator is unsure about the others votes  this result depends upon a basic
conjecture regarding junta distributions 
the paper proceeds as follows  in section    we outline some important voting protocols 
and define the manipulation problems we shall discuss  in section    we formally introduce
the tools for our average case analysis  junta distributions  heuristic polynomial time  and
susceptibility to manipulations  in section   we prove our main result  sensitive scoring
protocols are susceptible to coalitional manipulation with few candidates  in section   
we discuss the case when a single manipulator is unsure about the other voters votes  in
section   we survey related work  finally  in section    we present our conclusions and
directions for future research 

   preliminaries
we first describe some common voting protocols and formally define the manipulation
problems with which we shall deal  next  we introduce two useful lemmas from probability
theory 
    elections and manipulations
an election consists of a set c    c    c           of candidates and a set v    v    v              of
voters  who provide a total order on the candidates  an election also includes a winner
determination function from the set of all possible combinations of votes to c  we note
that throughout this paper the number of candidates is constant  so the complexity results
are in terms of the number of voters 
different voting protocols are distinguished by their winner determination functions 
the protocols we shall discuss are 
 scoring protocols  a scoring protocol is defined by vector 
    h                 c  i  such
that               c  and i  n       a candidate receives i points for each
voter which ranks it in the ith place  examples of scoring protocols are 
 plurality  
    h                  i 
 veto  
    h                  i 
 borda  
    h c       c                  i

 copeland  for each possible pair of candidates  simulate an election  a candidate wins
such a pairwise election if more voters prefer it over the opponent  a candidate gets
  point for each pairwise election it wins  and   for each pairwise election it loses 
 maximin  a candidates score in a pairwise election is the number of voters that
prefer it over the opponent  the winner is the candidate whose minimum score over
all pairwise elections is highest 
 single transferable vote  stv   the election proceeds in rounds  in each round  the
candidates score is the number of voters that rank it highest among the remaining
candidates  the candidate with the lowest score is eliminated 
remark    we assume that tie breaking is always adversarial to the manipulator  
in the case of weighted votes  a voter with weight k  n is naturally regarded as k voters
who vote unanimously  in this paper  we consider weights in         this is equivalent  since
any set of integer weights that are exponential in n can be scaled down to rational weights
in the segment         represented using o n  bits 
the main results of the paper focus on scoring protocols  we shall require the following
definition 


ff
definition    let p be a scoring protocol with parameters 
                     c    we say
that p is sensitive iff               c      c       notice the strict inequality on the
right  
in particular  borda and veto are sensitive scoring protocols 
remark    generally  from any scoring protocol with  c      c    an equivalent sensitive
scoring protocol can be obtained by subtracting  c  on a coordinate by coordinate basis
from the vector 
    moreover  observe that if a protocol is a scoring protocol but is not
sensitive  and  c       then  c        in this case  for three candidates it is equivalent to
the plurality protocol  for which all interesting formulations of the manipulation problem
are tractable even in the worst case  therefore  it is sufficient to restrict our results to
sensitive scoring protocols 
we next consider some types of manipulations  state the appropriate complexity results 
and introduce some notations 
remark    we discuss the constructive cases  where the goal is trying to make a candidate
win  as opposed to destructive manipulation  where the goal is to make a candidate lose 
constructive manipulations are always at least as hard  in the worst case sense  as their
destructive counterparts  and in some cases strictly harder  if one is able to determine
whether p can be made to win  one can also ask whether any of the other m    candidates
can be made to win  thus making p lose  
definition    in the individual manipulation  im  problem  we are given all the other
votes  and a preferred candidate p  we are asked whether there is a way for the manipulator
to cast its vote so that p wins 
   this is a standard assumption  also made  for example  in the work of conitzer and sandholm        
and conitzer  lang  and sandholm        

   

fijunta distributions

bartholdi and orlin        show that im is n p complete in single transferable vote 
provided the number of candidates is unbounded  however  the problem is in p for most
well known voting schemes  and hence will not be studied here 
in the lions share of this paper  we consider the coalitional manipulation setting  in
this scenario  the set v of voters is partitioned into two subsets  the set v     v            vn  
of manipulative  or untruthful  voters  and the set v     vn             vn n   of nonmanipulative voters  the set of candidates is c    c            cm   p   the manipulators goal is
to make the distinguished candidate p win the election  by coordinating their rankings of
candidates  in the cwm and scwm problems  the manipulators have full knowledge of
the nonmanipulators votes 
definition    in the coalitional weighted manipulation  cwm  problem  we are
given the set of voters v   v    v    the set of candidates c  the weights of all voters  and
a preferred candidate p  c  in addition  we are given the votes of the voters in v    and
assume the manipulators are aware of these votes  we are asked whether it is possible for
the manipulators in v  to cast their votes in a way that makes the preferred candidate p
win the election 
we know  conitzer   sandholm        conitzer et al         that cwm is n p complete
in borda  veto  and single transferable vote  even with   candidates  and in maximin and
copeland with at least   candidates 
the cwm version that we shall analyze  which is specifically tailored for scoring protocols  is a slightly modified version whose analysis is more straightforward 
definition    in the scoring coalitional weighted manipulation  scwm  problem  we are given an initial score s c  for each candidate c  the weights of the manipulators
in v    and a preferred candidate p  we are asked whether it is possible for the manipulators
in v  to cast their votes in a way that makes the preferred candidate p win the election 
s c  can be interpreted as cs total score from the votes in v    however  we do not
require that there exist a combination of votes that actually induces s c  for all c 
another setting that we shall shortly discuss  in section    is the scenario where the
manipulators are uncertain about the others votes 
definition    in the uncertain votes weighted evaluation  uvwe  problem  we
are given a weight for each voter  a distribution over all the votes  a candidate p  and a
number r          we are asked whether the probability of p winning is greater than r 
definition    in the uncertain votes weighted manipulation  uvwm  problem 
we are given a single manipulative voter with a weight  weights for all other voters  a
distribution over all the nonmanipulators votes  a candidate p  and a number r  where
r          we are asked whether the manipulator can cast its vote so that p wins with
probability greater than r 
if cwm is n p hard for a protocol  then uvwe and uvwm are also n p hard for
that protocol  conitzer   sandholm        
we make the assumption that the given distributions over the nonmanipulators votes
can be sampled in polynomial time  in other words  given a distribution over nonmanipulators votes  it is possible to obtain a specific instance in polynomial time

   our approach
in this section we lay the mathematical foundations required for an average case analysis
of the complexity of manipulations  all of the definitions are as general as possible  they
can be applied to the manipulation of any mechanism  not merely to the manipulation of
voting protocols 
we describe a distribution over the instances of a problem as a collection of distributions
    n  nn   where n is a distribution over the instances x such that  x    n  we wish to
analyze problems whose instances are distributed with respect to a distribution that focuses
on hard to manipulate instances  ideally  we would like to ensure that if one manages to
produce an algorithm that can usually manipulate instances according to this distinguished
difficult distribution  the algorithm would also usually succeed when the instances are
distributed with respect to most other reasonable distributions 
definition    let     n  nn be a distribution over the possible instances of an n phard manipulation problem m    is a junta distribution if and only if  has the following
properties 
   hardness  the restriction of m to  is the manipulation problem whose possible
instances are only 
 
 x    x    n  n  x       
nn

deciding this restricted problem is still n p hard

   balance  there exist a constant c     and n  n such that for all n  n  
 
 
 prxn  m  x    yes       
c
c
   dichotomy  for all n and instances x such that  x    n 
n  x    polyn  n  x      
if m is a voting manipulation problem  we also require the following property 
   symmetry  let v be a nonmanipulative voter  let c    c     p be two candidates  and
let i              m   the probability that v ranks c  in the ith place is the same as the
probability that v ranks c  in the ith place 
if m is a coalitional manipulation problem  we also require the following property 
   refinement  let x be an instance such that  x    n and n  x       if all manipulators
voted identically  then p would not be elected 
the name junta distribution comes from the idea that in such a distribution  relatively few powerful and difficult instances represent all the other problem instances 
alternatively  our intent is to have a few problematic distributions  the family of junta distributions  convincingly represent all other distributions with respect to the average case
analysis 
the first three properties are basic  and are relevant to problems of manipulating any
mechanism  the definition is modular  and additional properties may be added on top of
the basic three  in case one wishes to analyze a mechanism which is not a voting protocol 
the exact choice of properties is of extreme importance  and  as we mentioned above 
may be arguable   we shall briefly explain our choices  hardness is meant to ensure that the
junta distribution contains hard instances  balance guarantees that a trivial algorithm that
always accepts  or always rejects  has a significant chance of failure  the dichotomy property helps in preventing situations where the distribution gives a  positive but  negligible
probability to all the hard instances  and a high probability to several easy instances 
we now examine the properties that are specific to manipulation problems  the necessity of symmetry is best explained by an example  consider cwm in stv with m    
one could design a distribution where p wins if and only if a distinguished candidate loses
the first round  such a distribution could be tailored to satisfy the other conditions  but
misses many of the hard instances  in the context of scwm  we interpret symmetry in the
following way  for every two candidates c    c     p and y  r 
pr  s c      y    pr  s c      y

refinement is less important than the other four properties  but seems to help in concentrating the probability on hard instances  observe that refinement is only relevant to
coalitional manipulation  we believe that in the analysis of individual voting manipulation
problems  the first four properties are sufficient

definition     trevisan        a distributional problem is a pair hl  i where l is a decision
problem and  is a distribution over the set        of possible inputs 
informally  an algorithm is a heuristic polynomial time algorithm for a distributional
problem if it runs in polynomial time  and fails only on a small fraction of the inputs  we
now give a formal definition  this definition is inspired by trevisan         there the same
name is used for a somewhat different definition  
definition    let m be a manipulation problem and let hm  i be a distributional problem 
   an algorithm a is a deterministic heuristic polynomial time algorithm for the distributional manipulation problem hm  i if a always runs in polynomial time  and there
exists a polynomial p of degree at least   and n  n such that for all n  n

   let a be a probabilistic algorithm  which uses a random string s  a is a probabilistic heuristic polynomial time algorithm for the distributional manipulation problem

probabilistic algorithms have two potential sources of failure  an unfortunate choice of
input  or an unfortunate choice of random string s  the success or failure of deterministic
algorithms depends only on the choice of input 
we now combine all the definitions introduced in this section in an attempt to establish
when a mechanism is susceptible to manipulation in the average case  the following definition abuses notation a bit  m is used both to refer to the manipulation itself  and to the
corresponding decision problem 
definition     we say that a mechanism is susceptible to a manipulation m if there
exists a junta distribution   such that there exists a deterministic probabilistic heuristic
polynomial time algorithm for hm  i 

   formulation  proof  and justification of main result
recall  conitzer   sandholm        conitzer et al         that in borda and veto  cwm is
n p hard  even with   candidates  since borda and veto are examples of sensitive scoring
protocols  we would like to know how resistant this family of protocols really is with respect
to coalitional manipulation  in this section we use the methods from the previous section
to prove our main result 
theorem    let p be a sensitive scoring protocol  if m   o    then p   with candidates
c    p  c            cm    is susceptible to scwm 
   

fijunta distributions

intuitively  the instances of cwm  or scwm  which are hard are those that require a
very specific partitioning of the voters in v  to subsets  where each subset votes unanimously 
these instances are rare in any reasonable distribution  this insight will ultimately yield the
theorem 
the following proposition generalizes theorem   of conitzer and sandholm        and
theorem   of conitzer  lang and sandholm         and justifies our focus on the family
of sensitive scoring protocols  a stronger version of proposition   has been independently
proven by hemaspaandra and hemaspaandra         nevertheless  we include our proof 
since it will be required in proving the hardness property of a junta distribution we shall
design 
proposition    let p be a sensitive scoring protocol  then cwm in p is n p hard  even
with   candidates 
definition     in the partition problem  we are given a set of integers  ki  i t    summing
to  k  and are asked whether a subset of these integers sum to k 
it is well known that partition is n p complete 
proof of proposition    we reduce an arbitrary instance of partition to the following
cwm instance  there are   candidates  a  b  and p  in v    there are k            
voters voting a  b  p  and k             voters voting b  a  p  in v    for
every ki there is a vote of weight          ki   observe that from v    both a and b get
 k                      points 
assume first that a partition exists  let the voters in v  in one half of the partition
vote p  a  b  and let the other half vote p  b  a  by this vote  a and b each have
 k                         k                      k     
votes  while p has          k  points  thus there is a manipulation 
conversely  assume that a manipulation exists  clearly there must exist a manipulation
where all the voters in v  vote either p  a  b or p  b  a  because the manipulators do
not gain anything by not placing p at the top in a scoring protocol  in this manipulation  p
has          k  points  while a and b already have  k                      points
from v    therefore  a and b must gain less than     k              points from the voters
in v    each voter corresponding to ki contributes            ki points  it follows that
the sum of the ki corresponding to the voters voting p  a  b is less than k          and
likewise for the voters voting p  b  a  equivalently  the sum can be at most k  since
all ki are integers and       in both cases the sum must be at most k  hence  this is a
partition 
since an instance of cwm can be translated into an instance of scwm in the obvious
way  we have 
corollary    let p be a sensitive scoring protocol  it holds that scwm in p is n p hard 
even with   candidates

    a junta distribution
let w v  denote the weight of voter v  and let w denote the total weight of the votes in
v    p is a sensitive scoring protocol  we denote  v      n  the size of v  is the size of the
instance 
consider a distribution     n  nn over the instances of scwm in p   with m    
candidates p  c            cm   where each n is induced by the following sampling algorithm 
   fix a polynomial q   q n  
   v  t   randomly and independently choose w v           up to o n  bits of precision  i e   in intervals of    q n    
   i              m   randomly and independently choose s ci            w    w    up
to o n  bits of precision  
remark    although the distribution is in fact discrete  the weights  for example  are
uniformly distributed in        q n       q n       q n                we treat it below as continuous
for the sake of clarity 
we assume that s p       i e   all voters in s rank p last  this assumption is not a
restriction  if it holds for a candidate c that s c   s p   then candidate c will surely lose 
since the manipulators all rank p first  therefore  if s p       we may simply normalize
the scores by subtracting s p  from the scores of all candidates  this is equivalent to our
assumption 
remark    we believe that  is the most natural distribution with respect to which
coalitional manipulation in scoring protocols should be studied  even if one disagrees with
the exact definition of a junta distribution   should satisfy many reasonable conditions
one could produce 
we shall  of course   presently  prove that the distribution possesses the properties of a
junta distribution 
proposition    let p be a sensitive scoring protocol  then  is a junta distribution for
scwm in p with c    p  c            cm    and m   o    
proof  we first observe that symmetry is obviously satisfied  and dichotomy holds by remark   
the proof of the hardness property relies on the reduction from partition in proposition    the reduction generates instances x of cwm in p with   candidates  where
w            k  and
s a    s b 
   k                     
           w           
   

fijunta distributions

for some k that originates in the partition instance  these instances satisfy       w 
s a   s b     w   it follows that   x       after scaling down the weights   
we now prove that  has the balance property  if for all i  s ci            m w  
then clearly there is no manipulation  since at least   w points are given by the voters in
v  to the undesirable candidates c            cm   this happens with probability at least m m  
on the other hand  consider the situation where for all i 
s ci        

m    
   w  
m 

   

this occurs with probability at least  m    m   intuitively  if the manipulators could distribute
their votes in such a way that each undesirable candidate is ranked last in exactly   mfraction of the votes  this would be a successful manipulation  each undesirable candidate
would gain at most an additional m 
m   w points  unfortunately  this is usually not the
case  but the following condition is sufficient for a successful manipulation  assuming condition     holds   partition the manipulators to m disjoint subsets p            pm  w l o g  of
size n m   and denote by wpi the total weight of the votes in pi   the condition is that for
all i              m  
      m        n m  wpi         m        n m 

   

this condition is sufficient  because if the voters in pi all rank ci last  the fraction of the
votes in v  which gives ci points is at most 
 m           m 
m    
   
 
 m           m         m
m  m 
hence the number of points ci gains from the manipulators is at most 
m

  p wins

the voters in v    according to some order  each rank p first  and the rest of the candidates by their current score  the candidate with the lowest current score is ranked highest 
greedy accepts if and only if p wins this election 
this algorithm  designed specifically for scoring protocols  is a realization of an abstract
greedy algorithm  at each stage  voter vi ranks the undesirable candidates in an order that
minimizes the highest score that any undesirable candidate obtains after the current vote 
if there is a tie among several permutations  the voter chooses the option such that the
second highest score is as low as possible  etc  in any case  every manipulator always ranks
p first 
remark    this abstract scheme might also be appropriate for protocols such as maximin
and copeland  similarly to scoring protocols  in these two protocols the manipulators are
always better off by ranking p first  in addition  the abstract greedy algorithm can be
applied to maximin and copeland since the result of an election is based on the score each
candidate has  unlike stv  for example  
remark    greedy can be considered a generalization of the greedy algorithm given by
bartholdi et al       a  
in the following lemmas  a stage in the execution of the algorithm is an iteration of the
for loop 
lemma    if there exists a stage i  during the execution of greedy  and two candidates
a  b    p  such that
 si   a   si   b       
   
then for all i  i  it holds that  si  a   si  b

proof  the proof is by induction on i  the base of the induction is given by equation     
assume that  si  a   si  b        and without loss of generality  si  a   si  b   by the
algorithm  voter vi   ranks b higher than a  and therefore 
si    b   si    a      

   

since p is always ranked first  and the weight of each vote is at most    b gains at most  
points  therefore 
si    b   si    a      
   
combining equations     and     completes the proof 
lemma    let p    a  b  c  and suppose that there exists a stage i  such that si   a  
si   b   and a stage i   i  such that si   b   si   a   then for all i  i  it holds that
 si  a   si  b       
proof  assume that there exists a stage i  such that si   a   si   b   and a stage i   i 
such that si   b   si   a   w l o g  i    i   otherwise at stage i  it holds that si   b    si   a  
and then we finish by lemma     then there must be a stage i  such that i   i    i  and
si   a   si   b  but si      b   si      a   since the weight of each vote is at most    b gains at
most   points by voter vi       hence the conditions of lemma   hold for stage i    which
implies that for all i  i     si  a   si  b        in particular  i   i   
lemma    let p be a sensitive scoring protocol  and assume greedy errs on an instance
of scwm in p which has a successful manipulation  then there is d                 m   and
a subset of candidates d    cj            cjd    such that

proof  for the right inequality  for any d candidates  even ifp
all voters in v  rank them last
in every vote  the total points distributed among them is w di   m  i   if this inequality
does not hold  there must be some candidate ci that gains at least   w  s ci   points
from the manipulators  implying that this candidate has at least   w points  however  p
also has at most   w points  and we assumed that there is a successful manipulation  a
contradiction 
for the left inequality  assume the algorithm erred  then at some stage i    there is a
candidate cj  who has a total of at least   w points  w l o g  only one candidate passes this
threshold simultaneously   denote v      v    v            vi     and let wv   be the total weight
of the voters in v     voter vi  did not rank cj  last  since m        and thus ranking a
candidate last gives it no points  we have that there is another candidate cj    such that 
si     cj     si     cj     by lemma    si   cj     si   cj         and thus si   cj       w     
if these candidates were not always ranked last by the voters of v     there must be another
candidate cj  who was ranked strictly higher by some voter in v     w l o g  higher than cj   
therefore  we have from lemma   that  si   cj     si   cj         and so cj  has a total of at
least   w     points  by inductively continuing this reasoning  we obtain a subset d of
d candidates  possibly d   m   who were always ranked in the d last places by the voters

    algorithm   and the uniform distribution
in the previous subsection we have seen that algorithm   is a heuristic polynomial time
algorithm with respect to our junta distribution    we have argued that this suggests
that the algorithm also does well with respect to other distributions  in this subsection
we support this claim by showing that algorithm   is also a heuristic polynomial time
algorithm with respect to the uniform distribution over instances of scwm 
for the sake of consistency with previous results  we shall consider a uniform distribution
over votes which may produce unfeasible ballots  nevertheless  equivalent results can be
obtained for feasible  discrete  distributions over votes  if so  in this subsection we assume
each voter vi  v    where  v      n   awards each candidate c  c  including p  a score
independently and uniformly distributed in          further  we assume that the votes are
unweighted  this does not limit the generality of our results  since we use lower bounds
that depend only on the total weight of the manipulators in v   where  v      n   the
individual weights are of no consequence 
we distinguish between two cases in our results  depending on the ratio between the
number of nonmanipulators n and the number of manipulators n 

   n  n     p n  for some polynomial p of degree at least   

   n  n   p log n  for some polynomial p of degree at least   
the middle ground which is not covered by the two cases remains an open problem 
before we tackle the first case  we require a lower bound of sorts on the probability that
an instance of scwm is very easy to decide  since the manipulators in v  can award a
candidate at most   n points  the manipulators cannot make a candidate c beat another
candidate c  if s c     s c      n  in particular  if for every two candidates c and c  it holds
that  s c   s c         n  then the manipulators cannot affect the outcome of the election 
moreover  algorithm   always decides such an instance correctly  if s p    s c  for some
c  then the instance is a no instance  and in this case the algorithm never errs  and if
s p    s c  for all c  then the instance is a yes instance  and any vote of the manipulators
is sufficient to make p win  we have obtained the following lemma 
lemma    consider an instance of scwm where for all c  c   c   s c   s c         n 
then the instance is a yes instance iff s p    s c  for all candidates c    p  and the
instance is correctly decided by algorithm   
this lemma  together with the central limit theorem  yields the first result 
proposition    algorithm   is a heuristic polynomial time algorithm
with respect to the

uniform distribution over instances of scwm which satisfy n  n     p n  for some
polynomial p n  of degree at least

by our assumption regarding the ratio of manipulators and nonmanipulators  this is
inverse polynomial in n  rolling back  we obtain that the probability that the algorithm is

vote that makes p win  let c    c    p  be the set of undesirable candidates that had
maximal score among the candidates in c    p  at some stage during the execution of the
algorithm  by the algorithm  at any stage some candidate from c   is ranked last by a
voter in v    i e   is given   points  the other candidates in c   receive at any stage at most
  points  therefore  the total number of points the candidates in c   receive from the

   the case of uncertainty about votes
so far we have dealt with a setting where an entire coalition of manipulators is trying to
influence the outcome of the election  using complete knowledge of the nonmanipulators
votes  this section is a short aside  in which we discuss a setting where there is a single
manipulator with uncertainty about others votes  we shall prove 
theorem    let p be a voting protocol such that there exists a junta distribution p over
the instances of uvwm in p   with the following property  r is uniformly distributed in
        then p   with candidates c    p  c            cm    m   o     is susceptible to uvwm 
recall that in uvwm  we ask whether the manipulator can cast his vote so that p
wins with probability greater than r  the existence of a junta distribution with r uniformly distributed is a very weak requirement  it is even quite natural to have r uniformly
distributed   in fact  the following claim is very likely to be true 
conjecture    let p be a voting protocol for which uvwm is n p hard  then there exists
a junta distribution p over the instances of uvwm in p   with r uniformly distributed in
       
if this conjecture is indeed true  we have that all voting protocols are susceptible to
uvwm  if for some reason the conjecture is not true with respect to our definition of junta
distributions  then perhaps the definition is too restrictive and should be modified accordingly  we also remark that similar results can be derived for destructive manipulations by
analogous proofs 
to prove theorem    we first present a helpful procedure  which decides uvwe  w
 
denotes the vector of given weights  and  is the given distribution over all the votes  the
number of voters is  v     n 
sample c    p  c            cm    w

   count    
   for i     to n  do

calculate the result of the election using the sampled votes
  
if p won then
  
count   count    
  
end if
   end for
   if count n    r then
   
return  
    else
   
return  
    end if
sample samples the given distribution on the votes n  times  and calculates the winner
of the election each time  if p won more than an r fraction of the elections then the procedure
accepts  otherwise it rejects

lemma     let p be a voting protocol  and m be uvwm in p with c    p  c            cm   
m   o     furthermore  let  be a distribution over the instances of uvwm  with r
uniformly distributed in         then sample and manipulate is a probabilistic heuristic
polynomial time algorithm for hm  i 
proof  for each independent call to sample  the chance of failure is inverse polynomial 
by applying the union bound we have that the probability of sample failing on any of the
 
 m       invocations is at most  m       polyn
  which is still inverse polynomial since m is
constant  the lemma now follows from the fact that there is a manipulation if and only if
there is a permutation of candidates  such that if the manipulator votes according to this
permutation  the chance of p winning is greater than r 
notice that sample and manipulate is indeed polynomial by the fact that m   o    
and we assumed that the given distribution over the votes can be sampled in polynomial
time 

   related work
computational aspects of voting have long been investigated  a pivotal issue is the problem
of winner determination  voting protocols designed to satisfy theoretical desiderata may be
quite complex  consequently  deciding who won an election governed by such protocols may
be a computationally hard problem  bartholdi  tovey    trick      b   another concern
is strategic behavior on the part of the officials conducting the election  who may add or
remove voters and candidates from the slate  the computational complexity of strategically
controlling an election has been analyzed by bartholdi  tovey and trick        
that said  the main issue with respect to strategic behavior in voting has always been
manipulation by voters  there is a growing body of work which deals with the worst case
complexity of manipulating elections  a seminal paper is that of bartholdi  tovey and
trick      a   the authors suggested  for the first time  that computational complexity
is an obstacle that strategic voters must overcome  indeed  although it is shown that
many voting protocols can be efficiently manipulated  it is nevertheless proven that there
is a voting protocol  namely second order copeland  which is n p hard to manipulate 
bartholdi and orlin        have demonstrated that the prominent single transferable vote
 stv  protocol is n p hard to manipulate 
even in voting protocols that are easy to manipulate  difficulty can be artificially introduced by adding a preround  conitzer   sandholm         the candidates are paired  and
in each pairing of two candidates  the candidate that loses the pairwise election between the
two is eliminated  plurality  borda and maximin have been shown to be hard to manipulate
when augmented with a preround  in more detail  these protocols are n p hard to manipulate when the scheduling of the preround precedes voting   p hard when voting precedes
scheduling  and pspace hard when voting and scheduling are interleaved  elkind and
lipmaa      a  induce hardness of manipulation using a more general approach  hybrid
voting protocols that are hard to manipulate are constructed by composing several base
protocols  the base protocols may be individually easy to manipulate 
another case where manipulation may be hard  in the worst case  is when the election
has multiple winners instead of a single winner  as is the case in elections to a parliament
   

fijunta distributions

or an assembly  procaccia  rosenschein  and zohar        demonstrate that manipulation
in cumulative voting  a major protocol for multi winner elections  is n p hard 
the coalitional manipulation problem  which has been the focus of this paper  has first
been investigated by conitzer and sandholm               in this setting  the computational
problem is made more difficult by the fact that numerous manipulators must coordinate
their strategy  and additionally  by the introduction of weighted voting   while the hardness
results in the abovementioned papers relied on the number of candidates being unbounded 
conitzer and sandholm present hardness results in the coalitional manipulation setting with
a constant number of candidates  with respect to several central voting protocols 
elkind and lipmaa      b  extend the preround approach presented by conitzer and
sandholm        to the coalitional manipulation setting  in this context  they provide
an early impossibility result regarding the average case complexity of manipulations  the
authors present a family of preference profiles in which a manipulator can always improve
the outcome by voting strategically  regardless of the preround schedule  this result applies
only when seeking to make manipulation hard by adding a preround  further  one would
usually not expect distributions over the instances of the coalitional manipulation problem
to give this family of preference profiles significant probability  as it is extremely restricted 
a recent result regarding average case complexity of manipulation  which complements
our own  was presented by conitzer and sandholm         the authors put forward two
properties of instances of the coalitional manipulation problem  and demonstrate that any
instance that satisfies both properties is easy to manipulate  the first property is that the
instance satisfy a weaker form of monotonicity  this property seems very natural  the
second property is that manipulators be able to make one of exactly two candidates win
the election  and this property is much harder to accept  in order to justify the second
property  the authors show that in many voting protocols the property usually holds  but
only with respect to a specific family of distributions 
this result has two main shortcomings compared to ours  first  the arguments in favor
of the second property mentioned above are empirical rather than analytical  second  the
family of distributions considered is not special in any sense  which is not the case
here  in other words  the family of distributions in question is a priori not especially hard
to manipulate  on the other hand  their result has some advantages  unlike ours  it does
not depend on the number of candidates being constant  although in all experiments the
number of candidates and manipulators is extremely small compared to the number of
voters   and  arguably  does not require significant restrictions on the voting rule 

   conclusions
to date  all results on the complexity of manipulation only considered the worst case  although better than nothing  such results are a weak guarantee of resistance to manipulation 
a truly worthy goal is to design a voting protocol that is hard to manipulate in the average
case while being plausible from a social choice point of view  but so far all attempts have
failed 
motivated by this  we have presented a specific manipulation setting that is worst case
hard but average case tractable  we have first prepared the ground for our average case
analysis by borrowing several concepts from the existing theory and introducing several

new ideas  the key to our approach is junta distributions  which presumably concentrate
on hard instances of the coalitional manipulation problem  we have considered a voting
protocol to be susceptible to coalitional manipulation if there is an algorithm that almost
always correctly decides the problem  when the instances are distributed with respect to a
junta distribution 
our main result states that sensitive scoring protocols are susceptible to coalitional manipulation when the number of candidates is constant  although they are hard to manipulate
even when the number of candidates is constant 
    discussion
our results  first and foremost  suggest that worst case hardness is indeed not a strong
enough barrier against manipulation  this motivates further research regarding averagecase complexity of manipulations  at the expense of future investigations into worst case
complexity 
moreover  in our view  our main result provides further evidence that a voting rule
that is average case hard to manipulate does not exist  at the very least  it suggests that
scoring protocols cannot form the basis of a protocol which is usually strategy resistant 
nevertheless  this negative result can be circumvented in many ways 
first  it can be circumvented via the voting protocol  scoring protocols are among
the easiest voting systems to manipulate  as their structure is quite simple and they can be
concisely represented  other protocols  say stv  are inherently harder to deal with  in fact 
recall that stv is worst case hard to manipulate when there is only one manipulator  but
an unbounded number of candidates   bartholdi   orlin         whereas scoring protocols
are most certainly not 
second  it can be circumvented via the setting  our results hold only when one contemplates coalitional manipulation with a constant number of candidates  a constant number
of candidates is known to guarantee worst case hardness  but it may be the case that allowing for a large number of candidates would make the difference with respect to average case
analysis 
third  it can be circumvented via the distribution  traditional average case complexity
theory deals with hardness of distributional problems  in other words  a specific distribution
is considered  junta distributions were chosen in a way that if one of them can usually be
manipulated by an algorithm  presumably the same algorithm would be successful with
other distributions  this view was supported by the results in section      but at this point
there are no strong theoretical guarantees  and it may certainly be true that there is a
specific distribution over the instances of the manipulation problem which is average case
hard to manipulate  even when a scoring protocol is considered 
section     deserves an aside  the lemmas established there show that  with respect
to the uniform distribution  even a completely trivial algorithm can usually decide the
coalitional manipulation problem  if the number of manipulators is small  less than the
square root of the number of voters   the manipulators can rarely influence the outcome
of the election  therefore  if p was elected by the nonmanipulators as well  it is usually
correct to answer yes  and if not  it is usually correct to answer no  if the number
of manipulators is large  it is usually correct to answer yes  there is a manipulation

recent preliminary results in this direction imply that this is true for several families of
voting rules  and under a large variety of distributions  it is very important to note that
such a simple algorithm would not work well with respect to the junta distribution   
    future research
in our view  a central contribution of the paper is that it establishes a framework that
can be used to study the average case complexity of manipulations in other protocols  and
even more generally  in other mechanisms  indeed  voting is the most general method of
preference aggregation  but the same issues are also relevant when one considers mechanisms
in more specific settings  one such mechanism of which we are aware  whose manipulation is
n p hard  is presented by bachrach and rosenschein         all the definitions in section  
are sufficiently general to deal with different mechanisms for preference aggregation 
there is still room for debate as to the exact definition of a junta distribution  it may
also be the case that there are unconvincing distributions that satisfy all of the  current 
conditions of a junta distribution  it might prove especially fruitful to show that a heuristic
polynomial time algorithm with respect to a junta distribution is guaranteed to have the
same property with respect to some easy distributions  such as the uniform distribution 
an issue of great importance is coming up with natural criteria to decide when a manipulation problem is hard in the average case  the traditional definition of average case
completeness is very difficult to work with in general  is there a satisfying definition that
applies specifically to the case of manipulations  once the subject is more fully understood  this understanding will surely shed more light on the great mystery  are there voting
protocols that are usually hard to manipulate
