historically acknowledged reasoning actions change community 
intuitiveness logical domain description cannot fully automated  moreover 
logical theory  action theories may evolve  thus knowledge engineers need
revision methods help accommodating new incoming information behavior
actions adequate manner  present work changing action domain
descriptions multimodal logic  contribution threefold  first revisit semantics
action theory contraction proposed previous work  giving robust operators
express minimal change based notion distance kripke models  second
give algorithms syntactical action theory contraction establish correctness
respect semantics action theories satisfy principle modularity
investigated previous work  since modularity ensured every action theory
and  show here  needs computed evolution domain
description  represent limitation method studied  finally
state agm like postulates action theory contraction assess behavior
operators respect them  moreover  address revision counterpart
action theory change  showing benefits semantics contraction
