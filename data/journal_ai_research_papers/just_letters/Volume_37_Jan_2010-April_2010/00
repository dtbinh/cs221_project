abstract
computation relatedness two fragments text automated manner requires
taking account wide range factors pertaining meaning two fragments convey 
pairwise relations words  without doubt  measure relatedness
text segments must take account lexical semantic relatedness words 
measure captures well aspects text relatedness may help many tasks 
text retrieval  classification clustering  paper present new approach measuring
semantic relatedness words based implicit semantic links  approach exploits word thesaurus order devise implicit semantic links words  based
approach  introduce omiotis  new measure semantic relatedness texts
capitalizes word to word semantic relatedness measure  sr  extends measure
relatedness texts  gradually validate method  first evaluate performance
semantic relatedness measure individual words  covering word to word similarity relatedness  synonym identification word analogy  then  proceed evaluating
performance method measuring text to text semantic relatedness two tasks  namely
sentence to sentence similarity paraphrase recognition  experimental evaluation shows
proposed method outperforms every lexicon based method semantic relatedness selected
tasks used data sets  competes well corpus based hybrid approaches
