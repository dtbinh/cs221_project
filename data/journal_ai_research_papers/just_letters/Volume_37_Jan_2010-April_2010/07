   introduction
multiattribute trading mechanisms extend traditional  price only mechanisms facilitating negotiation set predefined attributes representing various non price aspects
deal  rather negotiate fully specified good service  multiattribute
mechanism delays commitment particular configurations extracts sufficient information traders preferences  example  companys procurement department may
run multiattribute auction select supplier hard drives  supplier offers may
evaluated price offer  features volume  rpm 
access time  latency  transfer rate  on  addition  suppliers may offer contracts
differing terms warranty  delivery time  service 
order account traders preferences  auction mechanism must extract evaluative information complex domain multidimensional configurations  constructing
communicating complete preference specification pose severe burden even

additivity reduces complexity preference specification exponentially  compared general discrete case   precludes expression interdependencies among
attributes  practice  however  interdependencies among natural attributes quite
common  example  hard drive buyer may exhibit complementary preferences
volume access time  since performance effect salient much data involved   may view strong warranty good substitute high reliability ratings 
similarly  sellers production characteristics easily violate additivity  example
decreasing access time technically difficult higher capacity drives  cases

    multiattribute preferences utility
let denote space possible outcomes    preference relation  weak total order 
  let    a              be set attributes describing   attribute
domain d a   ni   d ai    capital letters denote subsets attributes  small
latin letters  with without numeric subscripts  denote specific attributes  x   a x 
 and variations     indicate specific outcome   instantiation subset
attributes denoted using prime signs  as     numerical superscript  as     
particular    projection instantiations   represent
instantiation subsets x  time use sequence instantiation symbols

      v   v      iff

definition    measurable value function   measurable value function  mvf 
value function u                           
following holds

hence order differences values u   correspond exactly order
preference differences  note mvf used value function representing
         iff           
            
auction theory mechanism design  traders preferences usually represented
using quasi linear value function  v   p    u   p  p represents monetary
outcome   cardinal value function u   expresses strength preference 
difference u      u       corresponds additional amount trader willing pay
  relative      example    represents red mercedes sunroof    
denotes blue subaru sunroof  u      u       strength preference
mercedes configuration subaru  mercedes costs p  subaru p    
according v   p  trader prefers mercedes deal iff u      u       p  p    
fact  u   easily shown mvf  preference differences correspond differences willingness to pay  engel   wellman         reason 
use mvf basis utility work  assume traders willingness to pay
 wtp  functions constitute mvf 
reasoning full outcomes hard several ways  notably  difficult
humans compare outcomes many dimensions  complex machines store
analyze preferences number outcomes exponential number
attributes  therefore useful consider preferences joint product
a  considering rest attributes fixed predefined values 
order often referred ceteris paribus preference orderone partial outcome
preferred another else equal 
definition    conditional preference   partial outcome   conditionally preferred
 
 
 
partial outcome   given           conditional preference order
 
 
 
given denoted  y     hence       abbreviated    y      
general  conditional preferences may depend particular assignment chosen
rest attributes  precisely          could still find       
  
 
     case  one needs maintain conditional preference
orders  y    y      hence general scheme might yield computational
benefits  fortunately  many cases one identify subsets preference
reversal occur  preference order invariant instantiation
 
definition    preferential independence   preferential independent  pi   
 
  
written pi y                  y     iff    y   
  
first order preferential independence  fopi   independence single attribute
rest  natural assumption many domains  example  typical purchase decisions greater quantity higher quality desirable regardless assignments
attributes  preferential independence higher order  however  requires invariance
tradeoffs among attributes respect variation others  stringent independence condition  mpi condition  defined below  global set

gai auctions preferences non additive gai  allowed us quantify

gai subutilities exhibit internal structures  fopi  efficiency loss additive
approximation less severe  cases benefit accurate gai model still
significant  using additive approximation may reasonable approach gai

tradeoff expressive compactness preference representation ubiquitous applications involving preferences  one hand  would ask users
little possible information  other  users preference statements may accurate even meaningful cannot express important dependencies  problems
could useful experimentally compare accuracy gai additive representations  experimental methodologies used study  particular generation
random structured utility functions  finding additive approximation gai functions  may therefore prove applicable broader class preference research problems

follow sb 
let s  play arbitrary strategy   sb sellers s            sn   s  win
