idea  shown previous work  yu   ballard        liu  chai    jin        
parallel data visual perception spoken utterances used unsupervised
approaches automatically identify mappings words visual entities
thus acquire new words  previous approaches provide promising direction 
mainly rely co occurrence words visual entities completely unsupervised manner  however  human machine conversation  different types
extra information related human language behaviors characteristics conversation
systems  although extra information potentially provide supervision guide
word acquisition process improve performance  systematically explored

studies found significant temporal regularities mentioned objects

naming tasks  onset word begins approximately one second speaker

        ms articulation object name begins  eyes move next object relevant task  meyer et al          findings suggest eyes move
mentioned objects corresponding words uttered  although language

incorporated previous approaches 
second  practical conversational systems always existing knowledge application domains vocabularies  knowledge base acquired development
time  either authored domain experts automatically learned available data 
although existing knowledge rather limited desired enhanced automatically online  e g   automated vocabulary acquisition   provides important
information structure domain existing vocabularies

third  although psycholinguistic studies provide us sound empirical basis
assuming eye movements predictive speech  gaze behavior interactive
setting much complex  different types eye movements  kahneman 
       naturally occurring eye gaze speech production may serve different
functions  example  engage conversation manage turn taking  nakano

user could talking objects previously seen display something
completely unrelated object user looking at  therefore using speechgaze pairs word acquisition detrimental  type gaze mostly useful

word acquisition kind reflects underlying attention tightly links
content co occurring speech  thus  automatically recognizing closely coupled speech
gaze streams online conversation word acquisition important  however 
examined previous work 
address three issues  developed new approaches automatic word
acquisition     incorporate findings user language behavior psycholinguistic
studies  particular temporal alignment spoken words eye gaze      utilize
existing domain knowledge      automatically identify closely coupled speech

word acquisition improving language understanding human machine conversation 
following sections  first introduce domain data collection investigation  describe enhanced models word acquisition incorporate

wordnet  certainly desirable  limitation readily addressed
changing way word probability distribution tailored semantic relatedness
 in section       section         example  one simple way keep probability
mass words wordnet tailor distribution words
occur wordnet based semantic relatedness object 
second  current approach  acquired words limited words
recognized speech recognizer  shown section        speech recognition
performance rather poor experiments  partly due lack language
models specifically trained domain  approaches improve speech recognition 
example  based referential semantic language model described  schuler  wu

another limitation current approaches incapable acquiring

    conclusions
motivated psycholinguistic findings  investigate use eye gaze automatic word acquisition multimodal conversational systems  paper presents several
enhanced models incorporate user language behavior  domain knowledge  conversation context word acquisition  experiments shown enhanced
models significantly improve word acquisition performance 
recent advancement eye tracking technology made available non intrusive eye
tracking devices tolerate head motion provide high tracking quality  integrating eye tracking conversational interfaces longer beyond reach  believe
incorporating eye gaze automatic word acquisition provides another potential approach
improve robustness human machine conversation
