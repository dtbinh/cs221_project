   preliminaries
assume countable number propositional variables x    x        standard connectives             literal either variable xi  positive literal  negation
xi  negative literal   propositional formula well formed formula built finite
number variables connectives  v ar   denotes set variables occur
propositional formula   clause finite disjunction literals  propositional formula conjunctive normal form  cnf  written finite conjunction
clauses  instance     x  x     x  x  x    cnf  dual notions
clause cnf notions term  finite conjunction literals  disjunctive
normal form  dnf   finite disjunction terms  
assignment set variables v set literals contains exactly one
literal per variable v   model propositional formula assignment
v ar   satisfies usual way  assigns   xi iff xi m 
write tuple  e g         x    x    x    x     write m i  value assigned
xi m  m   set models propositional formula  
said satisfiable m        formula said imply propositional formula  
 written        m   m      generally  identify sets models boolean
functions  use notations  negation   m   disjunction  on 
notion projection important rest paper  assignment
set variables v v   write selecta  m  set literals
formed upon a  e g   select x   x                 projecting set assignments onto subset
variables intuitively consists replacing assignment selecta  m  
sake simplicity however  define projection set models built upon
set variables m  yields following definition 
definition    projection  let v    x            xn   set variables  set assignments v v   projection onto set assignments v
m a    m   m  m  selecta  m      selecta  m   
instance  let                                  set assignments v  
 x    x    x    x     let    x    x     easily seen
m a                                                                             
since  selecta  m    m                 
remark projection set models formula onto set variables
set models general consequence independent

   model abduction

first two classes proved polynomial general method solving abduction
problems notion prime implicants  last one obvious since information
explicitely given input  four others exhibited ad hoc algorithms 
let us mention amilhastre et al         study related problems
general framework multivalued theories instead propositional formulas  i e

   general algorithm
give principle algorithm  let us stress first that  well as  e g   marquis
construction  marquis        section       outline matches point point definition
best explanation  ideas marquis anyway rather close 
first interested hypotheses every abducible x occurs  either
negated unnegated   let us call full hypotheses  note indeed every explanation
e abduction problem subconjunction full explanation f   indeed  since e
definition e satisfiable implies   suffices let f selecta  m 
model e   minimization f discussed later on 
 

filogic based abduction

proposition   let        a  abduction problem  f full hypothesis  
f explanation exists assignment v ar  
f   selecta  m  m    m     a  
proof assume first f explanation    i  exists assignment
v ar      f   thus f   selecta  m  m     ii  f      i e  
f unsatisfiable  thus f
   selecta  m    m      thus
   m     a  
thus  m     a   conversely  m    m     a let f   selecta  m  
 i  since m    f satisfiable   ii  since
   m     a  
 
 
m    selecta  m     f   thus f unsatisfiable  thus
f     

thus characterized full explanations given abduction problem 
minimizing explanation f problem  since following greedy procedure 
given selman levesque        reduces f best explanation  
every literal   f
f         f f      endif 
endfor 
note depending order literals   f considered result may
different  cases best explanation  
finally  give general algorithm computing best explanation given
abduction problem        a   correctness follows directly proposition   
  propositional formula m       m    m     a  
  unsatisfiable return explanation 
else
model    
f selecta  m  
minimize f  
return f  
endif 

   polynomial classes

hand affine approximations knowledge base made small
efficiently learnable  zanuttini         show projecting affine formula onto
subset variables quite easy too  enabling algorithm run polynomial time 
proof following lemma easily obtained gaussian elimination  curtis        
triangulate variables put rightmost  keep equations
formed upon a  full details given technical report version  zanuttini        
lemma   let affine formula containing k equations  v ar   
affine formula m      m    a containing k equations
computed time o k    v ar     
proposition   represented affine formula containing k equations

sketch proof easily seen affine formula  containing k     k equations
n variables  computed time linear size   formula
projected onto time o  k   k      n   straightforwardly get disjunction
k   k   linear equations  m     a   use distributivity
solving satisfiability problem algorithm  recall sat solved time
o k   n  affine formula k equations n variables elimination method
gauss  curtis         remaining operations straightforward 

note variables  literals clauses special cases disjunctions linear equations 
    dnfs
though class dnf formulas good computational properties  abduction
remains hard problem whole  even additional restrictions  recall
tautology problem one deciding whether given dnf formula represents
identically true function  problem conp complete 
proposition   deciding whether least one explanation given abduction
problem      a  np complete given dnf  even variable
     v ar   
sketch proof membership np obvious  since deduction dnfs polynomial 
easily seen tautological abduction problem  
 x   x  v ar    explanation  x variable occuring  see dnf
 x  implication x    x  dnf  get result 

however  represented dnf projecting onto easy  indeed  properties projection show suffices cancel literals formed upon a 
consequently  dnf containing k terms  dnf m      m    a
containing k terms computed time o k v ar     
thus show subclasses class dnfs allow polynomial
abduction  state first result quite generally  note assumptions

one positive literal per term  similarly  horn renamable dnfs  i e  
turned horn dnf replacing variables negation 
simplifying double negations  everywhere formula   dnfs  dnfs
two literals per term  omit proof following proposition  since essentially
proposition    simply follow execution algorithm  
proposition   let class dnfs stable removal occurrences
literals tautology problem polynomial  restricted belong
d  clause subset v ar    searching best explanation
       a  done polynomial time 
thus establish abduction tractable  among others  horn renamable
dnf  including horn reverse horn cases   dnf  clause 
finally  let us point similar proof obtain polynomiality
problems obtained strengthening restriction proposition    
weakening  
proposition   represented horn  resp  reverse horn  dnf k terms
positive  resp  negative  cnf k   clauses  subset v ar   
searching best explanation        a  done time o  k    a  kk   n  
holds represented positive  resp  negative  dnf k terms
horn  resp  reverse horn  cnf k   clauses 
note variables  literals terms special cases  reverse  horn
cnfs  variables  positive  resp  negative  clauses positive  resp  negative 
terms special cases positive  resp  negative  cnfs 

   discussion perspectives
general algorithm presented note allows us derive new polynomial restrictions
abduction problems  even discussed here  lack space  allows
unify previously known restrictions  such  cnf  dnf 
monotone cnf given clause   following list summarizes main new
polynomial restrictions 
given affine formula disjunction linear equations  proposition   
horn renamable dnf given clause  proposition   
 dnf given clause  proposition   
horn  reverse horn  dnf positive  negative  cnf  proposition   
negative  positive  dnf reverse horn  horn  cnf  proposition    
moreover  even guarantee efficiency general case presentation
algorithm depend syntactic form   uses standard
operations boolean functions  projection  conjunction  negation

another interesting feature algorithm minimization computes

roughly delay models formula representing       however 
course  guarantee two would minimized
