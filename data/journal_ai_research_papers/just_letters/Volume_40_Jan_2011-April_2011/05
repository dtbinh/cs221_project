abstract
bound propagation important artificial intelligence technique used constraint
programming tools deal numerical constraints  typically embedded within
search procedure  branch prune  used every node search tree narrow
search space  critical fast  procedure invokes constraint
propagators common fixpoint reached  known algorithms
pseudo polynomial worst case time complexity  fast indeed variables
small numerical range  well known problem prohibitively
slow ranges large  important question therefore whether stronglypolynomial algorithms exist compute common bound consistent fixpoint set
constraints  paper answers question  particular show fixpoint
computation fact np complete  even restricted binary linear constraints 

   introduction overview main results
constraint solvers typically solve problems interleaving search propagation  propagation iterative procedure which  iteration  propagates every constraint
problem narrow domains variables  iteration stops constraint
changes domains variables  case  propagation reached common fixpoint constraints  iterative algorithm guaranteed compute fixpoint
polynomial time propagating constraint takes polynomial time domains
variables defined lists values  often  however  inconvenient infeasible list values explicitly  instead domains defined lower upper bounds 
focus representation  variables taking integer values  setting 
computing fixpoint iterative algorithm may require exponential time even
constraint propagated polynomial time  show exponential behaviour
simply due iterative algorithm suboptimal  rather intrinsic
