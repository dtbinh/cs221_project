   introduction
standard propositional logic  classical entailment distinguish among formulas
entail another formula  example  let x  z three atoms 
neither x z classically entails x y  however  x seems intuitively closer x
z  reason that  x considered union two parts x y 
x exactly one them  hand  z completely irrelevant x y 
example motivates us consider notion partial entailment  comparison classical entailment  partial entailment intends capture partial satisfaction
relationship two formulas respect background theory  standard propositional logic  formula p entails another formula q respect formula set
intuitively means circumstance   p true q true 
contrast  formula p partially entails another formula q respect formula set
intuitively means that  circumstance   p true part q
true  partial entailment widely used everyday life  example  suppose
student laura wants get score hd subjects mathematics physics
final examination  cannot achieve them  could satisfied
achieve one them  least  better achieving none 
let us consider example  suppose background formula set empty
objective formula x y  consider following four formulas  x  x z  x
z  clearly  none formulas classically entails x y  however  x  x z x
entail x  regarded part x y  contrast  z irrelevant x y  thus 
one conclude that  extent  x  x z x partially satisfy x z

one may observe exists difference x x z partially
satisfying x y  is  x z contains new atom z  irrelevant x y 
hand  x exactly part x y  words  x z contains irrelevancy
 namely z  partially satisfying x x not  another observation
x y  although entails x  a part x y   entails y  contradicts
 also part x y   words  x side effect  namely y  besides
partially satisfying x y 
background theory crucial partial entailment  example  consider z
x again  suppose background formula set empty  case  z
partially satisfy x y  background formula set turns  z x   z
partially satisfy x since background theory  z holds  x holds well 
based observations intuitions  paper  formalize notion partial entailment two formulas respect background theory
propositional language  moreover  distinguish three different kinds partial entailments  namely weak partial entailment  partial entailment strong partial entailment 
intuitions summarized table    course  require partial
satisfaction two formulas  however  weak partial entailment may allow
irrelevancies side effects  whilst partial entailment prohibits side effects still may

take switched  style definition  x  weakly  strongly  partially entails

hence  exists case x true x false 
again  consider formula x y  two prime implicants  namely  x   y

then  formulas p inconsistent   p  weakly  strongly  partially

addition  strong partial entailment captures notion part broader sense

entailment  however  explanation seems suggest way around  is 
p strongly partially entails q w r t   i e   p part q w r t     q classically
entails p w r t    fact  case either  example  x strongly partially
entails  x y   y z    x y   y z  classically entails x  reason

   partial goal satisfaction
traditional logic based approach rational agency  agents always try find actions
completely achieve goals  successful  agents would choose wait
nothing  idea usually formalized using classical entailment  however 
always case agents find perfect action  think real world
live in   situation  sometimes useful agents something
towards goals rather waiting  actions partially satisfying
agents goal rational candidates  here  partial entailments may serve
logic foundation 
example   let us consider example  suppose laura wants milk cereal
breakfast  however  three choices available breakfast menu 
choice  milk offered 
choice  milk bread offered 
choice  bread offered 
due current information  none choices completely satisfies lauras goal 
then  do   
here  argue that  circumstance  rational agents choose
actions partially achieving goal according belief  action
completely achieving goal 
important allow actions partially achieving agents goal rational
candidates  first all  rationality performing actions solid since
make goal closer agents nothing better do  hence  choosing
actions useful agents goal reasonable waiting  also 
environment dynamic nature  cases  agents choose actions
partially achieving goal  might lose chance achieve goal forever 
frequently happens everyday life cannot seize opportunities 
formalize partial achievement actions goals agents belief
using notion partial entailments proposed section    natural since
partial entailments precisely capture partial satisfaction relations two formulas
respect background theory  apply partial entailments formalize partial goal
satisfaction  treat background theory agents belief  consequent
agents goal antecedent consequences action  one obstacle

represent actions consequences  here  address issue  simply use triples
hoare logic represent actions  
again  restrict discussions within propositional language  goal
belief agents represented propositional formula set propositional formulas
respectively  action triple hp re      p ost  i  label called body
action  p re   p ost   two propositional formulas called precondition
postcondition action respectively  next  show traditional idea
complete goal satisfaction idea partial goal satisfaction formalized
setting 
definition     complete goal satisfaction  let agents belief g agents
goal  let set candidate actions  action completely achieves agents
goal g according belief iff 
      p re   
    p ost    consistent 
      p ost   g 
definition    means agents belief satisfies precondition action
believes postcondition action entails goal  action completely
achieves goal belief  partial goal satisfaction formalized similar way
except partial entailments used instead classical entailment 
definition     partial goal satisfaction  let agents belief g agents
goal  let set candidate actions  action  weakly  strongly  partially
achieves agents goal g according belief iff 
      p re   

   p ost   w
    g 

definition    means agents belief satisfies precondition action
believes postcondition action partially entails goal  action
partially achieves goal belief 
example   consider example   proposed previously  formalize example  use x 
z represent milk  cereal bread respectively  then 
lauras belief empty since background knowledge  goal represented
x y  preconditions three actions take three choices respectively
empty well represented    postcondition three cases
represented x  x z z respectively  according definition     none three
actions completely achieves goal x y  however  according definition     take
choice  choice   weakly  partially achieve goal  particular  take choice 
strongly partially achieves goal  whilst take choice  partially achieve
goal sense   
   here  use simple action theory demonstrate notion partial entailments

problem arises kind partial goal satisfaction rational agents  first
glance  seems partial entailment appropriate purpose  weak partial
entailment may contain side effects acceptable  whilst strong partial entailment
strict powerful actions excluded  however  believe better
leave agent designers  one may choose different kinds partial goal satisfaction
different application domains  e g   strong partial entailment irrelevancies
side effects crucial issues  partial entailment side effects unacceptable
irrelevancies not  weak partial entailment looser cases 
worth mentioning partial goal satisfaction proposes one possible solution
dealing situations agents cannot find plan completely achieve
goal  neither solution necessarily perfectly rational 
situations  actions achieving parts agents goal may lose chances
achieve parts  might unacceptable agents 
also  actions partially achieving agents goal rational candidates
compulsory  quite different fact action rational candidate
agents really choose perform it  partial goal satisfaction explains
rationality actions partially achieving goals  problem particular
action chosen perform among actions partially achieving agents
goal another research topic beyond scope paper 
another approach handling situations explicitly represent agents full
preferences among combinations goals  instance  example    laura may
following full preferences among candidate goals 
 m ilk  cereal     m ilk     cereal       
  represents preference relation  lauras original goal  i e  ilk cereal 
cannot achieved  intends achieve second best candidate goal  i e  ilk 
according preference  observed partial goal satisfaction always
consistent full preference approach  instance  preference laura
turns  m ilk  cereal          m ilk     cereal   although sharing similarities 
two approaches essentially different  first all  full preference requires additional
information  partial goal satisfaction not  moreover  expensive represent
full preference agents  since number possible combinations goals exponential respect size goals  represent full preference requires double
exponential number new information  last least  usually difficult obtain
full preferences agents  hence  believe full preference approach
partial goal satisfaction approach advantages disadvantages
dealing situations perfect actions achieve agents goal

firstly  partial entailments  objective formula represented single formula
instead set candidate variations  secondly  numerical degree satisfaction
