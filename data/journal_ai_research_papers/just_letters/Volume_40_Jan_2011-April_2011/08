   introduction
web search engines today predominantly answer queries simple ranked list results 
method successful  relies assumption users information need satised single page web  however  several studies  broder 
      rose   levinson        alluded fact many user queries merely
beginning exploration unknown space information  queries likely
better served users provided summary relevant information space
means conveniently exploring it  paraphrase  rather nding needle
haystack  queries would benet summarizing haystack  rajaraman 
       several commercial attempts recently made provide better answers
queries  including systmes carrot   clusty  kosmix  yahoo glue 
paper describes aspector system addresses following problem  given
exploratory search query q  compute set aspects enables convenient exploration
web content relevant q  dene aspect set search
queries together represent distinct information need relevant original search

   problem definition
begin dening scope problem address 
queries  assume queries sequence keywords  typical searchengine interfaces  techniques meant apply arbitrary queries  focus
exploratory queries  specically  assume either entity names  e g  
country vietnam  entity property name  e g   vietnam travel   thus 
interested computing aspects entities general context particular
property 
paper handle problem segmenting entity property names
queries  previous work  bergsma   wang        tan   peng        addressed
problem   question identifying exploratory queries query stream
beyond scope paper 
aspects  aspect query q meant describe particular sense q corresponding information need  specically  aspect represented collection
search queries related q  given q  compute set aspects a              along
scores p ai  q  used rank them 
since aspects collections search queries  compare aspects based search
results retrieved queries constitute them  aspects meant capture diverse
dimensions along organize exploration entire space information
relevant query  hence  set aspects computed query
following properties 
orthogonality  given two aspects  a  a    search results a  a 
dierent other 
coverage  search results provided aspects oer good overview
relevant space information 
thus  two sets aspects computed query compared based
pairwise orthogonality constituent aspects combined coverage
aspects  evaluation aspects inherently subjective  typical area web
search  hence  present user studies aspects computed dierent approaches
qualitatively rated large number independent users  note
compare dierent approaches computing aspects  focus dierent ways

    community created knowledge bases
knowledge bases  especially created large community contributors 
rich source information popular entities  cover wide spectrum user
interests potentially used organize information relevant search queries 
particular  properties infoboxes wikipedia articles potentially used
candidate aspects  wikipedia contains       classes   million entities
class average    attributes  wikipedia column table   shows
attributes two example classes  freebase another community created kb
      classes 
binary relationships recorded knowledge base fall signicantly short providing
good set aspects query  example  consider properties associated
cambodia wikipedia infobox capital  flag  population  gdp  etc  none
words appear top    frequent queries contain word cambodia  addition 
knowledge base limited describing well dened entities  example  cambodia
entity knowledge base  cambodia travel not  however  queries web cover
much well dened entities 
underlying reason knowledge bases fall short constructors choose
attributes based traditional design principles  good aspects follow
principles  example  turns cambodia travel good aspect vietnam travel 
many people consider side trip cambodia visiting vietnam  however 
designing knowledge base  cambodia would never attribute vietnam 
instead  knowledge base would assert vietnam cambodia neighbors 
include rule states x next y  x travel may aspect
travel  unfortunately  coming rules specifying precise preconditions
formidable task highly dependent instances applies to  example 
pakistan travel aspect india travel  even though two countries neighbors

   generating candidate aspects
aspector generates candidate aspects query logs  query logs reective

queries  rst describe generate instance level aspects  augment

given query q  start considering query renements super strings

engines typically use popular renements basis proposing related searches

observe proposing related searches based query renements is  principle 
optimized towards goal helping users nd single page containing specic answer
 rather helping user explore space   example  top    renements

   selecting aspects
section describes aspector prunes set candidate aspects  groups them 
eventually ranks ordered list subset selected 
    eliminating duplicate aspects
often case generated aspect list contains similar candidates may
considered redundant  example  top candidate aspects query vietnam travel
include vietnam travel package  vietnam travel packages vietnam travel deal 
represent either identical similar user intents  particular  note set
web documents returned aspects search engine likely
similar 
remove redundant aspects  compute similarity matrix   sim ai   aj    
every pair candidate aspects cluster based similarity 
      computing aspect similarity
since aspects contain words  estimating similarity based simple comparison words unlikely accurate  therefore  enrich representation

let di top web pages retrieved aspect ai   estimate similarity ai
