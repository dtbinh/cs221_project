   weight splitting  examples
real world situations modeled weighted voting games  players may able split 
dividing resources  weight  arbitrarily among new identities  payo would
distributed among agents according power resulting game  intuitively  total payment obtained new identities equal payo
original player split  however  demonstrate
case payo distributed according either shapleyshubik index
banzhaf index 
rst show players use weight splitting increase power 
example     advantageous splitting  consider wvg               symmetry 
player banzhaf index      shapleyshubik index      last
player splits two players  new game                  game 
original game  winning coalition grand coalition  hence players
equally powerful  thus  split up players banzhaf index     each  well
shapleyshubik index     each  i e   weight splitting increases manipulators power
factor                     according indices 
however  weight splitting may harmful 
example     disadvantageous splitting  consider wvg               again  symmetry  player banzhaf index      shapleyshubik index     
last player splits two players  new game                  new
players pivotal exactly one coalition  players weight   pivotal
three coalitions  thus  new players banzhaf index     each  similarly 
new players pivotal permutation appears third
position  followed new player  i e   new players shapleyshubik index
             thus  weight splitting decreases players power factor    
according banzhaf index factor   according shapleyshubik index 
finally  weight splitting may eect players power 
example     neutral splitting  consider wvg               previous examples  symmetry  player banzhaf index      shapleyshubik index
     last player splits two players  new game                 
game  new players pivotal   coalitions  players weight
  pivotal   coalitions  thus  split up players banzhaf index     each 
similarly  new players pivotal permutation appears
third position  followed one players weight    exactly  
permutations  shapleyshubik index new players     
             i e   according indices  players total power change 
examples presented far  weight splitting eect shapley
shubik index banzhaf index manipulator  show
always case 
example    consider wvg                     game  rst player pivotal
permutation appears last second to last position  earlier positions

thus  shapleyshubik index      further  player pivotal coalition
contains three four players weight    i e     coalitions  hand 
player weight   pivotal coalition contains player weight   well
two players weight    i e     coalitions  thus banzhaf index rst
player given                    
now  rst player splits two players weight one  resulting game
players weight  therefore  value indices     
hence total power manipulator     
remains observe                        i e   weight splitting hurts
manipulator payo distributed according shapleyshubik index  helps
banzhaf index used  further  example generalized weighted

   splitting two identities

split number identities  prove problem np hard even small
weights  i e   weights polynomial n   another question interest
extend upper lower bounds section   setting 
one might think nding benecial split k   identities easier nding
one uses exactly two identities  all  two way split transformed
split three players two players non zero weight  however 
turns restrict attention non trivial splits  i e   one
new players non zero weight  longer case 
example     consider game g              game  winning coalition
includes players  shapleyshubik indices given    g       g        
suppose player   splits two identities       selection integer
weights w       w      satisfy w    w       new game g          w    w   
   g        g          indeed  game player pivotal permutation
occurs second position  happens probability      hence 
non trivial split two identities increases payo second player factor
                  
now  suppose second player splits   new players weight   each 
new game  player   pivotal permutation occur
rst position permutation  shapleyshubik index      consequently 
sum shapleyshubik indices remaining players  i e   new identities player   
     therefore  split decreases payo player   factor    summarize 
non trivial integer split   identities benecial player    integer split
  identities positive weight harmful him 
remark     example    generalized games form gn    n      n  n  
arbitrary integer n      reasoning shows one players decides
split n new players weight   each  increases shapleyshubik index
player n  n      hence decreases total payo splitting player
