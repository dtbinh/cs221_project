abstract
weighted voting is a classic model of cooperation among agents in decision making
domains  in such games  each player has a weight  and a coalition of players wins the
game if its total weight meets or exceeds a given quota  a players power in such games
is usually not directly proportional to his weight  and is measured by a power index  the
most prominent among which are the shapleyshubik index and the banzhaf index 
in this paper  we investigate by how much a player can change his power  as measured
by the shapleyshubik index or the banzhaf index  by means of a false name manipulation 
i e   splitting his weight among two or more identities  for both indices  we provide upper
and lower bounds on the eect of weight splitting  we then show that checking whether
a benecial split exists is np hard  and discuss ecient algorithms for restricted cases of
this problem  as well as randomized algorithms for the general case  we also provide an
experimental evaluation of these algorithms 
finally  we examine related forms of manipulative behavior  such as annexation  where
a player subsumes other players  or merging  where several players unite into one  we
characterize the computational complexity of such manipulations and provide limits on
their eects  for the banzhaf index  we describe a new paradox  which we term the
annexation non monotonicity paradox 

   introduction
collaboration and cooperative decision making are important issues in many types of interactions among self interested agents  ephrati   rosenschein         in many situations 
agents must take a joint decision leading to a certain outcome  which may have a dierent
impact on each of the agents  a standard and well studied way of doing so is by means
of voting  and in recent years  there has been a lot of research on applications of voting to
multiagent systems as well as on computational aspects of various voting procedures  see
faliszewski   procaccia         one of the key issues in this domain is how to measure
the power of each voter  i e   his impact on the nal outcome  in particular  this question
becomes important when the agents have to decide how to distribute the payos resulting

from their joint action  a natural approach would be to pay each agent according to his
contribution  i e   his voting power 
this issue is traditionally studied within the framework of weighted voting games  wvgs 
 taylor   zwicker         which provide a model of decision making in many political and
legislative bodies  leech        laruelle   widgren        algaba  bilbao    fernandez 
       and have also been investigated in the context of multiagent systems  elkind  goldberg  goldberg    wooldridge      b         in such a game  each of the agents has a
weight  and a coalition of agents wins the game if the sum of the weights of its participants
meets or exceeds a certain quota  there are numerous examples of multiagent systems that
can be captured by weighted voting games  for example  the agents weights may correspond to the amount of resources  time  money  or battery power  that they contribute  and
the quota may indicate the amount of resources needed to complete a given task  alternatively  the weight may be an indicator of an agents experience or seniority  and a voting
procedure may be designed to take into account these characteristics 
clearly  having a larger weight makes it easier for a player to aect the outcome  however  the players power is not always proportional to his weight  for example  if the quota
is so high that the only winning coalition is the one that includes all players  intuitively 
all players have equal power  irrespective of their weight  this idea is formalized using the
concept of a power index  which is a systematic way of measuring a players inuence in a
weighted voting game  there are several ways to dene power indices  one of the most popular approaches relies on the fact that weighted voting games form a subclass of coalitional
games  and therefore one can use the terminology and solution concepts that have been
developed in the context of general coalitional games  in particular  an important notion
in coalitional games is that of the shapley value  shapley         which is a classic method
of distributing the gains of the grand coalition in general coalitional games  the shapley
value has a natural interpretation in the context of weighted voting  where it is known as
the shapleyshubik power index  shapley   shubik         another well known power
index  which has been introduced specically in the context of weighted voting games  is
the banzhaf index  banzhaf         while several other power indices have been proposed
 e g   see johnston        deegan   packel        holler   packel         the shapley
shubik power index and the banzhaf power index are usually viewed as the two standard
approaches to measuring the players power in weighted voting games  and have been widely
studied from both normative and computational perspective 
as suggested above  power indices measure the players power and can be used to determine their payos  however  to be applicable in real world scenarios  this approach to
payo division has to be resistant to dishonest behavior  or manipulation  by the participating players  in this paper we study the eects of a particular form of manipulation in
weighted voting games  namely  false name voting  under this manipulation  a player splits
his weight between himself and a fake agent who enters the game  such manipulations are
virtually impossible to detect in open anonymous environments such as the internet  they
can also occur in legislative bodies  where political parties vote on bills  in such bodies 
elections are held every several years to determine the weight each party has when voting
on a bill  before such elections are held  a party may split up into two smaller parties  it is
likely that the supporters of that party would somehow split between the two new parties 
so the total weight of the new parties will be equal to that of the original party  by choosing
  

fifalse name manipulations in wvgs

a suitable platform  the original party can decide how the weight would be split between
the two new parties 
while a weight splitting manipulation does not change the total weight of all identities
of the cheating agent  his power  as measured by the shapleyshubik power index or the
banzhaf index  may change  therefore  this behavior presents a challenge to the designers
of multiagent systems that rely on weighted voting  the main goal of this paper is to
measure the eects of false name voting and analyze its computational feasibility  we also
examine the related scenarios of players merging in order to increase their joint power  or
one player annexing another one 
our main results are as follows 
 we precisely quantify the worst case eect of false name voting on agents payos 
namely  we show that in an n player game splitting into two false identities can
increase an agents payo by at most a factor of   both for the shapleyshubik index
and the banzhaf index  moreover  this bound is asymptotically tight  on the other
hand  we show that false name manipulation can decrease an agents payo by at
most a factor of  n  for both indices 
 we demonstrate that nding a successful manipulation is not a trivial task by proving
that for both indices it is np hard to verify if a benecial split exists  however  we
show that if all weights are polynomially bounded  the problem can be solved in
polynomial time  and discuss ecient randomized algorithms for this problem 
 we present similar np hardness results for the case of players merging into a single
new player  interestingly  in the case of a player annexing one or more players  there
is a contrast between the shapleyshubik index and the banzhaf index  whereas for
the shapleyshubik index  annexing is always benecial  checking whether annexing
is benecial in the case of the banzhaf index is np hard  however it is benecial if a
player annexes a player with a bigger weight  we also present a new paradox called
the annexation non monotonicity paradox  which shows that annexing a small
player can be more useful than annexing a big player 
 we complement our theoretical results by experiments which indicate the expected
fractions of positive and negative false name manipulations in weighted voting games
with randomly selected weights 
    related work
weighted voting games date back at least to john von neumann and oskar morgenstern 
who developed their theory in their monumental book theory of games and economic
behavior  von neumann   morgenstern         subsequently  wvgs have been analyzed
extensively in the game theory literature  see  for instance  taylor   zwicker        
in his seminal paper  shapley        considered coalitional games and the question of fair
allocation of the utility gained by the grand coalition  the solution concept introduced in
this paper became known as the shapley value of the game  the subsequent paper  shapley
  shubik        studies the shapley value in the context of simple coalitional games  where
it is usually referred to as the shapleyshubik power index  the banzhaf power index was
  

fiaziz  bachrach  elkind    paterson

originally introduced by banzhaf         a somewhat dierent denition was later proposed
by dubey and shapley         in this paper  we make use of banzhafs original denition 
as it is more appropriate in the context of payo division 
both of these power indices have been well studied  stran        shows that each index
reects certain conditions in a voting body  laruelle        describes certain axioms that
characterize these two indices  as well as several others  these indices were used to analyze
the voting structures of the european union council of ministers and the imf  machover
  felsenthal        leech        
the applicability of the power indices to measuring political power in various domains
has raised the question of nding tractable ways to compute them  however  this problem
appears to be computationally hard  indeed  the naive algorithm for calculating the shapley
value  or the shapleyshubik power index  considers all permutations of the players and
hence runs in exponential time  moreover  papadimitriou and yannakakis        show
that computing the shapley value in weighted voting games is  p complete  this result
is extended by matsui and matsui         who show that calculating the banzhaf index
in weighted voting games is also np hard  furthermore  faliszewski and hemaspaandra
       show that comparing the players power in two dierent weighted voting games is
pp complete for both indices 
despite these hardness results  several papers show how to compute these power indices
in some restricted domains  or discuss ways to approximate them  these include a generating
functions approach  mann   shapley         which trades required storage for running time 
owens multilinear extension  mle  approach  owen        and monte carlo simulation
approaches  mann   shapley        fatima  wooldridge    jennings        bachrach 
markakis  resnick  procaccia  rosenschein    saberi         matsui and matsui       
provide a good survey of algorithms for calculating power indices in weighted voting games 
many of these approaches work well in practice  which justies the use of these indices as
payo distribution schemes in multiagent domains 
as a useful and succinct model for coalitional voting games  wvgs have attracted
a lot of interest from the multiagent community  a number of papers have considered
the problem of designing wvgs with desirable properties  aziz  paterson    leech       
fatima  wooldridge    jennings        de keijzer  klos    zhang         simple games
that can be obtained by combining multiple weighted voting games have been examined by
elkind et al       b  and faliszewski  elkind  and wooldridge         another well studied
topic is computing various stability related solution concepts in wvgs and their extensions
 elkind et al         elkind   pasechnik        elkind  chalkiadakis    jennings      a  
false name manipulations in open anonymous environments have been examined in
dierent domains such as auctions  yokoo        iwasaki  kempe  saito  salek    yokoo 
      and coalitional games  yokoo  conitzer  sandholm  ohta    iwasaki        ohta 
iwasaki  yokoo  maruono  conitzer    sandholm        ohta  conitzer  satoh  iwasaki   
yokoo         in the latter domain  the characteristic function by itself does not provide
enough information to analyze false name manipulation  to deal with this issue  yokoo
et al         introduced a framework where each player has a subset of skills  and the
characteristic function assigns values to the subset of skills  our model can be seen as a
special case of this framework  however  due to special properties of weighted voting games
we are able to obtain much stronger results than in the general case 
  

fifalse name manipulations in wvgs

the phenomenon considered in the paper has been studied by political scientists and
economists under the name of the paradox of size  shapley        brams        felsenthal
  machover         however  neither its quantitative nor its computational aspects have
been considered  felsenthal and machover also discuss a number of other paradoxes in
weighted voting games  laruelle and valenciano        give an overview of more recent
work on paradoxes of weighted voting  occurrences of these paradoxes in voting bodies are
considered by kilgour and levesque        van deemen and rusinowska         and leech
and leech         another form of manipulation in wvgs has been recently studied by
zuckerman  faliszewski  bachrach  and elkind         who analyze how the center might
change the players power by modifying the quota even if the weights are xed 
    follow up work
many results that appear in this paper have been previously presented at the aamas conference  bachrach   elkind        aziz   paterson         inspired by this work  lasisi
and allan        have recently undertaken an experimental analysis of false name manipulations in weighted voting games  they have also considered less popular power indices 
such as the deeganpackel index  in another follow up paper  rey and rothe        investigate false name manipulations in weighted voting games with respect to the probabilistic
banzhaf index  i e   the one suggested by dubey and shapley         although the probabilistic banzhaf index is more useful for measuring the actual probability of inuencing a
decision  it does not t the framework of using power indices to share resources or power 
because the probabilistic banzhaf index is not normalized 

   preliminaries and notation
we start by introducing the notions that will be used throughout this paper 
    coalitional games
a coalitional game g    n  v  is given by a set of players n               n   and a characteristic function v    n  r  which maps any subset  or coalition  of players to a real value  this
value is the total utility these players can guarantee to themselves when working together 
a coalitional game g    n  v  is called monotone if v s   v t   for any s  t   further 
g is called simple if it is monotone and v can only take values   and    i e   v    n         
in such games  we say that a coalition s  n wins if v s       and loses if v s       a
player i is critical  or pivotal  for a coalition s if adding this player to s turns it from a
losing coalition into a winning coalition  v s       v s   i        a player i is a veto
player if he is necessary for forming a winning coalition  i e   v s      for any s  n    i 
 for monotone games  this is equivalent to requiring v n    i        
    weighted voting games
a weighted voting game g is a simple game that is described by a vector of players weights
w    w            wn     r   n and a quota q  r    we write g    q  w            wn    or g    q  w  
in these games  a coalition is winning if
its total weight meets or exceeds the quota  formally 
for any s  n we have v s      if is wi  q and v s      otherwise  we will often
  

fiaziz  bachrach  elkind    paterson


write w s  to denote the total weight of a coalition s  i e   w s    is wi   also  we set
wmax   maxi       n wi   we will make the standard assumption that w n    q  i e   the
grand coalition is winning  note that if q   w n    then any player i  n is a veto player 
    power indices
for each player  both her shapleyshubik index and her banzhaf index are determined
by this players expected marginal contribution to all possible coalitions  however  the two
indices make use of dierent probabilistic models 
the shapleyshubik index is a specialization of shapley valuea classic solution concept
for coalitional gamesto simple games  in more detail  let n be the set of all possible
permutations  orderings  of n players  each   n is a one to one mapping from             n 
to             n   denote by s  i  the set of predecessors of player i in   i e   s  i     j  
 j     i    the shapley value of the i th player in a game g    n  v  is denoted by
i  g  and is given by the following expression 
  
 v s  i    i    v s  i    
   
i  g   
n 
n

we will occasionally abuse notation and say that a player i is pivotal for a permutation 
if it is pivotal for the coalition s  i  
the shapleyshubik power index is simply the shapley value in a simple coalitional
game  and therefore in the rest of the paper we will use these terms interchangeably   in
such games the value of each coalition is either   or    so formula     simply counts the
fraction of all orderings of the players in which player i is critical for the coalition formed
by his predecessors  the shapleyshubik power index thus reects the assumption that
when forming a coalition  any ordering of the players entering the coalition has an equal
probability of occurring  and expresses the probability that player i is critical 
in contrast  the banzhaf index computes the probability that the player is critical under
the assumption that all coalitions of the players are equally likely  formally  given a game
g    n  v   for each i  n we denote by i  g  the number of coalitions for which i is
critical in a game g  the banzhaf index of a player i in a wvg g    n  v  is
i  g 
 
jn j  g 

i  g    

while there exist several other approaches to determining the players inuence in a
game  the shapleyshubik index and the banzhaf index have many useful properties that
make them very convenient to work with  we will make use of three of these properties 
namely  the normalization property  the symmetry property  and the dummy player property  the normalization property simply states that the sum of shapleyshubik indices  or
banzhaf indices  of all players is equal to    the symmetry property says that two players
i  j that make the same contribution to any coalition  i e   such that v s   i     v s   j  
for any s  n    i  j   have equal values of the index  the dummy player property claims
that for a dummy player both indices equal    where a player i is called a dummy if he
contributes nothing to any coalition  i e   for any s  n we have v s   i     v s   it
is easy to verify from the denitions that both the shapleyshubik index and the banzhaf
index have these properties

   weight splitting  examples
in real world situations modeled by weighted voting games  players may be able to split 
dividing their resources  weight  arbitrarily among the new identities  the payo would
then be distributed among the agents according to their power in the resulting game  intuitively  the total payment obtained by the new identities should be equal to the payo
of the original player before the split  however  we will now demonstrate that this is not
the case if the payo is distributed according to either the shapleyshubik index or the
banzhaf index 
we rst show that players can use weight splitting to increase their power 
example     advantageous splitting  consider the wvg               by symmetry 
each player has a banzhaf index of      and a shapleyshubik index of      if the last
player splits up into two players  the new game is                  in this game  just as in the
original game  the only winning coalition is the grand coalition  and hence all players are
equally powerful  thus  the split up players have a banzhaf index of     each  as well as a
shapleyshubik index of     each  i e   weight splitting increases the manipulators power
by a factor of                      according to both indices 
however  weight splitting may also be harmful 
example     disadvantageous splitting  consider the wvg               again  by symmetry  each player has a banzhaf index of      and a shapleyshubik index of      if
the last player splits up into two players  the new game is                  each of the new
players is pivotal for exactly one coalition  while each of the players of weight   is pivotal
for three coalitions  thus  the new players have a banzhaf index of     each  similarly 
each of the new players is pivotal for a permutation if and only if it appears in the third
position  followed by the other new player  i e   the new players have shapleyshubik index
of              thus  weight splitting decreases the players power by a factor of    
according to the banzhaf index and by a factor of   according to the shapleyshubik index 
finally  weight splitting may have no eect on the players power 
example     neutral splitting  consider the wvg               as in the previous examples  by symmetry  each player has a banzhaf index of      and a shapleyshubik index
of      if the last player splits up into two players  the new game is                  in this
game  each of the new players is pivotal for   coalitions  while each of the players of weight
  is pivotal for   coalitions  thus  the split up players have a banzhaf index of     each 
similarly  each of the new players is pivotal for a permutation if and only if it appears in
the third position  followed by one of the players of weight    there are exactly   such
permutations  so the shapleyshubik index of each of the new players is      we have
              i e   according to both indices  the players total power did not change 
in all examples presented so far  weight splitting had the same eect on the shapley
shubik index and the banzhaf index of the manipulator  we will now show that this is not
always the case 
example    consider the wvg                     in this game  the rst player is pivotal for a
permutation if he appears in the last or second to last position  but not in earlier positions 
  

fiaziz  bachrach  elkind    paterson

thus  his shapleyshubik index is      further  this player is pivotal for any coalition that
contains three or four players of weight    i e   for   coalitions  on the other hand  any
player of weight   is pivotal for any coalition that contains the player of weight   as well as
any two other players of weight    i e   for   coalitions  thus the banzhaf index of the rst
player is given by                     
now  if the rst player splits into two players of weight one  in the resulting game all
players have the same weight  therefore  for each of them the value of both indices is     
and hence the total power of the manipulator is     
it remains to observe that            but             i e   weight splitting hurts the
manipulator if the payo is distributed according to the shapleyshubik index  but helps
him if the banzhaf index is used  further  this example can be generalized to any weighted
voting game of the form  n                    where there are n    players of weight   and n    
in any such game  weight splitting lowers the payo of the rst player according to the
 
  but increases his payo according to the banzhaf
shapleyshubik index from n  to n  
n
 
index from  n       to n    

   splitting  bounds of manipulation
we have seen that a player can both increase and decrease his total payo by splitting his
weight  in this subsection  we provide upper and lower bounds on how much he can change
his payo by doing so  we restrict our attention to the case of splitting into two identities 
the general case is briey discussed in section   
to simplify notation  in the rest of this section we assume that in the original game
g    q  w            wn   the manipulator is player n  and he splits into two new identities n and
n   resulting in a new game g   we rst consider the case of the shapleyshubik index 
followed by the analysis for the banzhaf index 
    shapleyshubik index
we start by providing a tight upper bound on the benets of manipulation 
theorem    for any game g    q  w            wn   and any split of n into n and n   we have
 n
n  g     n  g    n  
n  g   i e   the manipulator cannot gain more than a factor of
 n  n          by splitting his weight between two identities  moreover  this bound is tight 
i e   there exists a game in which player n increases his payo by a factor of  n  n      by
splitting into two identities 
proof  fix a split of n into n and n   let n  be the set of all permutations of the rst
n    players  consider any   n    let p    be the set of all permutations of the
players in g that can be obtained by inserting n and n into   let n   be the set of all
permutations   of players in g such that n or n is pivotal for     finally  let p     k 
be the subset of p     n   that consists of all permutations    p    in which at least
one of the players n and n appears between the k th and the  k      st element of   and
is pivotal for     every permutation in n   appears in one of the sets p     k  for some

  k  so we have
n  g     n  g    


 n    
 
 p     k   

 n      
 n      
 k

on the other hand  it is not hard to see that  p     k     n for any   k  there are two
ways to place n and n between the k th and the  k     st element of   n  permutations
in p     k  in which n appears after the k th element of   but n is not adjacent to it 
and n    permutations in p     k  in which n appears after the k th element of   but
n is not adjacent to it  moreover  if p     k  is not empty  then n is pivotal for the
permutation f    k  obtained from  by inserting n after the k th element of   further  if
     k            k    then f      k       f      k     hence 
n  g

we conclude that n  g     n  g    n  
gain more than a factor of  n  n          by splitting his weight between two identities 
to see that this bound is tight  consider the game g     n                   and suppose that
one of the players  say  n  decides to split into two identities n and n resulting in the game
g     n                       in both games the only winning coalition consists of all players  so we

n  g  
have n  g      n  n  g     n  g        n       i e   n  g     n  g     n  

we have seen that no player can increase his payo by more than a factor of   by
splitting his weight between two identities  in contrast  we will now show that a player can
decrease his payo by a factor of  n  by doing so  this shows that a would be manipulator
has to be careful when deciding whether to split his weight  and motivates the algorithmic
questions studied in the next two sections

proof  to prove the rst part of the theorem  x a split of n into n and n and consider
any permutation  of players in g such that n is pivotal for   it is easy to see that at
least one of n and n is pivotal for the permutation f    obtained from  by replacing
n with n and n  in this order   similarly  at least one of n and n is pivotal for the
permutation g   obtained from  by replacing n with n and n  in this order   moreover 
all such permutations of players in g are distinct  i e   for any     we have g      f      
and       implies f       f       g      g      hence  if n is the set of all permutations

to see that this bound is tight  consider the game g     n                      and suppose
that one of the players  say  n  decides to split into two identities n and n resulting in

the game g     n                          in the original game g  the only winning coalition
consists of all players  so we have n  g      n  now  consider any permutation  of
the players in g   we claim that n is pivotal for  if and only if it appears in the n th
position of   followed by n   indeed  if  n     n   n     n      then all players in the

conversely  if  n     n      we have w s  n       n      q  and if  n    n    
we have w s  n     n       n      finally  if  n     n  but  n      n      we have
w s  n     n       n      q  consequently  n is pivotal for  n      permutations  and  by
the same argument  n is also pivotal for  a disjoint set of   n      permutations  hence 
 
we have n  g     n  g       n

theorem    for any game g    q  w            wn   and any split of n into n and n   we have
n  g     n  g     n  g   moreover  this bound is asymptotically tight 
proof  assume that player n splits up into n and n and that wn  wn   consider a losing
coalition c for which n is critical in g  then w c    q  w c    wn   w c    wn   wn  
we have the following possibilities 
 q  w c   wn   in this case n and n are critical for c in g  
 wn   q  w c   wn   in this case n is critical for c   n   and c in g  
 q  w c    wn   in this case n is critical for c   n   and n is critical for c   n  
in g  
therefore we have n  g     n  g      n  g  in each case 
now consider a player i  n    n   suppose that i is critical for a coalition c in g  if
n  c  then i is also critical for the coalition c    c    n    n   n   in g   on the other
hand  if n   c  then i also remains critical for c in g   hence i  g   i  g    moreover 
i may also be critical for some coalitions in g that contain just one of n and n   so the

we claim that si    j   sij   indeed  if s   si    then i is pivotal for s  but not for s   n   n

for any s  si   let f  s    s    n   n    g s    s    n   n     n   if s  si    then

while it is not clear if the bound given in theorem   is tight  our next example shows
that splitting into two

suppose that player n splits up into new identities n and n with weights wn   wn    k 
for player n to be critical for a coalition s in g   it has to be the case that either n   s

   complexity of finding a benecial split
we now examine the problem of nding a benecial weight split in weighted voting games
from the computational perspective  ideally  the manipulator would like to nd a payomaximizing split  i e   a way to split his weight among two or more identities that results
in the maximal total payo  a less ambitious goal is to decide whether there exists a
manipulation that increases the manipulators payo  however  it turns out that even this
problem is computationally hard  in the rest of the section  we show that checking whether
there exists a payo increasing split is np hard both for the shapleyshubik index and the
banzhaf index  this holds even if the player is only allowed to use two identities  that is 
in the spirit of the groundbreaking papers of bartholdi and orlin        and bartholdi 
tovey  and trick               we show that computational complexity acts as a barrier to
manipulative behavior 
to formally dene our computational problems  we require that all weights and the
quota of both the original game and the new game are integers given in binary  i e   we
only allow integer splits  we remark that this assumption is not entirely without loss of
generality  there are games where a player can benet from a fractional split more than
from any integer split  one such example is given by the game               where there
are no non trivial integer splits available to the players  but  similarly to example    each
player can increase his power by a factor of     by splitting into two players with weight
     however  in real life settings there is usually a natural bound on the granularity of
the weights  if the weight is the number of supporters of a given party  it needs to be an
  

fifalse name manipulations in wvgs

integer  and if it is the monetary contribution of a player  it usually has to be an integer
number of dollars  or  at least  cents   i e   our assumption reects real life constraints 
we are now ready to dene our problems

note that we are looking for a strictly benecial manipulation  i e   one that increases
the manipulators total payo  rather than one that is simply not harmful 
we will prove that beneficial ss split and beneficial bi split are np hard  our
hardness results are based on reductions from the following classic np hard problem 
name  partition
instance  a set of k integer weights a    a            ak   
question  is it possible
to partition
a into two subsets p   a  p   a so that p  p     


p   p    a  and ai p  ai   ai p  ai  
we will rst prove a simple lemma that will be used in all np hardness proofs in this
paper 
lemma     let a    a            ak   be a no instance of partition  then for any
 weighted
      wn   such that n   k  wi    ai for i              k  q     ai a ai  
voting game g    q  w      
r  where     r      and ni k   wi      it holds that all players k              n are dummies 
and hence their shapleyshubik and banzhaf indices are equal to   
proof  consider a player i with k   i  n and a set s  n    i   we will show that i is
not pivotal for s 
set n                k  and let s    s  n    the set n  can be partitioned into two
equal weight subsets if and only if a can  so either w s      w n       or w s      w n      
moreover  the weights of all players in n  are multiples of    so w n      is a multiple of   
similarly  the weight of s  is a multiple of    hence  if w s      w n       it follows that
w s     w n         and w s   i     w n               q  therefore  we have v s      
v s   i        i e   i is not pivotal for s  on the other hand  if w s      w n       then
w s     w n            q  so s  is a winning coalition  therefore  i is not pivotal for s in
this case as well 
theorem     beneficial bi split is np hard  and remains np hard even if the player
can only split into two players with equal weights 
proof  given an instance of partition a    a            ak    we construct aweighted voting
game g    q  w            wn   with n   k     players as follows  we let x   ai a ai   and set
wi    ai for i              n     wn      and q    x      also  we set    n  since wn

the only integer split available to player n is into two identities n and n with weight  
each  let g    q  w            wn          be the resulting game 
if a is a no instance of partition  then lemma    implies that player n is a dummy 
and  moreover  if he splits into sub players  these sub players are also dummies  therefore
 g    is a no instance of beneficial bi split 
now let us assume that a is a yes instance of partition  let x denote the number
of coalitions in n    n  of weight  x  then n  g    x  for i              n     let
si    s  n    n  i    w s     x  w s    wi  q  

and set yi    si    also  set y   n 
i   yi  
consider a player i   n  observe that exactly half of the x subsets of             n     of
weight  x contain i  for any such subset t   player i is pivotal for  t    i     n   further 
for any coalition s  si   player i is pivotal for both s and s   n   therefore for i   n we
have i  g    x     yi   we obtain
n  g   

x
 
x    n     x     y

on the other hand  in the new game g we have n  g     n  g     x  moreover  for
i   n we have i  g     x     yi   since each coalition in si corresponds to   coalitions for
which i is pivotal  namely  s  s   n    s   n    and s   n   n    thus 
n  g     n  g    

 x
  n  g  
 x    n     x     y

where the last inequality holds since x      thus  a yes instance of partition corresponds to a yes instance of beneficial bi split 
we now consider the problem of nding a benecial split for the shapleyshubik index 
theorem     beneficial ss split is np hard  and remains np hard even if the player
can only split into two players with equal weights 

proof  given an instance a    a            ak   of partition  we set x   ai a ai   and create
a weighted voting game g     x       a             ak         with n   k     players  also  we set
n                n     
if a is a no instance of partition  then lemma    implies that player n is a dummy 
and if he splits into several players  all of them will be dummies  too  thus  we have
constructed a no instance of beneficial ss split 
now  suppose that a is a yes instance of partition  let p    p   be a partition of
a  so w p      w p     it corresponds to a partition s  n    s of n    where i  s if and
only if ai  p    observe that w s    w n    s   set s    s   so  n    s    n  s    
it is easy to see that n is critical for s   n     as well as for  n    s    n      there
are  s       n     s   permutations of            n that put n directly after some permutation
of s   n      similarly  there are s  n     s   permutations putting n directly after some
permutation of  n    s    n      thus  for each partition p i   p i   p i   where  p i     s

we have at least  s       n     s     s  n     s   distinct permutations where n is critical 
on the other hand  as argued above  if s is a subset of n  such that w s     w n      
then n is not critical for s or s   n      since either w s   w n           q    or
w s   w n            q 
let p be the set of all partitions of a  where each partition is counted only once  i e  
p contains exactly one of the p    p   and p    p    for each p i   p i   p i   p  we denote
 p i     si   there is a total of n  permutations of players in g  thus  the shapleyshubik

we now consider what happens when n splits into two players  n and n with wn  
wn      resulting in a game g     x       a             ak            
again  let p    p     p      si    p      n  si   be a partition of a such that w p      w p    
and let s  n    s be the corresponding partition of n    there are  si       n     si   
permutations that place n directly after some permutation of s   n     n    and n is
critical for each of them  similarly  n is critical for the si   n  si    permutations that place
n directly after some permutation of  n    s    n     n   
thus  each partition p i   p i   p i  with  p i     si   corresponds to  si       n    
si      si   n  si    distinct permutations where n is critical  by symmetry  there are  si  
    n     si      si   n  si    distinct permutations where n is critical  there are n    
players in g   so there is a total of  n       permutations of the players  thus each partition

summing these inequalities over all partitions p i implies n  g     n  g     n  g   as

for any n      this proves inequality     for any n      it follows that if a is a yesinstance of partition  player n always gains by splitting into two players of weight    i e  
 g  n  is a yes instance of beneficial ss split 
remark     it can be veried that both of our proofs go through even if we allow noninteger splits  i e   our hardness results are independent of the integrality assumption  further  note that we have not shown that beneficial bi split and beneficial ss split
are in np  i e   we have not proved that these problems are np complete  there are two
reasons for this  first  if we allow splits into an arbitrary number of identities  some of the
candidate solutions may have exponentially many new players  e g   a player with weight
wi can split into wi players of weight     second  even if we circumvent this issue by only
considering splits into a polynomial number of identities  it is not clear how to verify in
polynomial time whether a particular split is benecial  in fact  since computing both power
indices in weighted voting games is  p hard  it is quite possible that our problems are not
in np 

   computing benecial splits
in section    we have shown that it is hard even to test if any benecial split exists  let alone
to nd the optimal split  this can be seen as a positive result  since complexity of nding
benecial splits serves as a barrier for this kind of manipulative behavior  however  it turns
out that in many cases manipulators can overcome the problem  more precisely  in what
follows we show that in certain restricted domains manipulators can nd benecial splits
into two identities in polynomial time  we then consider manipulation algorithms that work
by approximating the shapleyshubik index  rather than calculating it precisely  
    examples
in this subsection  we describe two scenarios in which one of the players can always increase
his payo by splitting  while both of our examples rely on rather severe constraints on the
players weights and the threshold  there are practical weighted voting scenarios that satisfy
these constraints 
example     it is not hard to see that example   can be generalized to any weighted
voting game with w n     q  such games are sometimes called unanimity games  even
more generally  a player can always increase his payo by weight splitting if the threshold
is set so high that any winning coalition must include all players  this holds both for the
shapleyshubik index and the banzhaf index  indeed  consider the class of weighted voting
games g    q  w  that is characterized by the following condition  w n    s   q  w n   
where s   min mini wi   wmax      the condition s  mini wi ensures that all players are
present in all winning coalitions  so the index value of each player is   n  now  suppose that
the player i with the largest weight wi   wmax splits his weight  almost  equally between
two identities  i e   sets wi   wi     wi   wi     as we also have s  wmax     any
winning coalition still has to include all players  therefore  in the new game the payo of
each player is    n       and hence the split increases the total payo of the manipulator
by a factor of  n  n

example     our second example is specic to the shapleyshubik index  in this example 
a small player can benet from manipulation in the presence of large players  as long
as the threshold is suciently high  formally  consider the class of weighted voting games
of the form g    q  w   where all wi   i              n     are multiples of some integer a  the
threshold q is of the form at   b  b   a  and b   wn   min  b     a   suppose that all
winning coalitions have size at least n        this 
condition holds if we renumber the
players so that w   w       wn  and require q   i       n    wi  
now  suppose that player n is pivotal for at least one coalition in this game  if all weights
are small multiples of a  this condition can be checked easily   consider any permutation
 such that n is pivotal for   we have w s  n     at   indeed  if w s  n     at   then
w s  n    at   a   q  and the coalition s  n  does not need player n to win  on the
other hand  if w s  n     at   then w s  n    at  a  so w s  n     wn   at   b   q 
 
let p be the set of all such permutations  we have n  g     p
n   
now suppose that n decides to split its weight between two new identities n and n
by setting wn   b     wn   wn  b      note that wn   wn   b  consider any permutation
  suppose that n occurs in the k th position in this permutation  by our assumption 
k  n        we will construct  k permutations j   j   j              k  as follows  in each
of these permutations  players            n    appear in the same order as in   moreover  in
j   player n occurs in the j th position  and player n occurs in the  k      st position 
similarly  in j   player n occurs in the j th position  and player n occurs in the  k      st
position 
observe that n is pivotal for any j   j              k  indeed  the total weight of all players
that precede n in j is at  wn   q  while w sj  n   n      q  similarly  w sj  n      q 
so n is pivotal for any j   j              k  hence  the total number of permutations of
           n     n   n for which either n or n is pivotal is at least  k p     n      p    and the
 
 p  
total shapleyshubik index of these players is at least  n    p
 n       n    n  g   hence  any
such split is strictly benecial for player n 
in addition to the scenarios discussed above  fatima et al         describe several classes
of voting games where the shapleyshubik indices of all players can be computed in polynomial time  aziz and paterson        prove similar results for the banzhaf index  clearly 
if the manipulators weight is polynomially bounded  and the original game as well as all
games that result from the manipulator splitting into two identities are easy  i e   belong
to one the classes considered by fatima et al  or aziz and paterson  the problem of nding
the benecial two way split can be solved in polynomial time  however  our examples illustrate that a player may be able to decide whether it is benecial to split even if he cannot
compute his payo prior to the manipulation 
    pseudopolynomial and approximation algorithms
the hardness reductions in section   are from partition  while this problem in known
to be np hard  its hardness relies crucially on the fact that the weights of the elements
are represented in binary  indeed  if the weights are given in unary  there is a dynamic
programming based algorithm for this problem that runs in time polynomial in the size of
the input  such algorithms are usually referred to as pseudopolynomial    in particular  if
all weights are polynomial in n  the running time of this algorithm is polynomial in n  in

many natural voting domains the weights of all players are not too large  so this scenario
is quite realistic  it is therefore natural to ask if there exists a pseudopolynomial algorithm
for the problem of nding a benecial split 
it turns out that the answer to this question is indeed positive as long as there is a
constant upper bound k on the number of identities that the manipulator can use and
all weights are required to be integers  to see this  recall that there is a pseudopolynomial algorithm for computing the shapleyshubik index of any player in a weighted voting
game  matsui   matsui         this algorithm is based on dynamic programming  for any
weight w and any    k  n  it calculates the number of coalitions of size k that have
weight w   thus  it can be easily adapted to work for the banzhaf index as well 
one can use the algorithm of matsui and matsui        to nd a benecial split for a
   
player i with weight wi in a game g as follows  consider all possible splits wi   wi  
 k 
 j 
     wi   where wi  n for j              k  the number of such splits is at most  wi  k  
which is polynomial in n for constant k  evaluate the shapleyshubik indices  respectively 
banzhaf indices  of all new players in any such split and return yes if and only if at least
one of these splits results in an increased total payo  let a g  be the running time of
the algorithm of matsui and matsui on instance g  the running time of our algorithm is
o  wi  k k  a g    which is clearly pseudopolynomial 
we will now consider a more general setting  where only the weight of the manipulator
is polynomially bounded  while the weights of other players can be large  to simplify the
presentation  we limit ourselves to the case of two way splits and the shapleyshubik index 
however  our approach also applies to splits into any constant number of identities and to
the banzhaf index  we can use the same high level approach as in the previous case  i e  
considering all possible splits  because of the weight restriction  there are only polynomially
many of them   and computing the indices of both new players for each split  however  if
we were to implement the latter step exactly  it would take exponential time  therefore 
in this version of our algorithm  we replace the algorithm of matsui and matsui with an
approximation algorithm for computing the shapleyshubik index  several such algorithms
are known  see  e g   the work of mann and shapley         fatima et al          bachrach
et al          we will use these algorithms in a black box fashion  namely  we assume
that we are given a procedure shapley g  i      that for any given values of      and
     outputs a number v that with probability     satises  v  i  g     and runs in
time poly n log wmax            we will now show how to use this procedure to design an
algorithm for nding a benecial split and relate the performance of our algorithm to that
of shapley g  i      
our algorithm is given in figure    it takes parameters  and  as inputs  and uses the
procedure shapley g  i      as a subroutine  the algorithm outputs yes if it nds a split
whose total estimated payo exceeds the payo of the manipulator in the original game by
at least    it can easily be modied to output the  approximately  optimal split 
proposition     with probability       the output of our algorithm satises the following   i  if the algorithm outputs yes  then  g  i  admits a benecial integer split   ii 
conversely  if there is an integer split that increases the payo to the manipulator by more
than    our algorithm outputs yes  moreover  the running time of our algorithm is
polynomial in nwi       and

p rob v    i  g           hence  with probability at least       if v    v    v      
then i  g    i  g         i  g         or  equivalently  i  g     i  g     i  g  
conversely  suppose that there is a benecial split of the form  wi   wi   that improves
player is payo by at least    as before  with probability at least      we have that
v   i  g     and at the step j   wi it holds that v   i  g      v   i  g      then
v   v    v   i  g     i  g        i  g          v       so the algorithm will
output yes 
while our algorithm does not guarantee nding a successful manipulation  it is possible
to control the approximation quality  at the cost of increasing the running time   so that a
successful manipulation is found with high probability 
thus we can see that manipulators have several ways to overcome the computational
diculty of nding the optimal manipulation  hence  other measures are required to avoid
such manipulations 

   merging and annexation
instead of a player splitting into smaller players  some players may merge into a single
entity  however  this situation is very dierent from the game theoretic perspective  as it
involves coordinated actions by several would be manipulators who then have to decide how
to split the  increased  total payo  for the case of players merging to gain advantage  we
examine two cases  one is annexation where one player takes the voting weight of other
players  the annexation is advantageous if the payo of the new merged coalition in the
new game is greater than the payo of the annexer in the original game  the other case is
voluntary merging where players merge to become a bloc so that their new payo exceeds
the sum of their individual payos 
for any weighted voting game g  we denote the game that results from merging of the
players in a coalition s by g s   the set of players in the new game is  n  s   s   and its
characteristic function is denoted by v s   we will now dene the computational problems

we can easily adapt these denitions for the banzhaf index  we will refer to the resulting problems as beneficial bi merge and beneficial bi annexation  we will rst
consider the issues related to annexation  followed by the analysis for merging 
    merging
as in the case of splitting  we expect it to be hard to nd a benecial merge  the following
theorem conrms this intuition 
theorem     beneficial ss merge and beneficial bi merge are np hard 
voting
proof  given an instance of partition a    a            ak    we construct a weighted

game g    q  w            wn   with n   k     players as follows  we set x     ki   ai and let
wi    ai for i              n     wn    wn    wn      and q   x      we will now argue
that a is a yes instance of partition if and only if  g   n     n   is a yes instance of
both beneficial ss merge and beneficial bi merge 
if a is a no instance of partition  then by lemma    players n and n    are
dummies  and even if they merge together  the new player   n     n  remains a dummy
in the new game g  n  n    thus  in this case  g   n     n   is a no instance for both
of our problems 
now let us assume that a is a yes instance of partition  we will rst consider the
case of the shapleyshubik index  followed by the analysis for the banzhaf index 
set n                n      let p    p   be a partition of a  and let s  n    s be the
corresponding partition of n    set s    s   so  n    s    n  s     player n is critical for
s   n     and s   n      as well as for  n    s    n     and  n    s    n      thus 
for each partition p   p    p    where  p      s  we have exactly   s       n     s   distinct
permutations where n is critical  further  it is easy to see that n is not critical for any other
permutation  by symmetry  the same is true for n     thus  each partition p    p   of a
to the sum of the shapleyshubik indices of n   
with  p      s contributes    s     n s  
n 
and n 
now  consider the game g  n  n    consider a partition s  n    s of n  with  s      s
that corresponds to a partition p    p   of a  player   n     n  is critical for s and
s   n      as well as for n    s and  n    s    n      thus  each partition p    p  
     s     n s  
to the shapleyshubik index of
of a with  p      s contributes   s  n s  
 n

this inequality can be simplied to   s      n     s    n n     s   s        n n     
which is equivalent to     n n        s      n     s     n   s        n     this

 g   n     n   is a yes instance of beneficial ss merge if and only if we started with

we will now show that the same is true for the banzhaf index  let x denote the number
of coalitions in n  of weight  x  then n   g    n   g    n  g     x  for i              k 
let
si    s  n     i    w s     x  w s    wi  q  

and set yi    si    also  set y   ki   yi  
consider a player i  n    observe that exactly half of the x subsets of n  of weight  x
contain i  for any such set t   player i is pivotal for  t    i     n     n       t    i     n 
   n    t    i     n     n   and  t    i     n     n     n   further  for any coalition s  si  
player i is pivotal for any coalition of the form s s    where s    n   n   n   therefore
 x
for any i  n  we have i  g     x
     yi   thus  we have n   g    n  g     x  kx  y  
in the new game g  n  n    we have   n  n   g  n  n       x  but n   g  n  n     
   now  consider a player i  n  and a coalition t  n  of weight  x that contains i 
player i is pivotal for  t    i       n     n   and for  t    i     n       n     n    as
well as for any coalition of the form s  s    where s  si and s    n       n     n

    annexation
felsenthal and machover        prove that annexation is never disadvantageous with respect
to the shapleyshubik index  for completeness  we give a simple proof of this fact 
proposition     for any weighted voting game g with the set of players n   any i  n  
and any s  n    i  we have i  g     s i    g  s i     
proof  we give a proof for the case  s       i e   s    j  for some j  n    i   the general
case follows easily by induction  let i be the set of all permutations  of n such that i
is critical for  in g  we have i  g     i   n   for each   i   let f    be a permutation
of the players in n  i j  obtained from  by deleting j and replacing i with a new player
  i  j   for any   i the player   i  j  is pivotal for f     moreover  for any permutation
 of n  i j  we have  f         n  hence  we have

however felsenthal and machover        show that  for the case of the banzhaf index 
annexation could be disadvantageous  they refer to this phenomenon as the bloc paradox 
they provide a    player wvg for which this is the case  which is the simplest example they
could nd  we improve on their result by describing a   player wvg where annexation is
disadvantageous 
example     consider a weighted voting game                            in this game  player  
is pivotal for any coalition that involves player   and any subset of the remaining players  as
well as for the coalition                 i e   for    coalitions  player   is pivotal for any coalition
that involves player   and at most   of the remaining players  i e      coalitions  finally  each
of the players of weight   is only pivotal for the coalition that includes player   and the rest
  
         
of the players of weight    thus  the banzhaf index of player   equals        
if player   annexes one of the players with weight    the new game is                        
applying the same reasoning as above  we obtain that player   is pivotal for    coalitions 
player   is pivotal for    coalition  and each of the remaining players is pivotal for exactly one
  
coalition  so the banzhaf index of player   in the new game is        
                   
we have shown that annexation can be disadvantageous in the case of the banzhaf
index  one would at least expect that the banzhaf index payo after annexing another
player is monotone in the power of the annexed player  surprisingly  this is not the case 
that is  we will now show that there exists a weighted voting game g    q  w            wn  
and i  j  k              n  such that wj   wk   but   i j   g  i j        i k   g  i k     we will
refer to this phenomenon as the annexation non monotonicity paradox  observe that it is
distinct from the bloc paradox  the former has to do with choosing which of the two given
players to annex  while the latter has to do with choosing between annexing a given player
and not annexing any player at all 
example     consider the weighted voting game                        suppose rst that player
  annexes player   to form the game                     in this game  player   is pivotal for
  coalition that does not include player    and   coalitions that include player    i e    
coalitions  further  player   is pivotal for   coalitions  and each of the remaining players is
 
pivotal for   coalitions  thus  the banzhaf index of player   is      
      
now  suppose that player   annexes player   to form the game                     in this
game  player   is pivotal for   coalitions  player   is pivotal for   coalitions  and each of
the remaining players is pivotal for   coalition  thus  the banzhaf index of player   in this
 
                
game is      
in contrast  the shapleyshubik index is monotone with respect to annexation 
proposition     for any weighted voting game g    q  w            wn   and any i  j  k 
            n  such that wj  wk we have   i j   g  i j       i k   g  i k    
proof  consider any permutation  of n  i k  for which   i  k  is pivotal  let   be a
permutation of n  i j  obtained by replacing   i  k  with   i  j  and j with k  since
w  i j   w  i k    if in  player j appears after player   i  k   then player   i  j  is
pivotal for     on the other hand  if in  player j appears before player   i  k   we

have w s    i  j     w s    i  k      q  w s    i  j       i  j      w s    i  k   
   i  k     q  so   i  j  is pivotal for   in this case as well  hence  each permutation for
which   i  k  is pivotal corresponds to a distinct permutation for which   i  j  is pivotal 
i e   we have   i j   g  i j       i k   g  i k    
to bound the gains and losses from annexation  we observe that a player can increase
his payo  with respect to both indices  by as much as    this happens if a dummy
player annexes a suciently large player or a coalition of players  on the other hand 
theorem   immediately implies that  when a player i annexes a player j in a game g  we
have   i j   g  i j         i  g    j  g    this has the following useful corollary 
corollary     for any weighted voting game g with the set of players n and any i  j  n
we have   i j   g  i j        i  g   i e   no player can decrease his payo by more than a
factor of   by annexing another player  moreover  if wi  wj   then   i j   g  i j     i  g  
we will now show that determining whether a player can benet from annexing a given
coalition  with respect to the banzhaf index  is np hard 
theorem     beneficial bi annexation is np hard 
proof  the proof is similar to that of theorem     given an instance of partition a  
 a            ak    we construct
 a weighted voting game g    q  w            wn   with n   k   players

q    x     
by lemma     if a is a no instance of partition  then players n    and n are
dummies  and n remains a dummy even if it annexes n     now  suppose that a is a

we conclude this section by analyzing the benets of merging and annexation in unanimity games  i e   games where q   w n   
proposition     in any unanimity game  it is advantageous for a player to annex an
arbitrary coalition  with respect to both the shapleyshubik index and the banzhaf index 
however  no group of players can increase its total payo  as measured by either of the
indices  by merging

proof  in any game all players have equal value of the index both before and after annexa 
  however 
tion  hence  if i annexes a coalition of size s  his power increases from n  to ns
s
 
merging reduces the total power of all players in a coalition of size s from n to ns
 
we remark that proposition    generalizes to any game in which each player is a veto
player 

   empirical analysis
we now analyze false name splitting manipulations empirically  we have constructed a
system for randomly constructing weighted voting games and examined the changes in both
the shapleyshubik index and the banzhaf index that occur when agents split their weights
between false identities  we briey describe our simulation system  the game construction
and the power index calculations  and then present the empirical evidence obtained 
    simulation system and settings
the weighted voting games were constructed by rst randomly choosing the number of
players in the game  then  the weights of the players were each drawn from n         
the normal distribution with mean  and variance      the weights were then rounded to
the nearest integer  to make sure that the game has integer weights  the threshold for
the game was chosen uniformly at random between   and the sum of the players weights
w   w n    and again rounded to the nearest integer  in our experiments  we have used a
mean of        for the weights  and several values for the standard deviation  from the
set                          the number of players n was chosen uniformly at random from the
set                       
power indices are computationally hard to compute exactly  papadimitriou   yannakakis        matsui   matsui         but can be tractably approximated using several
methods  we have used the approximation method of bachrach et al          this algorithm estimates the power indices and returns a result which is probably approximately
correct  as discussed in section    given a game in which a players true power index is
  and given a target accuracy level  and condence level   the algorithm returns an
approximation  such that with probability at least     we have         i e  the
result is approximately correct  and is within a distance  of the correct value   this algorithm works by drawing a sample of k permutations  or coalitions   and testing whether
the target player is critical for them  such a test runs in time linear in the number of
agents  so the total running time is o kn log w    bachrach et al  show that to achieve
a condence level  and accuracy level   it suces to take k   ln            thus the
total running time is logarithmic in the condence and quadratic in the accuracy  so the
approach is tractable even for high accuracy and condence  we have used           
and           so the power was estimated very accurately  our system was implemented
in c   and the results of the experiments were stored in an sql database  since power
indices were approximated accurately  a single experiment can take several seconds  our
tests required tens of thousands of experiments  so we have used a compute cluster with
    cores for our experiments

our theoretical results show that testing for a benecial split is hard  which might create
the impression that nding a benecial manipulation is hard in practice  our empirical
experiments were designed to see whether this is indeed the case  a very naive method
that a manipulator can use is to try many possible splits into two identities  in constant
intervals  in other words a manipulator whose weight is w can try  s splits by splitting his
 w
 w
 w
weight as   ws   w  ws       w
s   w  s      s   w  s   and so on  although this is certainly
not a complete coverage of the space of possible manipulations  in our experiments we have
tried a very simple algorithm that is based on this idea  since all the weights were integers 
we have only tried splitting weights between two false identities  and examined all integer
splits  for example  if an agent had a weight of wi       we attempted splitting into weights
of w       w       w       w       w       w      and so on  in each experiment we
have recorded the details of the game  the number of benecial splits  power increase  and
harmful splits  power decrease   for a split to be considered benecial  it had to increase the
power by more than twice the accuracy level  thus  the results presented here understate
the number of positive splits  in our results we examine the proportion of experiments
where we have found at least one benecial manipulation  as well as the proportion of the
splits that were benecial  out of all the integer splits  
    empirical results
we rst present the results regarding the shapleyshubik index  first and foremost  our
results indicate that the weighted voting domain is very manipulable  at least for our method
of generating random weighted voting games  under all values we have tried for the variance
in the player weights and number of players in the game  in over       of the experiments
even the very naive manipulation algorithm managed to uncover at least one benecial
manipulation  this indicates that in most games it is enough to try all integer splits  or
splits in uniform intervals  and use the tractable method for approximating power indices to
uncover benecial manipulations  figures   and   indicate the proportion of the experiments
in which this algorithm succeeds in nding a benecial split  as a function of the variance
in players weights and the number of players  respectively  it appears that the success rate
of our algorithm slightly increases as the variance increases  no such obvious trend appears
for the number of players 
one might be tempted to think that benecial splits are quite common  as most experiments had at least one benecial split  however  it turns out that most splits are harmful
splits  in all tested settings  less than     of all splits were benecial splits  in most
settings  harmful splits accounted for over     of all splits  in figure   and figure    we
indicate the proportion of benecial splits  as a function of the variance in players weights
and the number of players  respectively 
we have also examined the distribution of the proportion of benecial splits across
experiments  in some generated games  the benecial splits were quite rare  and less than a
single percent of the splits were benecial  in other generated games  benecial splits were
the common case  and over     of the splits were benecial  figure   shows the distribution
 histogram  of the proportion of benecial splits  across games  to create the gure  the
games were partitioned into     bins  according to the proportion of benecial splits in the
game  each bin was of size       e g   the proportion of benecial manipulations in the

    th bin was between     and        the value on the x axis of figure   is the proportion
of benecial splits  the bin   and the y axis is the number of experiments falling in that
category  figure   shows that most games are ones where benecial splits are more rare
than harmful splits  but the distribution has a long tail  so even games where almost all the
splits are benecial are not uncommon 
we now turn to examine the banzhaf index  as in the case of the shapleyshubik index 
for the banzhaf index the weighted voting domain is very susceptible to manipulation 
under all tested settings  in over       of the experiments our manipulation algorithm
managed to uncover at least one benecial manipulation  slightly less than the       for
the shapleyshubik index   the proportion of experiments where our algorithm nds a
benecial split with respect to the banzhaf index is shown in figure    for dierent values
of variance  and figure    for dierent number of players  
similarly to the case of the shapleyshubik index  for the banzhaf index benecial splits
were the less common case  and most splits are harmful splits  with less than     of all
splits being benecial  and typically about     being benecial splits  slightly higher than
for the shapleyshubik index   unlike for the shapleyshubik index  for the banzhaf index 
the proportion of benecial splits among all splits increases with the variance  figure    
however  this proportion does not have a clear trend with regard to the number of players
 figure     
the distribution of the proportion of benecial splits across games for the banzhaf index
seems quite similar to that for the shapleyshubik index  see figure      again  for most
games  the majority of splits are harmful  but the distribution has a long tail  and many

games have mostly benecial splits  although the distribution seems similar to that for the
shapleyshubik index  the tail of the distribution seems slightly fatter for the banzhaf
index 
to conclude  experiments for both indices present a similar picture  for most games
generated in our model  we have mostly harmful splits  however  many experiments have
many positive splits  and in some of them even almost all the splits are benecial  games
where trying all the integer splits does not yield a successful manipulation are very rare 
although they do exist  thus  for most games generated in our model  even the extremely
simple manipulation algorithm nds benecial splits  we conclude that despite the hardness
results in this paper  in practice we believe it is quite easy to nd such splits  and thus we
believe such attacks pose a real problem in many settings 

   splitting into more than two identities
so far  we have mostly discussed the gain  or loss  that a player can achieve by splitting
into two identities  however  it is also possible for a player to use three or more false names 
potentially  the number of identities a player can use can be as large as his weight  and if the
weights are not required to be integers  it can even be innite   it would be interesting to see
which of our results hold in this more general setting  for example  while our computational
hardness result holds for splits into any number of identities  the algorithmic results of the
previous section only apply to splits into a constant number of new identities  an obvious
open problem here is to design a pseudopolynomial algorithm for nding a benecial integer
  

fiaziz  bachrach  elkind    paterson

split into any number of identities  or to prove that this problem is np hard even for small
weights  i e   weights that are polynomial in n   another question of interest here is to
extend the upper and lower bounds of section   for this setting 
one might think that nding a benecial split into k    identities is easier than nding
one that uses exactly two identities  after all  any two way split can be transformed into a
split into three or more players in which only two players have non zero weight  however 
it turns out that if we restrict our attention to non trivial splits  i e   one in which all of the
new players have a non zero weight  this is no longer the case 
example     consider a game g              in this game  the only winning coalition
includes both players  so their shapleyshubik indices are given by    g       g        
suppose that player   splits into two identities   and     for any selection of integer
weights w       w      that satisfy w    w       in the new game g          w    w    we
have    g        g          indeed  in this game each player is pivotal in a permutation
 if and only if it occurs in the second position  which happens with probability      hence 
any non trivial split into two identities increases the payo of the second player by a factor
of                   
now  suppose that the second player splits into   new players of weight   each  in the
new game  player   is pivotal for a permutation  if and only if he does not occur in the
rst position in that permutation  so his shapleyshubik index is      consequently  the
sum of shapleyshubik indices of all remaining players  i e   the new identities of player   
is      therefore  this split decreases the payo of player   by a factor of    to summarize 
while any non trivial integer split into   identities is benecial for player    any integer split
into   identities with positive weight is harmful for him 
remark     example    can be generalized to games of the form gn    n      n  n   for
an arbitrary integer n      the reasoning above shows that if one of the players decides
to split into n new players of weight   each  this increases the shapleyshubik index of the
other player to n  n      and hence decreases the total payo of the splitting player by
a factor of  n         as the representation size of this game is polynomial in log n   this
decrease is exponential in description size 

    conclusions
we have considered false name manipulations in weighted voting games with respect to the
payo schemes based on the shapleyshubik index and the banzhaf index  we have also
considered manipulation via annexation and voluntary merging with respect to such payo
schemes  we have examined both the limits of manipulation  table    and the complexity
of manipulation  table     and complemented the theoretical investigation by empirical
analysis 
we have shown that  in most scenarios considered in this paper  testing whether a
benecial manipulation exists is np hard  one may ask whether these hardness results
provide an adequate barrier to manipulation  given that the power indices themselves are
hard to compute  in other words  dont we simultaneously assume that the weights are small
 and hence computing the indices is easy  and large  and hence manipulation is hard   to
resolve this apparent contradiction  note that the power indices considered in this paper

correspond to the voting power  and the players may try to increase their voting power by
weight splitting manipulation even if they cannot compute it  also  when a power index is
used to compute payments  the center  which performs this computation  may have more
computational power than individual players 
our experimental results show that  for moderately large weights  weight splitting manipulation is easy in practice  however  our algorithm relies on considering all integer splits 
i e   its running time is at least linear in the manipulators weight  an interesting open question is whether it is the case that if a benecial split exists  it can be found by testing a
number of splits that is logarithmic in the manipulators weight 
our results indicate that the shapleyshubik index and the banzhaf index behave similarly with respect to false name manipulation  however  the shapleyshubik index appears
to be a more desirable solution concept because annexation does not decrease the payo of
a player  exploring other solution concepts and their behavior with respect to false name
manipulation is a natural next step  a particularly suitable solution to consider could be
the nucleolus  which not only always exists but is also unique 
the study of weighted voting has many applications  both in political science and in
multiagent systems  there are several possible interpretations for identity splitting in these
contexts  such as obtaining a higher share of the grand coalitions gains when these are
distributed according to the shapleyshubik index or the banzhaf index  or obtaining more
political power by splitting a political party into several parties with similar political platforms  in the rst case  a false name manipulation is hard to detect in open anonymous
  

fiaziz  bachrach  elkind    paterson

environments  and can thus be very eective  in the second case  the manipulation is done
using legitimate tools of political conduct  therefore  we conjecture that false name manipulation is widespread in the real world and may become a serious issue in multiagent
systems  it is therefore important to develop a better understanding of the eects of this
behavior and or design methods of preventing it
