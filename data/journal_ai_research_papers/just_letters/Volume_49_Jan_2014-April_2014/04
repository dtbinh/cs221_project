abstract
recent years  task automatically linking pieces text  anchors  mentioned
document wikipedia articles represent meaning anchors received
extensive research attention  typically  link to wikipedia systems try find set
wikipedia articles candidates represent meaning anchor and  later 
rank candidates select appropriate one  ranking process
systems rely context information obtained document anchor
mentioned and or wikipedia  paper center attention use
wikipedia links context information  particular  offer review several candidate
ranking approaches state of the art rely wikipedia link information 
addition  provide comparative empirical evaluation different approaches
five different corpora  tac      corpus four corpora built actual wikipedia
articles news items

basically  relatedness allows compute similarity two wikipedia documents wi   wj links common  original definition milne
witten      a   computed as 
rb  wi   wj    

log max  b wi      b wj      log  b wi   b wj

according milne witten      a   relatedness metrics based normalized google distance  ngd   defined cilibrasi vitanyi         ngd based
intuition terms similar related meaning co occur frequently
documents  thus  given pair terms  google search engine used obtain
pages mention terms  pages mention indicate relatedness 
pages one suggest unrelatedness  indicated milne witten
     a   relatedness metrics  defined equation    shares inspiring principle  uses wikipedia links instead google search results account mentions 
distance metrics  relatedness values expected smaller similar
wikipedia articles are  however  easy transform distance metrics
similarity metrics following approach gracia mena         requires
computation of

second similarity metrics wikipedia articles considered based
computing pointwise mutual information  pmi  sets links articles

another well known approach compute document similarity within natural language processing information retrieval communities cosine similarity  basically 
vector built represent context document candidate article  then  similarity context document candidate computed cosine
angle respective vectors  several approaches state art  bunescu
  pasca        fader  soderland    etzioni        nguyen   cao        fahrni et al  
      ploch et al         ratinov et al         use cosine similarity  however 
differences features used build vector representations
documents 
case  requirement considering solely links context information 
thus  document represented using links mentioned
document  similar approach model documents compute cosine similarity
used  instance  fahrni et al         ploch et al         
particular  document represented vector vd r w     component
vd i                 w   vector vd computed traditional term frequency

note f  d  contain certain wikipedia article wi   n d  wi       
f  d  wi       and  thus  vd i      due this  vector vd expected sparse

ci c dc   a   simply counting number wikipedia articles link it  is 
indegree   b ci    or  alternatively  number wikipedia articles linked it

    graph approaches
second family link based approaches candidate ranking consider graph
approaches  rely building graph processing select best candidate 
      pagerank personalized pagerank
first algorithm consider within graph family pagerank  first defined
