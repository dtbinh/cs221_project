   introduction
many situations  agents coordinate use resource  one wireless channel used one device  one parking slot may occupied one vehicle 
etc  problem often  agents identical preferences  everyone prefers
access rather yield  similarly  everyone prefers parking slot rather leave
car home  however  multiple agents try use one resource simultaneously 
collide everyone loses 
consider simple example  two agents want access single resource  describe
problem game  agents two actions  yield  y   access  a   agent
yields  gets payoff    agent accesses resource agent
yields  gets payoff    agents access resource time 
incur cost

symmetric game  two efficient nash equilibria  ne  asymmetric 
either one agent yields one accesses resource  vice versa 
symmetric equilibrium outcome mixed ne agents access resource
 
probability pr a         
  however  mixed equilibrium efficient 
expected payoff agents   
asymmetric equilibria symmetric games undesirable two reasons  first 
fair  example  one agent access resource  second  coordinating
asymmetric equilibrium difficult  imagine agents identical
anonymous  i e  cannot observe identity  identity agent 
cannot prescribe different strategy agents  agents peer to peer

consider following example  millions wireless sensors produced
pipeline  take two randomly  put room  one
frequency sensors transmit measurements  sensor know
transmit stay quiet  factory could program half sensors
transmit odd slots  half transmit even slots  nevertheless 
would likely odd even pair sensors  would pair
sensors transmit time 
aumann        proposed notion correlated equilibria fixes issues
nash equilibria resource allocation game above  correlated equilibrium
 ce  probability distribution joint strategy profiles game  correlation
device samples distribution recommends action agent play 
probability distribution ce agents incentive deviate
recommended action  correlation device takes away burden coordination
anonymous agents  follow strategy  correlation
device told me 
smart correlation device  send agent different private
signal  available  still reach correlated equilibrium outcome  one
anonymous agents play identical strategies  yet achieve efficient fair allocation  previous work  cigler   faltings         proposed algorithm
allows agents learn correlated equilibrium outcome repeated play 
considered special case resource allocation problem  proposed use global
coordination signal multi agent learning reach symmetric  fair efficient outcome  wang et al         later implemented approach actual wireless network
achieved throughput   higher standard aloha protocols  
coordination signal previous work  cigler   faltings        differ
smart correlation device assumed aumann         firstly  public
cannot send private signals agents  private signals necessary anonymous
agents implement desirable correlated equilibrium single stage resource allocation
game  anonymous agents follow strategy given public signal

exist symmetric games nevertheless asymmetric efficient equilibria 
allow central coordination device  agents play symmetric efficient
correlated equilibrium selects randomly set efficient nash equilibria  without device  stage game  way reach symmetric efficient outcome

however  agents play game repeatedly  use history play
condition strategy  two agents different histories  take different
actions future  first round game though  history empty
everyone  therefore  symmetric strategy players randomize order ever
reach point histories agents distinct 
bhaskar        considered problem playing asymmetric outcomes stage

fisymmetric subgame perfect equilibria resource allocation

already mentioned two basic conventions proposed bhaskar        
bourgeois egalitarian convention    resource allocation game  asynchrony
round  one agent chooses action one chooses   call agent
chose asynchrony round winner  agent loser  bourgeois
convention guarantees agents keep playing ne forever after  way 
winner forever guaranteed higher payoff loser  egalitarian
convention  players alternate two pure strategy nash equilibria  way
payoffs winner loser closer 
infinitely repeated game discounting  social payoff depend two
things  discount factor   probability collision  probability
players play action a  big difference winner loser
payoff  losers fight back harder  play preferred action
higher probability  increase probability collision  egalitarian
convention  payoffs loser closer winner  therefore  agents
collide less often  reach asynchrony faster 
another example convention  kuzmics et al         analyze nash demand
game  nash demand game game n players choose n actions
labeled            n   players choose distinct action  player receives payoff
equal label chosen action  two players chose
action  every player  including chose action alone  receives zero payoff 
pure strategy nash equilibrium  players choose different action  naturally 
player prefers equilibrium one chose action n  
nash demand game  define bourgeois egalitarian conventions 
kuzmics et al         define three notions payoff symmetry 
ex ante agents expected payoffs game starts 
ex post agents expected payoffs asynchrony occurs  regardless
winner  
strong ex post agents payoff along realization play 
bourgeois convention ex ante payoff symmetric  since asynchrony occurs  winner gets higher payoff loser  egalitarian convention strong
ex post payoff symmetric  fact  kuzmics et al         show nash demand
game  convention socially efficient  must strong ex post payoff symmetric 
intuition order maximize social efficiency  want reach asynchrony fast
possible  possible agents choose actions uniformly random 
indifferent action choose moment
asynchrony occurs 
formally define convention augmented repeated game n agents

figure   shows expected number rounds converge varying discount factor
  generally  would expect access probability increase increasing   since
profit winning resource increases  increase convergence
time  however  experiments influence convergence time negligible 
although observe slight increase increases  figure   shows convergence
varying collision cost   close    convergence time remains stable  however 
high cost   convergence time increases linearly   case  high cost
collision drives resource access probability low  agents try avoid collisions
costs 
figure    shows expected convergence increase number resources c
number agents n proportionally  increase convergence time still sub linear
increase c

anonymity bourgeois convention infinite  at least small number resources

coordination signals k  however  market mechanism already makes sure agent
wants access resource one coordination signal  therefore  showed
