argument acceptable wrt it  complete extensions could viewed conflict free fixed
points characteristic function f    ar  ar defined f  s    set acceptable
arguments wrt s  preferred extensions maximal conflict free fixed points f
least fixed point f called grounded extension  could many preferred
extensions  exists unique grounded extension  stable extension conflict free
set arguments attacks every argument belonging it 
amgoud besnard        proposed use tarskis abstract logic argumentation characterized simply consequence operator

definition   given language l  abstract logic defined pair  cn  con ra 
cn   l  l represents consequence operator con ra  l collection
contradictory sets following axioms hold 
   cn satisfies expansion  idempotence finiteness axioms 
    weak absurdity  con ra superset belongs con ra  
    weak coherence  cn      con ra 
given abstract logic  cn  con ra   x closed iff x   cn  x   set x
con ra said contradictory 
set x l said inconsistent iff closure cn  x  contradictory   x said
consistent iff inconsistent  x minimal inconsistent iff x inconsistent
proper subset x consistent   
definition   say abstract logic satisfies
strong absurdity axiom con ra    x con ra  cn  x    l 

follows immediately abstract logic tarski abstract logic satisfies
strong absurdity axiom x l  x  inconsistent   
example   let rs      wr  go  b hw  hw  set strict rules   
l language consisting literals whose atoms occur rules rs    define
al     cn    con ra  follows 
x con ra iff x contains pair literals  l  l  
cn  consequence operator defined rs   
illustration  cn        wr  go   cn    m      wr  go  m  hw  cn    m  b    
 wr  go  m  hw  b  hw   hence set  m  b  inconsistent contradictory 
difficult see al  abstract logic  cn    hw  hw    
 hw  hw   follows al  satisfy strong absurdity axiom 
   note con ra could empty case definite logic programs l consists
positive literals  nonetheless  con ra    l con ra 
   words  set sentences x inconsistent contradiction could derived though
contradiction may present directly x  i e  inconsistent set may contradictory  
    proper subset x subset x    x 
    tarskian one  abstract logic needs satisfy absurdity coherence   x 
inconsistent  cn   x   contradictory  since strong absurdity satisfied  cn  cn   x      l 
idempotence  cn  cn   x      cn   x    hence cn   x     l  coherence holds 
weak coherence axiom abstract logic  cn      con ra  due strong absurdity 
con ra      due weak absurdity  fact con ra      follows l
con ra  hence cn       l
