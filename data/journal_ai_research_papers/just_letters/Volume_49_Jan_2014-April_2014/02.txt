   introduction
properties like logical closure and consistency are important properties in any logical reasoning system  caminada and amgoud        showed that not every logic based argument
system satisfies these relevant properties  but under conditions like closure under contraposition or transposition of the monotonic part of the underlying logic   these properties
are fulfilled for aspic systems  prakken        and later modgil and prakken        have
developed this idea further for aspic   a rich and complex logic based argumentation
system 
the following example illustrates that there are many sensible aspic or assumptionbased systems that satisfy both properties of closure and consistency but are neither closed
under contraposition nor under transposition 
   a precise definition of closure under contraposition and transposition is given in section

example   consider an aspic like system as    rs  rd  where
   rd   rd   rd  is a set of defeasible rules and
 a  rd  consists of two defeasible rules
d    p  f

d    b  f

representing defaults birds fly  penguins dont and
 b  rd  consists of a single defeasible rule
th  bh
representing the default thais normally have black hair
   rs   rs   rs  is a set of strict rules and
 a  rs  consists of three strict rules

where oj d    means that rule d  is not applicable 
 b  rs  consists of a single strict rule
 th
it is not difficult to see that as satisfies both properties of closure and consistency 
even though as is neither closed under contraposition nor under transposition  there
is no reason to rule out systems like as from consideration as long as they capture our
intuition in the concerned applications  in fact  systems like as often offer a more natural representation of the concerned applications than those closed under contraposition or
transposition  to illuminate this point  imagine another aspic like system as  containing
the strict and defeasible rules in as but is closed under contraposition  
suppose we are interested in the colour of the hair of the concerned thai individual 
consider the argument a    th  bh  let b     p  f and b     p  b  f   let
cn be the consequence operator defined by the strict rules  in as    from f  cn   f  bh   
it follows from the closure under contraposition property of cn  bh  cn   f  f     therefore there is an argument b with conclusion bh that contains b    b  as subarguments  b
hence attacks a  as b is attacked  by undercut  by argument c    p  oj d    at b 
and there is no attack against c  a is accepted in the grounded extension  but the set  a 
itself is not admissible  in other words  to draw a conclusion about the hair colour of thais 
the system needs to resolve a completely unrelated controversy about the flying capabilities
of penguins and birds 
   for example  by adding to as absurdity rules representing the proposition inconsistency implies
every thing  of the form a  a  l where a is an atom appearing in rs  rd and l is a literal over this
set of atoms  it is not difficult to see that as  is closed under contraposition  see appendix of section    
   a precise definition is given in definition   

  

ficlosure and consistency in logic associated argumentation

in general  the condition of closure under contraposition creates an attack against any
defeasible argument from any inconsistency in aspic systems  in other words  if the systems happen to contain knowledge about several causally independent domains like about
the flying penguins and the hair colour of thais  closure under contraposition will interlink
them and making it necessary to resolve all possible inconsistencies in all parts of the systems before being able to answer any query  independent of whether these inconsistencies
are causally related to the query or not  
in contrast  in argument systems like as  there is no attack against a and  a  is
admissible  controversy about the flying capabilities of penguins do not have any effect on
the acceptance of a 
though closure under transposition avoids the problem of conflict propagation  it is not
adopted in many well known and practical systems as an indiscriminate application of it
could lead to counter intuitive result in many cases  for example  consider a simplified
version of example birds fly penguins dont in aspic  whose set of strict rules is the
closure under transposition of the following strict rules 
app  b  f

p  f

pb

p  app

where app is an ordinary premise with app   app 
therefore the rule app  p is included in the set of strict rules 
suppose the knowledge base only consists of the ordinary premise app stating that the
default birds fly is applicable 
without any further information  the only two arguments are  a  app and b 
a  p 
accepting ordinary premise app simply says that there is no information at all why the
default birds fly should not be applied  it does not say anything about penguin  but closure
under transposition implies that there is definitely no penguin around  a rather slippery way
to make a conclusion  
in the context of logic programming  the rule app  p is also rather unnatural as app
is viewed as an assumption and  is the explicit negation operator whose intuitive reading
is that an explicit negation of an assertion should be based on some hard evidence  not
on another assumption  gelfond   lifschitz         
in contrast to aspic systems  not much research has been done to study the logical
closure and consistency of the semantics of other well known and widely applied systems
like logic programming or assumption based argumentation  gelfond   lifschitz       
lifschitz        bondarenko  dung  kowalski    toni         properties like closure under
transposition or contraposition are not embraced in logic programming or assumption based
argumentation  prakken        has observed that assumption based argumentation yields
unintuitive argument with unwanted conclusion if the inference rules satisfy the transposition property  it is hence natural to ask
whether there are conditions that are implied by both conditions of closure under contraposition and transposition but still guaranteeing the important properties of logical closure
and consistency  and
   pollock        and wu        have also pointed out that classical propositional proof systems propagate
conflicts throughout the knowledge bases to unrelated parts

whether the logical closure and consistency properties could be stated and studied in a
general framework generalizing both assumption based and aspic like systems and possibly
also other logic based argument systems  
we will present in this paper a new condition referred to as the self contradiction axiom 
that guarantees the consistency of complete extension semantics and is implied by both
conditions of closure under contraposition or transposition while at the same time  also
includes systems that could avoid the problem of conflict propagation  in example   both
as  as  satisfy the self contradiction axiom 
it turns out that the consistency and closure properties in logic based argument systems could be studied within a general logic associated abstract argumentation framework 
obtained by associating abstract argumentation with abstract logics to represent the conclusions of arguments  we demonstrate that logic associated abstract argumentation frameworks capture aspic like systems  without preferences  and assumption based argumentation  we present two simple and natural properties of compactness and cohesion in
logic associated abstract argumentation frameworks and show that they capture the logical
closure and consistency of the complete extension semantics  we demonstrate that in both
assumption based argumentation and aspic like systems cohesion follows naturally from
the self contradiction axiom 
we further give a translation from aspic like systems  without preferences  into equivalent assumption based systems that keeps the self contradiction property invariant 
the paper is structured as follows  in section   we recall abstract argumentation and
tarski abstract logics  we then introduce in section   a framework in which abstract argumentation is associated to abstract logics where sentences in abstract logics represent
argument conclusions  we present in this section two simple and natural conditions of compactness and cohesion and show that they ensure the satisfaction of the properties of logical
closure and consistency of complete extensions  in sections      we show how compactness
and cohesions could be captured naturally in aspic like systems or assumption based argumentation  we introduce in section   the fundamental axiom of self contradiction and show
the connections between it and the properties of closure under contraposition and transposition  we provide in section   a transformation from aspic like systems into equivalent
assumption based framework  in section    we discuss the more recent systems based on
tarskis abstract logics  we then conclude  

   preliminaries
an abstract argumentation framework  dung        is defined simply by a pair  ar  att 
of a set of arguments ar and att  ar  ar where  a  b   att represents an attack
from argument a against argument b  a set of argument s attacks an argument a if
some argument in s attacks a  s attacks another set s  if s attacks an argument in
s    s is conflict free if it does not attack itself  s is conflicting if it attacks itself  an
argument a is acceptable wrt set of arguments s if s attacks each attack against a  s is
admissible if s is conflict free and it counter attacks each attack against it  the semantics
   the intuitive reading of self contradiction is that if x causes contradiction then x contradicts
itself 
   a very preliminary extended abstract of this paper is published by dung and thang        

  

ficlosure and consistency in logic associated argumentation

of abstract argumentation is determined by the acceptability of arguments and various
associated notions of extensions  a complete extension is an admissible set containing every
argument acceptable wrt it  complete extensions could also be viewed as conflict free fixed
points of the characteristic function f    ar   ar defined by f  s    set of acceptable
arguments wrt s  preferred extensions are maximal conflict free fixed points of f while the
least fixed point of f is called the grounded extension  while there could be many preferred
extensions  there exists an unique grounded extension  a stable extension is a conflict free
set of arguments that attacks every argument not belonging to it 
amgoud and besnard        have proposed the use of tarskis abstract logic in argumentation that is characterized simply by a consequence operator 
given a language l of well formed formulas  a tarski abstract logic  amgoud   besnard 
      is defined by a consequence operator cn   l   l such that following axioms are
satisfied 
    expansion 

x  cn  x 

    idempotence 
    finiteness 

cn  cn  x     cn  x 
s
cn  x     cn  y     y  x and y is finite  

    absurdity 

cn   x     l for some x  l

    coherence 

cn       l

we introduce below the consequence operator over a set of strict or inference rules 
a strict rule  is of the form
            n  
where             n    are from l 
definition   let rs be a set of strict rules  define the consequence operator cnrs  
 l   l as follows  for a set x  l  cnrs  x  is the smallest set such that
   x  cnrs  x   and
   for each rule           n   in rs  if            n    cnrs  x  then   cnrs  x  


   associating abstract argumentation with abstract logics
intuitively  an argument is a proof of some conclusion  in many cases  such proofs are constructed following some proof theory of some formal logics  such logics could be nonmonotonic  the notions of closure and consistency are then defined according to the monotonic
parts of the underlying logics 
many logics underlying argumentation systems like assumption based argumentation
or aspic systems do not always impose the absurdity axiom  this motivates our slight
generalization of tarski abstract logics in the following definition 
   often also referred to as inference rules in assumption based argumentation 

  

fidung   thang

definition   given a language l  an abstract logic is defined as a pair  cn  con t ra 
where cn   l   l represents a consequence operator and con t ra   l is a collection
of contradictory sets such that following axioms hold 
   cn satisfies the expansion  idempotence and finiteness axioms 
    weak absurdity  if s  con t ra then each superset of s also belongs to con t ra  
    weak coherence  cn      con t ra  
given an abstract logic  cn  con t ra   x is closed iff x   cn  x   a set x 
con t ra is said to be contradictory 
a set x  l is said to be inconsistent iff its closure cn  x  is contradictory   x is said
to be consistent iff it is not inconsistent  x is minimal inconsistent iff x is inconsistent
and each proper subset of x is consistent   
definition   we say that an abstract logic satisfies the
strong absurdity axiom if con t ra     and for each x  con t ra  cn  x    l 

it follows immediately that an abstract logic is a tarski abstract logic if it satisfies the
strong absurdity axiom and there is x  l such that  x  is inconsistent   
example   let rs      wr   go  b  hw  m  hw  be a set of strict rules   
and l be a language consisting of literals whose atoms occur in the rules in rs    define
al     cn    con t ra  as follows 
 x  con t ra iff x contains a pair of literals  l  l  
 cn  is the consequence operator defined by rs   
for illustration  cn        wr  go   cn    m      wr  go  m  hw  and cn    m  b    
 wr  go  m  hw  b  hw   hence the set  m  b  is inconsistent but not contradictory 
it is not difficult to see that al  is an abstract logic  from cn    hw  hw    
 hw  hw   it follows that al  does not satisfy the strong absurdity axiom  
   note that con t ra could be empty like in the case of definite logic programs where l consists only of
positive literals  nonetheless  if con t ra     then l  con t ra 
   in other words  a set of sentences x is inconsistent if a contradiction could be derived from it though
contradiction may not be present directly in x  i e  an inconsistent set may not be contradictory  
    y is a proper subset of x if y is a subset of x and y    x 
    to be a tarskian one  an abstract logic needs to satisfy absurdity and coherence  because  x  is
inconsistent  cn   x   is contradictory  since strong absurdity is satisfied  cn  cn   x      l  because
of idempotence  cn  cn   x      cn   x    hence cn   x     l  so coherence holds 
from the weak coherence axiom of abstract logic  cn      con t ra  due to the strong absurdity 
con t ra      due to the weak absurdity  and the fact that con t ra      it follows that l 
con t ra  hence cn       l 
    the rules are taken from an example by caminada and amgoud        where wr   john wears
something that looks like a a wedding ring  m   john is married  hw   john has a wife  go  
john often goes out until late  b   john is a bachelor 

  

ficlosure and consistency in logic associated argumentation

inspired by amgoud and besnards idea         we use abstract logics to represent the
conclusions of arguments but in difference to them  we do not specify in detail the structure
of individual arguments 
definition   a logic associated argumentation framework over a language l is a
quadruple  af    al  cnl  where
   af    ar  att  is an abstract argumentation framework  and
   al    cn  con t ra  is an abstract logic over l  and
   cnl   ar  l assigns to each argument a  its conclusion cnl a  in l  and
    is a partial order   over ar where a  b means that a is a subargument of b such
that for all arguments c  ar  if c attacks a then c attacks b  
remark  
 for a set s of arguments  cnl s  denotes the set of the conclusions of
the arguments in s 
 the set of all subarguments of a is denoted by sub a   for a set of arguments s 
sub s  contains all subarguments of arguments in s 

we next give an example of a logic associated argumentation framework 
example   let laf     af        al    cnl  where al  is defined in example   and
af     ar    att    such that
   the arguments in ar  are constructed with rules from the set of strict rules rs  in
example    and a set of defeasible rules rd    wr  m  go  b   there are  
arguments    
a     wr  a     wr  m  a     wr  m  hw 
a     go  a     go  b 

a     go  b  hw 

attack relation  a  attacks a  and vice versa  there are no other attacks  let
att      a    a      a    a     
   the subargument relation   is the reflexive and transitive closure of a   a   a 
and a   a   a    
definition   let laf    af    al  cnl   al    cn  con t ra   be a logic associated
argumentation framework 
   laf is said to satisfy the closure property if for each complete extension e of af 
cnl e  is closed wrt al 
    a partial order is a reflexive  asymmetric and transitive relation 
    for a precise definition see definition    

  

fidung   thang

   laf is said to satisfy the consistency property if for each complete extension e
of af  cnl e  is consistent wrt al  
example    continuation of example   
the grounded extension of af  is ge    a    a    a    a     there are two preferred
extensions e     a    a    a    a    a    and e     a    a    a    a    a    
cnl ge     wr  go  m  b  and cn   cnl ge     cnl ge    hw  hw   hence the
set of conclusions of arguments in the grounded extension are neither closed nor consistent wrt the abstract logic al    hence laf  satisfies neither the closure property nor the
consistency property 
it is also easy to see that the sets of conclusions of the arguments of the two preferred
extensions are neither closed nor consistent either  
example    continuation of example   
let rs    rs    hw  m  hw  b   the consequence operator wrt rs  is
denoted by cn    let al     cn    con t ra  and af     ar    att    where
 ar    ar    a    a    with a    a   b and a    a   m   
 att      a    a      a    a      a    a      a    a      a    a      a    a     
   is the reflexive and transitive closure of    a   a    a   a    
the grounded extension of af  is ge     a    a     two preferred extensions of af 
are e     a    a    a    a    a    and e     a    a    a    a    a    
it is not difficult to see that the sets cnl ge       wr  go   cnl e       wr  go  m  hw  b  
cnl e       wr  go  b  hw  m  are closed and consistent 
let laf     af        al    cnl   both closure and consistency properties are satisfied
in laf    
from now on until the end of this section  we assume an arbitrary but fixed logicassociated framework laf    af    al  cnl  
it turns out that both the closure and consistency properties are based on an intuitive
idea of a base of an argument 
definition   let a be an argument and ba be a finite set of subarguments of a  ba is
said to be a base of a if following conditions are satisfied 
   cnl a   cn  cnl ba  
   for each argument c  c attacks a iff c attacks ba  
it is easy to see that for each argument a   a  is a base of a 
in example    though cnl a     cn   cnl a       a    is not a base of a  since a 
attacks a  but a  does not attack a   
note that the empty set is a base of both arguments a  and a   
in contrast  in example     a    is a base of a  and a  and  a    is a base of a  and a   
    i e  a    wr  m  hw  b  and a    go  b  hw  m 

  

ficlosure and consistency in logic associated argumentation

definition  
   an argument a is said to be generated by a set of arguments s if
there is a base ba of a such that ba  sub s  
   the set of all arguments generated by s is denoted by gn s   
it follows immediately
lemma   let s be a set of arguments  the following assertions hold 
   for each argument a  a is generated by  a  
   sub s   gn  s  
   cnl gn  s    cn  cnl sub s    
   cn  cnl gn  s      cn  cnl sub s    
   for each argument c  c attacks gn  s  iff c attacks s 
proof see appendix of section    
theorem   let e be a complete extension  then gn  e    e
proof see appendix of section    
theorem   motivates the following definitions      
definition   we say that a logic associated argumentation framework laf is compact
if for each set of arguments s  cnl gn  s   is closed  
the argumentation framework in example   is not compact since for s    a     gn  s   
 a    a    a    and cnl gn  s      wr  go  m  is not closed since cn   wr  go  m      wr  go  m  hw  
in contrast  the argumentation framework in example   is compact  for example 
gn  s     a    a    a    a    a     wrt laf    and cnl gn  s      wr  go  m  hw  b  is both
closed and consistent 
theorem   each compact logic associated argumentation framework satisfies the closureproperty 
proof  let e be a complete extension  from the compactness  it follows that cnl gn  e  
is closed  from theorem    cnl e  is closed  
from lemma    it follows that laf is compact iff cnl gn  s     cn  cnl sub s    iff
cn  cnl sub s     cnl gn  s    we have proved
lemma   laf is compact iff for each set s of arguments  cn  cnl sub s     cnl gn  s  
notation   abusing the notations for simplicity  we often refer to a set of arguments
s as inconsistent  resp  consistent  if cnl sub s   is inconsistent  resp  consistent

intuitively  inconsistency among a set of arguments indicates a possible conflict among
its generated arguments  this insight motivates the following definitions 
definition   a logic associated argumentation framework laf is said to be cohesive if
for each inconsistent set of argument s  gn  s  is conflicting  
for illustration  consider the logic associated argumentation framework in example   
let s    a    a     it is clear that s is inconsistent  it is not difficult to see that each
base of each argument a   a    a    contains argument a itself  therefore gn  s   
 a    a    a    a     gn  s  is thus conflict free  the framework laf  is hence not cohesive 
note that the argumentation framework laf  in example   is both compact and cohesive 
theorem   let laf be a cohesive logic associated argumentation framework  then laf
satisfies the consistency property 
proof let e be a complete extension  suppose cnl e  is inconsistent  from the cohesion of
laf  it follows that gn  e  is conflicting  from theorem    e is conflicting  contradiction 
hence cnl e  is consistent  
it follows immediately from theorems   and   
corollary   let laf be a compact and cohesive logic associated argumentation framework  then laf satisfies both the closure  and consistency properties  
in the next sections  we show that aspic like systems  without preferences  and assumptionbased argumentation are instances of logic associated argumentation frameworks  we will
also introduce the axiom of self contradiction to guarantee the cohesion  and consistency 
of these systems 

   argumentation with strict and defeasible rules
we assume a language l of literals where a literal is an atom a or the explicit negation a
of atom a  a set of literals is said to be contradictory if it contains a pair a  a 
it is important to note that we identify a with a  for x  l  denote x    l   l 
x  
a defeasible rule is of the form
            n  
where             n    are from l 
definition    a rule based argumentation system is a pair as    rs  rd  of a set rs
of strict rules and a set rd of defeasible rules such that cnrs    is not contradictory  
the following definition    identifies the abstract logic underlying a rule based argumentation system as    rs  rd  
  

ficlosure and consistency in logic associated argumentation

definition    let as    rs  rd  be a rule based argumentation system  define
alas    cnas   con t raas  
where con t raas is the collection of all contradictory sets and cnas   cnrs   
it follows immediately
lemma   alas is an abstract logic  
we recall below the arguments and attack relations of rule based argumentation systems
introduced by caminada and amgoud         prakken         pollock         and modgil
and prakken        
definition   

   rules of the form        are arguments with conclusion  

   let r be a strict defeasible rule of the form             n       n     further suppose that a            an   n     are arguments with conclusions             n respectively 
then a            an      is an argument with conclusion  and last rule r 
   every argument is constructed by applying finitely many times the above two steps  
we next introduce key notations 
notation  
   a strict argument is an argument containing no defeasible rule  nonstrict arguments are called defeasible arguments 
   a basic defeasible argument is an argument whose last rule is a defeasible one 
i e  of the form a            an   
for a basic defeasible argument b  the last rule of b is denoted by lr b  
   b is a subargument of an argument a of the form a            an       denoted by
b  a  if b   a or b is a subargument of some ai   
remark   the conclusion of an argument a is denoted by cnl a  
remark   arguments of the form a            an      are also often viewed as proof
trees with the root labelled by  and the children of the root are the roots of subtrees
a            an   note that if n      the proof tree consists of just the root 
illustrations for argumentation systems based on strict and defeasible rules are given in
examples      
the following notion of attack is adopted from articles of caminada and amgoud        
prakken         pollock         and modgil and prakken        
definition    an argument a attacks an argument b  on b  if b is basic defeasible
subargument of b and one of the following conditions is satisfied

remark   for simplicity  we identify a rule based argumentation system as with the logicassociated argumentation framework  afas     alas   cnl  where afas is the argumentation framework obtained from as according to definitions       
theorem   rule based argumentation systems are compact 
proof see appendix of section

proof see appendix of section    
we introduce now a fundamental condition underlying the cohesion of rule based argumentation 
definition    the abstract logic alas is said to satisfy the
self contradiction axiom if for each minimal inconsistent set x  l   x  cnas  x    

the example below illustrates the intuition of the self contradiction axiom using again
the famous birds fly penguins dont example 
example   let as    rs  rd  where rd consists of two defeasible rules 
d    p  f

d    b  f

and rs consists of three strict rules
r     p

r    p  b

r    p   oj d   

where oj d    is an atom stating that rule d  is applicable 
it is obvious that the set of strict rules rs is not closed under transposition  it is also
straightforward to see that cnas   f  f       f  f    
  l  hence the underlying abstract
logic alas satisfies neither the strong absurdity axiom nor the closure under transposition
property   
    the intuitive reading of self contradiction is that if x causes contradiction then x contradicts
itself 
    see section     for precise definitions of closure under transposition or contraposition and their relationships with strong absurdity and self contradiction

   assumption based argumentation
given a logical language l  an assumption based argumentation  aba  framework  bondarenko et al         is a triple f    r  a    where r is a set of inference rules of the form
is a  total  one one
          n    for n      and a  l is a set of assumptions  and
mapping from a into l  where x is referred to as the contrary of x such that following
properties are satisfied 
 assumptions in a do not appear in the heads of rules in r  and
 contraries of assumptions are not assumptions  and
 if l contains an explicit negation operator  then cnr    is not contradictory wrt
  i e  for all   l         cnr    
the following edition of the birds fly penguins dont example provides an illustration

we identify the structure of abstract logics underlying aba frameworks below 
    assumption based abstract logics
a set x  l is said to be contradictory iff
 x is contradictory wrt
or

  i e  there exists an assumption   a such that       x 

 x is contradictory wrt     i e  there exists   l such that       x

   con t raf is the set of all contradictory sets  
it follows immediately

remark   for simplicity  if there are no possibilities for misunderstanding  we often write
in this section cn  s  or con t ra for cnf  s  or con t raf respectively 
we adapt the self contradiction axiom for assumption based argumentation below

the
ab self contradiction axiom   if for each inconsistent set of assumptions x  there is
  x such that   cnf  x   
    closure and consistency in assumption based argumentation
we first recall definitions of arguments and attack relation associated to an aba framework 
definition   
   any assumption  is an argument whose support and conclusion are
     respectively 
   let           n   be a rule  further suppose that a            an are arguments with
conclusions             n respectively  then a            an   is an argument whose
conclusion is  and whose support is the union of the supports of a            an
   every argument is constructed by applying finitely many times the above two steps  
remark   arguments are often viewed as proof trees  arguments of the form a            an 
 are proof trees with the root labelled by  and the children of the root are the roots of
subtrees a            an   note that if n      the proof tree consists of just the root  if a is an
assumption  then the proof tree consists of just the root labelled by 
notation  

   the support of an argument a is denoted by supp a  

the support of a set of arguments s is the union of the supports of each individual
argument in it and denoted by supp s  
   the conclusion of an argument a is denoted by cnl a   
definition   
supp b  

   an argument a attacks an argument b if cnl a     for some  

   we say b is a subargument of an argument a of the form a            ak    denoted
by b  a  if b   a or b is a subargument of some ai   
remark   for simplicity  we identify an assumption based framework f with the logicassociated argumentation framework  aff     alf   cnl  where aff is the argumentation
framework generated from f  according to definitions         
it is not difficult to see
theorem   aba frameworks are compact 
    ab stands for assumption based

    logic programming
logic programming could be classified into three different classes of definite programs 
normal programs and extended programs with increasing complexity  bondarenko  dung 
kowalski and toni       showed that logic programs are instances of assumption based
argumentation  we discuss below the underlying abstract logics of all classes and the selfcontradiction axiom 
      definite logic programs
a definite logic program is simply an assumption based argumentation framework f  
 r  a    based on a language l where
   l consists only of ground atoms and the set of assumptions is empty 
   rules in r are of the form a            an  h where h  a            an are atoms from l 
as there is no contradiction in l  con t raf     the ab self contradiction axiom
hold trivially  since there is no attack between arguments  the only extension is the set of
all arguments  the closure and consistency properties hold obviously 

      normal logic programs
a normal logic program is an assumption based argumentation framework f    r  a 
based on a language l where

 

   l consists of atoms of the form a  b        together with the negation as failure literals
of the form not a where a is an atom 
   assumptions are negation as failure literals not a whose contraries are a 
   rules in r are of the form l            ln  h where h is an atom and l            ln are literals
from l 
  

fidung   thang

con t raf consists of all subsets of l that contain a pair a  not a for some atom a 
the ab self contradiction axiom holds obviously    the closure and consistency properties hence hold for all extensions of normal programs 

      extended logic programs
an extended logic program  gelfond   lifschitz        lifschitz        is an assumptionbased argumentation framework f    r  a    based on a language l where
   l consists of atoms of the form a  b        and their explicit negations a  b        together
with the negation as failure literals of the form not l where l is a classical literal  i e 
an atom or the explicit negation of an atom  
   assumptions are negation as failure literals not l whose contraries are l 
   r consists of rules of the form l            ln  h where h is a classical literal and
l            ln are literals from l
con t raf consists of all subsets of l that contain a pair a  a for some atom a or a
pair l  not l for some classical literal l 
from theorems     and corollary    it follows immediately
corollary   let f be a extended logic program  if cnf    is not contradictory wrt  and
alf satisfies the ab self contradiction axiom then f is compact and cohesive and hence
satisfies both the closure and consistency properties 

   translating rule based argumentation into assumption based
argumentation
we have showed in the previous two sections that the self contradiction axioms are sufficient
and natural conditions for ensuring closure and consistency properties in both assumptionbased and rule based argumentation 
in this section  we argue that the self contradiction axiom in rule based systems is
subsumed by the assumption based self contradiction axiom by giving a translation from
rule based systems into equivalent assumption based ones  more generally  the translation suggests that rule based argument systems  without preferences  are subsumed by
assumption based argumentation 
let as    rs  rd  be an arbitrary but fixed rule based argumentation system such
that for each r  rd  there is no rule in rs  rd whose head coincides with oj r  or
whose body contains an occurrence of oj r   we translate as into an assumption based
system in the following definition 
definition    t  as     r  a 

  is defined as follows 

    we give a short proof here  let x be an inconsistent set of assumptions  hence there is an assumption
 s t        cnf  x   since assumptions do not appear in the heads of rules    x 

  

ficlosure and consistency in logic associated argumentation

   a    oj r    r  rd     not l   l is the head of some rule in rd 
where oj r  is viewed as an assumption indicating that rule r is applicable and not l
is a negation as failure assumption stating that there is no evidence to the contrary
of l 
  

r   rs   t r r    r  rd  
where t r r  is of the form
oj r   not h              n  h
if r is of the form             n  h

  

oj r    oj r  and not l   l 

remark   since there is no rule in rs  rd whose head is of the form oj r   no assumption in a coincides with the head of any rule in r  therefore cnt  as     is not
contradictory wrt   it is not difficult to see that cnt  as       cnas     cnt  as     is
hence not contradictory wrt   therefore cnt  as     is not contradictory 
t  as  is hence an assumption based argumentation system 
as as and t  as  are distinct systems  an attentive reader may ask in what sense they
are equivalent 
before giving a formal elaboration on this question  let us look at an example 
example   consider a simple rule based system as consisting of one strict rule and one
defeasible rule  
r     b
r    b  f
there are two arguments here 
a     b and a    a   f
the arguments do not attack each other  hence the only complete extension e of as
contains both arguments a    a   
the corresponding assumption based system t  as  consists of two rules 
b

oj r     not f  b  f

there are four arguments in the assumption based system 
b     b

b    c     c     b   f

c    oj r   

c    not f

there are no attacks between these four arguments  the only complete extension e  of
t  as  consists of all four arguments  in fact the information contained in e  is fully captured in the set s    b    b    since c    c  are subarguments of b    hence any attack against
  

fidung   thang

them is also an attack against b    we could view the set s as an equivalent representative
of e    s could be viewed as representing the core of e   
the equivalence between e and e  is captured by the correspondence between arguments
a    a  and arguments b    b  respectively 
note that arguments c    c  in extension e  of t  as  explicitly represent the implicit
meta level information contained in extension e of as  namely  defeasible rule r  is applicable and there is no argument with conclusion f   
let af     ar    att     af     ar    att    be the argumentation frameworks corresponding to as  t  as  respectively 
definition    let s be a set of arguments in af    the core of s  denoted by core s

holds  a is acceptable wrt s iff a is acceptable wrt core s

   discussion
amgoud and besnard        have introduced the use of tarskis abstract logic to study
the consistency property of logic based argumentation  in the following  we discuss how
compactness and cohesion could be fulfilled in their systems 
as remarked earlier  a tarski abstract logic is represented by an abstract logic where
con t ra     and for each x  con t ra  cn  x    l and there is x  l such that
cn   x    con t ra 
a tarski abstract logic is said to be adjunctive if for all x  y  l  if cn   x     
cn   x  y      cn   y   then there exists z such that cn   z     cn   x  y   
a knowledge base is defined as a set   l such that for each x    x is consistent 
an argument over  is a pair a    x    where x is finite consistent support of a
denoted by supp a   and   cn  x  is the conclusion of a denoted by cnl a   the
support of a set of arguments is the union of the supports of the individual arguments 
ar denotes the set of all arguments over  
x   is called a minimal conflict set if x is inconsistent and each proper subset of x
is consistent   
for the rest of this discussion  we assume that all minimal conflict sets contain two or
more elements 
let att  ar  ar be an attack relation 
   att is said to be context sensitive iff for all a  b  ar  if supp a supp b  is inconsistent
then either  a  b   att or  b  a   att 
   att is said to be conflict dependent iff for all a  b  ar  if  a  b   att then supp a  
supp b  is inconsistent 
   att is said to be symmetric iff for all a  b  ar  if  a  b   att then  b  a   att 
an argument b is said to be a subargument of an argument a  denoted b  a if b   a
or b          for some   supp a  
lemma    if all minimal conflict sets are binary and the attack relation att is contextsensitive  conflict dependent and symmetric then laf    af    al  cnl  is a compact
and cohesive logic associated argumentation framework 
proof see appendix of section    
it follows immediately from theorem   
corollary   if all minimal conflict sets are binary and the attack relation att is contextsensitive  conflict dependent and symmetric then laf satisfies both properties of closure
and consistency 
    it is not difficult to see that each minimal conflict set is finite as from cn  x    l  and l   cn   x  
for some x  l  it follows that x  cn  x   from the finiteness axiom  there is a finite subset y of x
such that x  cn  y    hence cn  y     l  from the minimality of x  it follows x   y   x is hence
finite 

   

ficlosure and consistency in logic associated argumentation

corollary   is rather limited due to restrictions imposed on the attack relations  this
is because the structure of arguments here is rather poor as abstract logics do not reveal
any structure of the consequence relation  our approach of marrying abstract argumentation with abstract logics resulting in logic associated abstract argumentation addresses this
problem by specifying the subargument structure and its relation to the attack relation 
caminada and amgoud        have also studied unrestricted rebuts where two arguments with contrary conclusions are considered to attack each other  defeasible argumentation with attacks based on unrestricted rebuts violates both the consistency and closure
properties except for the grounded semantics  unrestricted rebuts did not gain much attention in the research in assumption based argumentation or logic programming  this
suggests that there are relevant structural features underlying unrestricted attacks that are
still not understood  a sensible idea could be to study this kind of attacks within our
proposed framework of logic associated abstract argumentation as it could shed lights on
its instances in both defeasible and assumption based argumentation 
non interference  another key rationality postulate for structured argumentation has
been proposed by caminada  carnielli  and dunne        and studied extensively by caminada et al          and wu         non interference is conceptually different to the consistency and closure properties as the later properties could be viewed as about the correctness
of the argument systems while the former is about their structural modularity  as we focus
on the correctness of argument systems  a study on their structural modularity is outside
the scope of this paper  nonetheless  non interference seems to be related to a property of
localizing conflicts in arguments systems where we say that an argument system is localized
if there is no argument attacking every argument  it is not difficult to see that aspic systems
that are closed under contraposition is not localized if there is a rebutting attack in it  in
contrast  the self contradiction axiom allows us to develop localized aspic systems  it would
be interesting to see how the two concepts of localized conflicts and non interference are
interrelated 
toni        has generalized assumption based argumentation to represent reasoning
with both strict and defeasible rules satisfying both the rational properties of logical closure
and consistency  as we have showed in section    standard assumption based argumentation
captures rule based argumentation system by a simple and elegant transformation  hence it
is not necessary to generalize assumption based argumentation to capture defeasible reasoning with strict and defeasible rules  nevertheless  the proposal by toni        is interesting 
nielsen and parson        have also proposed a generalization of abstract argumentation
allowing sets of attacking arguments  prakken        and modgil and prakken        had
also studied preferences between arguments  it would be interesting to see whether the
properties of compactness and cohesion are satisfied in these frameworks 
we believe that the compactness and cohesion and self contradiction properties could
serve as guideline principles in the design of logic based argumentation systems to ensure the
satisfaction of properties of logical closure and consistency  as pointed out by caminada and
amgoud         there are several argument systems  garcia   simari        governatori 
maher  antoniou    billington        not satisfying the consistency property  it would be
interesting to see how the results in this paper could be applied on them

   suppose al is closed under contraposition  let x  con t ra  hence there is
an atom a s t   a  a   x  from a  cn   a     for any literal   and from the
closure under contraposition property  it follows that   cn   a  a    hence  
cn  x  for any literal   we have proved that l   cn  x  for each x  con t ra 
from definition     it follows that al satisfies the strong absurdity axiom 
   suppose al satisfies the strong absurdity axiom  let x  l such that x is minimal
inconsistent  therefore cn  x   con t ra  from the idempotence axiom and the
strong absurdity axiom  cn  x    l  it holds obviously  x  cn  x   
lemma   let as    rs  rd  such that the set of strict rules rs is closed under transposition  then alas satisfies the self contradiction axiom 
proof we first prove the following assertion 
assertion  let a be a strict argument over x with conclusion  and   
  p rem a   x 
then for each   p rem a   there is an argument b with premises in p rem a     
and conclusion   
proof we prove by induction on the height of a  as a proof tree    
if the height of a is    the theorem is obvious 
suppose a is of the form a            an   where cnl ai     i   let   p rem a  
without loss of generality  let   p rem an    from the closure under transposition  the rule
            n      n also belongs to rs  let b be the argument a            an     
n  
from the induction hypothesis  there is a proof tree t r whose premises are in p rem an  
 n   and whose conclusion is  
let t r be the tree obtained from t r by replacing each occurrence of premise n by
the argument b  it is clear that p rem t r    p rem a      and cnl t r       
let x  l s t  x is minimal inconsistent  hence there are two arguments a    a 
with premises in x and conclusions    respectively  from the minimality of x  it
holds  x   p rem a     p rem a     let   x  without loss of generality  suppose
  p rem a     from the above assertion  it follows that there exists an argument b with
conclusion  and p rem b   p rem a         let a be the argument obtained by
replacing each leaf labelled by  in b by tree a    it is clear that p rem a   x and the
conclusion of a is

proof let s be an inconsistent set of arguments  hence supp s  is inconsistent  since

that   cnf  supp s    from lemma    there is an argument a  gn  s  such that

lemma  
   let s be a set of arguments in af  and a be an argument in af    it holds 
a is acceptable wrt s iff a is acceptable wrt core s  
   let s be a set of arguments in af    s is admissible iff core s  is admissible 
proof
   since core s   s  if a is acceptable wrt core s   a is obviously acceptable wrt s 
suppose now that a is acceptable wrt s  let b attack a  hence there is a  s s t 
a attacks b  therefore a is not an assumption  hence a  core s   b is hence
attacked by core s   i e  a is acceptable by core s  
   follows immediately from the previous assertion  
lemma    let e  e  be complete extensions of af    it holds 
e   e  iff core e    core e   
proof we only need to show that core e    core e    implies e   e    the reverse
direction is obvious  let core e    core e      s  let a  e   s  a is hence an
assumption acceptable wrt e  from lemma    a is acceptable wrt s  thus a is acceptable
wrt e   lemma     hence a  e    similarly  we could show that each assumption in e    s
belongs to e  we thus proved e   e

   s is admissible in af  if and only if c s  is admissible in af   
   a is acceptable wrt s iff c a  is acceptable wrt c s 
proof
   the first assertion is obvious 
   it is obvious that there is no argument a in ar  such that c a   a 
viewing an argument in ar  as a proof tree  the height of a tree is defined to be the
length  i e  number of links  of the longest path from the root to a leaf  let ar  k be
the set of all trees of height  k in ar    we prove by induction that c is one one on
ar  k  
it is obvious that c is one one on ar      suppose c is one one on ar  k   let a  b
be two different arguments in ar  k     if the last rules of a b are different then it is
obvious that c a   c b  are different  suppose that the last rules of a b are identical 
then a  b respectively have the forms a            an     h  b            bn     h 
without loss of generality  we can assume that a     b    hence from the induction
hypothesis  c a       c b     therefore c a     c b  
it is also straightforward to prove by induction that for each b  ar    a  there is
a  ar  such that c a    b 
    a  suppose  a  b   att    let b  be a basic defeasible subargument of b such that
a attacks b  on b     there are two cases 
i  cnl a    oj lr b      undercut attack   from cnl a    cnl c a   
it follows cnl c a     oj lr b   and oj lr b    supp c b    c a 
hence attacks c b  wrt att   
ii  cnl a    h for h   cnl b     hence cnl c a     h and not h 
supp c b    c a  hence attacks c b  wrt att   
 b  suppose  c a   c b    att    there are two cases 
i  cnl c a     oj r  for some defeasible rule r such that oj r   supp c b   
from cnl a    cnl c a    it follows cnl a    oj r  and r is a defeasible
rule in b  hence there is basic defeasible subargument b  of b such that
lr b      r  hence a attacks b on b  in af   
ii  cnl c a     h such that not h  supp b   hence there is basic defeasible
rule r in b such that hd r    h  therefore there is a subargument b  of b
such that lr b      r  hence a attacks b on b   by rebutting  in af   
   from assertion    it is clear that s is conflict free iff c s  is conflict free 
suppose s defends itself against all attacks  let a attack c s  in af    therefore a is
not an assumption  from the second assertion  there is b   c    a   from assertion
   it follows b attacks s  therefore s attacks b  hence c s  attacks a

suppose c s  defends itself against all attacks  let a attack s in af    let b   c a  
from assertion    it follows b attacks c s   therefore c s  attacks b  hence s attacks
a 
   follows immediately from assertion    
theorem   for each complete extensions e of af  there is a complete extension e  of
af  and vice versa such that following properties hold 
   c e    core e   
   for each literal l  l    l  cnl e  iff l  cnl e   
proof let e be a complete extension of af    from assertion   in lemma     it follows
s   c e  is admissible  let as be the set of assumptions acceptable wrt s  we show
that e    s  as is complete  let b in af  be acceptable wrt e    suppose b is not an
assumption  let a   c    b   from lemma     assertion    a is acceptable wrt e  hence
a  e  therefore b  s  if b is an assumption  b  as   we have proved that e  is
complete and core e      c e   the uniqueness of e  follows directly from the lemma   
let l  l  such that l  cnl e     since l   a  it is clear that l  cnl core e      hence
l  cnl c e    from the first assertion in lemma     it follows l  cnl e   
theorem   if al  satisfies the self contradiction axiom then al  satisfies the ab selfcontradiction axiom 
proof suppose al  satisfies the self contradiction axiom  let x  a be an inconsistent
set of assumptions in t  as   we want to show that there exists   x such that  
cn   x   suppose the contrary  it follows immediately that there is atom a such that
 a  a   cn   x   there are two cases 
case     a  a   a  
    since a   a  a is an assumption  as classical negation
does not apply to negation as failure literal  it follows a   oj d  for some d  rd  from
oj d    a  cn   x   this is a contradiction to the hypothesis that     x such that
  cn   x   this case hence can not occur 
case     a  a   a     therefore  a  a   x     let s  be the set of all arguments
in ar    a whose support is a subset of x  from  a  a   cn   x    x  it follows s      
it is not difficult to see that cnl s      cn   x    x  let s  be a set of arguments
from ar  such that s    c    s     from cnl s      cnl s     it follows that cnl s    is
closed  wrt cn     it is also easy to see that sub s      s    let bs be the set of basic
defeasible arguments in s    from lemma    it is clear that cn   cnl bs     cnl s     since
 a  a   cn   x    x   cnl s      cn   cnl bs    cnl bs  is hence also inconsistent
wrt as  because al  satisfies the self contradiction axiom  there is a literal h  cnl bs 
such that h  cn   cnl bs    let    not h  from h  cnl bs   it follows  
supp c bs    supp s      x  from h  cn   cnl bs     cnl s      cn   x    x  it
follows   cn   x   contradiction 
we have proved that al  satisfies the assumption based self contradiction axiom
