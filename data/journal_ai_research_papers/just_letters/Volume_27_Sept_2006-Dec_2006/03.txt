abstract
in this paper  we show that there is a close relation between consistency in a constraint
network and set intersection  a proof schema is provided as a generic way to obtain consistency properties from properties on set intersection  this approach not only simplifies the
understanding of and unifies many existing consistency results  but also directs the study
of consistency to that of set intersection properties in many situations  as demonstrated
by the results on the convexity and tightness of constraints in this paper  specifically 
we identify a new class of tree convex constraints where local consistency ensures global
consistency  this generalizes row convex constraints  various consistency results are also
obtained on constraint networks where only some  in contrast to all in the existing work 
constraints are tight 

   introduction
a constraint network consists of a set of variables over finite domains and a system of
constraints over those variables  an important task is to find an assignment for all the
variables such that all the constraints in the network are satisfied  if such an assignment
exists  the network is satisfiable or globally consistent  and the assignment is called a solution 
the problem of determining the global consistency of a general constraint network is npcomplete  usually a search procedure is employed to find a solution  in practice  due
to efficiency considerations  the search is usually equipped with a filtering algorithm that
prunes values of a variable or the combinations of values of a certain number of variables
that cannot be part of any solution  the filtering algorithm can make a constraint network
locally consistent in the sense that a consistent assignment of some variables can always be
extensible to a new variable  an important and interesting question on local consistency is 
is the local consistency obtained sufficient to determine the global consistency of
the network without further search  as the filtering algorithm is of polynomial
complexity  a positive answer would mean that the network can be solved in
polynomial time 
much work has been done to explore the relationship between local and global consistency in particular and the properties of local consistency in general  one direction is to
make use of the topological structure of a constraint network  a classical result is that
when the graph of a constraint network is a tree  arc consistency of the network is sufficient
to ensure its global consistency  freuder

the second direction  makes use of semantic properties of the constraints  for monotone
constraints  path consistency implies global consistency  montanari         van beek and
dechter        generalize monotone constraints to a larger class of row convex constraints 
dechter        shows that a certain level of consistency in a constraint network whose
domains are of limited size ensures global consistency  later  van beek and dechter       
study the consistency of constraint networks with tight and loose constraints 
the existing work along the two approaches has used specific and different techniques to
study local and global consistency  in particular  there is little commonality in the details
of the existing work  in much of the existing work  the techniques and consequently the
proofs given are developed specifically for the results concerned 
in this paper  we show how much of this work can be connected together through a
new approach to studying consistency in a constraint network  we unite two seemingly
disparate areas  the study of set intersection on special sets and the study of k consistency
in constraint networks  in fact  k consistency can be expressed in terms of set intersection 
which allows one to obtain relationships between local and global consistency in a constraint
network through the properties of set intersection on special sets  the main result of this
approach is a proof schema that can be used to lift results from set intersection  which are
rather general  to particular consistency results on constraint networks  one benefit of the
proof schema lies in that it provides a modular way to greatly simplify the understanding
and proofs of consistency results  this benefit is considerable as often the proofs of many
existing results are complex and hard wired  using this new approach  we show that
it is precisely the various properties of set intersection that are the key to those results 
furthermore  the proofs become mechanical 
the following sketch illustrates briefly the use of our approach  one property of set
intersection is that if the intersection of every pair     of tree convex sets  see section    is
not empty  the intersection of the whole collection of these sets is not empty too  from this
property  we can see that the local information on the intersection of every pair of sets gives
rise to the global information on the intersection of all sets  intuitively  this relationship
between the local and global information corresponds to obtaining global consistency from
local consistency  the proof schema is used to lift the result on tree convex sets to the
following consistency result  for a binary constraint network of tree convex constraints 
      consistency  path consistency  implies global consistency of the network 
the usefulness of our new set based approach is twofold  firstly  it gives a clear picture
of many of the existing results  for example  many well known results in the second direction
based on semantic properties of the constraints  including van beek   dechter              
as well as results from the first direction  can be shown with easy proofs that make use of
set intersection properties  secondly  by directing the study of consistency to that of set
intersection properties  it helps improve some of the existing results and derive new results
as demonstrated in sections    
this paper is organized as follows  in section    we present necessary notations and
concepts  in section    we focus on properties of the intersection of tree convex sets and sets
   there is a difference between the work concerned here and that studying the tractability of constraint
languages  e g   schaefer        jeavons  cohen    gyssens         the latter considers the problems
whose constraints are from a fixed set of relations while the former studies constraint networks with
special properties 

   

fiset intersection and consistency in constraint networks

with cardinality restrictions  in section    we develop a characterization of k consistency
utilizing set intersection and the proof schema that offers a generic way to obtain consistency
results from set intersection properties  the power of the new approach is demonstrated
by new consistency results on the convexity and tightness of constraints  tree convex
constraints are studied in section    on a constraint network of tree convex constraints 
local consistency ensures global consistency  as a result of the intersection property of tree
convex sets  the tightness of constraints is studied in section    thanks to the intersection
properties of sets with cardinality restriction  a relation between local and global consistency
is identified on weakly tight constraint networks in section      these networks require only
some  rather than all  constraints to be m tight  improving the tightness result by van beek
and dechter         with the help of relational consistency  we show that global consistency
can be achieved through local consistency on weakly tight constraint networks in section     
this type of result on tightness was not known before  in section      we explore when
a constraint network is weakly m tight and present several results about the number of
tight constraints sufficient or necessary for a network to be weakly tight  to make full use
of the tightness of the constraints in a network  we propose dually adaptive consistency
in section      dually adaptive consistency of a constraint network is determined by its
topology and the tightest relevant constraint on each variable  for completeness  we include
in section   results on tightness and tree convexity that are based on relational consistency 
we conclude in section   

   preliminaries
a constraint network r is defined as a set of variables n    x    x            xn    a set of finite
domains d    d    d            dn   where domain di   for all i     n  is a set of values that
variable xi can take  and a set of constraints c    cs    cs            cse   where si   for all i     e 
is a subset of  x    x            xn   and each constraint csi is a relation defined on the domains
of all variables in si   without loss of generality  we assume that  for any two constraints
csi   csj  c  i    j   si    sj   the arity of constraint csi is the number of variables in si  
for a variable x  dx denotes its domain  in the rest of this paper  we will often use network
to mean constraint network 
an instantiation of variables y    x            xj   is denoted by a    a            aj   where
ai  di for i     j  an extension of a to a variable x 
  y   is denoted by  a  u  where
u  dx   an instantiation of a set of variables y is consistent if it satisfies all constraints in
r that do not involve any variables outside y  
a constraint network r is k consistent if and only if for any consistent instantiation a
of any distinct k    variables  and for any new variable x  there exists u  dx such that
 a  u  is a consistent instantiation of the k variables  r is strongly k consistent if and only if
it is j consistent for all j  k  a strongly n consistent network is called globally consistent

   properties on set intersection
in this section  we develop a number of set intersection results that will be used later to
derive results on consistency  the set intersection property that we are concerned with is 
given a collection of l finite sets  under what conditions is the intersection of
all l sets not empty 
here  we are particularly interested in the intersection property on sets with two interesting and useful restrictions  convexity and cardinality 
    tree convex sets
given a collection of sets  some structures can be associated with the elements of the sets
such that we can obtain interesting and useful set intersection results  here we study the
sets whose elements form a tree  we first introduce the concept of a tree convex set 
definition   given a discrete set u and a tree t with vertices u   a set a  u is tree
convex under t if there exists a subtree of t whose vertices are a 
a subtree of a tree t is a subgraph of t that is a tree  next we define when we can say
a collection of sets are tree convex 
definition   given a collection of discrete sets s  let the union of the sets of s be u   the
sets of s are tree convex under a tree t on u if every set of s is tree convex under t  
a collection of sets are said tree convex if there exists a tree such that the sets in the
collection are tree convex under the tree

 a  b  c  d  is tree convex under the given tree  so is the set  b  a  c  e  since the elements of
the set are a subtree  however   b  c  e  is not tree convex as its elements do not form a
subtree of the given tree 
example   consider s                             if we construct a tree on              with
  being the root and         being its children  each set of s covers the nodes of exactly one
branch of the tree  hence  the sets of s are tree convex 
   

fiset intersection and consistency in constraint networks

tree convex sets have the following intersection property 
lemma    tree convex sets intersection 
given a finite collection t
of finite sets s 
t
assume the sets of s are tree convex 
e     iff for all e    e   s  e  e      
es
proof  let l be the number of sets in s  and t a tree such that  for each ei  s  ei is
the vertices of a subtree ti of t   assuming t is a rooted tree  every ti  i     l  is a rooted
tree whose root is exactly the node nearest to the root of t   let ri denote the root of ti
for i     l  t
to prove
ei      we want to show the intersection of the trees  ti   i     l  is not
i   l

empty  the following propositions on subtrees are necessary in our main proof 
proposition   let t    t  be two subtrees of a tree t   and t   t   t    t is a tree 
if t     it is a trivial tree  now let t      since t is a portion of t    there is no circuit in
it  it is only necessary to prove t is connected  that is to show  for any two nodes u  v  t  
there is a path between them  u  v  t  and u  v  t  respectively imply that there exist
paths p    u          v in t  and p    u          v in t  respectively  recall that there is a unique
path from u to v in t and that t  and t  are subtrees of t   therefore  p  and p  cover
the same nodes and edges  and thus they are in t   the intersection of t  and t    p  is the
path we want 
proposition   let t    t  be two subtrees of a tree t   and t   t   t    t is not empty if
and only if at least one of the roots of t  and t  is in t  
let r  and r  be the roots of t  and t  respectively  if r   t   the proposition is correct 
otherwise  we show r   t   assume the contrary r  
  t   clearly  r     r    let r be the
first common ancestor of r  and r  and v the root of t  t is a tree by proposition     we
have paths p    r            v in t    p    r            v in t    and p    r          r    and p    r          r  in
t   since v is a descendant of both r  and r    p  and p  share only the vertex v  since r is
the first common ancestor of r  and r    p  and p  share only the vertex r  it can also be
verified that p  and p  share only r    p  and p  share only r    and no vertex is shared by
either p  and p  or p  and p    hence  the closed walk p  p  p   p     where p   and p   are the
reverse of p  and p  respectively  is a simple circuit  it contradicts that there is no circuit
in t  
further  we have the following observation 
proposition   let t be a tree with root r  and t  and t  two subtrees of t with roots r 
and r  respectively  let r  be not closer to r than r    and t the intersection of t  and t   
r  is the root of t if t is not empty 
the proposition is true if r    r    now let r  be farther to r than r    clearly r  
  t  and
thus r  
 t
 
by
proposition
  
r
is
the
root
of
t
 
 
t
let t  
ti   we are ready now to prove our main result t      select a tree tmax from
i   l

t    t            tl such that its root rmax is the farthest away from r of t among the roots of
   

fizhang   yap

the concerned trees  in accordance with proposition    that tmax intersect with every other
tree implies that rmax is a node of every ti  i     l   therefore  rmax  t    
remark  a partial order can be represented by an acyclic directed graph  it is tempting to further generalize tree convexity to partial convexity in the following way 
given a set u and a partial order on it  a set a  u is partially convex if and only if a
is the set of nodes of a connected subgraph of the partial order  given a collection of sets s 
let the union of the sets of s be u   the sets of s are partially convex if there is a partial
order on u such that every set of s is partially convex under the partial order 
however  with this generalization  we can not get a result similar to lemma    which
is illustrated by the following example  consider three sets  c  b  d    d  f  a  and  a  e  c 
that are the nodes of the diagram given in figure   b   these sets are partially convex and
intersect pairwise  however  the intersection of all three sets is empty 
    sets with cardinality restrictions
another useful restriction that we will place on sets is to restrict their cardinalities  as a
special case  consider a set with only one element a  if its intersection with every other set
is not empty  we are able to conclude that every set contains a  and thus the intersection of
all the sets is not empty  generally  if a set has at most m elements  we have the following
result 
lemma   consider a finite collection of l sets s  e    e            el   and a number m   l 
assume one set e   s has at most m elements 
 
e    
es
iff the intersection of e  and any other m sets of s is not empty 
proof  the necessary condition is immediate 
to prove the sufficient condition  we show that the intersection of e  and any other
k  m  k  l     sets of s is not empty by induction on k  when k   m  the lemma
is true according to its assumption  assuming that the intersection of e  and any other
k      m  sets of s is not empty  we show that the intersection of e  and any other k
sets of s is not empty  without loss of generality  the subscripts of the k sets are numbered
from   to k      for    i  k      let ai be the intersection of e  and the k sets except ei  
ai   e          ei   ei           ek    
first  we show by contradiction that there exist some i  j     k      i    j such that
ai  aj      assume ai  aj    for all distinct i and j  according to the construction of
ai s 
 
e  
ai  
i   k

and  ai      by the induction assumption  hence 
x
 e    
 ai    k   m 
i   k  

which contradicts  e     m 
since ai  aj     for some i  j     k      i    j 
 
ei     
ai  aj  
i   k  

 
this lemma leads to the following corollary where the intersection of every m     sets
is not empty 
corollary    small set intersection  consider a finite collection of l sets s and a
number m   l  assume one set of s has at most m elements 
 
e    
es
iff the intersection of any m     sets of s is not empty 
there are other specialized versions  zhang   yap        of lemma   on which some
existing works by van beek and dechter        and david        are based 
when the sets of concern have a cardinality larger than a certain number  the intersection
of these sets is not empty under some conditions  the reader may refer to the large sets
intersection lemma  zhang   yap        for more details 

   set intersection and consistency
in this section  we first relate consistency in constraint networks to set intersection  using
this result  we present a proof schema that allows us to study the relationship between local
and global consistency from the properties of set intersection 
underlying the concept of k consistency is whether an instantiation of some variables
can be extended to a new variable such that all relevant constraints on the new variable are
satisfied  a relevant constraint on a variable xi with respect to y is a constraint that contains
only xi and some variables of y   given an instantiation of y   each relevant constraint allows
a set  possibly empty  of values for the new variable  we call this set an extension set  the
satisfiability of all relevant constraints depends on whether the intersection of their extension
sets is non empty  see lemma    
definition   given a constraint csi   a variable x  si   and any instantiation a of si  x  
the extension set of a to x with respect to csi is defined as
ei x  a     b  dx    a  b  satisf ies csi   
an extension set is trivial if it is empty  otherwise it is non trivial 
   

fizhang   yap

recall that dx refers to the domain of variable x  throughout the paper  it is often
the case that an instantiation a of s   x  is already given  where s   x  is a superset
of si   x   let b be the instantiation obtained by restricting a to the variables only in
si   x   for ease of presentation  we continue to use ei x  a   rather than ei x  b   to denote
the extension of b to x under constraint csi   to make the presentation easy to follow  some
of the three parameters i  a  and x may be omitted from an expression hereafter whenever
they are clear from the context  for example  given an instantiation a and a new variable
x  to emphasize different extension sets with respect to different constraints csi   we write
ei instead of ei x  a  to simply denote an extension set 
example   consider a network with variables  x    x    x    x    x

  d     a   d     b   d     a  b  c  d  

let a    a  b  a  be an instantiation of variables y    x    x    x     the relevant constraints
to x  are cs    cs    and cs    cs  is not relevant since it contains x  outside y   the extension
sets of a to x  with respect to the relevant constraints are 
e   a     d  a   e   a     d  b   e   a     d  c  
the intersection of the extension sets above is not empty  implying that a can be extended
to satisfy all relevant constraints cs    cs  and cs   
let a    b  c  be an instantiation of  x    x     e  x   a     and thus it is trivial  in
other words  with a trivial extension set  an instantiation can not be extended to satisfy the
constraint of concern 
the relationship between k consistency and set intersection is characterized by the following lemma 
lemma    set intersection and consistency  lifting  a constraint network r is kconsistent if and only if for any consistent instantiation a of any  k     distinct variables
y    x    x            xk     and any new variable xk  
 
eij    
j   l

where eij is the extension set of a to xk with respect to csij   and csi            csil are all relevant
constraints 
proof  it follows directly from the definition of k consistency in section   and the
definition of extension set   
the insight behind this lemma is to examine consistency from the perspective of set
intersection 
   

fiset intersection and consistency in constraint networks

example   consider again example    we would like to check whether the network is  consistent  consider the instantiation a of y again  this is a trivial consistent instantiation
since the network doesnt have a constraint among the variables in y   to extend it to x 
we need to check the first three constraints cs  to cs    the extension is feasible because
the intersection of e    e    and e  is not empty  we show the network is   consistent  by
exhausting all consistent instantiations of any three variables  conversely  if we know the
network is   consistent  we can immediately say that the intersection of the three extension
sets of a to x is not empty 
the usefulness of this lemma is that it allows consistency information to be obtained from
the intersection of extension sets  and vice versa  with this point of view of consistency as
set intersection  some results on set intersection properties  including all those in section   
can be lifted to get various consistency results for a constraint network through the following
proof schema 
proof schema
    consistency to set  from a certain level of consistency in the constraint network 
we derive information on the intersection of the extension sets by lemma   
    set to set  from the local intersection information of sets  information may be
obtained on intersection of more sets 
    set to consistency  from the new information on intersection of extension sets 
higher level of consistency is obtained by lemma   
    formulate conclusion on the consistency of the constraint network    
in the proof schema  step    consistency to set   step    set to consistency   and step   are
straightforward in many cases  so  lemma   is also called the lifting lemma because once we
have a set intersection result  step     we can easily have consistency results on a network
 step     the proof schema establishes a direct relationship between set intersection and
consistency properties in a constraint network 
in the following sections  we demonstrate how the set intersection properties and the
proof schema are used to obtain new results on the consistency of a constraint network 

   global consistency of tree convex constraints
the notion of extension set plays the role of a bridge between the restrictions to set s  and
properties of special constraints  in this section  we consider the constraints arising from
tree convex sets  lemma     a constraint is tree convex if all the extension sets with respect
to the constraint are tree convex 
definition   a constraint cs is tree convex with respect to xi and a tree ti on di if and
only if the sets in
a    es xi   es xi is a non trivial extension of some instantiation of s   xi   
are tree convex under ti   a constraint cs is tree convex under a tree t on the union of the
domains of the variables in s  if it is tree convex with respect to every x  s under t  
example   tree convex constraints can occur where there is a relationship among the
values of a variable  consider the constraint on the accessibility of a set of facilities by a
   

fizhang   yap

set of persons  the personnel include a network engineer  web server engineer  application
engineer  and a team leader  the relationship among the staff is that the team leader
manages the rest  which forms a tree structure shown in figure   b   there are different
accessibilities to a system which includes basic access  access to the network routers  access
to the web server  and access to the file server  in order to access the routers and servers 
one has to have the basic access right  implying a tree structure  figure   c   on the access
rights  the constraint is that the team leader is able to access all the facilities while each
engineer can access only the corresponding facility  e g   the web server engineer can access
the web server   this tree convex constraint is shown in figure   a  where the rows are
named by the initials of the engineers and the columns by the initials of the access rights  the
tree on the union of personnel and the accessibilities can be obtained from their respective
trees  in figure   b  and  c   by adding an edge  say between web server and leader  note
that the constraint in figure   a  is not row convex

example   tree convex constraints can also be used to model some scene labeling problems
naturally as shown by zhang and freuder        
definition   a constraint network is tree convex if there exists a tree t on the union of
all its variable domains such that all constraints are tree convex under t  
tree convex constraints generalize row convex constraints introduced by van beek and
dechter        
definition   a constraint cs is row convex with respect to x if and only if the sets in
a    es x   es x is a non trivial extension of some instantiation of s   x  
are tree convex under a tree where any node has at most one child  such a tree is called a
total ordering  a constraint cs is row convex if  under a total ordering on the union of the
involved domains  it is row convex with respect to every x  s 
example   for the constraint c in example   to be row convex  b  basic access  has to be
the neighbor of r  routers   w  web server   and f  file server   however  in a total ordering 
a value can be the neighbor of at most two other values  hence  c is not row convex but is
tree convex 
by the property of set intersection on tree convex sets and the proof schema  we have
the following consistency results on tree convex constraints 
   

fiset intersection and consistency in constraint networks

theorem    tree convexity  let r be a network of constraints with arity at most r
and strongly   r         consistent  if r is tree convex then it is globally consistent 
proof  the network is strongly   r         consistent by assumption  we prove that
the network is k consistent for any k    r          n  
consider any instantiation a of any k    variables and any new variable x  let the
number of relevant constraints be l  for each relevant constraint  there is one extension set
of a to x  so  we have l extension sets  if the intersection of all l sets is not empty  we have
a value for x such that the extended instantiation satisfies all relevant constraints 
 consistency to set  consider any two of the l extension sets  e  and e    the two
corresponding constraints involve at most   r     variables since the arity of a constraint
is at most r and each of the two constraints has x as a variable  by the consistency lemma 
that r is    r          consistent implies that the intersection of e  and e  is not empty 
 set to set  since all relevant constraints are tree convex under the given tree  the
extension sets of a to x are tree convex  henceforth  the fact that every two of the extension
sets intersect shows that the intersection of all l extension sets is not empty  by the tree
convex sets intersection lemma 
 set to consistency  from the consistency lemma  we have that r is k consistent   
since a row convex constraint is tree convex  this result generalizes the consistency result
on row convex constraints reported by van beek and dechter         it is interesting to
observe that the latter can be lifted from a set intersection results on convex sets  zhang

a question raised by theorem   is how efficient it is to check whether a constraint
network is tree convex  yosiphon        has proposed an algorithm to recognize a tree
convex constraint network in polynomial time 

   consistency and the tightness of constraints
in this section  we will present various consistency results on the networks with m tight
constraints 
    global consistency on weakly tight networks
the tightness of constraints has been related to the consistency of a constraint network
by van beek and dechter         the m tightness of a constraint is characterized by the
cardinality of the extension sets in the following way 
definition    van beek   dechter        a constraint csi is m tight with respect to x  si
iff for any instantiation a of si   x  
 ei x    m or  ei x      dx   
a constraint csi is m tight iff it is m tight with respect to every x  si  
given an instantiation  if its extension set with respect to x is the same as the domain
of variable x  i e    ei x      dx    the instantiation is supported by all values of x and thus
easy to be satisfiable  hence  in the definition above  these instantiations do not affect the
m tightness of a constraint

figure    the constraint cxy is   tight or   tight
example   consider the constraint cxy in figure   where dx   dy    a  b  c   an edge
in the graph denotes that its ends are allowed by cxy   it can be verified that for the values
of x  their extension sets have a cardinality of    and for values of y  their extension sets
have a cardinality from   to    hence  cxy can be said   tight or   tight but not   tight 
we are specially interested in the following tightness 
definition   a constraint csi is properly m tight with respect to x  si iff for any instantiation a of si   x  
 ei x    m 
a constraint csi is properly m tight iff it is properly m tight with respect to every x  si  
a constraint is m tight if it is properly m tight  the converse might not be true  for
example  the constraint x  y  where x                     and y                      is   tight
but not properly   tight  it is properly    tight since  ex            when y      
next  we define a special constraint network which allows us to make a more accurate
connection between the tightness of constraints and the consistency of the network 
definition   a constraint network is weakly m tight at level k iff for every set of variables
 x    x            xl   k  l   n  and a new variable x  there exists a properly m tight constraint
among the relevant constraints on x with respect to  x    x            xl

fiset intersection and consistency in constraint networks

example   the network in figure   a  is weakly tight at level   because for any three
variables and a fourth variable  one of the relevant constraints is properly m tight  the
network in figure   b  is not weakly tight at level   since for  y    y    y    and y    none of
the relevant constraints cy  y  and cy  y  is properly m tight 
by the small set intersection corollary  corollary     we have the following consistency
result on a weakly m tight network 
theorem    weak tightness  if a constraint network r with constraints of arity at
most r is strongly   m    r      consistent and weakly m tight at level   m    r      
it is globally consistent 
proof  let j    m    r      the constraint network r will be shown to be k consistent
for all k  j   k  n  
let y    x            xk    be a set of any k    variables  and a be an instantiation of
all variables in y   consider any additional variable xk   without loss of generality  let the
relevant constraints be cs            csl   and ei be the extension set of a to xk with respect to
csi for i  l 
 consistency to set  consider any m     of the l extension sets  all the corresponding
m     constraints contain at most  m      r         variables including xk   since r is
  m    r      consistent  by the set intersection and consistency lemma  the intersection
of the m     extension sets is not empty 
 set to set  the network is weakly m tight at level   m      r           so  there must
be a properly m tight constraint among the relevant constraints cs            csl   let it be csi  
we know its extension set  ei    m  since the intersection of every m     of the extension
sets is not empty  all l extension sets share a common element by the small set intersection
corollary 
 set to consistency  by the lifting lemma  r is k consistent   
in a similar fashion  the main tightness result by van beek and dechter         where
all the constraints are required to be m tight  can be lifted from the small sets intersection
corollary by zhang and yap         this uniform treatment of lifting set intersection results
to consistency results is absent from the existing works  e g   dechter        van beek  
dechter              david        
the tightness result by van beek and dechter        requires every constraint to be
m tight  the weak tightness theorem  on the other hand  does not require all constraints
to be properly m tight  the following example illustrates this difference 
example    for a weakly m tight network  we are interested in its topological structure 
thus we have omitted the domains of variables here  consider a network with five variables
labeled                  in this network  for any pair of variables and for any three variables 
there is a constraint  assume the network is already strongly   consistent 
since the network is already strongly   consistent  we can simply ignore the instantiations
with less than   variables  this is why we introduce the level at which the network is weakly
m tight  the interesting level here is    table   shows the relevant constraints for each
possible extension of four instantiated variables to the other one  in the first row

table    relevant constraints in extending an instantiation of four variables to a new variable

stands for extending the instantiation of variables              to variable    entries in its
second column denote a constraint  for example      denotes c      if the constraints on
          and            suffixed by   in the table  are properly m tight  the network is weakly
m tight at level    alternatively  if the constraints                and         suffixed by   
are properly m tight  the network will also be weakly m tight  the tightness result by van
beek and dechter        requires all binary and ternary constraints to be m tight 
    making weakly tight networks globally consistent
consider the weak tightness theorem in the previous section  generally  a weakly m tight
network might not have the level of local consistency required by the theorem  it is tempting
to enforce such a level of consistency on the network to make it globally consistent  however 
this procedure may result in constraints with higher arity 
example    consider a network with variables  x  x    x    x     let the domains of x    x    x 
be            the domain of x be               and the constraints be that all the variables should
take different values  x    x    x    x    x    x    x     x    x     x    x     x    this network is
strongly path consistent  in checking the   consistency of the network  we know that the
instantiation           of  x    x    x  is consistent but can not be extended to x    to enforce   consistency  it is necessary to introduce a ternary constraint on  x    x    x  to make
          no longer a valid instantiation 
to make the new network globally consistent  the newly introduced constraints with
higher arity may in turn require higher local consistency in accordance with theorem   
therefore  it is difficult to predict an exact level of consistency  variable based  to enforce
on the network to make it globally consistent 
in this section  relational consistency will be used to make a constraint network globally
consistent 
definition     van beek   dechter        a constraint network is relationally m consistent
iff given     any m distinct constraints cs            csm   and     any x  m
i   si   and     any
m
consistent instantiation a of the variables in  i   si   x    there exists an extension of
a to x such that the extension is consistent with the m relations  a network is strongly
relationally m consistent if it is relationally j consistent for every j  m 
   

fiset intersection and consistency in constraint networks

variables are no longer of concern in relational consistency  instead  constraints are the
basic unit of consideration  intuitively  relational m consistency concerns whether all m
constraints agree at every one of their shared variables  it makes sense because different
constraints interact with each other exactly through the shared variables 
relational     and   consistency are also called relational arc  and path consistency 
respectively 
using relational consistency  we are able to obtain global consistency by enforcing local
consistency on the network 
proposition   the weak m tightness at level k of a constraint network is preserved by the
process of enforcing relational consistency on the network 
proof  let r be the constraint network before relational consistency enforcing and r 
the network after consistency enforcing  clearly  r and r  have the same set of variables 
consider any set of variables  x    x            xl    k  l   n  and a new variable x  since
r is weakly m tight at level k  there exists a properly m tight constraint c among the
relevant constraints on x with respect to  x    x            xl    enforcing relational consistency
on a constraint network will only tighten a constraint  so  the proper m tightness of c is
preserved  hence  r  is weakly m tight at level k   
now we have the main result of this subsection 
theorem   a constraint network weakly m tight at level  m      r          where r is
the maximal arity of the constraints of the network  is globally consistent after it is made
strongly relationally  m      consistent 
proof  by proposition    the network is still weakly m tight at  m      r         after
enforcing strong relational  m      consistency on it  let r  be the maximal arity of the
constraints of the new network after consistency enforcing  clearly  r   r  so  the network
is m tight at  m      r          by proposition    the theorem follows immediately from
theorem   in section     
the implication of this theorem is that as long as we have certain properly m tight constraints on certain combinations of variables  the network can be made globally consistent
by enforcing relational  m      consistency 
we have the following observation on the weak m tightness of a network 
proposition   a constraint network is weakly m tight at any level if the constraint between
every two variables in the network is properly m tight 
proof  consider any level k  any set of variables y    x    x            xl   k  l  n   and
any new variable x 
  y   since the constraint between any two variables is properly m tight 
the constraint c x   x  on x  and x is properly m tight  therefore  there is a properly m tight
constraint c x   x  among the relevant constraints after an instantiation of y    
this observation shows that the proper m tightness of the constraints on every two
variables is sufficient to determine the level of local consistency needed to ensure global
consistency of a constraint network 
remark  proposition   assumes there is a constraint between every two variables  if
there is no constraint between some two variables  a universal constraint is introduced  in

this case  we can enforce path consistency on the constraint network to make the binary
constraints tighter so that lower level of relational consistency is needed to make the network
globally consistent 
    properties of weakly tight constraint networks
since for a weakly m tight constraint network global consistency can be achieved through
local consistency  it is interesting and important to investigate the conditions for a network
to be weakly m tight  although proposition   shows a sufficient condition  it requires every
binary constraint be tight  as we can see from example   a   the required number of
tight constraints for a constraint network to be weakly tight can be further reduced  this
subsection is focused on the understanding of the relationship between the number of tight
constraints and the weak tightness of a constraint network 
there is a strong relationship among different levels of weak tightness in a network 
proposition   if a constraint network is weakly m tight at level k for some m  it is weakly
m tight at any level j   k 
proof  for any j   k  we prove that the network is weakly tight at level j  that is  for
any set of variables y    x            xj   k  j   n  and a new variable x  we show that there
exists an m tight relevant constraint on x with respect to y   since the network is weakly
tight for k   j  there exists an m tight relevant constraint on x with respect to a subset of
y   this constraint is still relevant on x with respect to y   and thus the one we look for   
in the following  we present two results on sufficient conditions for a constraint network
to be weakly m tight 
theorem   given a constraint network  v  d  c  and a number m  if for every x  v  
there are at least n    properly m tight binary constraints on it  then the network is weakly
m tight at level   
proof  for any two variables  x  y  and a third variable z  the relevant constraints
on z with respect to  x  y  are cxz and cyz   we know that the number of relevant binary
constraints on z with respect to v is n     that n    of them are properly m tight means
either cxz or cyz must be properly m tight   
in fact  for the weak tightness at a higher level  we need fewer constraints to be m tight
as shown by the following result 
theorem   a constraint network  v  d  c  is weakly m tight at level k if for every x  v  
there are at least n  k properly m tight binary constraints on it 
proof  for any set y of k variables and a new variable z  we show that there is a
properly m tight relevant constraint on z with respect to y   otherwise  none of the k
binary constraints on z is properly m tight  since the total number of the relevant binary
constraints on z is n     the number of properly m tight binary constraints on z is at most
 n  k  which contradicts that z is involved in nk properly m tight binary constraints 
 
   

fiset intersection and consistency in constraint networks

this result reveals that for a constraint network to be weakly tight at level k  it could
need as few as n n  k        properly m tight binary constraints  in contrast to the result
in theorem   where all binary constraints are required to be properly m tight 
an immediate question is  what is the minimum number of m tight constraints required
for a network to be weakly tight  it can be answered by the following result on weak
tightness at level   
theorem   given a number m  for a constraint network to be weakly m tight at level   
it needs at least
n n         bn  c if n         mod   
or otherwise

m tight binary or ternary constraints 
proof 
given a network  its weak m tightness at level   depends on the tightness
of only binary and ternary constraints  among all weakly m tight  at level    constraint
networks with n variables  let r  be the network that has a minimal set of properly m tight
binary and ternary constraints 
in the following exposition  a constraint is denoted by its scope  for example  we
use  u  v  w  and  u  v  to denote ternary constraint c u v w  and binary constraint cuv
respectively  a constraint is non properly m tight if it is not properly m tight 
the proof consists of three steps 
step    while preserving the weak m tightness of r  and the number of properly mtight constraints in r    we modify  if necessary  the proper m tightness of some constraints
in r  such that  for any properly weak m tight constraint  u  v  w   none of the binary
constraints  u  v    v  w   and  u  w  is properly m tight 
to modify the proper m tightness of a constraint c in r  is to remove c from the network
and introduce a new constraint on the same set of variables of c with the desirable proper
m tightness 
we claim that  for any properly m tight constraint  u  v  w   at most one of  u  v  
 v  w   and  u  w  is properly m tight  otherwise  at least two of them are properly mtight  which means  u  v  w  can be modified to be not properly m tight  contradicting the
minimality of the number of properly m tight constraints in r   
assume  u  v  is properly m tight  since  u  v  w  is properly m tight  there should be
a reason for  u  v  to be properly m tight  the only reason is that there exists another
variable z such that one of  u  z  and  v  z  is not properly m tight  and  u  v  z  is not
properly m tight  too  see figure    without loss of generality  let  u  z  be properly mtight  implying that the constraint  v  z  is not properly m tight  the constraint  z  v  w 
is properly m tight because  v  z  and  v  w  are not properly m tight 
now we modify the constraints  u  v  w  and  z  v  w  to be not properly m tight and
modify the constraints  z  v  and  v  w  to be properly m tight  this modification preserves
the number of properly m tight constraints in r  and the weak m tightness of r   
step    while preserving the weak m tightness of r  and the number of properly m tight
constraints in r    we next modify  if necessary  the proper m tightness of the constraints
in r  such that no two properly m tight ternary constraints share any variables

binary constraints  u  w    w  x    v  w   and  w  y  to be properly m tight and the six
ternary constraints to be non properly m tight  the new network is still weakly m tight
with fewer m tight constraints  this contradicts the minimality of the number of properly
m tight constraints in r    hence  case   is not possible 
step    as a result of the first two steps  in the network r    the scopes of the properly
m tight ternary constraints are disjoint  and the binary constraint between any two variables
of a properly m tight ternary constraint is not properly m tight

respectively  constraints of r   
assume  t     k  since it is difficult to count b  we count the maximum number of
non properly m tight binary constraints in r    we have  k non properly m tight binary

between a variable in t and a variable outside t   let v   be the variables outside t   we
have  v       n   k  the other non properly m tight constraints fall only between variables
in v     since r  is weakly tight at level    there is no two non properly m tight constraints
on any variable in v     hence  there are at most  n   k    non properly m tight constraints
if n   k is even  and otherwise at most  n   k       ones  so the number  denoted by  
of the properly m tight constraints in r  would be the sum of the cardinality of t and b 
   k    n n         k  b n   k   c    n n         k  b n   k   c 
the fact that  is minimal implies that k should be maximized  if n is a multiple of    the
number of properly m tight constraints is n n         n    if n is   more than a multiple
of    the number is n n          n        otherwise the number is  n      n         
this result shows that under the concept of k consistency we still need a significant
number of constraints to be properly m tight to predict the global consistency of a network
in terms of constraint tightness 
    dually adaptive consistency
a main purpose of our characterization of weak m tightness of a network is to help identify a
consistency condition under which a solution of a network can be found without backtracking  i e   efficiently  we have studied constraint tightness under the concept of k consistency
in the previous subsections  in this subsection  we introduce dually adaptive consistency to
achieve backtrack free search by taking into account both the tightness of constraints and
the topological structure of a network 
the idea of adaptive consistency  dechter   pearl        is to enforce only the necessary
level of consistency on each part of a network to ensure global consistency  it assumes an
ordering on the variables  for any variable x  it only requires that a consistent instantiation
of the relevant variables before x can be consistently extensible to x  other variables do not
play any direct role on x and thus are ignored when dealing with x 
we first introduce some notations used in adaptive consistency 
the width of a variable with respect to a variable ordering is the number of constraints
involving x and only variables before x  see figure   for an example 
given a network  a variable ordering  and a variable x  the directionally relevant constraints on x are those involving x and only variables before x  in the following  dr x  is
used to denote the directionally relevant constraints on x  and s used to denote all variables
occurring in the constraints of dr x  
the constraints of dr x  are consistent on x if and only if  for any consistent instantiation a of s   x   there exists u  dx such that  a  u  satisfies all the constraints of
dr x  
we next define the adaptive consistency of a network

definition    given a constraint network and an ordering on its variables  the network is
adaptively consistent if and only if for any variable x  its directionally relevant constraints
are consistent on x 
the adaptive consistency is presented as an algorithm by dechter        although  for
the purpose of this paper  we prefer a declarative characterization 
for an adaptively consistent network  a solution can be found without backtracking 
proposition   given a constraint network and an ordering on its variables  a backtrack
free search is ensured if the network is adaptively consistent 
proof  assume we have found a consistent instantiation of the first k variables  in terms
of the given ordering   they can be consistently extended to xk   because all directionally
relevant constraints on xk   are consistent on xk      
when a network is not adaptively consistent  the algorithm by dechter        p      
can be used to enforce adaptive consistency on it 
adaptive consistency is not only more accurate in estimating the local consistency that
ensures global consistency  but also makes intuitive the algorithms to enforce consistency
and to find a solution 
with the knowledge of constraint tightness presented in the previous subsections  we
know that for a network to be adaptively consistent  it is sufficient to make sure that only
some  not all  directionally relevant constraints on a variable are consistent  we are now in
a position to define dually adaptive consistency of a constraint network 
definition    consider a constraint network and an ordering of its variables  for any
variable x in the network  let cx be one of the tightest directionally relevant constraints on
x and cx be properly mx  tight  the network is dually adaptively consistent if and only if
   for any variable x whose width is not greater than mx   its directionally relevant
constraints are consistent on it  and
   for any variable x whose width is greater than mx   cx is consistent with every other
mx directionally relevant constraints on x 
thanks to the set intersection result of lemma    we have the main result on dually
adaptive consistency 
   

fiset intersection and consistency in constraint networks

theorem   given a constraint network and an ordering of its variables  a backtrack free
search is ensured if it is dually adaptively consistent 
proof  we only need to prove that the network is adaptively consistent  for any
variable x  its directionally relevant constraints dr x  are consistent on x  let s be the
variables involved in dr x   consider any consistent instantiation a of s   x   we show
that there exists u  dx such that  a  u  satisfies constraints in dr x   let l be the number
of constraints in dr x   and let cx be one of the tightest constraint in dr x  with proper
tightness mx   for any constraint ci  dr x   let as extension set to x under ci be ei   it
is sufficient to show
c dr x  ei     
i

we know cx is consistent with every other mx constraints  hence  ex   as extension set
under cx   intersects with every other mx extension sets of a  lemma   implies that
c dr x  ei     
i

 
by this theorem  we need only the tightest of the directionally relevant constraint on
each variable  totally n    such constraints  to predict the global consistency of a network 
this could be considered a significant improvement over the results in the previous two
subsections 
compared with the result by dechter and pearl         this theorem also provides a
lower level  the smaller of tightness or width  of consistency ensuring global consistency 
when a constraint network is not dually adaptively consistent with respect to a variable
ordering  it can be made so by enforcing the required consistency on each variable  in the
reverse order of the given variable ordering  to make the procedure more efficient  we
should chose a better variable ordering  depending on both the topological structure of the
network and the tightness of the constraints 

   tightness and convexity revisited
the consistency results derived from small set intersection and tree convex set intersection
in section   and section     can be rephrased in a relational consistency setting  for
example  a new version of weak tightness based on relational consistency is given as follows 
theorem    weak tightness  if a constraint network r of constraints with arity of at
most r is strongly relationally  m      consistent and weakly m tight at level of  m      r 
        it is globally consistent 
proof  let j    m      r          the constraint network r will be shown to be
k consistent for all k  j   k  n  
let y    x            xk    be a set of any k   variables  and a a consistent instantiation of
all variables in y   consider any new variable xk   without loss of generality  let cs            csl
be the relevant constraints on xk   and ei the extension set of a to xk with respect to csi
for i  l

 consistency to set  consider any m     of the l extension sets  since r is relationally
 m      consistent  the intersection of m     extension sets is not empty 
 set to set  the network is weakly m tight  so  there must be a properly m tight
constraint in the relevant constraints cs            csl   let it be csi   its extension set  ei    m 
since every m     of the extension sets have a non empty intersection  all l extension sets
share a common element by the small set intersection result  corollary    
 set to consistency  from the lifting lemma  we have that r is k consistent   
compared with the weak tightness theorem in section      the exposition of the result
is neater and the proof is simpler 
for completeness  we also include here a new version of the tree convex theorem using
relational consistency  the proof is omitted since it is a simplified version of the one in
section   as hinted by the proof above 
theorem    tree convexity  let r be a tree convex constraint network  r is globally
consistent if it is strongly relationally path consistent 

   conclusion
through the lifting lemma and proof schema  we have shown that set intersection results can
be easily lifted to consistency results in a constraint network  there are a few advantages
for this approach of studying consistency 
firstly  although this approach does not offer a completely new way to prove consistency results  it does provide a uniform way to understand many seemingly different results
on the impact of convexity and tightness on global consistency  in addition to the results
shown here  some other results can also be obtained easily by the lifting lemma and proof
schema  for example  the work by david        can be obtained by lifting the corollary of
lemma    zhang   yap         the work by sam haroud and faltings        on convex
constraint networks with continuous domains can be lifted from hellys theorem  eckhoff 
      on the intersection of convex sets in euclidean spaces 
secondly  the establishment of the relationship between set intersection and consistency
in a constraint network makes it easier to communicate the consistency results to the researchers outside the constraint network community  it is also made possible for them to
contribute to consistency results by exploiting their knowledge on set intersection properties 
more importantly  this approach singles out the fact that set intersection properties play
a fundamental role in determining the consistency of a constraint network  this perspective
helps us focus on properties of set intersection and discover or generalize the intersection
properties of tree convex sets and sets with cardinality restrictions  the corresponding
consistency results have extended our understanding of the convexity and tightness of constraints since dechter and van beeks work               we identify a new class of tree
convex constraints for which global consistency is ensured by a certain level of local consistency  this generalizes row convex constraints by van beek and dechter         we also
show that a weakly m tight constraint network can be made globally consistent by enforcing
local consistency  this type of result on tightness is new  detailed study has been carried
out on when a constraint network is weakly m tight  to make full use of the tightness of
the constraints  we propose dually adaptive consistency that exploits both the topology and
   

fiset intersection and consistency in constraint networks

the semantics of a constraint network  which again results from the relation between set
intersection and consistency  under dually adaptive consistency  the topology of a network
and the tightest relevant constraint on each variable determine the local consistency that
ensures backtrack free search
