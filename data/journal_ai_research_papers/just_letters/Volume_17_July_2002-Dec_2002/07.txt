abstract
much work in ai deals with the selection of proper actions in a given  known or unknown  environment  however  the way to select a proper action when facing other agents
is quite unclear  most work in ai adopts classical game theoretic equilibrium analysis to
predict agent behavior in such settings  this approach however does not provide us with
any guarantee for the agent  in this paper we introduce competitive safety analysis  this
approach bridges the gap between the desired normative ai approach  where a strategy
should be selected in order to guarantee a desired payoff  and equilibrium analysis  we show
that a safety level strategy is able to guarantee the value obtained in a nash equilibrium 
in several classical computer science settings  then  we discuss the concept of competitive
safety strategies  and illustrate its use in a decentralized load balancing setting  typical to
network problems  in particular  we show that when we have many agents  it is possible
to guarantee an expected payoff which is a factor of     of the payoff obtained in a nash
equilibrium  our discussion of competitive safety analysis for decentralized load balancing
is further developed to deal with many communication links and arbitrary speeds  finally 
we discuss the extension of the above concepts to bayesian games  and illustrate their use
in a basic auctions setup 

   introduction
deriving solution concepts for multi agent encounters is a major challenge for researchers
in various disciplines  the most famous and popular solution concept in the economics
literature is the nash equilibrium  although nash equilibrium and its extensions and modifications are powerful descriptive tools  and have been widely used in the ai literature
 rosenschein   zlotkin        kraus        sandholm   lesser         their appeal from
a normative ai perspective is somewhat less satisfactory   we wish to equip an agent with
an action that guarantees some desired outcome  or expected utility  without relying on
other agents rationality   this paper shows that  surprisingly  the desire for obtaining a
guaranteed expected payoff  where this payoff is of the order of the value obtained in a
   if we restrict ourselves to cases where there exists an equilibrium in dominant strategies  as is done in
some of the cs literature  nisan   ronen         then the corresponding equilibrium is appealing from
a normative perspective  however  such cases rarely exist 
   maximizing expected payoff when facing a set of possible environment behaviors is fundamental to ai 
in particular  it is discussed in the context of game trees  in the context of planning with incomplete
information  where we need to obtain a desired goal regardless of the initial configuration  as well as
in the context of reinforcement learning  where we wish to maximize expected payoff when the actual
model  selected from a set of possible models in adversarial way  is initially unknown   russell   norvig

nash equilibrium  is achievable in various classical computer science settings  our results
are inspired by several interesting examples for counter intuitive behaviors obtained by following nash equilibria and other solution concepts  roth        aumann         one of
the most interesting and challenging examples has been introduced by aumann  aumann 
       aumann presented a   person   choice        game g  where the safety level  probabilistic maximin  strategy of the game is not a nash equilibrium of it  but it does yield
the expected payoff of a nash equilibrium of g  this observation may have significant positive ramifications from an agents design perspective  if a safety level strategy of an agent
guarantees an expected payoff that equals its expected payoff in a nash equilibrium  then
it can serve as a desirable robust protocol for the agent  given the above  we are interested
in whether an optimal safety level strategy leads to an expected payoff similar to the one
obtained in a nash equilibrium of simple games that represent basic variants of classical
computer science problems  as we show  this is indeed the case for      games capturing
simple variants of the classical load balancing and leader election problems  a more general
question refers to more general      games  we show that if the safety level strategy is a
 strictly  mixed one  then its expected payoff is identical to the expected payoff obtained in
a nash equilibrium in any generic non reducible      game  we also show that this is no
longer necessarily the case if we have a pure safety level strategy  in addition  we consider
general   person set theoretic games  which naturally extend      leader election games 
and show that if a set theoretic game g possesses a strictly mixed strategy equilibrium then
the safety level value for a player in that game equals the expected payoff it obtains in
that equilibrium  following this  we define the concept of c competitive safety strategies 
roughly speaking  a strategy will be called a c competitive safety strategy  if it guarantees
an expected payoff that is c  of the expected payoff obtained in a nash equilibrium  we
show that in an extended decentralized load balancing setting a     competitive strategy
exists  when the number of players is large  we also discuss extensions of this result to more
general settings  in particular  we deal with the cases of arbitrary number of communication
lines  and arbitrary different speeds of communication  we show that a ratio of     can be
obtained when we allow arbitrary speeds in two communication lines connecting source to
target  we also consider the notion of a k regular network  where k is the ratio between
the average communication speed and the lowest speed of communication  in a given set
of communication lines   and show that a k competitive safety strategy exists for general
k regular networks  then  we discuss c competitive strategies in the context of bayesian
games  in particular we show the existence of an e competitive safety strategy for a classical
first price auctions setup 
imagine an agent designed to deal with the communication of a user with different
targets  selecting routes for messages in a multi agent system is a non trivial task  the
efficiency of the agent depends on the actions selected by other users  and their agents 
that try also to communicate with similar targets  in such cases  game theoretic analysis
can identify the nash equilibria that may emerge in that setting  however  adopting the
strategy prescribed by a nash equilibrium may be quite dangerous for our agent  other
agents may fail to choose strategies prescribed by that equilibrium  and as a result the
outcome of our agent can be quite poor  it would have been much better if the agent could
have guaranteed similar payoff  to the one obtained in a nash equilibrium  without relying
on other agents behavior  in computational settings  where  machine and other  failures
   

ficompetitive safety analysis

are possible  and rationality assumptions about participants behavior should be minimized 
a safety level strategy has a special appeal  especially when it yields a value that is close to
the expected payoff obtained in a nash equilibrium 
previous work has been concerned with comparing the payoffs that can be obtained
by an optimal centralized  and pareto efficient  controller to the expected payoffs obtained
in the nash equilibria of the corresponding game  koutsoupias   papadimitriou         
that work is in the spirit of competitive analysis  a central topic in theoretical computer
science  borodin   el yaniv         our work can be considered as suggesting a complementary approach  comparing the safety level value to the agents expected payoff in a nash
equilibrium 
the rest of this paper is organized as follows  in section   we provide some basic
definitions and notations  in sections   and   we deal with simple variants of the load
balancing and the leader election problems  we use these as examples for showing that
safety level strategies can be quite competitive and attractive  leading to the value of a
nash equilibrium  this is generalized in section   to the context of general      games  a
discussion of another extension dealing with set theoretic games is discussed in section    in
section   we deal with several settings of decentralized load balancing  with increasing level
of complexity  in particular we show the existence of desired competitive safety strategies
for settings with many agents and many possible routes  section   illustrates the use of
competitive safety analysis in games with incomplete information 

   basic definitions and notations
a game is a tuple g   hn               n    si  ni      ui  ni   i  where n is a set of n players 
si is a finite set of pure strategies available to player i  and ui   ni   si    is the payoff
function of player i  given si   we denote the set of probability distributions over the
elements of si by  si    an element t   si   is called a mixed strategy of player i  it
is called a pure strategy if it assigns probability   to an element of si   and it is called a
strictly mixed strategy if it assigns a positive probability to each element in si   a tuple
t    t            tn    ni    si   is called a strategy profile  we denote by ui  t  the expected
payoff of player i given the strategy profile t  a strategy profile t    t            tn   is a nash
equilibrium if i  n   ui  t   ui  t    t            ti    t i   ti             tn   for every t i  si   the nash
equilibrium t    t            tn   is called a pure strategy nash equilibrium if ti is a pure strategy
for every i  n   the nash equilibrium t    t            tn   is called a strictly mixed strategy
nash equilibrium if for every i  n we have that ti is a strictly mixed strategy  given a
game g and a mixed strategy of player i  t   si    the safety level value obtained by i when
choosing t in the game g  denoted by val t  i  g   is the minimal expected payoff that player
i may obtain when employing t against arbitrary strategy profiles of the other players  a
strategy t  of player i for which val    i  g  is maximal is called a safely level strategy  or
a probabilistic maximin strategy  of player i  hence  a safety level strategy for agent i

   decentralized load balancing
in this section we consider decentralized load balancing  where two rational players need to
submit messages in a simple communication network  a network of two parallel communication lines e    e  connecting nodes s and t  each player has a message that he needs to
deliver from s to t  and he needs to decide on the route to be taken  the communication line
e  is a faster one  and therefore the value of transmitting a single message along e  is x    
while the value of transmitting a single message along e  is x for some              each
player needs to decide on the communication line to be used for sending its message from
s to t  if both players choose the same communication line then the value for each one of
them drops in a factor of two  a player will obtain x  if both players choose e    and a player
will obtain x
  if both players choose e     in a matrix form  this game can be presented as
follows

proposition   the optimal safety level value for a player in the decentralized load balancing game equals its expected payoff in the strictly mixed strategy equilibrium of that game 
proof  consider the following equations for the probability to choose e  in a symmetric
equilibrium  where each player selects e  with probability p and e  with probability    p 
this equation is derived from the fact that in a nash equilibrium every strategy in the
support should lead to identical expected payoffs  notice that by solving this equation we
will also prove the existence of a strictly mixed strategy nash equilibrium

notice that     p     as required  the safety level mixed strategy satisfies the following

the safety level value is

we will show that these values coincide  it is enough to show that 
    

 
 
     
       
  
  

the above however trivially holds since both sides equal       
 
notice that the above proposition shows that an agent can guarantee itself an expected
payoff that equals its payoff in a nash equilibrium of the decentralized load balancing
game  this is obtained using a strategy that differs from the agents strategies in the nash
equilibria of that game  which do not provide that guarantee   notice that if the players
could have used a mediator correlation devise  and play the game repeatedly  then the
mediator could have directed them to the use of strategies leading to a payoff that is higher
than the one guaranteed by the safety level strategy  the use of such mediator correlation
devise  as well as the discussion of repeated games  is beyond the scope of this paper 

   leader election  decentralized voting
in a leader election setting  the players vote about the identity of the player who will take
the lead on a particular task  a failure to obtain agreement about the leader is a bad
output  and can be modelled as leading to a   payoff  assume that the players strategies
are either vote for   or vote for    denoted by a    a  respectively  then ui  aj   ak       
where i  j  k          and j   k  notice that this setting captures various forms of leader
election  e g  when a player prefers to be selected  when it prefers the other player to be
selected  etc  in a matrix form  this game can be presented as follows  where a  b  c  d

proposition   the optimal safety level value for a player in the leader election game equals
its expected payoff in the strictly mixed strategy equilibrium of that game 
proof  in a strictly mixed nash equilibrium we have that the probability q of choosing a 
by player   should satisfy 
qu   a    a          q u   a    a   
the above equality is implied by the fact that any pure strategy in the support of the
mixed strategy for an agent  in a nash equilibrium  should yield the same expected payoff
 otherwise  deviation will be rational   hence  the above equality captures the fact that the
strategy of player   in equilibrium should be selected in a way that the utility for agent  
when using either a  or a  will be the same 
similarly  the probability p of choosing a  by player   should satisfy
pu   a    a          p u   a    a   
hence  a strictly mixed strategy nash equilibrium exists  where q  

u   a   a   
u   a   a    u   a   a   

and

u   a   a   
u   a   a    u   a   a   

as can be seen from the above equations a strictly mixed strategy
p 
equilibrium exists  consider now w l o g player    the expected payoff it obtains in the
 u   a   a   
above equilibrium is qu   a    a      uu   a a   a a    u
player  s safety level strategy satisfies
   a   a   
 
the following  where p is the probability of choosing a   
p  u   a    a          p   u   a    a   
hence  p   

u   a   a   
u   a   a    u   a   a    notice
 u   a   a   
 
p  u   a    a      uu   a a   a a    u
   a   a   

that p    q  the safety level value will be there 

we get that the nash equilibrium and safety level
fore 
strategies are different  but their expected payoffs for the players coincide 
 
notice that the above proposition shows that a agent can guarantee itself an expected
payoff that equals its payoff in a nash equilibrium of the leader election game   as in the
decentralized load balancing game  this is obtained using a strategy that differs from the
agents strategies in the nash equilibria of that game  which do not provide that guarantee  

   safety level in general      games
the results presented in the previous sections refer to   person   choice variants of central problems occurring in computational contexts  given the encouraging results in the
framework of these basic settings  we wish to consider two types of extensions 
   generalize the results to a broader family of simple games 
   generalize the results to more general cs related settings  dealing in particular with
games with many players  as found in load balancing settings 
   the reader should not confuse the fact that p    q with similarity between safety level and nash equilibrium  indeed  p  refers to the probability of choosing a  by player    while q refers to the probability
of choosing that action by player   

   

ficompetitive safety analysis

in this section we deal with the first point  later  and in particular in section    we will
deal with the second one  it is of interest to see whether our results in sections     can
be extended to other forms of      games  notice that the load balancing and the leader
election settings can be represented as non reducible generic      games  the same is true
with regard to the game presented by aumann

non reducible generic games are an attractive concept  having dominated strategies in the
game do not add to the understanding of the interaction  since these strategies can be safely
ignored  the fact a game is generic is also quite appealing  it is quite natural to assume that
a pair of actions should lead to different outcomes when we fix the rest of the environment 
we can show 
theorem   let g be a      non reducible generic game  assume that the optimal safety
level value of a player is obtained by a strictly mixed strategy  then this value coincides with
the expected payoff of that player in a nash equilibrium of g 
proof  denote the strategies available to the players by a    a    use the following notation  a   u   a    a     b   u   a    a     c   u   a    a     d   u   a    a     e   u   a    a     f  
u   a    a     g   u   a    a     h   u   a    a   
in a matrix form  the above will be presented as

if a strictly mixed strategy nash equilibrium exists then it should satisfy that 
qa       q b   qc       q d
and
pe       p g   pf       p h
where p and q are the probabilities for choosing a  by players   and    respectively  we get
that we should have qa   b  qb   qc   d  qd  which implies that q a  b  c   d    d  b 
similarly  we get that we should have pe   g  pg   pf   h  ph  which implies that
p e  g  f   h    h  g  hence  in a strictly mixed strategy nash equilibrium we should
have

and

egf  h
notice that since the game is generic then d    b  if d   b then if q is not strictly in between
  and   then c   a which will contradict non reducibility  if d   b then in if q is not strictly
in between   and   then a   c  which also contradicts non reducibility  similarly  since the
game is generic then h    g  if h   g then if p is not strictly in between   and   then f   e

which will contradict non reducibility  if h   g then in if p is not strictly in between   and
  then e   f   which also contradicts non reducibility  given the above we get that p and q
define a strictly mixed strategy equilibrium of g  consider now the safety level strategy of
player    if player   chooses a  with probability p  then it satisfies that 
p  a       p   c   p  b       p   d
this implies that we need to have p  a cp  c   p  b dp  d  which implies p   acb d   
d  c  hence  we have
dc
p   
acb d
and
ab
   p   
acb d
compute now the expected payoff for player   in the strictly mixed nash equilibrium  given
ac
  we have that 
that    q   abc d
qa       q b  

da  cb
 d  b a    a  c b

the expected payoff of the safety level strategy for player   will be 
p  a       p   c  

 d  c a    a  b c
da  cb
 
abc d
abc d

hence  we get that the expected payoffs of the nash equilibrium and the safety level strategies for player   coincide  the computation for player   is similar 
 
    the case of pure safety level strategies
the reader may wonder whether the previous result can be also proved for the case where
there are no restrictions on the structure of the safety level strategy of the game g  in several
ai contexts  the discussion is on pure maximin strategies  where probabilistic behavior is
not considered  of course  probabilistic maximin strategies are more powerful  and in many
cases the best safety level is obtained only by a mixed strategy and not by a pure one 
however  it will be of interest to consider the case where the safety level strategy is a pure
one  as we now show  there exists a generic non reducible      game g  where the optimal
safety level strategy for a player is pure  and the expected payoff for that player is lower than
the expected payoff for that player in all nash equilibria of g  consider a game g  where
u                u               u               u               and u                u          
     u                u               in a matrix form this game looks as follows 


m 

        
       

       
      

 

it is easy to check that g is generic and non reducible  in particular  there are no dominated
strategies  and the payoffs obtained by each player for different strategy profiles are different
from one another  the game has no pure nash equilibria  in a strictly mixed strategy

equilibrium the probability q of choosing a  by player   should satisfy    q         q   
  q     q   i e  that   q        q     q        in that equilibrium the probability that
player   will choose a  is p        and the expected payoff of player   is    q     q       
the safety level strategy for player   is to perform a    guaranteeing a payoff of     given
that  a    a    is a saddle point in a zero sum game where the payoffs of player   are taken to
be the complement to   of player  s original payoffs  hence  the value of the safety level
strategy for player   is         
 

   beyond      games
the leader election game is an instance of a more general set of games  set theoretic games 
in a set theoretic game the sets of strategies available to the players are identical  and the
payoff of each player is uniquely determined by the set of strategies selected by each player 
for example  in a   person set theoretic game we will have that u   s  t    u   t  s   u   s  t   
u   t  s  for every s  t  s    s    notice that set theoretic games are very typical to voting
contexts  in a typical voting context we care about the votes  but not about the indentity
of the voters  we can prove the following 
proposition   given a   person set theoretic game g with a strictly mixed strategy nash
equilibrium  then the value of an optimal safety level strategy of a player equals its expected
payoff in that equilibrium 
proof  let s   s    s     s    s            sl    let t    t    t    be a strictly mixed strategy
nash equilibrium  denote the tuple of probabilities associated with ti by  pi            pil    i 
         s       s      l   in a strictly mixed nash equilibrium we have that the expected
payoff of player   is 
lj   p j u   se   sj     
for every    e  l  consider now a strategy f of player   that assigns probability p j to
strategy sj   then  for every strategy se selected by player    the expected payoff of f is
given by
lj   p j u   sj   se     lj   p j u   se   sj       
this implies that the safety level strategy for player   yields an expected payoff that is
identical to the expected payoff for player   in the above equilibrium  similar reasoning can
be applied for player   
 

   competitive safety strategies
let s be a set of strategies  consider a family of games  g    g            gj          where i is a
player at each of them  its set of strategies at each of these games is s  and there are j
players  in addition to i  in gj   as an example  consider a family of decentralized load
balancing settings  the  n     th game in this extended load balancing setting will consist
of n players  one of them is i  the players submit their messages along e  and e    the
payoff for player i when participating in an n person decentralized load balancing game is

that communication line  a mixed strategy t   s  will be called a c competitive safety
strategy if there exists some constant c      such that
nash i  gj

lim

where nash i  gj   is the lowest expected payoff player i might obtain in some equilibrium
of gj   and val t  i  gj   is the expected payoff guaranteed for i by choosing t in the game gj  
the extended decentralized load balancing setting   is a typical and basic network problem 
if c is small  a c competitive safety strategy for that context will provide a useful protocol
of behavior  we can show 
theorem   there exists a     competitive safety strategy for the extended decentralized
load balancing setting 
proof  consider the following strategy profile for the players in an n person decentralized
 
load balancing game  players                d   
ne  will choose e    and the rest will choose
e    w l o g we assume that i     is the player for which we will make the computation of
expected payoffs  it is easy to verify that the above strategy profile is an equilibrium of the
game  with an expected payoff for player i that is bounded above by

that t  if adopted by all participants  is not a nash equilibrium  however  we will show
that it is a competitive safety strategy for small c       consider an arbitrary number of

   competitive safety analysis in bayesian games
the results presented in the previous sections refer to games with complete information 
the games we have studied in this context refer to fundamental settings in the ai and game
theory intersection  and deal with issues such as congestion  in this section  we show that
our ideas can be applied to games with incomplete information as well 
in a game with incomplete information the payoff for a player given the behavior of the
set of players is private information of that player  in order to illustrate competitive safety
analysis in games with incomplete information  we have chosen to consider a very basic
mechanism  the first price auction  the selection of first price auction is not an accident 
   

ficompetitive safety analysis

auctions are fundamental to the theory of economic mechanism design    and among the
auctions that do not possess a dominant strategy  assuming the independent private value
model  first price auctions are probably the most common ones 
we consider a setting where a good g is put for sale  and there are n potential buyers 
each such buyer has a valuation  i e  maximal willingness to pay  for g that is drawn from
a uniform distribution on the interval of real numbers         this valuation is the private
information that the agent has  the exact valuation is known only to the agent  while the
distribution on agent valuations are commonly known  the valuations are assumed to be
independent from one another  in a first price auction  each potential buyer is asked to
submit a bid for the good g  we assume that the bids of a buyer with valuation v is a
number in the interval     v    the good will be allocated to the bidder who submitted the
highest bid  with a lottery to determine the winner in a case of a tie   the auction setup can
be defined using a bayesian game   in this game the players are the potential bidders  and
the payoff of a player with valuation v is vp if he wins the good and pays p  and   if he does
not get the good  as the reader can see  the distinguished feature of such games is that the
players utility function depends on the agents private valuation  and therefore it is known
only to it  the equilibrium concept can be also extended to the context of bayesian games 
in the auction setup an agents strategy is a function from its valuations to monetary bids 
a strategy profile will be in equilibrium if an agents strategy is the best response against
the other agents strategies given the distribution on these agents valuations  in particular 
in equilibrium of the above game the bid of a player with valuation v is     n   v 
n
given the above  the expected payoff of an agent with valuation v  will be vn   as before 
the question is whether we can guarantee a payoff that is proportional to the expected payoff
in equilibrium 
before discussing an appropriate strategy  we should emphasize a formal issue with
regard to competitive safety strategies in bayesian games  notice that in our definition
of competitive safety strategies  we assume that the players competitive action should be
independent of the number of players  on the other hand  as suggested by the equilibrium
analysis above  behavior in first price auction may heavily depend on the number of players 
in order to address this issue  we make use of the revelation principle  discussed in the
economic mechanism design literature  the revelation principle tells us that one can replace
the above mentioned first price auction with the following auction  each bidder will be asked
to reveal his valuation  and the good will be sold to the bidder who reported the highest
valuation  if agent i who reported valuation v   will turn out to be the winner then he will
be asked to pay     n   v     in this mechanism a player will submit bids in between   and
n
n  v  it turns out that reporting the true valuation is an equilibrium of that auction  and
that it will yield  in equilibrium  the same allocation  payments  and expected utility to
the participants  as the original auction  it is convenient to consider the above revelation
mechanism  since when facing any number of participants  a bidders strategy in equilibrium
will always be the same 
   for a general discussion of mechanism design see  mas colell  whinston    green         chapter    
and  fudenberg   tirole         chapter    
   in general  buyers may submit bids that are higher than their valuations  but these strategies are dominated by other strategies  and their existence will not effect the equilibrium discussed in this paper 
   a formal definition and exposition of bayesian games can be found in  fudenberg   tirole        

   

fitennenholtz

given the above  a first price auction setup will be identified with a family of  bayesian 
games  g    g           where gj is the bayesian game associated with  the revelation mechanism
of  first price auction with j    potential buyers  the definition of c competitive strategies
can now be applied to the above context as well 
theorem   there exists an e competitive strategy for the first price auction setup 
proof  when player   with valuation v submits the bid b in an auction with additional
n    players  its worst case payoff is
z

n 
b

v

dv 

n 
b

v    

dv

vn   

 v 

n 
b dvn
n

the above says that in order to win  player is bid should be higher than the other players
n
bids  each players bid in the revelation mechanism is however at most n 
times its
n 
valuation  and therefore we should integrate over valuations that are at most n times
player is bid  if agent i will be the winner then he will gain v  n 
n b when he bids b and
his valuation is v  given the rules of the revelation mechanism   the above is maximized
when
d
n    n    n 
 v 
b  
b 
  
db
n
n
n    i e  when b   v 
hence  the expected value is maximized when  n    vbn    n 
n nb
we therefore get that the safety level strategy coincides in this case with the equilibrium
strategy  the expected payoff in equilibrium can be shown to be v n  n  the expected payoff
guaranteed by the above strategy will be

 

n    n   
v 
v
n
n

the ratio between the safety level value and the equilibrium value is therefore bounded
n
 
above by   n 
n     which is greater or equal to e   and approaches it when the number of
players approaches infinity 
 
an interesting observation is that in the above theorem  the safety level strategy is
identical to the equilibrium strategy  this connection occurs although the game is not a
  sum game  it is interesting to observe that since we consider revelation mechanisms then
the safety level strategy turns out to be independent of the number of participants  our
result can also be obtained if we consider standard first price auctions  rather than the
revelation mechanisms associated with them  nevertheless  this will require us to allow a
player to choose its action knowing the number of potential bidders  as in the corresponding
equilibrium analysis  

   discussion
some previous work in ai has attempted to show the potential power of decision theoretic
approaches that do not rely on classical game theoretic analysis  in particular  work in theoretical computer science on competitive analysis has been extended to deal with rationality
constraints  tennenholtz         in order to become applicable to multi agent systems  we
   

ficompetitive safety analysis

introduced competitive safety analysis  bridging the gap between the normative ai cs approach and classical equilibrium analysis  we have shown that the observation  due to
aumann  that safety level strategies may yield the value of a nash equilibrium in games
that are not zero sum  provides a powerful normative tool for computer scientists and ai
researchers interested in protocols for non cooperative environments  we have illustrated
the use and power of competitive safety analysis in various contexts  we have shown general
results about      games  as well as about games with many participants  and introduced
the use of competitive safety analysis in the context of decentralized load balancing  leader
election  and auctions  notice that our work is concerned with a normative approach to
decision making in multi agent systems  we make no claims as for the applicability of this
approach for descriptive purposes  i e  for the prediction of how people will behave in the
corresponding situations  although there exists much literature on the failure of nash equilibrium  it is still the most powerful concept for action prediction in multi agent systems 
the setting of decentralized load balancing discussed as part of this paper is central to game
theory and its applications    given the importance of this setting from a cs perspective 
providing robust agent protocols for that setting is a major challenge to work in multiagent systems  in order however to build robust protocols  relying on standard equilibrium
analysis might not be satisfactory  and safety guarantees are required  our work suggests
protocols and analysis for providing such guarantees  bridging the gap between classical
ai decision theoretic reasoning and equilibrium analysis in game theory
