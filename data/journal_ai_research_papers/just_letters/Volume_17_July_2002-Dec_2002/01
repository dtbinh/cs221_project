ordering information  ordering unconstrained problem  number good orderings given text limited  second question addressed analysis use
data infer strategy ordering  existing corpus based methods  supervised
learning  easily applicable problem part lack training data 
given multiple possible orderings  corpus providing one ordering
set information allow us differentiate sentences must together sentences happen together  led us develop corpus data
sets  contains multiple acceptable orderings single text  corpus
expensive construct therefore  provide enough data pure statistical
approaches  instead  used hybrid corpus analysis strategy first automatically identifies commonalities across orderings  manual analysis resulting clusters led
identification constraints ordering  finally  evaluated plausible ordering strategies
asking humans judge results 
set experiments together suggests ordering algorithm integrates constraints approximation temporal sequence underlying events

majority ordering  evaluation showed two ordering algorithms alone
yield satisfactory results  first  majority ordering  critically linked level
similarity information ordering across input texts  input texts different
orderings  however  algorithm produces unpredictable unacceptable results 
second  chronological ordering produces good results information event based 
therefore  temporally sequenced  texts refer events  describe
states properties  algorithm falls short 
automatic analysis revealed topical relatedness important constraint 
groups related sentences tend appear together  algorithm combines chronological
ordering constraints topical relatedness  evaluation shows augmented
algorithm significantly outperforms either simpler methods alone  strategy

reports human summarizers sometimes change original order  multidocument
summarization  summary consists fragments text sentences selected
different texts  thus  complete ordering summary sentences

domain dependent summarization  possible establish possible orderings
priori  valid ordering traditionally derived manual analysis corpus
texts domain  typically operates set semantic concepts  semantic
representation information usually available input ordering component 
instance  specific domain news topic terrorist attacks  summaries
constructed first describing place attack  followed number
casualties  possible perpetrators are  etc 
another alternative ordering information  still domain dependent framework  use data driven approach  produces flexible output

specific summaries technical medical articles  examples features influence
ordering presence contradiction repetition  relevance patient characteristics

cohesion temporal connections happen exist selected text 
ordering component takes place content selection information
pipeline architecture  contrast generation systems  usually ordering
content selection come tandem  separation might come cost
good ordering given extracted information  possible go back
content selection extract new information  summarization  content selection driven
salience criteria  believe ordering strategy work different
content selectors  independently salience criteria  therefore  choose keep
two components  selection ordering  two separate modules 

   conclusion future work
paper investigated information ordering constraints multidocument summarization news genre  evaluated two alternative ordering strategies  chronological
ordering  co  majority ordering  mo   experiments show mo performs well
input texts follow similar organization information  domains
constraint holds  mo would appropriate highly effective strategy 
news genre cannot make assumption  thus appropriate solution 
chronological ordering  co  algorithm provide acceptable solution many
cases  sufficient summaries contain information event based 
experiments  using corpus collected multiple alternative summaries
multiple documents  show cohesion important constraint contributing ordering 
moreover  show appropriate ordering information critical allow
easy comprehension summary case possible orderings
information acceptable  developed operational algorithm integrates cohesion
part co algorithm  implemented part multigen summarization
system  evaluation system shows significant improvement summary quality 
paper focused augmenting co algorithm  believe mo
promising strategy neglected  clear different forms
summarization useful different situations  depending intended purpose

summary types documents summarized  future work  plan

summarizer would use different algorithms summary generation depending
type input text  suspect ordering strategies may differ also  depending
type summary  work first investigate whether use augmented
algorithm summary types  algorithm yield good orderings 
investigate corpus analysis summary type specific constraints  suspect
augmented algorithm may apply  instance  biographical summaries  since
information summarized mixture event based information
chronologically ordered along descriptive information person  unclear
whether apply types summaries summaries different events 
since pieces information may temporally related other  plan
identify types summaries would benefit using mo algorithm
augmented version  the way co algorithm augmented cohesion
