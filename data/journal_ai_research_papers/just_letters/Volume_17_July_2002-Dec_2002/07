interesting observation theorem  safety level strategy
identical equilibrium strategy  connection occurs although game
  sum game  interesting observe since consider revelation mechanisms
safety level strategy turns independent number participants 
result obtained consider standard first price auctions  rather
revelation mechanisms associated them  nevertheless  require us allow
player choose action knowing number potential bidders  as corresponding

approaches rely classical game theoretic analysis  particular  work theoretical computer science competitive analysis extended deal rationality
