abstract
the problem of organizing information for multidocument summarization so that the
generated summary is coherent has received relatively little attention  while sentence
ordering for single document summarization can be determined from the ordering of sentences in the input article  this is not the case for multidocument summarization where
summary sentences may be drawn from different input articles  in this paper  we propose
a methodology for studying the properties of ordering information in the news genre and
describe experiments done on a corpus of multiple acceptable orderings we developed for
the task  based on these experiments  we implemented a strategy for ordering information
that combines constraints from chronological order of events and topical relatedness  evaluation of our augmented algorithm shows a significant improvement of the ordering over
two baseline strategies 

   introduction
multidocument summarization poses a number of new challenges over single document summarization  researchers have already investigated issues such as identifying repetitions or
contradictions across input documents and determining which information is salient enough
to include in the summary  barzilay  mckeown    elhadad        carbonell   goldstein

pierce    wagstaff         one issue that has received little attention is how to organize
the selected information so that the output summary is coherent  once all the relevant
pieces of information have been selected across the input documents  the summarizer has
to decide in which order to present them so that the whole text makes sense  in single
document summarization  one possible ordering of the extracted information is provided by
the input document itself  however  jing        observed that  in single document summaries written by professional summarizers  extracted sentences do not always retain their
precedence orders in the summary  moreover  in the case of multiple input documents  this
does not provide a useful solution  information may be drawn from different documents and
therefore  no single document can provide an ordering  furthermore  the order between two
pieces of information can change significantly from one document to another 
in this paper  we provide a corpus based methodology for studying ordering  our goal
was to develop a good ordering strategy in the context of multidocument summarization

targeted for the news genre  the first question we addressed is the importance of ordering  we conducted experiments which show that ordering significantly affects the readers
comprehension of a text  our experiments also show that although there is no single ideal
ordering of information  ordering is not an unconstrained problem  the number of good orderings for a given text is limited  the second question addressed was the analysis and use
of data to infer a strategy for ordering  existing corpus based methods  such as supervised
learning  are not easily applicable to our problem in part because of lack of training data 
given that there are multiple possible orderings  a corpus providing one ordering for each
set of information does not allow us to differentiate between sentences which must be together and sentences which happen to be together  this led us to develop a corpus of data
sets  each of which contains multiple acceptable orderings of a single text  such a corpus
is expensive to construct and therefore  does not provide enough data for pure statistical
approaches  instead  we used a hybrid corpus analysis strategy that first automatically identifies commonalities across orderings  manual analysis of the resulting clusters led to the
identification of constraints on ordering  finally  we evaluated plausible ordering strategies
by asking humans to judge the results 
our set of experiments together suggests an ordering algorithm that integrates constraints from an approximation of the temporal sequence of the underlying events and
relatedness between content elements  our evaluation of plausible strategies measured the
usefulness of a chronological ordering algorithm used in previous summarization systems
 mckeown et al         lin   hovy        as well as an alternative  original strategy 
majority ordering  our evaluation showed that the two ordering algorithms alone do not
yield satisfactory results  the first  majority ordering  is critically linked to the level of
similarity of information ordering across the input texts  when input texts have different
orderings  however  the algorithm produces unpredictable and unacceptable results  the
second  chronological ordering produces good results when the information is event based 
and therefore  is temporally sequenced  when texts do not refer to events  but describe
states or properties  this algorithm falls short 
our automatic analysis revealed that topical relatedness is an important constraint 
groups of related sentences tend to appear together  our algorithm combines chronological
ordering with constraints from topical relatedness  evaluation shows that the augmented
algorithm significantly outperforms either of the simpler methods alone  this strategy can
be characterized as bottom up since final ordering of the text emerges from how the data
groups together  whether by related content or by chronological sequence  this contrasts
with top down strategies such as rst  moore   paris        hovy         schemas  mckeown        or plans  dale        which impose an external  rhetorically motivated ordering
on the data 
in the following sections  we first show that the way information is ordered in a summary
can critically affect its overall quality  we then give an overview of our summarization
system  multigen  we next describe the two naive ordering algorithms and evaluate
them  followed by a study of multiple orderings produced by humans  this allows us
to determine how to improve the chronological ordering algorithm using cohesion as an
additional constraint  the last section describes the augmented algorithm along with its
evaluation

   impact of ordering on the overall quality of a summary
even though the problem of ordering information for multidocument summarization has
received relatively little attention  we hypothesize that good ordering is crucial to produce
summaries of quality  the consensus architecture of the state of the art summarizers consists
of a content selection module in which the salient information is extracted and a regeneration
module in which the information is reformulated into a fluent text  ideally  the regeneration
component contains devices that perform surface repairs on the text by doing anaphora
resolution  introducing cohesion markers or choosing the appropriate lexical paraphrases 
our claim in this paper is that the multidocument summarization architecture needs an
explicit ordering component  if two pieces of information extracted by the content selection
phase end up together but should not  in fact  be next one to another  surface devices will
not repair the impaired flow of information in the summary  an ordering strategy would
help avoid this situation 
it is clear that ordering cannot improve the output of earlier stages of a summarizer 
among them content selection    however  finding an acceptable ordering can enhance user
comprehension of the summary and  therefore  its overall quality  of course  surface devices
are still needed to smooth the output summary  but this is out of the scope of this paper  but
see  schiffman  nenkova    mckeown          in this section we show that the quality of
ordering has a direct effect on user comprehension of the summary  to verify our hypothesis 
we performed an experiment  measuring the impact of ordering on the users comprehension
of summaries 
we selected ten summaries produced by the columbia summarization system  mckeown  barzilay  evans  hatzivassiloglou  kan  schiffman    teufel         it is composed
of a router and two underlying summarizers  multigen and dems  difference engine
for multidocument summarization   depending on the type of input articles to be summarized  the router selects the appropriate summarizer  we evaluated this system through the
document understanding conference       duc    evaluation  where summaries produced
by several systems were graded by human judges according to different criteria  among
them how well the information contained in the summary is ordered  to actually identify a
possible impact of ordering on comprehension  we selected only summaries where humans
judged the ordering as poor   for each summary  we manually reordered the sentences
generated by the summarizer  using the input articles as a reference  when doing so  we
did not change the content  all the sentences in the reordered summaries were the same
ones as in the originally produced summaries  this process yields ten additional reordered
summaries and thus  overall our collection contains twenty summaries 
two subjects other than the authors participated in this experiment  each summary
was read by one participant without having access to the input articles  we distributed the
summaries among the judges so that none of them read both an original summary and its
reordering  they were asked to grade how well the summary could be understood  using
the ratings incomprehensible  somewhat comprehensible or comprehensible 
   no information is added or deleted once the content selection is performed 
   http   www nlpir nist gov projects duc 
   the selected summaries were produced by the dems system  we didnt select any summary produced
by multigen because it implemented our ordering algorithm at the time  dems on the other hand 
had no specific ordering strategy implemented and thus provided us with the appropriate type of data

the results are shown in figure      seven original summaries were considered incomprehensible by their judge  two were somewhat comprehensible  and only one original summary
was fully comprehensible  the reordered summaries obtained better grades overall  five
summaries were fully comprehensible  two were somewhat comprehensible  while three remained incomprehensible  to assess the statistical significance of our results  we applied
the fisher exact test to our data set  conflating incomprehensible and somewhat comprehensible summaries into one category to obtain a  x  table  this test is adapted to
our case because of the reduced size of our data set  we obtained a p value of       siegal
  castellan         which means that if reordering is not  in general  helpful  there is only
a    chance that doing reordering anyway would produce a result this different in quality
from the original ordering  this experiment indicates that a good ordering can improve the
overall comprehensibility of a summary

figure    impact of ordering on the user comprehension of summaries 

in the case of some low scoring summaries  it is clear that poor ordering is the likely
culprit  for instance  readers can easily identify that grouping the two following sentences
is an unsuitable choice and could be misleading  miss taylors health problems started with
a fall from a horse when she was    and filming the movie national velvet  the recovery of
elizabeth taylor  near death two weeks ago with viral pneumonia  was complicated by a yeast
infection  her doctors said friday  but in other cases  when information in a summary is
poorly ordered and readers cannot make sense of the text  we observed through interviews
with the readers that they tend to blame it on content selection rather than on ordering 
even if the content is not the issue  thus  the issue of ordering is not isolated  it can affect
the overall quality of a summary 

   multigen overview
our framework is the multigen system  mckeown et al          a multidocument summarizer which has been trained and tested on news articles  multigen is part of the
columbia summarization system  it operates on a set of news articles describing the same
   the set names are the ones used in the duc evaluation 

  

fisentence ordering in multidocument news summarization

event  creating a summary which synthesizes common information across documents  the
system runs daily over real data within newsblaster     a tool which collects news articles
from multiple sources  organizes them into topical clusters and provides a summary for each
of the clusters 
in the case of multidocument summarization of articles about the same event  source
articles can contain both repetitions and contradictions  extracting all the similar sentences would produce a verbose and repetitive summary  while extracting only some of the
similar sentences would produce a summary biased towards some sources  multigen uses
a comparison of extracted similar sentences to select the appropriate phrases to include in
the summary and reformulates them as new text 
multigen consists of an analysis and a generation component  the analysis component  hatzivassiloglou  klavans    eskin        identifies units of text which convey similar
information across the input documents using statistical techniques and shallow text analysis  once similar text units are identified  we cluster them into themes  themes are sets of
sentences from different documents that contain repeated information and do not necessarily contain sentences from all the documents  see two examples of themes in figure     for
each theme  the generation component  barzilay et al         identifies phrases which are
in the intersection of the theme sentences and selects them as part of the summary  the
intersection sentences are then ordered to produce a coherent text  at the end  for each
theme there will be a single corresponding generated output sentence in the summary  in
the following section  we describe different strategies for ordering the output sentences to
obtain a quality summary 
theme  
mr  salvi      apparently killed himself in his prison cell last november 
the state wouldnt execute him for killing two abortion clinic workers in       so john
c  salvi iii took his own life 
john c  salvi iii  who was convicted of killing two people in a shooting spree on two
abortion clinics in       killed himself in prison 
theme  
his attorneys said he attempted suicide twice before in prison 
his lawyers said that he twice had tried to commit suicide in jail  a charge authorities
have denied 
figure    two themes with their corresponding sentences  theme   contains sentences from only
two articles  while theme   contains sentences from three input articles 

   naive ordering algorithms are not sufficient
when producing a summary  any multidocument summarization system has to choose in
which order to present the output sentences  in this section  we describe two algorithms
   http   www cs columbia edu nlp newsblaster

  

fibarzilay  elhadad   mckeown

for ordering sentences suitable for multidocument summarization in the news genre  the
first algorithm  majority ordering  mo   relies only on the original orders of sentences
in the input documents  the second one  chronological ordering  co   uses time related
features to order sentences  this strategy was originally implemented in multigen and
followed by other summarization systems  radev  jing    budzikowska        lin   hovy 
       in the multigen framework  ordering sentences is equivalent to ordering themes 
and we describe the algorithms in terms of themes  this makes sense because  ultimately 
the summary will be composed of a sequence of sentences  each one constructed from the
information in one theme  our evaluation shows that these methods alone do not provide
an adequate strategy for ordering 
    majority ordering
      the algorithm
in single document summarization  the order of sentences in the output summary is typically
determined by their order in the input text  this strategy can be adapted to multidocument
summarization  consider two themes  t h   and t h    if sentences from t h  precede sentences
from t h  in all input texts  then presenting t h   before t h  is likely to be an acceptable
order  to use the majority ordering algorithm when the order between sentences from t h  
and t h  varies from one text to another  we must augment the strategy  one way to define
the order between t h  and t h  is to adopt the order occurring in the majority of the
texts where t h  and t h  occur  this strategy defines a pairwise order between themes 
however  this pairwise relation is not necessarily transitive  for example  given the themes
t h    t h  and t h  and the following situation  t h  precedes t h  in a text  t h  precedes
t h  in the same text or in another text  and t h   precedes t h  in yet another text  there is a
conflict between the orders  t h    t h    t h    and  t h    t h     since transitivity is a necessary
condition for a relation to be called an order  this relation does not form an order 
we  therefore  have to expand this pairwise relation to provide a total order  in other
words  we have to find a linear ordering between themes which maximizes the agreement
between the orderings provided by the input texts  for each pair of themes  t h i and t hj  
we keep two counts  ci j and cj i   ci j is the number of input texts in which sentences from
t hi occur before sentences from t hj   and cj i is the same for the opposite order  the weight
of a linear order  t hi            t hik   is defined as the sum of the counts for every pair c il  im  
such that il  im and l  m           k   stating this problem in terms of a directed graph
where nodes are themes  and a vertex from t h i to t hj has the weight ci j   we are looking
for a path with maximal weight which traverses each node exactly once  see figure     we
call such a graph a precedence graph 
the problem of finding a path with maximal weight has been addressed by cohen 
schapire  and singer        in the task of learning orderings  they adopt a two stage
approach  in the first stage  given a training corpus of ordered instances and a set of
features describing them  a binary preference function is learned  in the second stage  new
instances are ordered so that agreement with the learned preference function is maximized 
to do so  cohen et al         represent the preference function as a directed  weighted
graph  our precedence graph can be seen as such a graph where the preference function

figure    three input theme orderings and their corresponding precedence graph  t h ji is the
sentence part of the theme t hi in the input ordering j 

between the nodes t hi and t hj is ci j   the orderings from the input articles provide us
directly with a preference function and  therefore  we do not need to learn it 
unfortunately this problem is np complete  cohen et al         prove it by reducing
from cyclic ordering  galil   megido         however  using a modified version
of topological sort provides us with an approximate solution  for each node  we assign a
weight equal to the sum of the weights of its outgoing edges minus the sum of the weights
of its incoming edges  we first pick up the node with maximum weight  ordering it ahead
of the other nodes  delete it and its outgoing edges from the precedence graph and update
properly the weights of the remaining nodes in the graph  we then iterate through the
nodes until the graph is empty  cohen et al         show that this algorithm produces a
tight approximation of the optimal solution  currently multigen uses an implementation
of this algorithm for its ordering component 
figures   and   show examples of produced summaries  one feature of this strategy is
that it can produce several orderings with the same weight  this happens when there is a
tie between two opposite orderings  in this situation  this strategy does not provide enough
constraints to determine one optimal ordering  an ordering is chosen randomly among the
orders with maximal weight 
      evaluation
we asked three human judges  not including ourselves  to classify the quality of the order
of information in    summaries produced using the mo algorithm into three categories
poor  fair and good  we use an operational definition of a poor summary as a text whose

figure    a summary produced using the majority ordering algorithm  graded as poor 

readability would be significantly improved by reordering its sentences  a fair summary
is a text which makes sense  but reordering of some sentences can yield a better readability  finally  a summary which cannot be further improved by any sentence reordering is
considered a good summary 
the judges were asked to grade the summaries taking into account only the order in
which the information is presented  to help them focus on this aspect of the texts  we
resolved dangling references beforehand  figure    shows the grades assigned to the summaries  three summaries were graded as poor     were graded as fair  and eight were
graded as good  we are showing here the majority grade that is selected by at least two
judges  this was made possible because in our experiments  judges had strong agreement 
they never gave three different grades to a summary 
the mo algorithm produces a small number of good summaries  but most of the
summaries were graded as fair  for instance  the summary graded good shown in figure  
orders the information in a natural way  the text starts with a sentence summary of the
event  then the outcome of the trial is given  a reminder of the facts that caused the trial
and a possible explanation of the facts  looking at the good summaries produced by
mo  we found that it performs well when the input articles follow the same order when
  

fisentence ordering in multidocument news summarization

presenting the information  in other words  the algorithm produces a good ordering if the
input articles orderings have high agreement 
on the other hand  when analyzing poor summaries  we observed that the input texts
have very different orderings  by trying to maximize the agreement of the input texts
orderings  mo produces a new ordering that does not occur in any input text  the ordering
is  therefore  not guaranteed to be acceptable  an example of a new produced ordering is
given in figure    the summary would be more readable if several sentences were moved
around  an example of a better ordering is given in figure    in this summary  the
three sentences related to the fact that the subject had a sex change operation are grouped
together  while in the one produced by the majority ordering algorithm  they are scattered

figure    one possible better ordering for the summary graded as poor 

this algorithm can be used to order sentences accurately if we are certain that the
input texts follow similar organizations  this assumption may hold in limited domains
where documents have a fixed organization of the information  however  in our case  the
input texts we are processing do not have such regularities  looking at the daily statistics of
newsblaster which collects clusters of related articles to be synthesized into one summary 
we notice that the typical cluster size is seven  but every day there are several clusters
which contain more than    and up to    articles to be summarized into single summaries    
with such a big number of input articles  we cannot assume that they will all have similar
ordering of the information  mos performance critically depends on the agreement of
orderings in the input texts  we  therefore  need an ordering strategy which can fit any
input data  from here on  we will focus only on the chronological ordering algorithm and
techniques to improve it 

   these giant clusters correspond to the hot topics of the day in the news

    chronological ordering
      the algorithm
multidocument summarization of news typically deals with articles published on different
dates  and articles themselves cover events occurring over a wide range of time  using
chronological order in the summary to describe the main events helps the user understand
what has happened  it seems like a natural and appropriate strategy  as mentioned earlier 
in our framework  we are ordering themes  using this strategy  we  therefore  need to assign
a date to themes  to identify the date an event occurred requires a detailed interpretation
of temporal references in articles  while there have been recent developments in disambiguating temporal expressions and event ordering  wiebe  ohara  ohrstrom sandgren   
mckeever        mani   wilson        filatova   hovy         correlating events with the
date on which they occurred is a hard task  in our case  we approximate the theme time
by its first publication time  that is  the first time the theme has been reported in our set
of input articles  see figure     it is an acceptable approximation for news events  the first
publication time of an event usually corresponds to its occurrence in real life  for instance 
in a terrorist attack story  the theme conveying the attack itself will have a date previous
to the date of the theme describing a trial following the attack

figure    a theme with its corresponding sentences  the time theme is shown underlined  it is the
earliest publication time of the sentences 

articles released by news agencies are marked with a publication time  consisting of a
date and a time with two fields  hour and minutes   articles from the same news agency
are thus guaranteed to have different publication times  this is also quite likely for articles
coming from different news agencies  during the development of multigen  we processed
hundreds of articles  and we never encountered two articles with the same publication time 
thus  the publication time serves as a unique identifier over articles  as a result  when two
themes have the same publication time  it means that they both are reported for the first
time in the same article 
our chronological ordering  co  algorithm takes as input a set of themes and orders
them chronologically whenever possible  each theme is assigned a date corresponding to
its first publication  to do so  we select for each theme the sentence that has the earliest
publication time  we call it the time stamp sentence and assign its publication time as

the time stamp of the theme  this establishes a partial order over the themes  when two
themes have the same date  that is  they are reported for the first time in the same article 
we sort them according to their order of presentation in this article  this results in a total
order over the input themes  figures   and   show examples of summaries produced using

      evaluation
following the same methodology we used for the mo algorithm evaluation  we asked three
human judges  not including ourselves  to grade    summaries generated by the system
using the co algorithm applied to the same collection of input texts  the results are
shown in figure     ten summaries were graded as poor  eight were graded as fair and
seven were graded as good 
our first suspicion was that our approximation deviates too much from the real chronological order of events and  therefore  lowers the quality of sentence ordering  to verify
this hypothesis  we identified sentences that broke the original chronological order and restored the ordering manually  interestingly  the displaced sentences were mainly background
information  the evaluation of the modified summaries shows no visible improvement 
when comparing good  figure    and poor  figure    summaries  we notice two phenomena  first  many of the badly placed sentences cannot be ordered based on their temporal occurrence  for instance  in figure    the sentence quoting clinton is not one event
in the sequence of events being described  but rather  a reaction to the main events  a
tool assigning time stamps would assign to this sentence the date at which clinton made
his statement  this is also true for the sentence reporting albrights reaction  assigning
  

fibarzilay  elhadad   mckeown

a date to a reaction  or more generally to any sentence conveying background information 
and placing it into the chronological stream of the main events does not produce a logical
ordering  the ordering of these themes is  therefore  not covered by the co algorithm  furthermore  some sentences cannot be assigned any time stamp  for instance  the sentence 
the vast  sparsely inhabited xinjiang region  largely desert  has many chinese military
and nuclear installations and civilian mining  describes a state rather than an event and 
therefore  trying to describe it in temporal terms is invalid  thus the ordering cannot be
improved at the temporal level 
the second phenomenon we observed is that poor summaries typically contain abrupt
switches of topics and are generally incoherent  for instance  in figure    quotes from
us officials  third and fifth sentences  are split  and sentences about the mourning  first
and sixth sentences  appear too far apart in the summary  grouping them together would
increase the readability of the summary  at this point  we need to find additional constraints
to improve the ordering 

   improving the ordering  experiments and analysis
in the previous section  we showed that using naive ordering algorithms does not produce
satisfactory orderings  in this section  we investigate through experiments with humans
how to identify patterns of orderings that can improve the algorithm 
    collecting a corpus of multiple orderings
sentences in a text can be ordered in a number of ways  and the text as a whole will still
convey the same meaning  but the majority of possible orders are likely to be unacceptable because they break conventions of information presentation  one way to identify these
conventions is to find commonalities among different acceptable orderings of the same information  extracting regularities in several acceptable orderings can help us specify ordering
constraints for a given input type  there is no naturally occurring existing collection of
summaries for multiple documents that we aware of     but even such a collection would not
be sufficient since we want to analyze a collection of multiple summaries over the same set
of articles  we created our own collection of multiple orderings produced by different humans  using this collection  we studied common behaviors and mapped them to strategies
for ordering 
our collection of multiple orderings  along with our test corpus is available at
http   www cs columbia edu  noemie ordering   we collected ten sets of articles for
this collection  each set consisted of two to three news articles reporting the same event 
for each set  we manually selected the intersection sentences  simulating multigen     on
average  each set contained     intersection sentences  the sentences were cleaned of explicit references  for instance  occurrences of the president were resolved to president
clinton  and connectives  so that participants would not use them as clues for ordering 
ten subjects participated in the experiment  and they each built one ordering per set of
   in a recent attempt  nist for the duc conference collected sets of articles to summarize and one
summary per set 
   we performed a manual simulation to ensure that ideal data was provided to the subjects of the experiments

so that they form a readable text  overall  we obtained     orderings  ten alternative

figure     multiple orderings for one set in our collection  a  b        j stand for sentences  underlined are automatically identified blocks 

we first observed that a surprisingly large portion of the orderings are different  out
of the ten sets  only two sets had some identical orderings  in one set  two orderings were
identical while in the other set  there were two pairs of identical orderings   this variety
in the produced orderings can be interpreted as suggesting that not all the orderings were
actually valid or that the task was maybe too hard for the subjects to allow them to
produce reasonable orderings  in fact  all the subjects were satisfied with the orderings
they produced  furthermore  we manually went through all the     orderings  and all
appeared to be valid  in other words  there are many acceptable orderings given one set of
sentences  this confirms the intuition that we do not need to look for a single ideal total
ordering but rather construct an acceptable one 
looking at these various orderings  one might also conclude that any ordering would
do just as well as any other  one piece of evidence against this statement is that  as
shown in section    some orderings yield incomprehensible texts and thus should be avoided 
furthermore  for a text with n sentences  there are n  possible orderings  but only a small
fraction of those are actually valid orderings  one way to validate this claim would be to
enumerate all the possible orderings of a single text and evaluate each one of them  this
would be doable for very small texts  a text of   sentences has     possible orderings 
but not for texts of a reasonable size  a more feasible way to validate our claim is to get
multiple orderings of the same text from a large number of subjects  we asked subjects to
order one text of eight sentences  there is a maximum of        possible orderings for these
sentences  while    subjects participated  we only obtained    unique orderings  showing
that the number of acceptable orderings does not grow as fast as the number of participants 
we can conclude that only a small fraction of all possible orderings of the information in a
text contains orderings that render a readable text

    analysis
the several alternative orderings produced for a single summary exhibit commonalities 
we noticed that  within the multiple orderings of a set  some sentences always appear
together  they do not appear in the same order from one ordering to another  but they
share an adjacency relation  from now on  we refer to them as blocks  for each set  we
identify blocks by automatically clustering sentences across orderings  we use as a distance
metric between two sentences  the average number of sentences that separate them over all
orderings  in figure     for instance  the distance between sentences d and g is    the
blocks identified by clustering are  sentences b  d  g and i  sentences a and j  sentences
c and f  and sentences e and h 
we observed that all the blocks in the experiment correspond to clusters of topically
related sentences  these blocks form units of text dealing with the same subject  in
other words  all valid orderings contain blocks of topically related sentences  the notion
of grouping topically related sentences is known as cohesion  as defined by hasan        
cohesion is a device for sticking together different parts of the text  studies show that
the level of cohesion has a direct impact on reading comprehension  halliday   hasan 
       therefore  good orderings are cohesive  this is what makes the summary readable 
conversely  the evaluation of the co algorithm showed that the summaries that were judged
invalid contain abrupt switches of topic  in other words  orderings that are not cohesive
are graded poorly  there is a correlation between the quality of the ordering and cohesion 
incorporating cohesion constraint into our ordering strategy by opportunistically grouping
sentences together would be beneficial  cohesion is achieved by surface devices  such as
repetition of words and coreferences  we describe next how we include cohesion in the co
algorithm based on these surface features 

   the augmented algorithm
disfluencies arise in the output of the co algorithm when topics are distributed over the
whole text  violating cohesion properties  mccoy   cheng         a typical scenario is
illustrated in figure     the inputs are texts t     t    t   ordered by publication time   a   
a  and a  belong to the same theme  whose intersection sentence is a  and similarly for
b and c  the themes a and b are topically related  but c is not related  summary s    
based only on chronological clues  contains two topical shifts  from a to c and back from
c to b  a better summary would be s    which keeps a and b together 
    the algorithm
our goal is to remove disfluencies from the summary by grouping together topically related
themes  the main technical difficulty in incorporating cohesion in our ordering algorithm is
to identify and to group topically related themes across multiple documents  in other words 
given two themes  we need to determine if they belong to the same cohesion block  for a
single document  topical segmentation  hearst        could be used to identify blocks  but
this technique is not a possibility for identifying cohesion between sentences across multiple
documents  segmentation algorithms typically exploit the linear structure of an input text 
in our case  we want to group together sentences belonging to different texts

figure     input texts t  t  t  are summarized by the chronological ordering  s    or by the augmented algorithm  s    

our solution consists of the following steps  in a preprocessing stage  we segment each
input text  kan  klavans    mckeown        based on word distribution and coreference
analysis  so that given two sentences within the same text  we can determine if they are
topically related  assume the themes a and b exist  where a contains sentences  a         an   
and b contains sentences  b        bm    recall that a theme is a set of sentences conveying
similar information drawn from different input texts  we denote  ab to be the number of
pairs of sentences  ai   bj   which appear in the same text  and  ab   to be the number of
sentence pairs which appear in the same text and are in the same segment 
in the first stage  for each pair of themes a and b  we compute the ratio  ab     ab
to measure the relatedness of two themes  this measure takes into account both positive
and negative evidence  if most of the sentences in a and b that appear together in the same
texts are also in the same segments  it means that a and b are highly topically related  in
this case  the ratio is close to    on the other hand  if among the texts containing sentences
from a and b  only a few pairs are in the same segments  then a and b are not topically
related  accordingly  the ratio is close to    a and b are considered related if this ratio is
higher than a predetermined threshold  we determined experimentally its value to be     
this strategy defines pairwise relations between themes  a transitive closure of this
relation builds groups of related themes and  as a result  ensures that themes that do not
appear together in any article but which are both related to a third theme will still be
linked  this creates an even higher degree of relatedness among themes  because we use a
threshold to establish pairwise relations  the transitive closure does not produce elongated
chains that could link together unrelated themes  we are now able to identify topically
related themes  at the end of the first stage  they are grouped into blocks 
in a second stage  we assign a time stamp to each block of related themes using the
earliest time stamp of the themes it contains  we adapt the co algorithm described in      
to work at the level of the blocks  the blocks and the themes correspond to  respectively 
themes and sentences in the co algorithm  by analogy  we can easily show that the
adapted algorithm produces a complete order of the blocks  this yields a macro ordering
of the summary  we still need to order the themes inside each block 
in the last stage of the augmented algorithm  for each block  we order the themes it
contains by applying the co algorithm to them  figure    shows an example of a summary
produced by the augmented algorithm 
  

fibarzilay  elhadad   mckeown

this algorithm ensures that cohesively related themes will not be spread over the text
and decreases the number of abrupt switches of topics  figure    shows how the augmented
algorithm improves the sentence order compared with the order in the summary produced
by the co algorithm in figure    sentences quoting us officials are now grouped together 
and so are the descriptions of the mourning 
thousands of people have attended a ceremony in nairobi commemorating the first anniversary of the
deadly bombings attacks against u s  embassies in kenya and tanzania  kenyans are observing a national
day of mourning in honor of the     people who died there 
saudi dissident osama bin laden  accused of masterminding the attacks  and nine others are still at large 
u s  federal prosecutors have charged    people in the bombings 
president clinton said  the intended victims of this vicious crime stood for everything that is right about
our country and the world  albright said that the mourning continues 

figure     a summary produced using the augmented algorithm  related sentences are
grouped into paragraphs 

    evaluation
following the same methodology used to evaluate the mo and the co algorithms  we asked
the judges to grade    summaries produced by the augmented algorithm  results are shown
in figure    
the manual effort needed to compare and judge system output is extensive considering
that each human judge had to read three summaries for each input set as well as skim the
input texts to verify that no misleading information was introduced in the summaries  we
collected a corpus of    sets of articles for evaluation  overall  there were    summaries to
be evaluated  the size of our corpus is comparable with the collection used for the duc
evaluation     sets of articles   this evaluation shows a significant improvement in the
quality of the orderings from the co algorithm to the augmented algorithm  to assess the
significance of the improvement  we used the fisher exact test  conflating poor and fair
summaries into one category  p value of        the augmented algorithm also shows an
improvement over the mo algorithm  p value of

   related work
finding an acceptable ordering has not been studied before in domain independent text
summarization  in single document summarization  summary sentences are typically arranged in the same order that they were found in the full document  although jing       
reports that human summarizers do sometimes change the original order  in multidocument
summarization  the summary consists of fragments of text or sentences that were selected
from different texts  thus  there is no complete ordering of summary sentences that can be
found in the original documents 
in domain dependent summarization  it is possible to establish possible orderings a
priori  a valid ordering is traditionally derived from a manual analysis of a corpus of
texts in the domain  and it typically operates over a set of semantic concepts  a semantic
representation of the information is usually available as input to the ordering component 
for instance  in the specific domain of news on the topic of terrorist attacks  summaries
can be constructed by first describing the place of the attack  followed by the number of
casualties  who the possible perpetrators are  etc 
another alternative when ordering information  still in the domain dependent framework  is to use a more data driven approach  which produces a more flexible output  a
priori defined simple ordering strategies are combined together by looking at a set of features from the input  elhadad and mckeown        use such techniques to produce patient
specific summaries of technical medical articles  examples of features which influence the
ordering are presence of contradiction or repetition  relevance to the patient characteristics 
or type of results being reported  a linear combination of these features assigns a weight to
each semantic predicate to be included in the output  allowing them to be ordered  in this
case  the features are domain dependent and have been identified through corpus analysis
and interviews with physicians  in the case of a domain independent system  it would be
an entire new challenge to define and compute such a set of features 
producing a good ordering of information is also a critical task for the generation community  which has extensively investigated the issue  mckeown        moore   paris       
hovy        bouayad agha  power    scott        mooney  carberry    mccoy         one
approach is top down  using schemas  mckeown        or plans  dale        to determine
the organizational structure of the text  this approach postulates a rhetorical structure
which can be used to select information from an underlying knowledge base  because the
domain is limited  an encoding can be developed of the kinds of propositional content that
match rhetorical elements of the schema or plan  thereby allowing content to be selected
and ordered  rhetorical structure theory  rst  allows for more flexibility in ordering content by establishing relations between pairs of propositions  constraints based on intention
 e g   moore   paris         plan like conventions  e g   hovy         or stylistic constraints
 e g   bouayad agha et al         are used as preconditions on the plan operators containing
rst relations to determine when a relation is used and how it is ordered with respect to
other relations  another approach  mooney et al         is bottom up and is used to group
together stretches of text in a long  generated document by finding propositions that are
related by a common focus  since this approach was developed for a generation system  it
finds related propositions by comparisons of proposition arguments at the semantic level 
  

fibarzilay  elhadad   mckeown

in our case  we are dealing with a surface representation  so we find alternative methods
for grouping text fragments 
a more recent approach by duboue and mckeown        has been implemented to
automatically estimate constraints on information ordering in the medical domain  at the
content planning stage  using a collection of semantically tagged transcripts written by
domain experts  duboue and mckeown        identify basic adjacency patterns contained
within a plan  as well as their ordering  multigen generates summaries of news on any
topic  in such an unconstrained domain  it would be impossible to enumerate the semantics
for all possible types of sentences which could match the elements of a schema  a plan or
rhetorical relations  for instance  duboue and mckeown build their content planner based
on a set of    semantic categories  in our case  there is no such regularity in the input
information  furthermore  it would be difficult to specify a generic rhetorical plan for a
summary of news  instead  content determination in multigen is opportunistic  depending
on the kinds of similarities that happen to exist between a set of news documents  similarly 
we describe here an ordering scheme that is opportunistic and bottom up  depending on
the cohesion and temporal connections that happen to exist between selected text 
our ordering component takes place after the content selection of the information in
a pipeline architecture  in contrast to generation systems  where usually the ordering and
the content selection come in tandem  this separation might come at a cost  if there is
no good ordering to the given extracted information  it is not possible to go back to the
content selection to extract new information  in summarization  content selection is driven
by salience criteria  we believe that the same ordering strategy should work with different
content selectors  independently of their salience criteria  therefore  we choose to keep the
two components  selection and ordering  as two separate modules 

   conclusion and future work
in this paper we investigated information ordering constraints in multidocument summarization in the news genre  we evaluated two alternative ordering strategies  chronological
ordering  co  and majority ordering  mo   our experiments show that mo performs well
only when all input texts follow similar organization of the information  in the domains
where this constraint holds  mo would be an appropriate and highly effective strategy  but
in the news genre we cannot make this assumption  thus it is not an appropriate solution 
the chronological ordering  co  algorithm can provide an acceptable solution for many
cases  but is not sufficient when summaries contain information that is not event based 
our experiments  using a corpus that we collected of multiple alternative summaries each of
multiple documents  show that cohesion is an important constraint contributing to ordering 
moreover  they also show that appropriate ordering of information is critical to allow for
easy comprehension of the summary and that it is not the case that all possible orderings of
information are acceptable  we developed an operational algorithm that integrates cohesion
as part of the co algorithm  and implemented it as part of the multigen summarization
system  our evaluation of the system shows significant improvement in summary quality 
while in this paper we focused on augmenting the co algorithm  we believe that mo
is a promising strategy and should not be neglected  it is clear that different forms of
summarization are useful in different situations  depending on the intended purpose of
  

fisentence ordering in multidocument news summarization

the summary and on the types of documents summarized  for our future work  we plan
to build on the approach we used for the duc      evaluation  where we developed a
summarizer that would use different algorithms for summary generation depending on the
type of input text  we suspect that ordering strategies may differ also  depending on
the type of summary  our work will first investigate whether we can use our augmented
algorithm for other summary types  if the algorithm does not yield good orderings  we will
investigate through corpus analysis other summary type specific constraints  we suspect
that our augmented algorithm may apply  for instance  to biographical summaries  since
the information being summarized is a mixture of event based information that can be
chronologically ordered along with descriptive information about the person  it is unclear
whether it can apply to other types of summaries such as summaries of different events 
since pieces of information may not be temporally related to each other  we also plan to
identify the types of summaries which would benefit from using the mo algorithm or an
augmented version of it  the same way the co algorithm was augmented with the cohesion
constraint
