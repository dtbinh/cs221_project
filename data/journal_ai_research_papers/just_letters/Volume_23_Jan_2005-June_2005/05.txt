abstract
argumentation is based on the exchange and valuation of interacting arguments  followed
by the selection of the most acceptable of them  for example  in order to take a decision 
to make a choice   starting from the framework proposed by dung in       our purpose
is to introduce graduality in the selection of the best arguments  i e  to be able to
partition the set of the arguments in more than the two usual subsets of selected and
non selected arguments in order to represent different levels of selection  our basic idea
is that an argument is all the more acceptable if it can be preferred to its attackers  first 
we discuss general principles underlying a gradual valuation of arguments based on their
interactions  following these principles  we define several valuation models for an abstract
argumentation system  then  we introduce graduality in the concept of acceptability
of arguments  we propose new acceptability classes and a refinement of existing classes
taking advantage of an available gradual valuation 

   introduction
as shown by dung         argumentation frameworks provide a unifying and powerful
tool for the study of several formal systems developed for common sense reasoning  as well
as for giving a semantics to logic programs  argumentation is based on the exchange and
valuation of interacting arguments which support opinions and assertions  it can be applied 
among others  in the legal domain  for collective decision support systems or for negotiation
support 
the fundamental characteristic of an argumentation system is the interaction between arguments  in particular  a relation of attack may exist between arguments  for example  if
the argument takes the form of a logical proof  arguments for a proposition and arguments
against this proposition can be advanced  in that case  the attack relation relies on logical
inconsistency 
the argumentation process is usually divided in two steps  a valuation of the relative
strength of the arguments  followed by the selection of the most acceptable arguments 
in the valuation step  it is usual to distinguish two different types of valuations 
intrinsic valuation  here  the value of an argument is independent of its interactions
with the other arguments  this enables to simply express to what extent an argument
increases the confidence in the statement it supports  see pollock        krause  ambler  elvang    fox        parsons        prakken   sartor        amgoud   cayrol

for example  in the work of krause et al          using the following knowledge base 
composed of  formula  probability  pairs                                          
                           two arguments can be produced   
a                              
and a                               

both arguments have the same weight                     and the formula    has
the weight                              
interaction based valuation  here the value of an argument depends on its attackers
 the arguments attacking it   the attackers of its attackers  the defenders   etc   
several approaches have been proposed along this line  see dung        amgoud  
cayrol        jakobovits   vermeir        besnard   hunter        which differ in
the sets of values used  usually  two values are considered  however  there are very
few proposals which use more than two values  three values in jakobovits   vermeir 
      and an infinity of values in besnard   hunter        
for example  in the work of besnard and hunter         the set of values is the
interval of the real line         in this case  with the set of arguments   a    a    a   
and considering that a  attacks a  which attacks a    the value of the argument a 
 resp  a    a    is    resp            
intrinsic valuation and interaction based valuation have often been used separately  according to the considered applications  some recent works however consider a combination of
both approaches  see amgoud   cayrol        karacapilidis   papadias        pollock 
      
considering now the selection of the more acceptable arguments  it is usual to distinguish
two approaches 
individual acceptability  here  the acceptability of an argument depends only on its
properties  for example  an argument can be said acceptable if and only if it does not
have any attacker  in this case  only the interaction between arguments is considered 
see elvang goransson et al          in the context of an intrinsic valuation  an argument can also be said acceptable if and only if it is better than each of its attackers
 see amgoud   cayrol        
collective acceptability  in this case  the acceptability of a set of arguments is explicitly
defined  for example  to be acceptable  a set of arguments may not contain two
   here  the arguments are under the form of an explanation conclusion pair  this is one possible way
to compute arguments  see also lin   shoham        vreeswijk        pollock        prakken   sartor 
      simari   loui        elvang goransson  fox    krause        kohlas et al         amgoud  
cayrol        
   weights being probabilities  the weight of an argument is the probability of the conjunction of the
formulae of the argument  and the weight of   is the probability of the disjunction of a  and a   
   here  we consider only the interactions corresponding to attacks between arguments  there exist also
some other types of interactions  for example  arguments which reinforce other arguments instead of attacking them  see karacapilidis   papadias        verheij         for this kind of interaction  graduality
has not been considered 
   here  the initial knowledge base is useless 

   

figraduality in argumentation

arguments such that one attacks the other  interactions between arguments are used  
dungs        framework is well suited for this kind of approach but allows only for
a binary classification  the argument belongs or does not belong to an acceptable set 
it is clear that except for intrinsic valuations  most proposals do not allow for any gradual
notion of valuation or acceptability  i e  there is a low number of levels to describe values
and the acceptability is usually binary   our aim is therefore to introduce graduality in
these two steps 
however  the processes of valuation and of selection are often linked together  this is the
case when the selection is done on the basis of the value of arguments  or when the selection
defines a binary valuation on arguments  we will therefore 
first consider and discuss the general principles concerning the definition of a gradual
interaction based valuation and then define some valuation models in an abstract
argumentation system 
then  introduce the notion of graduality in the definition of the acceptability using the
previously defined gradual valuations  but also some more classical mechanisms 
some graduality has already been introduced in argumentation systems  for instance  in
the work of pollock         degrees of justification for beliefs are computed  arguments are
sequences of conclusive and or prima facie inferences  arguments are collected in a graph
where a node represents the conclusion of an argument  a support link ties a node to nodes
from which it is inferred  and an attack link indicates an attack between nodes  the degree
of justification of a belief is computed from the strength of the arguments concluding that
belief and the strength of the arguments concluding on an attacker of the belief 
our work takes place in a more abstract framework since we do not consider any argument
structure  our valuation models are based on interactions between arguments and directly
apply to arguments 
we use the framework defined by dung         a set of arguments and a binary attack
relation between arguments  we also use a graphical representation of argumentation systems  see section     the gradualisation of interaction based valuations will be presented
in section    then  in section    we will consider different mechanisms leading to gradual
acceptability  sometimes relying on the gradual valuations defined in section    we will
conclude in section   
all the proofs of the properties stated in sections   and   will be given in appendix a 

   dungs        framework and its graphical representation
we consider the abstract framework introduced by dung         an argumentation system
 a  r  is a set a of arguments and a binary relation r on a called an attack relation 
consider ai and aj  a  ai raj means that ai attacks aj or aj is attacked by ai  also
denoted by  ai   aj    r  
   for example  using besnard and hunters        valuation  we can decide that all the arguments whose
value is       are selected  because     is the mean value of the set of values  another possibility  with
different valuations  interaction based or intrinsic   is to accept an argument when its value is better
than the value of each of its attackers

an argumentation system is well founded if and only if there is no infinite sequence a     a   
        an         such that i  ai  a and ai   rai  
here  we are not interested in the structure of the arguments and we consider an arbitrary
attack relation 
notation   a  r  defines a directed graph g called the attack graph  consider a  a 
the set r  a  is the set of the arguments attacking a  and the set r   a  is the set of the
arguments attacked by a   
example  
the system  a    a    a    a    a     r     a    a      a    a      a    a      defines the following graph g with the root  a

definition    graphical representation of an argumentation system  let g be the
attack graph associated with the argumentation system  a  r   we define 
leaf of the attack graph a leaf of g is an argument a  a without attackers   
path in the attack graph a path from a to b is a sequence of arguments c   a  
       an such that 
a   a   
a  ra   
    
an  ran  
an   b 
the length of the path is n     the number of edges that are used in the path  and
will be denoted by lc  
a special case is the path   from a to a whose length is   
the set of paths from a to b will be denoted by c a  b  
   r  a     ai  a ai ra  
   r   a     ai  a arai   
   the word root is used in an informal sense  it just means that there are in the graph some paths
leading to this node   this term and other terms  leaf  branch  path          which are used in this
document are standard in graph theory but may have a different definition  they are usual terms in the
argumentation domain  please see definition   in order to know their precise meaning in this document 
these definitions simply take into account the fact that the directed edges of our graph link attackers to
attacked argument  
   a is a leaf iff r  a     
    we will assume that there exists an infinity of such paths  this assumption greatly simplifies the handling
of leaves later in the paper

dependence  independence  root dependence of a path
consider   paths ca  c a    an   and cb  c b    bm   
these two paths will be said dependent iff ai  ca   bj  cb such that ai   bj  
otherwise they are independent 
these two paths will be said root dependent in an iff an   bm and ai    an  ca  
  bj  cb such that ai   bj  
cycles in the attack graph a cycle   is a path c   a          an  a  such that i  j 
    n   if i    j  then ai    aj  
a cycle c is isolated iff a  c    b  a such that bra and b   c 
two cycles ca   a          an  a  and cb   b          bm  b  are interconnected
iff i      n   j      m  such that ai   bj  
we use the notions of direct and indirect attackers and defenders  the notions introduced
here are inspired by related definitions first introduced by dung        but are not strictly
equivalent    
definition    direct indirect attackers defenders of an argument  consider a 
a 
the direct attackers of a are the elements of r  a  
the direct defenders of a are the direct attackers of the elements of r  a  
the indirect attackers of a are the elements ai defined by 
c  c ai   a  such that lc    k      with k    
the indirect defenders of a are the elements ai defined by 
c  c ai   a  such that lc    k  with k    
if the argument a is an attacker  direct or indirect  of the argument b  we say that a
attacks b  or that b is attacked by a   in the same way  if the argument a is a defender
 direct or indirect  of the argument b  then a defends b  or b is defended by a  
note that an attacker can also be a defender  for example  if a  attacks a  which attacks
a    and a  also attacks a     in the same way  a direct attacker can be an indirect attacker
 for example  if a  attacks a  which attacks a  which attacks a    and a  also attacks a   
and the same thing may occur for the defenders 
definition    attack branch and defence branch of an argument  consider a 
a  an attack branch  resp  defence branch  for a is a path in g from a leaf to a whose
length is odd  resp  even   we say that a is the root of an attack branch  resp  a defence
branch  
    this definition of a cycle corresponds to the definition of an elementary cycle in graph theory  an
elementary cycle does not contain   edges with the same initial extremity  or the same ending extremity  
    in dungs        work  direct attackers  resp  defenders  are also indirect attackers  resp  defenders 
which is not true in our definitions 

   

ficayrol  lagasquie schiex

note that this notion of defence is the basis of the usual notion of reinstatement  b attacks
c  a attacks b and c is reinstated because of a   in this paper  reinstatement is taken
into account indirectly  because the value of the argument c and the possibility for selecting
c will be increased thanks to the presence of a 
all these notions are illustrated on the following example 
example  

on this graph g  we can see 
a path from c  to a whose length is    c   b   a  
  cycles a   a   a   a  and a   a   a   a    of length
   which are not isolated  note that a   a   a   a  
a   a   a  is not a cycle with our definition  
the two previous cycles are interconnected  in a  and a    
the paths d  c  b  and c  b  a are independent  the
paths d   c   b   a and c   b   a are root dependent
and the paths d  c  b  a and c  b  a are dependent 
d    c    e  are the leaves of g 
d   c   b   a is an attack branch for a whose length is
   c   b   a is a defence branch for a whose length is   
c    b  and b  are the direct attackers of a 
c    c   which is already a direct attacker of a  and c  are
the direct defenders of a 
d  and d  are the two indirect attackers of a 
e  is the only indirect defender of a

   graduality in interaction based valuations
we consider two different valuation methods for taking into account the quality of attackers
and defenders of an argument in order to define the value of an argument using only the
interaction between arguments    
in the first approach  the value of an argument only depends on the values of the direct
attackers of this argument  therefore  defenders are taken into account through the
attackers  this approach is called local 
in the second approach  the value of an argument represents the set of all the attack
and the defence branches for this argument  this approach is called global 
the main difference between these two approaches is illustrated by the following example 
d

c 

c

b

c 

    we pursue a work initiated in  cayrol   lagasquie schiex      c  and propose some improvements 

   

figraduality in argumentation

in the local approach  b has two direct attackers  c  and c    whereas b   has only one
 c      thus b   is better than b  since b   suffers one attack whereas b suffers two attacks  
in the global approach  two branches  one of attack and one of defence  lead to b whereas
only one branch of attack leads to b     thus b is better than b    since it has at least one
defence whereas b   has none   in this case  c  loses its negative status of attacker  since it
is in fact carrying a defence for b 
    local approach  generic valuation 
some existing proposals can already be considered as examples of local valuations 
in jakobovits and vermeirs        approach  a labelling of a set of arguments assigns a
status  accepted  rejected  undecided  to each argument using labels from the set          
   resp       represents the accepted  resp  rejected  undecided  status  intuitively 
an argument labelled with   is both supported and weakened 
definition    jakobovits and vermeirs labellings        let  a  r  be an argumentation system  a complete labelling of  a  r  is a function lab   a           such
that 
   if lab a         then b  r  a  such that lab b         
   if lab a          then b  r  a   r   a   lab b        
the underlying intuition is that an argument can only be weakened  label  or    if one of
its direct attackers is supported  condition     an argument can get a support only if all its
direct attackers are weakened and an argument which is supported  label   or    weakens
the arguments it attacks  condition     so 
if
if
if
if

a has no attacker lab a      
lab a     then b  r  a  such that lab b     
 b  r  a   lab b      then lab a      
lab a      then b  r  a   r   a   lab b     

every argumentation system can be completely labelled  the associated semantics is that
s is an acceptable set of arguments iff there exists a complete labelling lab of  a  r  such
that s    a lab a       
other types of labellings are introduced by jakobovits and vermeir        among which the
so called rooted labelling which induces a corresponding rooted semantics  the idea is
to reject only the arguments attacked by accepted arguments  an attack by an undecided
argument is not rooted since an undecided attacker may become rejected 
definition    jakobovits and vermeirs labellings        continuation 
the complete labelling lab is rooted iff a  a  if lab a     then b  r   a  such that
lab b      
the rooted semantics enables to clarify the links between all the other semantics introduced
by jakobovits and vermeir        and some semantics introduced by dung

for n odd  we obtain lab an     lab an              lab a        and lab an     
lab an              lab a      
another type of local valuation has been introduced recently by besnard and hunter       
for deductive arguments  the approach can be characterised as follows  an argument
is structured as a pair hsupport  conclusioni  where support is a consistent set of formulae
that enables to prove the formula conclusion  the attack relation considered here is strict
and cycles are not allowed  the notion of a tree of arguments allows a concise and
exhaustive representation of attackers and defenders of a given argument  root of the tree 
a function  called a categoriser  assigns a value to a tree of arguments  this value
represents the relative strength of an argument  root of the tree  given all its attackers and
defenders  another function  called an accumulator  synthesises the values assigned to all
the argument trees whose root is an argument for  resp  against  a given conclusion  the
phase of categorisation therefore corresponds to an interaction based valuation  besnard
and hunter        introduce the following function cat 
if r  a      then cat a     
if r  a      with r  a     a            an    cat a   

 
  cat a        cat an  

intuitively  the larger the number of direct attackers of an argument  the lower its value 
the larger the number of defenders of an argument  the larger its value 
example    continuation  we obtain 
cat a
n        cat an           cat an            cat an                   and cat a     

          when n    this value is the inverse of the golden ratio     
so  we have 
if n is even cat an            cat a     cat a     cat a            cat an      
if n is odd cat an            cat a     cat a     cat a            cat an      
our approach for local valuations is a generalisation of these two previous proposals in the
sense that besnard and hunters        cat function and jakobovits and vermeirs       
labellings are instances of our approach 
the main idea is that the value of an argument is obtained with the composition of two
functions 
one for aggregating the values of all the direct attackers of the argument  so  this
function computes the value of the direct attack 
the other for computing the effect of the direct attack on the value of the argument 
if the value of the direct attack increases then the value of this argument decreases 
if the value of the direct attack decreases then the value of this argument increases 
    the golden ratio is a famous number since the antiquity which has several interesting properties in
several domains  architecture  for example  

   

figraduality in argumentation

let  w    be a totally ordered set with a minimum element  vmin   and a subset v of w  
that contains vmin and with a maximum element vmax  
definition    generic gradual valuation  let  a  r  be an argumentation system 
a valuation is a function v   a  v such that 
   a  a  v a   vmin
   a  a  if r  a      then v a    vmax
   a  a  if r  a     a            an        then v a    g h v a             v an    
with h   v   w such that  v  denotes the set of all finite sequences of elements of v  
h x    x

for any permutation  xi            xin   of  x            xn    h xi            xin     h x            xn  
h x            xn   xn      h x            xn  
if xi  x i then h x            xi           xn    h x            x i           xn  
and g   w  v such that
g vmin     vmax
g vmax     vmax
g is non increasing  if x  y then g x   g y  
note that h x            xn    max x            xn   is a logical consequence of the properties of the
function h 
a first property on the function g explains the behaviour of the local valuation in the case
of an argument which is the root of only one branch  like in example    
property   the function g satisfies for all n    
g vmax    g    vmax           g  n    vmax    g  n  vmax           g    vmax    vmax
moreover  if g is strictly non increasing and g vmax     vmin   the previous inequalities
become strict 
a second property shows that the local valuation induces an ordering relation on arguments 
property    complete preordering  let v be a valuation in the sense of definition   
v induces a complete   preordering  on the set of arguments a defined by  a  b iff
v a   v b  
a third property handles the cycles 
    a complete preordering on a means that any two elements of a are comparable

property    value in a cycle  let c be an isolated cycle of the attack graph  whose
length is n  if n is odd  all the arguments of the cycle have the same value and this value
is a fixpoint of the function g  if n is even  the value of each argument of the cycle is a
fixpoint of the function g n  
the following property shows the underlying principles satisfied by all the local valuations
defined according to our schema 
property    underlying principles  the gradual valuation given by definition   respects the following principles 
p  the valuation is maximal for an argument without attackers and non maximal for an
attacked and undefended argument 
p  the valuation of an argument is a function of the valuation of its direct attackers  the
direct attack  
p  the valuation of an argument is a non increasing function of the valuation of the direct
attack 
p  each attacker of an argument contributes to the increase of the valuation of the direct
attack for this argument 
the last properties explain why jakobovits and vermeir        and besnard and hunter
       propose instances of the local valuation described in definition   
property    link with jakobovits   vermeir       
every rooted labelling of  a  r  in the sense of jakobovits and vermeir        can be
defined as an instance of the generic valuation such that

note that  in the work of besnard and hunter         the valued graphs are acyclic  however  it is easy to show that the valuation proposed by besnard and hunter        can be

v a    g h g h g    vmax    g vmax      g    vmax    g vmax    vmax   
so  we have 
e     d     d     c     b 

c     b 

d     c     c     b 
however  the constraints on v a  and v b    are insufficient to compare a and b  with the
other arguments 
the same problem exists if we reduce the example to the hatched part of the graph in the
previous figure  we obtain e    d   c   d    c    but a and b  cannot be compared with
the other arguments    
now  we use the instance of the generic valuation proposed by besnard and hunter        
v e      v d      v d      v c      v b        
v d      v c      v c      v b          
v c      v b          
    v a    g    h g    vmax   g vmax     and v b      g h g    vmax    g vmax

v b        
  
v a         

so  we have 
e     d     d     c     b 

c     b 

d     c     c     b 

b 

a
however  if we reduce the example to the hatched part of the graph  then the value of a is
  
     so  v a  is better than v b    and v d     but also than v c     a becomes better than
its defender  
example    isolated cycle  consider the following graph reduced to an isolated cycle 
a

b

 

a generic valuation gives v a    v b    fixpoint of g    
if we use the instance proposed by besnard and hunter         v a  and v b  are solutions
of the following second degree equation 
x    x        

    
so  we obtain  v a    v b   
        the inverse of the golden ratio again  
 
    global approach  with tuples 
we now consider a second approach for the valuation step  called the global approach  here 
the key idea is that the value of a must describe the subgraph whose root is a  so  we
want to memorise the length of each branch leading to a in a tuple  for an attack branch 
we have an odd integer  and for a defence branch  we have an even integer  
in this approach  the main constraint is that we must be able to identify the branches
leading to the argument and to compute their lengths  this is very easy in the case of an
acyclic graph  we therefore introduce first a global gradual valuation for acyclic graphs 
then  in the next sections  we extend our proposition to the case of graphs with cycles  and
we study the properties of this global gradual valuation 
      gradual valuation with tuples for acyclic graphs
first  in order to record the lengths of the branches leading to the arguments  we use the
notion of tuples and we define some operations on these tuples

definition    tuple  a tuple is a sequence of integers  the tuple                       will be
 
 z
 
denoted by     the tuple                       will be denoted by    
 
 z
 





notation   t denotes the set of the tuples built with positive integers 
definition    operations on the tuples  we have two kinds of operations on tuples 
the concatenation of two tuples is defined by the function     t  t  t such that
    t   t       t for t      

 x            xn             x             x n            sort x            xn           x             x n         
sort being the function which orders a tuple by increasing values 
the addition of a tuple and an integer is defined by the function    t 
that

 t such

   k    k 
    k     

 x            xn    k    x    k          xn   k

note that we allow infinite tuples  among other reasons  because they are needed later in
order to compute the ordering relations described in section        in particular when the
graph is cyclic  
the operations on the tuples have the following properties 
property    properties of   and  
the concatenation   is commutative and associative 
for any tuple t and any integers k and k      t  k   k     t   k   k     
for any integer k and any tuples t and t  different from        t   t     k    t  k     t   k  
in order to valuate the arguments  we split the set of the lengths of the branches leading
to the argument in two subsets  one for the lengths of defence branches  even integers  and
the other one for the lengths of attack branches  odd integers   this is captured by the
notion of tupled values 
definition    tupled value  a tupled value is a pair of tuples vt    vtp   vti   with 
vtp is a tuple of even integers ordered by increased values  this tuple is called the even
component of vt 
vti is a tuple of odd integers ordered by increased values  this tuple is called the odd
component of vt 
    otherwise it is false         p    k    p   k   whereas     k      p   k     k     p   k     k  p   k

notation   v denotes the subset of t  t of all tupled values  so  vt  v  vt is a pair
of tuples satisfying definition    
using this notion of tupled values  we can define the computation process of the gradual
valuation with tuples   in the case of acyclic graphs 
definition     valuation with tuples for acyclic graphs  let  a  r  be an argumentation system without cycles  a valuation with tuples is a function v   a  v such
that 
if a  a is a leaf then

v a             

if a  a has direct attackers denoted by b            bn         then
v a     vp  a   vi  a   with 

vp  a     vi  b             vi  bn          
vi  a     vp  b             vp  bn          

notes  the choice of the value          for the leaves is justified by the fact that the value
of an argument memorises all the lengths of the branches leading to the argument  using
the same constraint  either vp  a  or vi  a  may be empty but not both    
note also that the set of the direct attackers of an argument can be infinite  this property
will be used when we take into account an argumentation graph with cycles  
example   on this graph  the valuation with tuples gives the following results 
a
b

on this graph g  we have

v d      v c      v e               
v c      v d                
v c                
v b

    this definition is different from the definition given in  cayrol   lagasquie schiex      c   the ideas
are the same but the formalisation is different 
    the proof is the following  
if a is not a leaf  at least one of the tuples is not empty  because there exists at least one branch
whose length is     leading to a  see definitions   and     
and  if a is a leaf  there also exists at least one defence branch because the path from a to a is
allowed and its length is    in fact  there are an infinity of such paths  see definition    and no attack
branch leading to the leaf  see definition     
so  the value of a leaf is           and it is impossible that vp  a    vi  a

      study of cycles
handling cycles raises some important issues  the notion of branch is not always useful in a
cycle  for example  in an unattacked cycle like in examples   and     and when this notion
is useful  the length of a branch can be defined in different ways 
let us consider different examples 
example    unattacked cycle  the graph is reduced to an unattacked cycle a  b  a
which attacks the argument c 
a

b

c

the notion of branch is useless in this case  because there is no leaf in the graph 
there are two possibilities 
first  one can consider that the cycle is like an infinite branch  so a  resp  b  is the
root of one branch whose length is   but the parity of the length of this branch is
undefined  and it is impossible to say if this branch is an attack branch or a defence
branch 
the second possibility is to consider that the cycle is like an infinity of branches  so
a  resp  b  is the root of an infinity of attack branches and defence branches whose
lengths are known and finite 
the second possibility means that the cycle may have two representations which are acyclic
but also infinite graphs  one with the root a and the other one with the root b   this is a
rewriting process of the cycle

the ai and bi must be new arguments created during the rewriting process of the cycle 
example    attacked cycle  the cycle a  b  a is attacked by at least one argument
which does not belong to the cycle  here  the attacker is the unattacked argument d

e

in this case  the notion of branch is useful because there exists one leaf in the graph  but the
difficulty is to compute the length of this branch  as in example    we can consider either
that there is only one infinite branch  so  it is impossible to know if this branch is an attack
or a defence branch   or that there is an infinity of attack branches and defence branches
whose lengths are known and finite 
in the second case  the graph can be rewritten into the following structures

the ai and bi must be new arguments created during the rewriting process of the graph 
from the previous examples  we have chosen to manage a cycle as an infinity of attack
branches and defence branches whose lengths are known and finite because we would like to
be able to apply definition    in all cases  acyclic graphs and graphs with cycles   however 
we need a rewriting process of the graph with cycles into an acyclic graph  there are two
different cases  one for the unattacked cycles and one for the attacked cycles 
definition     rewriting of an unattacked cycle  let c   a   a          an   a 
an unattacked cycle  the graph g which contains c is rewritten as follows

note  if there exist several cycles in a graph  we have two cases 
if they are not interconnected  we rewrite each cycle  and the valuation of the resulting
graph after rewriting does not depend on the order of cycles we select to rewrite
because the valuation process only uses the length of the branches 
if they are interconnected  they are considered as a metacyle which is in turn attacked or unattacked and the previous methodology can be used leading to a more
complex rewriting process which is not formalized here  see details and examples in
appendix b  
      a gradual valuation with tuples for general graphs
using the definitions given in sections       and        the gradual valuation with tuples
given by definition    is applicable for arbitrary graphs after the rewriting process 
let us apply the rewriting process and definition    on different examples 
example    unattacked cycle  continuation 
consider the following graph 
a

b

c

the rewriting of this graph has been given in section       
definition    produces 
vp  a     vi  a                    vi  an               
vi  a     vp  a                    vp  an               
applying definition    for different arguments in the rewritten graph produces the following
equalities 
v ann              for each n   
v ann                for each n   
m
m
v am
n      vp  an         vi  an         for each n    and m  n    

so  using the above equalities in the formulae giving vp  a  and vi  a   we define two sequences of tuples   a sequence  xk   k     of infinite tuples of even integers  and a sequence
 yk   k     of infinite tuples of odd integers
n
xk          vi  a k

 k                   vp  a k               

   

ficayrol  lagasquie schiex

from the results stated in property    it is easy to prove that vp  a    x  and for each k    
xk          xk       
similarly  vi  a    y  and for each k     yk          yk       
these equations enable to prove that  
for each even integer p p      p belongs to each tuple xi   i    
for each odd integer p  p belongs to each tuple yi   i    

the proof is done by induction on p 
so  v a    v b                                         
then  v c

and also
v d            
v ann               for each n   
as done in the treatment of example    the formulae giving vp  a  and vi  a  can be rewritten
in order to bring to light some interesting sequences of tuples

yk           vp  a k
 k                   vp  a k               
then  it is easy to prove that vp  a    x   and for each k     x k    x k       
 
    
similarly  vi  a    y   and for each k     yk           yk  

the first equation enables to prove that x   is the empty tuple    
the second equation has already been solved and produces y                      
so  v a                            for b  we can reason as for a  and we have v b

notation  in order to simplify the writing  we will not repeat the values inside the tuples
 we will just indicate under each value how many times it appears   for example

conclusion about cycles cycles are expensive since all the values obtained are infinite 
in appendix b  we introduce an algorithm for computing these tupled values  it uses a
process of value propagation and is parameterised by a maximum number of runs through
a cycle  this number will be used in order to stop the propagation mechanism and to
obtain finite  thus incomplete  tupled values 
      comparison of tupled values
in this section  we define the comparison relation between arguments  so  between some particular tupled values   using the following idea  an argument a is better than an argument
b iff a has a better defence  for it  and a lower attack  against it  
the first idea is to use a lexicographic ordering on the tuples  this lexicographic ordering
denoted by lex on t is defined by 
    the proof is the following  
x   contains only even integers 
for each k  x k      since x k is the result of the addition of a tuple and an integer 
if x   is not empty  let e  denote the least even integer present in x     as x     x       x   is not empty
and e  will denote the least integer present in x     we have e    e       so  we are able to build
a sequence of positive even integers e    e           which is strictly decreasing  that is impossible  so 
x        

   

ficayrol  lagasquie schiex

definition     lexicographic ordering on tuples 
let  x            xn          and  y            ym          be   finite or infinite tuples  t  
 x            xn           lex  y            ym          iff i    such that 
j   i  xj   yj and
yi exists and 
either the tuple  x            xn          is finite with a number of elements equal to i   
 so  xi does not exist  
or xi exists and xi   yi  
 x            xn           lex  y            ym          iff the tuples contain the same number p     
of elements and i     i  p  xi   yi  
so  we define   x            xn          lex  y            ym          iff
 x            xn           lex  y            ym          or  x            xn           lex  y            ym          
the ordering  lex is a generalisation of the classical lexicographic ordering  see xuong 
      to the case of infinite tuples  this ordering is complete but not well founded  there
exist infinite sequences which are strictly non increasing       lex         lex        lex
                       lex        lex         
since the even values and the odd values in the tupled value of an argument do not play
the same role  we cannot use a classical lexicographic comparison  so  we compare tupled
values in two steps 
the first step compares the number of attack branches and the number of defence
branches of each argument  so  we have two criteria  one for the defence and the other
for the attack   these criteria are aggregated using a cautious method  we conclude if
one of the arguments has more defence branches  it is better according to the defence
criterion  and less attack branches than the other argument  it is also better according
to the attack criterion   note that we conclude positively only when all the criteria
agree  if one of the arguments has more defence branches  it is better according to
the defence criterion  and more attack branches than the other argument  it is worse
according to the attack criterion   the arguments are considered to be incomparable 
else  the arguments have the same number of defence branches and the same number
of attack branches  and a second step compares the quality of the attacks and the
quality of the defences using the length of each branch  this comparison is made
with a lexicographic principle  see definition     and gives two criteria which are
again aggregated using a cautious method  in case of disagreement  the arguments
are considered to be incomparable 
let us consider some examples 
           is better than               because there are less attack branches in the first
tupled value than in the second tupled value  the numbers of defence branches being
the same  first step  
           is incomparable with                  because there are less defence branches
and less attack branches in the first tupled value than in the second tupled value  first
step  
   

figraduality in argumentation

           is better than            because there are weaker attack branches in the first
tupled value than in the second tupled value  the attack branch of the first tupled

the same  second step  using the lexicographic comparison applied on even parts then
on odd parts of the tupled values  
           is better than            because there are stronger defence branches in the
first tupled value than in the second tupled value  the defence branch is shorter in
the first tupled value than in the second tupled value   the attack branches being the
same  second step  
           is incomparable with            because there are worse attack branches and
better defence branches in the first tupled value than in the second tupled value

this argument

also a comparison of the local approaches and the global approach  the improvement
of the global approach proposed in this paper does not modify the main results of this

in the local approach  b   is better than b  since b   suffers one attack whereas b suffers
two attacks  
in the global approach  b is better than b    since it has at least a defence whereas b   has
none   in this case  c  loses its negative status of attacker  since it is in fact carrying a
defence for b

the difference between the local approaches and the global approach is also illustrated by
the following property 
property     independence of branches in the global approach 
let a be an argument having the following direct attackers 
a  whose value is v a        a p            a pm     a i            a im

this property illustrates the independence of branches during the computation of the
values in the global approach  even when these branches are not graphically independent

this property is not satisfied by the local approach since  using the underlying principles
of the local approach  see property     the value of the argument a must be at least as
good as  and sometimes better than     the value of the argument a   a having one direct
attacker  and a  having two direct attackers  
    conclusion about valuation step
we have proposed two different gradual valuation models and we are now able to make a
distinction between different arguments using the preordering associated with a valuation
model  these valuations will be used for the selection of the arguments  see section    

   graduality and acceptability
in this section  we now shift to the selection step and introduce graduality in the notion of
acceptability    
the basic idea is to select an argument depending on the non selection of its direct attackers 
following this idea  we propose two different methods 
the first method consists in refining the classical partition issued from dungs collective acceptability  this refinement may be achieved using the gradual valuations
defined in section   
the second method takes place in an individual acceptability and consists in defining
a new acceptability using only the gradual valuations defined in section   
    dungs        collective acceptability
in the framework of collective acceptability  we have to consider the acceptability of a set
of arguments  this acceptability is defined with respect to some properties and the sets
which satisfy these properties are called acceptable sets or extensions  an argument will be
said acceptable if and only if it belongs to an extension 
    with the valuation proposed by besnard and hunter         we obtain  v a       and v a

definition     basic properties of extensions following dung       
let  a  r  be an argumentation system  we have 
conflict free set a set e  a is conflict free if and only if   a  b  e such that arb 
collective defence consider e  a  a  a  e collectively defends a if and only if
b  a  if bra  c  e such that crb  e defends all its elements if and only if
a  e  e collectively defends a 
dung        defines several semantics for collective acceptability  mainly  the admissible
semantics  the preferred semantics and the stable semantics  with corresponding extensions 
the admissible sets  the preferred extensions and the stable extensions  
definition     some semantics and extensions following dung        let  a  r 
be an argumentation system 
admissible semantics  admissible set  a set e  a is admissible if and only if e is
conflict free and e defends all its elements 
preferred semantics  preferred extension  a set e  a is a preferred extension if
and only if e is maximal for set inclusion among the admissible sets 
stable semantics  stable extension  a set e  a is a stable extension if and only if e
is conflict free and e attacks each argument which does not belong to e  a  a   e 
b  e such that bra  
note that in all the above definitions  each attacker of a given argument is considered
separately  the direct attack as a whole is not considered   dung        proves that 
any admissible set of  a  r  is included in a preferred extension of  a  r  
there always exists at least one preferred extension of  a  r  
if  a  r  is well founded then there is only one preferred extension which is also the
only stable extension 
any stable extension is also a preferred extension  the converse is false  
there is not always a stable extension 
property    the set of leaves  i e   a r  a       is included in every preferred extension and in every stable extension 
    different levels of collective acceptability
under a given semantics  and following dung  the acceptability of an argument depends on
its membership to an extension under this semantics  we consider three possible cases     
    the terminology used in this section is also used in the domain of nonmonotonic reasoning  see pinkas
  loui         the word uni comes from the word universal which is a synonym of the word skeptical 
and the word exi comes from the word existential which is a synonym of the word credulous  we have
chosen to use the words uni and exi because they recall the logical quantificators   for all  and   exists
at least one  

   

figraduality in argumentation

the argument can be uni accepted  when it belongs to all the extensions of this semantics 
or the argument can be exi accepted  when it belongs to at least one extension of this
semantics 
or the argument can be not accepted when it does not belong to any extension of this
semantics 
however  these three levels seem insufficient  for example  what should be concluded in
the case of two arguments a and b which are exi accepted and such that arb or bra 
so  we introduce a new definition which takes into account the situation of the argument
w r t  its attackers  this refines the class of the exi accepted arguments under a given
semantics s 
definition     cleanly accepted argument  consider a  a  a is cleanly accepted
if and only if a belongs to at least one extension of s and b  a such that bra  b does
not belong to any extension of s 
thus  we capture the idea that an argument will be better accepted  if its attackers are
not accepted 
property    consider a  a and a semantics s such that each extension for s is conflictfree  if a is uni accepted then a is cleanly accepted  the converse is false 
the notion of cleanly accepted argument refines the class of the exi accepted arguments 
for a semantics s and an argument a  we have the following states 
a can be uni accepted  if a belongs to all the extensions for s  so  it will also be
cleanly accepted  
or a can be cleanly accepted  so  it is by definition also exi accepted   note that it is
possible that the argument is also uni accepted 
or a can be only exi accepted  if a is not cleanly accepted  but a is exi accepted 
or a is not accepted if a does not belong to any extension for s 
example   consider the following argumentation system 
there are two preferred extensions  d  c    a  g  and
j
 d  c    e  g  i   so  for the preferred semantics  the aci
ceptability
levels are the following 
e
a
g
h

d

f

c 

c 

d  c  and g are uni accepted 
i is cleanly accepted but not uni accepted 
a and e are only exi accepted 
b  c    f   h and j are not accepted 

note that  in all the cases where there is only one extension  the first three levels of acceptability coincide     this is the case 
    if there is only one extension then the fact that a belongs to all the extensions is equivalent to the
fact that a belongs to at least one extension  moreover  with only one extension containing a  all the
attackers of a do not belong to an extension  so  a is cleanly accepted

under the preferred semantics  when there is no even cycle  see doutre        
under the basic semantics  another semantics proposed by dung  see dung       
doutre        which is not presented here and which has only one extension  
looking more closely  we can prove the following result  proof in appendix a  
property    under the stable semantics  the class of the uni accepted arguments coincides
with the class of the cleanly accepted arguments 
then  using a result issued from the work of dunne and bench capon              and
reused by doutre        which shows that  when there is no odd cycle  all the preferred
extensions are stable     we apply property    and we obtain the following consequence 
consequence   under the preferred semantics  when there is no odd cycle  the class of
the uni accepted arguments coincides with the class of the cleanly accepted arguments 
finally  the exploitation of the gradual interaction based valuations  see section    allows
us to define new levels of collective acceptability 
let v be a gradual valuation and let  be the associated preordering  partial or complete 
on a  this preordering can be used inside each acceptability level  for example  the level of
the exi accepted arguments  in order to identify arguments which are better accepted than
others

valuation with tuples

with the global valuation with tuples presented in section      we obtain the following comparisons 
d  c   g  b  f  c 
d  c   a  e
d  c   h  e
d  c   i
d  c   j
so  all the arguments belonging to a cycle are incomparable with g  b  f   c   and  even
between them  there are few comparison results 
if we apply the preordering induced by a valuation without respecting the acceptability
levels defined in this section  counter intuitive situations may happen  in example    we
obtain 
with the valuation of besnard and hunter        and under the preferred semantics 
e  g despite the fact that g is uni accepted and e is only exi accepted 
with the valuation with tuples and under the preferred semantics  h  e despite the
fact that e is only exi accepted and h is not accepted 
these counter intuitive situations illustrate the difference between the acceptability definition and the valuation definitions  even if both use the interaction between arguments  they
do not use it in the same way  
   

ficayrol  lagasquie schiex

    towards a gradual individual acceptability
the individual acceptability is based on the comparison of an argument with its attackers 
the first proposal has been to select an argument if and only if it does not have any attacker
 see elvang goransson et al         
this has later been extended by amgoud and cayrol        where  using a preference
relation between arguments  an intrinsic valuation   an argument is accepted if and only if
it is preferred to each of its attackers 
following this proposal  we propose the same mechanism but with the interaction based
valuation 
given v a gradual valuation  the preordering induced by v can be directly used in order
to compare  from the acceptability point of view  an argument and its attackers      this
defines a new class of acceptable arguments  well defended arguments 
definition     well defended argument  consider a  a  a is well defended  for v 
if and only if b  a such that bra  b   a 
thus  we capture the idea that an argument will be better accepted if it is at least as good
as its direct attackers  or incomparable with them in the case of a partial ordering   the
set of well defended arguments will depend on the valuation used 
using this new notion  the set of the arguments is partitioned in three classes 
the first class contains the arguments which are not attacked 
the second class contains the arguments which are attacked but are well defended 
the third class contains the other arguments  attacked and not well defended  
note that the set of the well defended arguments corresponds to the union of the two first
classes  a further refinement uses the gradual valuation inside each of the classes as in
section     
in example   presented in section      the well defended arguments are 
d  c    g  h and a  a is incomparable with b but better than e  for the valuation
with tuples 
though with the valuation of besnard and hunter        the well defended arguments
are d  c    g  i and e  e is better than a  
note also that  as in the semantics of dung         definition    considers the attackers
one by one  it is not suitable for a valuation which handles the direct attack as a whole
 as the valuation of besnard and hunter         see the counterexamples presented in
section      
    this idea is also used in the notion of defeat proposed by bench capon         so  there is a link
between a well defended argument and an argument which is not attacked in the sense of benchcapon        by its direct attackers  note that  in the work of bench capon         the valuation is an
extra knowledge added in the argumentation framework  in contrast  here  the v preference is extracted
from the attack graph 

   

figraduality in argumentation

    compatibility between acceptability and gradual valuation
following the previous sections  the set of arguments can be partitioned in two different
ways 
first  given a semantics s and a gradual valuation v  it is possible to use the partition
issued from dung        which we have refined 
uni
accepted
cleanly
accepted

exi

onlyexi

not
accepted

refinement of each level with the gradual valuation v

second  given a gradual valuation v  it is possible to use the partition induced by the
notion of well defended arguments 
attaked but
not welldefended
arguments

attaked
arguments


















welldefended



for
the
valuation
v
















unattacked
arguments

a very natural and interesting question is  is it possible to find a semantics s and a gradual
valuation v such that the associated partitions have some compatibilities 
the following examples show that the class of the well defended arguments does not correspond to the class of the cleanly accepted arguments  in some cases  some uni accepted
arguments are even not well defended

      examples showing the non compatibility in the general case
we give examples for each usual valuation  the global valuation with tuples and   instances

      particular cases leading to compatibility
in the context of an argumentation system with a finite relation r without cycles      the
stable and the preferred semantics provide only one extension and the levels of uni accepted

in this context  there are at least two particular cases leading to compatibility 
first case  it deals with the global valuation with tuples 
theorem   let g be the graph associated with  a  r    a  r  being an argumentation
system with a finite relation r without cycles and satisfying the following condition  
a  a such that
xi   leaf of g   only one path from xi to a  xi          xili  a with xi    xi and
li the length of this path  if li is even  this path is a defence branch for a  else it is
an attack branch  
all the paths from xi to a are root dependent in a 
ai  a  xj a leaf of g such that ai belongs to a path from xj to a 
let v be a valuation with tuples  let s be a semantics   preferred  stable  
   b  a  b    a  b  exi  uni  cleanly  accepted for s iff b well defended for v 
   if a is  exi  uni  cleanly  accepted for s then a is well defended for v  the converse
is false  
   if a is well defended for v and if all the branches leading to a are defence branches
for a then a is  exi  uni  cleanly  accepted for s 
    so   a  r  is well founded

   conclusion
in this paper  we have introduced graduality in the two main related issues of argumentation
systems 
the valuation of the arguments 
the acceptability of the arguments 
regarding the first issue  we have defined two formalisms introducing an interaction based
gradual valuation of arguments 
first  a generic gradual valuation which covers existing proposals  for example besnard
  hunter       and jakobovits   vermeir         this approach is essentially local
since it computes the value of the argument only from the value of its direct attackers 
then  an approach based on a labelling which takes the form of a pair of tuples 
this labelling memorises the structure of the graph representing the interactions  the
attack graph   associating each branch with its length  number of the edges from
the leaf to the current node  in the attack graph  if the length of the branch is an even
integer  the branch is a defence branch for the current node  otherwise the branch is
an attack branch for the current node   this approach is said to be global since
it computes the value of the argument using the whole attack graph influencing the
argument 
we have shown that each of these valuations induces a preordering on the set of the arguments  and we have brought to light the main differences between these two approaches 
regarding the second issue  two distinct approaches have been proposed 
first  in the context of the collective acceptability of dung         three levels of
acceptability  uni accepted  exi accepted  not accepted  were already defined  more
graduality can be introduced in the collective acceptability using the notion of cleanlyaccepted arguments  those whose direct attackers are not accepted  
then  in the context of individual acceptability  using the previously defined gradual
valuations  the new notion of well defended arguments has been introduced  those
which are preferred to their direct attackers in the sense of a given gradual valuation
v  
the first concept induces a refinement of the level of exi accepted in two sublevels  cleanlyaccepted arguments and only exi accepted arguments   the gradual valuation allows graduality inside each level of this collective acceptability 
   

ficayrol  lagasquie schiex

the second concept induces two new levels of acceptability  well defended arguments and
not well defended arguments   the gradual valuation also allows graduality inside each
level of this individual acceptability 
regarding our initial purpose of introducing graduality in the definition of acceptability  we
have adopted a basic principle 
acceptability is strongly related to the interactions between arguments  represented
on the graph of interactions  
and an argument is all the more acceptable if it is preferred to its direct attackers 
then  we have followed two different directions  one is based on a refinement of an existing
partition and remains in the framework of dungs work  the other one is based on the
original concept of being well defended  and deserves further investigation  in particular
from a computational point of view

appendix a  the proofs
in this section  we give the proofs of all the properties presented in sections   and   
proof
 of property    by induction from vmin  g vmax     vmax and by applying
function g twice 


proof
 of property    the valuation function v associates each argument a with a
value v a  belonging to a set v which is a subset of a completely ordered set
w 


proof
 of property    let c   an  an          a   a  be a cycle 
if n is even  n    k and v a      g v a               g  k   v a k     
g  k  v a      so  v a    is a fixpoint of g  k   g n   it is the same for each ai  
   i   k 
however  the ai may have different values  for example  for n      with
the valuation of jakobovits and vermeir         v a        and v a      
with g       and g        if all the ai have the same value  then this
value will be a fixpoint of g  because v a      g v a       g v a      
   

figraduality in argumentation

if n is odd  n    k     and v a      g v a               g  k  v a k       
g  k    v a      so  v a    is a fixpoint of g  k     g n   it is the same for each
ai      i   k     
since the function g is non increasing  the function g  k   is also nonincreasing and we can apply the following result  if a non increasing function has fixpoints  these fixpoints are identical     so  v a             
v a k      but  v a      g v a       g v a      so v a    is a fixpoint of g 
so  for all the    i   k      v ai   is a fixpoint of g 

proof
 of property   
p  is satisfied because  a  a  if a has no direct attacker  r  a  is empty  
then v a    vmax and g vmax     vmax  
p  is satisfied because if r  a     a            an    h v a             v an    evaluates
the direct attack of a 
p  is satisfied because the function g is supposed to be non increasing 
p  is satisfied due to the properties of the function h 



proof
 of property    the valuation proposed by jakobovits and vermeir        is
the following 
let  a  r  be an argumentation system  a complete labelling of  a  r  is a
function et   a           such that 
   if et a         then b  r  a  such that et b         

   if et a          then b  r  a  or  r   a   et b        
moreover  jakobovits and vermeir        also define a complete rooted labelling
et with  a  a  if et a     then b  r  a  such that et b      

the translation of et into a local gradual valuation is very easy 

g is defined by g        g        g       and h is the function max 



proof
 of property    besnard and hunter        introduce the following function
cat  in the context of deductive arguments and for an acyclic graph  
if r  a      then cat a     
    proof  let g be a non increasing function  let  and  be two fixpoints of g  if       we may suppose
that      so g    g    since g is non increasing   so     since  and  are fixpoints of g   which
is in contradiction with the assumption

 of property     the principle p   is satisfied by definition    and by the
fact that          is the unique maximal element of v a   see property    
the principle p   is satisfied because of definition    
the principles p   and p   are satisfied  all the possible cases of improvement degradation of the defence attack for a given argument  see definition

of the case shows that the principle p    or p     depending on the applied case 
    we work case by case in order to avoid the complex cases in which we have several simultaneous simple
modifications  for example  the modification of the length of a branch which changes the status of the
branch  an even integer replaced by an odd integer  is a complex case corresponding to two simple cases 
the removal of a branch with a given status  then the addition of a new branch with a different status

is satisfied 



proof
 of property     from definition    



proof
 of property     first  we consider the case of the preferred extensions  let
e be a preferred extension  a  we assume that e does not contain all the
unattacked arguments of a  so  let a  a be an unattacked argument such
that a   e 
consider e   a  
if e   a  is conflict free then  with a an unattacked argument and e
a preferred extension  e   a  collectively defends itself  so e   a  is
admissible and e  e  a   this contradicts the fact that e is a preferred
extension 
if e   a  contains at least one conflict  then 

b  e such that bra  this is impossible since a is unattacked 
or b  e such that arb  but  since a is unattacked   c  e
such that cra  so  e does not collectively defend b  which is in
contradiction with the fact that e is a preferred extension 

so  the assumption e does not contain all the unattacked arguments of a
cannot hold 
now  we consider stable extensions  let e be a stable extension  a  we assume
that e does not contain all the unattacked arguments of a  so  let a  a be
an unattacked argument such that a   e 
since a   e there exists in e another argument b which attacks a  this is
impossible since a is unattacked 
so  the assumption e does not contain all the unattacked arguments of a
cannot hold 


proof
 of property     an argument and one of its direct attackers cannot belong
to the same extension in the sense of dung        because the extension must
be conflict free  so  since a is uni accepted  it means that a belongs to all the
extensions  and none of the direct attackers of a belongs to these extensions 
for the converse  we use the following counterexample in the case of the preferred
semantics

there are two preferred extensions
 k  h  g  and  a  e  k  h   the argument a is cleanly accepted  b and
c do not belong to any preferred extension  and a belongs to at least one
of the two extensions   but  a is not
uni accepted because it does not belong
to all preferred extensions 



proof
 of property     first  a uni accepted  a cleanly accepted is the result of
property    
conversely  let a be a cleanly accepted argument  there exists at least one stable extension e such that a  e and b  bra  b   e     e   stable extension 
using a reductio ad absurdum  we assume that there exists a stable extension
e    such that a   e      but  if a   e      it means that b  e    such that bra 
so  the direct attacker b of a belongs to a stable extension  so  there is a contradiction with the assumption  a is cleanly accepted   so  e    does not exist
and a is uni accepted 


proof
 of theorem   
   we consider the arguments b  a such that b    a  let xi be a leaf  the
path c  c xi   a  is xi          xili  a with xi    xi and li denoting the
length of the path  if li is even  this path is a defence branch for a  else it
is an attack branch  
the constraints from xi  to xili are the following 
xi   xi          xili  xili           xi   xi  if li odd   
or
xi   xi          xili    xili         xi   xi  if li even   
so  for the path xi          xili   the set of the well defended arguments is
 xi    xi            xili   if li is odd   xi    xi            xili     otherwise  this is the
set of all the arguments having a value strictly better than those of their
direct attackers   this set will denoted by accepi  
by definition  this set is conflict free  it defends all its elements  because it
contains only the leaf of the path and all the arguments which are defended
by this leaf  and it attacks all the other arguments of the path  if we try
   

figraduality in argumentation

to include another argument of the path x   xi            xili    accepi   we
obtain a conflict  because all the other arguments of the path are attacked
by the elements of accepi    so  for  xi            xili    accepi is the only
preferred and stable extension 
consider a    a    a   with r  being the restriction of r to a    and
union accep  i accepi   then union accep is the only preferred
and stable extension of  a    r    
so  b  a  b    a  b is accepted iff b well defended 

   now  consider a  if a is accepted then union accep  a  is the only
preferred and stable extension of  a  r   so  i  xili does not belong to
the extension  then  i  xili    xili   therefore  each branch leading to
a is a defence branch for a  so  i  v xili         li       so  v a   
  l    l            ln       then  i  v a   v xili    therefore  a is well defended 
using the following example  we show that the converse is false

a is well defended  a  b    a  b  and a is incomparable with a    but
not accepted 
   now  if a is well defended and all the branches leading to a are defence
branches for a  then union accep  a  is conflict free and a is defended
against each of its direct attackers  because xili    union accep for each
branch i   so  union accep  a  is the preferred and stable extension
of  a  r  and a is accepted 


proof
 of lemma    let  a  r  be an argumentation system with a finite relation
r without cycles  so  there is only one non empty preferred and stable extension
denoted by e   we know that 
if a is exi accepted and if a has a direct attacker denoted by b then b is
not accepted 
    r  is the restriction of r to a  if and only if r      a  b  arb  a  a    b  a

if b is not accepted then there exists at least one argument c such that
crb and c is exi accepted  because b does not belong to e and e is
stable  so c must  e   so  a fortiori  if b is not accepted and has only
one direct attacker c  then c will be exi accepted 
the proof is done by induction on the depth of a proof tree for a or c 
basic case for  i   a is exi accepted with only one direct attacker b  bra 
and c        cn are the direct attackers of b  so  we have a proof tree whose
depth is   for a and one of the unattacked ci   for example c    so 
v b    g h v c             v cn    
 g v c    

because h v c             v cn     h v c       v c   

and g is non increasing

 g vmax  

because v c      vmax

so 

v a    g v b  
 g    vmax  
but  property   says that g    vmax    g vmax    so v a   v b  
basic case for  ii   crb with c the only direct attacker of b  so  we have
a proof tree whose depth is   for c  i e  c is unattacked  so  v c    vmax
and v b    g vmax    v c   following definition    
general case for  i   a is exi accepted with only one direct attacker b
 bra  and c        cn are the direct attackers of b  with one of the ci exiaccepted  for example c    we consider the subgraph leading to c  to which
we add c  rbra  and we assume 
g v c      v c     induction assumption issued from  ii  
so 

v b    g h v c             v cn    
 g v c    
 v c   

for the same reasons as in the basic case
by induction assumption

 h v c             v cn   

property of h

and with the non increasing of g 

v a    g v b  
 g h v c             v cn       v b 
   

figraduality in argumentation

general case for  ii   b is not accepted  so c is exi accepted  we assume
that c has several direct attackers d        dp which are all not accepted
 because c is exi accepted   we consider each subgraph leading to di to
which we add di rcrb and we assume 
i           p  g v di     v di    induction assumption issued from  i  
so 
v c    g h v d             v dp    
 h v d             v dp   

application of the condition   
since the induction assumption
corresponds to the premise of   

so 
v b    g v c  
 g h v d             v dp       v c 

proof
 of theorem    assume that    is true and consider a  a which is exiaccepted  let bi   i           n  be the direct attackers of a  then  for all i  
        n  in the subgraph leading to bi and completed with bi ra  we apply the
lemma and we obtain  g v bi     v bi    i           n  thus  we have 
v a    g h v b             v bn    
 h v b             v bn   

 v bi    i           n

by applying   
property of h

so  a is well defended 
for the converse  let a  a be well defended  let b            bn be the direct
attackers of a and assume that a is not exi accepted  then  there exists at
least one direct attacker bi of a such that bi is exi accepted  because there is
only one preferred and stable extension   we can apply  ii  of the lemma on the
subgraph leading to bi completed with bi ra and we obtain g v bi     v bi   
so  there exists bi a direct attacker of a such that 

v a    g h v b             v bn    
 g v bi   

 v bi  

property of h and non increasing of g
using the lemma

this is in contradiction with a well defended  so  a is exi accepted 



appendix b  computation of tupled values
we propose an algorithm for computing the tupled values for an arbitrary graph  cyclic or
acyclic  the cycles may be isolated or not   this algorithm uses a principle of propagation
of values  an argument is evaluated when the values of its direct attackers are known 
we must consider the cycles as meta arguments which are evaluated when all the direct
attackers of the cycle  i e  the direct attackers of one of the elements of the cycle which
do not belong to the cycle  are evaluated 
the beginning of the process is as follows  we consider that all the arguments have the
initial value           and only the leaves of the graph are marked as having their final
values  thus  we have the following partition of the graph g 
gv   the part of the graph already evaluated  at the beginning  this part contains only
the leaves of the graph  
gv   the part of the graph which is not evaluated  at the beginning  this part contains
all the arguments of the graph g except the leaves  
the algorithm also relies on a special data structure denoted by l giving the list of the
cycles in the graph and their main characteristics 
list of the arguments which belong to this cycle 
list of the arguments which belong to this cycle and which have direct attackers outside
the cycle  these arguments are called inputs of the cycle  those which will be used in
order to propagate the values across the cycle in the case of a non isolated cycle   this
list will be empty in the case of an isolated cycle 
remark  for the sake of efficiency  the interconnected cycles  see definition    will be
considered as a whole by the algorithm and will be used like a meta cycle  for example 
the two cycles a  b  a and b  c  b which do not have any direct attacker outside
of the cycles  will be described in the data structure l as only one meta cycle with the
following lists 
a  b  c 
nothing  because it is an isolated meta cycle  
in order to avoid some ambiguity  these meta cycles are defined as mcycles 
definition     mcycle  let g be an attack graph  let cc be the set of all the cycles of
g  let cc    cc and cc      c            cn   be a set of cycles 
let acc   be the set   aj such that ci  cc   and aj  ci   
if cc   satisfies the following properties 
aj   ak  acc      a path from aj to ak such that each element  arguments or edges
between arguments  of the path belongs to cycles of cc    
and ck  cc   cc       ci  cc   such that ck is interconnected with ci  
   

figraduality in argumentation

then the union of the ci belonging to cc   is a mcycle 
thus  we make a partition of cc using the notion of interconnection between cycles  each
element of the partition being a different mcycle  see on the following example

algorithm   is the main algorithm used for computing the tupled values 
the function add node  respectively remove node  whose parameters are a subgraph
gx of the attack graph and a node s  adds  resp  removes  s in  resp  of  gx   the other
functions are described in  cayrol   lagasquie schiex      a  
algorithm   has been applied on an example after the step of rewriting  see figure     note
that in order to make the understanding of the results easier  we do not have created new
arguments  as in definitions    and      but of course  it would be necessary for a rigorous
formalization
