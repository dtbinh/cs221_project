abstract

we investigate the computational properties of the spatial algebra rcc   which is a restricted
version of the rcc framework for spatial reasoning  the satisfiability problem for rcc   is known
to be np complete but not much is known about its approximately four billion subclasses  we
provide a complete classification of satisfiability for all these subclasses into polynomial and npcomplete respectively  in the process  we identify all maximal tractable subalgebras which are four
in total 

   introduction

qualitative spatial reasoning has received a constantly increasing amount of interest in the literature 
the main reason for this is  probably  that spatial reasoning has proved to be applicable to realworld problems in  for example  geographical database systems  egenhofer        grigni  papadias 
  papadimitriou        and molecular biology  cui         in both these applications  the size of
the problem instances can be huge  so the complexity of problems and algorithms is a highly relevant
area to study  however  questions of computational complexity have not received so much attention
in the literature  two notable exceptions are the results reported by nebel        and renz and
nebel         in this article we take a small step towards a better understanding of complexity
issues in qualitative spatial reasoning 
a well known framework for qualitative spatial reasoning is the so called rcc approach  randell
  cohn        randell  cui    cohn         this approach is based on modelling qualitative spatial
relations between regions using first order logic  of special interest  from a complexity theoretic
standpoint  are the two subclasses rcc   and rcc    it is well known that both rcc   and
rcc   have quite weak expressive power  although they can be used to describe spatial situations 
they are very general and should perhaps better be described as topological algebras  however  we
will denote these algebras as spatial algebras in order to avoid terminological confusion  the term
topological algebra has a well established but completely different meaning in mathematics  mallios 
      
bennett        has shown the suciency of using propositional logics for reasoning about rcc  and rcc    hence  the reasoning becomes more ecient when compared to reasoning in a full
first order logic  bennett s approach uses classical propositional logic for rcc   and intuitionistic
propositional logic for rcc    unfortunately  these logics are known to be computationally hard 
the satisfiability problem for classical propositional logic and intuitionistic propositional logic is npcomplete  cook        and pspace complete  statman        respectively  however  the complexity
of the underlying logic does not carry over in both cases  renz and nebel        have shown that
the satisfiability problem for both rcc   and rcc   is np complete  the full proofs can be found
in  renz        
these findings motivate the search for tractable subclasses of rcc   and rcc    nebel       
showed that reasoning with the basic relations in rcc   is a polynomial time problem  renz and
nebel        improved this result substantially by showing the following results

 there exists a large  maximal subclass of rcc    denoted hb   which contains all basic relations
and is polynomial  hb  contains     elements out of           
 there exists a large  maximal subclass of rcc    denoted hb   which contains all basic relations
and is polynomial  hb  contains    elements out of           furthermore  this is the unique 
maximal subclass of rcc   containing all basic relations 

we will concentrate on rcc   in this article  the main result is a complete classification of all
subclasses of rcc   with respect to tractability  the classification makes it possible to determine
whether a given subclass is tractable or not by a simple test that can be carried out by hand or
automatically  we have thus gained a clear picture of the tractability borderline in rcc    as is
more or less necessary when showing results of this kind  the main proof relies on a case analysis
performed by a computer  the number of cases considered was roughly          the analysis cannot 
of course  be reproduced in a research paper or be verified manually  hence  we include a description
of the programs used  the programs are also available as an on line appendix to this article 
the structure of the article is as follows  section   defines rcc   and some auxiliary concepts 
section   contains the tractability proofs for three subclasses of rcc    in section   we show that
these subclasses together with hb  are the only maximal tractable subclasses of rcc    the article
concludes with a brief discussion of the results 

   the rcc   algebra

we follow bennett        in our definition of rcc    rcc   is based on the notions of regions and
binary relations on them  a region p is a variable interpreted over the non empty subsets of some
fixed set  it should be noted that we do not require the sets to be open sets in some topological
space  this is no limitation since it is impossible to distinguish interior points from boundary points
in rcc    thus we can take any set x and use the discrete topology t   hx    x i  where every
subset of x is an open set in t  
we assume that we have a fixed universe of variable names for regions  then  an r interpretation
is a function that maps region variables to the non empty subsets of some set 
given two interpreted regions  their relation can be described by exactly one of the elements of
the set b of five basic rcc   relations  the definition of these relations can be found in table   
figure   shows   dimensional examples of the relations in rcc    a formula of the form xby where
x and y are regions and b   b  is said to be satisfied by an r interpretation iff the interpretation
of the regions satisfies the relations specified in table   
to express indefinite information  unions of the basic relations are used  written as sets of basic
relations  leading to    binary rcc   relations  naturally  a set of basic relations is to be interpreted
as a disjunction of the basic relations  the set of all rcc   relations  b is denoted by r   relations
of special interest are the null relation    also denoted by    and the universal relation b  also
denoted    
a formula of the form x fb           b gy is called an rcc   formula  such a formula is satisfied
by an r interpretation   iff xb y is satisfied by   for some i     i  n  a finite set  of rcc  
formulae is said to be r satisfiable iff there exists an r interpretation   that satisfies every formula
of   such a satisfying r interpretation is called an r model of   given an r interpretation  
and a variable v  we write   v  to denote the value of v under the interpretation

figure    pictorial example of the relations in rcc   
we denote this problem by rsat  in the following  we often consider restricted versions of rsat
where the relations used in formulae in  are only from a subset s of r   in this case we say that 
is a set of formulae over s and we use a parameter in the problem description to denote the subclass
under consideration  e g   rsat s    note that an rsat problem instance can be represented by a
labelled directed graph  where the nodes are region variables and the arcs are labelled by relations
between variables  given an instance  of rsat  we say that such a graph is a graph representation
of  
we continue by defining an algebra over the rcc   relations 

definition     let b   fdr  po  pp  ppi  eqg  the rcc   algebra consists of the set r     b
and the operations unary converse  denoted by    binary intersection  denoted by    and binary
composition  denoted by    they are defined as follows 
 x  y  
xr y iff y rx
 x  y   x  r   s  y iff xry   xsy
 x  y   x  r  s  y iff  z    xrz   zsy  
if s is a subset of r    s is said to be a subalgebra of rcc  
s iff s is closed under converse  intersection
and composition  it can easily be verified that r  s   fb  b   jb   r  b     s g  i e   composition
 

 

is the union of the component wise composition of basic relations 
next  we introduce a closure operation  the closure operation transforms a given subclass of
r  to one that is polynomially equivalent to the original subclass with respect to satisfiability  the
operation is similar to the closure operation for rcc   introduced by renz        but it does not
pose the same restrictions on the given subclass   renz s operation requires feqg to be a member
of the subclass to be closed  

definition     let s  r   then we denote by s the closure of s   defined as the least subalgebra
containing s closed under converse  intersection and composition 
observe that a subset s of r  is a subalgebra iff s   s  

the next lemma is given without proof  a proof of the analogous result for allen s algebra can
be found in nebel and burckert        
   

fijonsson   drakengren

lemma     let s  r   then rsat s   can be polynomially transformed to rsat s   and vice
versa 

corollary     let s  r   rsat s   is polynomial iff rsat s   is polynomial  rsat s   is
np complete iff rsat s   is np complete 

   tractable subclasses of rcc  

we begin this section by defining four tractable subalgebras of rcc    which can be found in table   
later on  we show that these algebras are the only maximal tractable subalgebras of rcc    the
  
tractability of the first algebra  r  
    has been established by renz and nebel         the name r 
reects the fact that the algebra contains    elements 

theorem     rsat r  
    is polynomial 
the tractability of our second algebra  r  
    can be settled quite easily  the algorithm can be found
in figure   
  
lemma     let  be an instance of rsat r  
     the algorithm a accepts on input  iff  has

an r model 

proof  if  we show the contrapositive  i e   if a   rejects then  has no r model  clearly  the
satisfiability of  is preserved under the transformations made in lines       note that if xrx   
then eq   r if  is satisfiable  thus  is not satisfiable if the algorithm rejects in line    similarly 
 is not satisfiable if the algorithm rejects in line   

only if  consider the set  after the completion of line     we denote this set by     obviously   

is satisfiable if the initial  was satisfiable  also observe that line   ensures that   does not relate
any variables with eq  furthermore  line   guarantees that there is at most one relation that relates
two variables 
now  we construct an r model m for   as follows  let v be the set of variables in     let
m assign non empty sets that are pairwise disjoint to the members of v   let u   s   m  x   
introduce a set of values u     fff j x  y   v g satisfying the following 
x

v

x y

   ff   ff iff x   z and y   w   and
   for arbitrary x  y   v   ff    u  
x y

z w

x y

for each relation of the type x fpogy or x fpo  eqgy   extend the sets m  x   and m  y   with the
element ff  
clearly  two sets x  y are disjoint  and are thus related by dr  under m unless x fpogy or
x fpo  eqgy is in   but in these cases  x and y must not be disjoint  in fact  by introducing
ff   we have forced x fpogy to hold under m which satisfies formulae of the type x fpogy as well
as formulae of the type x fpo  eqgy   hence  m is an r model of   which implies the r satisfiability
of  
 
x y

x y

theorem     rsat r  
    is polynomial 
proof  algorithm a   correctly solves the rsat r  
    problem by the previous lemma  further 

more  the number of iterations is bounded from above by the number of variables and the number
of formulae in the given instance and the tests can easily be performed in polynomial time 
 
next we show the tractability of rsat r

theorem     rsat r  
    is polynomial 
proof  consider the algorithm a   in figure    if there exist x  y such that x  y    then 

is not satisfiable  otherwise  we can let all variables have the same value  since eq is a member of
every relation that occurs in   this interpretation is an r model of  
 

we continue by proving that rsat r  
    is a tractable problem  let
 
r    ffpp  eqgg   fr   fpp  ppig j r   r g 
 
using a machine assisted proof  it can be shown that r  
    r  so it is sucient to prove the
 
tractability of rsat r   by corollary      the program that we used for showing this is available
as an on line appendix to this article 
from now on  let  be an arbitrary instance of rsat r    and g   hv  e i be its graph representation  the following proofs are similar in spirit to some of the proofs appearing in drakengren and

     rsat r    and rsat r   

jonsson         the algorithm itself is reminiscent of an algorithm by van beek        for deciding
satisfiability in the point algebra 
definition     a rcc   relation r is said to be an acyclic relation iff any cycle in any g with r
on every arc is never satisfiable 
the relation pp is an example of an acyclic relation while fpp  eqg is not acyclic  we continue by
showing a few properties of acyclic relations 
proposition     let r be an acyclic relation  then every relation r   r is acyclic 
proof  since taking subsets of r constrains satisfiability further  the result follows 
 
proposition     let r be an acyclic relation  and choose a such that a  fr  j r   rg  then 
any cycle in g where every arc is labelled by some relation in a is unsatisfiable 
proof  same argument as in the previous proposition 
 
the following definition is needed in the following proofs 
definition     let i be an instance of the r satisfiability problem  m a model for i   and r   r 
a relation between two region variables x and y in i   then r is said to be satisfied as r  in m for
any relation r   r  such that xr  y is satisfied in m  
   

fia complete classification of tractability in rcc  

the definition may seem a bit cumbersome but the essence should be clear  as an example  let x
and y be region variables related by x fpo  ppgy   and m a model where x is interpreted as f    g
and y as f       g  then in m   fpo  ppg is satisfied as fppg  but also as fpo  ppg 
lemma     let r be an acyclic relation  and a  a  sets such that a  fr  j r   rg and a  
fa   feqg j a   ag  then  every cycle c labelled by relations in a   a  is satisfiable iff it contains
only relations from a    furthermore  all relations in the cycle have to be satisfied as eq 
proof  only if  suppose that a cycle c is satisfiable and that it contains some relation from
a  apply induction on the number n of arcs in the cycle  for n      we get a contradiction by
proposition      so  suppose for the induction that c contains n     arcs  let m be an r model
for the relations in c   it cannot be the case that every relation in c is satisfied in m as some
relation in a  by proposition      thus  some relation r  in c has to be satisfied as eq  but then
we can collapse the two variables connected by r  to one variable  and we have a cycle with n nodes
containing a relation from a  this contradicts the induction hypothesis 
if  suppose that a cycle c contains only relations in a    then c can be satisfied by choosing eq on
every arc  notice that the only if part implies that c must be satisfied by choosing eq on every arc 

 

hence  the variables are forced to be equal 

after having studied acyclic relations  we will now turn our attention to dag satisfying relations 
the formal definition is as follows 
definition      a basic relation b is said to be dag satisfying iff any dag  directed acyclic
graph  labelled only by relations containing b is satisfiable  i e   if the corresponding rsat problem
has a model 
a typical example of a dag satisfying relation is eq  given a dag labelled only by relations containing eq  we can always satisfy these relations by assigning some non empty set s to all variables 
we can now show that pp is a dag satisfying relation 
definition      let g be an arbitrary dag  a node v in g is said to be a terminal node iff there
are no arcs which start in v 
lemma      the basic relation pp is dag satisfying 
proof  let g be a dag labelled only by relations containing pp  we show that g is satisfied
by some r model m   induction on n which is the number of nodes in g  the case when n     is
trivial  suppose that g has n    nodes and remove a terminal node g  by induction  the remaining
graph g    hv     e  i is satisfiable by a model m   swe shall now construct a model m of g  which
agrees with m   on every variable in g   let s   fm   v  j v   v   g and let ff be an element not in
s   let m  g    s   fffg  obviously  m is a model of g 
 
we now state a simple result from drakengren and jonsson        
lemma      let g be irreexive  and have an acyclic subgraph d  then those arcs of g which
are not in d can be reoriented so that the resulting graph is acyclic 
by specializing this result  we get the next lemma 
lemma      let g be irreexive with an acyclic subgraph d and let the arcs of d be labelled by
relations containing pp  and the arcs not in d being labelled by relations containing pp and ppi 
then g is r satisfiable 
   a graph is irreexive iff it has no arcs from a node v to the node v 

   

fijonsson   drakengren

proof  reorient the arcs of g such that the resulting graph is acyclic  this is always possible by
the previous lemma  furthermore  whenever an arc is reoriented  also invert the relation on that
arc  so that g  is satisfiable iff g is  by this construction  only arcs containing both pp and ppi
have been reoriented  so every arc in the dag g  contains pp and  thus  since pp is dag satisfying
by lemma       g  is satisfiable  consequently  g is also satisfiable 
 
lemma      algorithm a  correctly solves rsat r    
proof  assume that the algorithm finds a strongly connected component of g   which then contains
only the relation fpp  eqg   containing two nodes that in g are connected by an arc e that is labelled
by a relation r  which does not contain eq  then there exists a cycle c in which the relation of
every arc contains eq  such that e connects two nodes in that c but e is not part of that cycle  by
lemma      c can be satisfied only by choosing the relation eq on every arc in c   and since r  does

not admit eq  c is unsatisfiable 
otherwise  every such strongly connected component can be collapsed to a single node  removing
all arcs which start and end in the collapsed node  this transformation retains satisfiability using the
same argument as above  after collapsing  the subgraph obtained by considering only arcs labelled
fpp  eqg will be acyclic  since the remaining arcs are labelled by relations containing both pp and
ppi  the graph is r satisfiable by lemma        note that the graph will be irreexive since every
node is contained in some strongly connected component  
 
lemma      given a graph g   hv  ei  algorithm a  runs in o jv j   jej  time 
proof  strongly connected components can be found in o jv j   jej  time  baase        and the
remaining test can also be made in o jv j   je j  time 
 
theorem      rsat r  
    can be solved in polynomial time 
  
 
proof  rsat r    is polynomial by the previous two lemmata  since r  
    r   rsat r    can
be solved in polynomial time by corollary     
 

   classification of rcc  

before we can give the classification of rcc   we need two np completeness results 
theorem     rsat s   is np complete if
    renz   nebel        c    ffpog  fpp  ppigg  s   or
   c    ffdr  pog  fpp  ppigg  s  
proof  the proof for c  is by polynomial time reduction from rsat c    let  be an arbitrary
instance of rsat c    construct the following set 
    fx fpp  ppigy j x fpp  ppigy   g   fx fdr  pogy j x fpogy   g 
clearly    can be obtained from  in polynomial time and   is an instance of rsat c    we show
that  is satisfiable iff   is satisfiable 
only if  assume that there exists an r model i of   it is not hard to see that i is also an r model

of i   since if x fpogy under i then x fdr  pogy under i   thus   is r satisfiable if  is r satisfiable 

if  assume the existence of an r model i   that assigns subsets of some set u to the region variables

of     let ff be an element such that ff    u   we construct a new interpretation i as follows 
i  x    i    x    fffg for every variable x in     it can easily be seen that the following holds for i

if xfdrgy under i   then xfpogy under i  
if xfpogy under i   then xfpogy under i  
if xfppgy under i   then xfppgy under i  
if xfppigy under i   then xfppigy under i  

it is easy to see that if xfpp  ppigy under i   then xfpp  ppigy under i   similarly  if xfdr  pogy under
i   then xfpogy under i   it follows that i is a model of  so  is r satisfiable if   is r satisfiable 
 
the main theorem can now be stated and proved

fr  
    r    r    r  g  and np complete otherwise 
proof  if  for each r   r   rsat r  is polynomial as was shown in the previous section 
only if  choose s  r  such that s is not a subset of any algebra in r   for each subalgebra
r   r   choose a relation x such that x   s and x    r  this can always be done since s   r  let
x be the set of these relations and note that x is not a subset of any algebra in r   the set r
contains four algebras so by the construction of x   jx j     observe that rsat s   is np complete
if rsat x   is np complete 
to show that rsat s   has to be np complete  a machine assisted case analysis of the following

   discussion

the main problem of reporting tractability results for restricted classes of problems is the diculty
of isolating interesting and relevant subclasses  the systematic approach of building complete classifications is a way of partially overcoming this problem  if the problem class under consideration
is regarded relevant  then its tractable subclasses should be regarded relevant if the computational
problem is of interest  this is especially true in spatial reasoning where the size of the problem instances can be extremely large  one good example is spatial reasoning in connection with the human
genome project  cui        
another advantage with complete classifications is that they are more satisfactory from a scientific
point of view  to gain a clear picture of the borderline between tractability and intractability has
an intrinsic scientific value  a common critique is that complete classifications tend to generate
certain classes which are totally useless  for instance  the subalgebra r  
  is certainly of no use 
it must be made clear that such critique is unjustified since the researcher who makes a complete
classification does not deliberately invent useless classes  instead  if useless classes appear in a
complete classification  they are unavoidable parts of the classification 
   

fijonsson   drakengren

the work reported in this article can be extended in many different ways  one obvious extension
is to study other computational problems than the rsat problem  renz        has studied two
problems  rmin and rent  on certain subclasses of rcc   and rcc    the rmin problem is to
decide if a set of spatial formulae  is minimal  i e   whether all basic relations in every formula of
 can be satisfied or not  the rent problem is to decide whether a formula xry is entailed by a
set of spatial formulae  grigni et al         study a stronger form of satisfiability which they refer
to as realizability  a finite set  of rcc   formulae is said to be realizable iff there exist regions
on the plane bounded by jordan curves which satisfy the relations in   grigni et al         have
shown that the realizability problem is much harder than the satisfiability problem  for instance 
deciding realizability of formulae constructed from the two relations dr and po is np complete while
the satisfiability problem is polynomial  certainly  further studies of the realizability problem would
be worthwhile 
another obvious research direction is to completely classify other spatial algebras  such as rcc   rcc   contains            relations so the question whether this is feasible or not remains to
be answered 

   conclusions

we have studied computational properties of rcc    all of the     possible subclasses are classified with respect to whether their corresponding satisfiability problem is tractable or not  the
classification reveals that there are four maximal tractable subclasses of the algebra
