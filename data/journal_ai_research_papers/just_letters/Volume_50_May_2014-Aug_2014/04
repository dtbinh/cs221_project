alignment quality  subsequently  default scheme generally recommended existing new
iterative alignment techniques seek utilize bcd

finally  demonstrated benefits bcd toward aligning pairs new biomedical ontology testbed  due large number ontologies biomedicine  critical need
ontology alignment vast domain  future work continue focus methods
would allow general principled alignment approaches falcon ao optima perform better testbed producing better quality alignment pairs less time
