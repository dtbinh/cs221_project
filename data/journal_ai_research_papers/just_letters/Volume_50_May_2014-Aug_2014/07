   introduction
two key issues creating sustainable energy efficient society increase penetration
renewable sources  manage supply demand reduce demand peaks
maintaining supply demand balance  one way  commonly used  achieve
demand supply balance supply requested demand whenever occurs  however 
attempting achieve demand supply balance adjusting supply side leads use
flexible  usually diesel operated  power plants expensive  inefficient  emit large
amount carbon  alternative adjusting supply side only  adjust demand
consumers  palensky   dietrich        via demand response programs  demand response
defined changes electricity consumption end users normal consumption
patterns response changes price electricity time  albadi   el saadany        
several different forms demand response programs developed  for overview
see albadi   el saadany         typical example incentive based program  customers receive payment participation  direct load control programs  utilities
remotely control power consumption consumers appliances switching on off 
small scale pilot studies  direct load control successful reducing peak energy consumption  however consumers uncomfortable yielding control appliances utility
companies  rahimi   ipakchi        medina  muller    roytelman         another type demand management program price based  energy rates variable follow real cost
electricity  objective indirect method control overall demand incentivizing consumers flatten demand curve shifting energy peak off peak times 
typical example programs time use pricing  price peak times
higher price off peak times  recent technological advances smart meters
smart appliances created potential enable direct real time participation individual
consumers energy market thus make real time price based demand management programs

theorem    general algorithm weakly incentive compatible 
proof  algorithm agents two possible ways deviate truthful reporting  first 
could report demand profile minimize individual cost according
current virtual price signals intent misreporting would benefit final
payment  second  could report marginal valuations differ true marginal valuations  analysis assume rational agents  i e   agents always prefer lower cost 
note payment rule  equation    agent pays electricity demand based
final price signal  iteration  truthful demand report minimizes agents cost given
price signal  therefore  agent report truthfully final price signal  i e   final
iteration  incur higher cost  furthermore  agents know whether given price
signal final price signal not  is  agents limited knowledge
know demand profiles agents constraints preferences  thus  manipulation
iteration may result higher cost truthful report  therefore  manipulation strategy
involving misreported demand profiles dominates truthful reporting 
regarding reporting marginal valuations  definition     obvious deflating
