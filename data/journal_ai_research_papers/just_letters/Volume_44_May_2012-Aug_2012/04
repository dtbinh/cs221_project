   selective max decision rule
many admissible heuristics proposed domain independent planning  vary
cheap compute yet accurate  accurate yet expensive compute  general 
accurate heuristic is  fewer states would expanded using it 
accuracy heuristic functions varies different planning tasks  even different states
task  may able produce robust optimal planner combining several admissible heuristics  presumably  heuristic accurate  is  provides higher estimates 
different regions search space  simplest best known way using point wise maximum heuristics use state  given n admissible heuristics 
h            hn   new heuristic  maxh   defined maxh  s     max in hi  s   easy see
maxh  s  hi  s  state heuristic hi   thus search using maxh expected
expand fewer states using individual heuristic phowever  denote time needed
compute hi ti   time needed compute maxh ni   ti  
mentioned previously  selective max form hyper heuristic  burke et al        
chooses heuristic compute state  view selective max decision rule dr 
given set heuristics h            hn state s  chooses heuristic compute
state  one natural candidate decision rule heuristic yields highest 
is  accurate  estimate 
drmax   h            hn    s     hargmax in hi  s   
using decision rule yields heuristic accurate maxh   still computing
one heuristic per state time targmax in hi  s   
analysis  however  take account different computation times different heuristics  instance  let h  h  pair admissible heuristics h  h   
priori  seems using h  always preferred using h  former
cause expand fewer states  however  suppose given planning task  expands     
states guided h      states guided h    computing h  state
takes    ms  computing h  state takes      ms  switching h  h  increases
overall search time  using maxh h  h  makes things worse  h  h   
thus computing maximum simply wastes time spent computing h    possible 
however  computing h  carefully chosen states  computing h  states 
would result expanding     states  reducing overall search time compared
running h   
example shows  even given knowledge heuristics estimates advance 
clear heuristic computed state objective minimize overall
search time  therefore  begin formulating decision rule choosing one two
heuristics  respect idealized state space model  selective max operates online

    decision rule without perfect knowledge
idealized model makes several assumptions  appear problematic
meet practice  examine assumptions closely  needed  suggest
pragmatic compromises 
first  model assumes search space forms tree single goal state 
heuristics question consistent  perfect tie breaking rule  although
first assumption hold planning tasks  second assumption satisfied
many state of the art heuristics  karpas   domshlak        helmert   domshlak        bonet
  helmert         third assumption realistic  prevent us using
decision rule suggested model 
idealized model assumes branching factor heuristic computation
times constant across search states  application decision rule planning
practice  deal assumption adopting average branching factor heuristic
computation times  estimated random sample search states 
finally  decision rule dropt requires unrealistic knowledge heuristic estimates 
well optimal plan cost c depth ls go state f   s    c  
obviously knowledge practice  must use approximation decision
rule 
first approximation make ignore trivial cases require knowledge c  
cases either surely expanded  h  enough prune s  instead  apply
reasoning complicated case states  resulting following decision rule 
 
h    ls logb   tt    
drapp    h    h     s    
 
h    ls   logb   tt

expand tree f  reaches c   order derive useful decision rule  assume ls
positive correlation h  s    h   s  h   s   is  h  h  close  ls low 
h  yields much lower estimate h    implying h  accurate s 
depth go f   s    c large  approximation uses simplest correlation
linear one h  s  ls   hyper parameter controlling slope 
recall idealized model  actions unit cost  thus cost to go depthto go same  however  planning tasks  notably  planning tasks     
international planning competition  feature non uniform action costs  therefore  decision rule
converts heuristic estimates cost to go heuristic estimates depth to go dividing

given b  t    t    c  quantity c logb  t   t    becomes fixed  follows denote

note linear correlation h  s  ls occurs simple cases  first
case h  value remains constant subtree rooted s  is  additive error
h  increases   level s  case  f  increases   expanded level

furthermore  empirical evidence support conclusion exponential
growth search effort function heuristic error  even assumptions made
model hold  particular  experiments helmert roger        ipc benchmarks
heuristics small constant additive errors show number expanded nodes
typically grows exponentially  still small additive  error increases 
finally  remark decision rule always chooses admissible heuristic 
resulting heuristic estimate always admissible  thus  even chosen heuristic
correct one according dropt   result loss optimality solution 
possible increase search time

last decision made choice classifier  although many classifiers used here 
several requirements must met due particular setup  first  training classification must fast  performed time constrained problem solving  second 
classifier must incremental support active learning  achieved allowing online
updates learned model  finally  classifier provide us meaningful measure
confidence predictions 
several classifiers meet requirements  found naive bayes classifier provide
good balance speed accuracy  one note naive bayes classifier
assumes strong conditional independence features  although fully
realistic assumption planning tasks  using sas  task formulation contrast classical
strips formulations helps lot  instead many highly dependent binary variables 
much smaller set less dependent ones 
although  empirical evaluation demonstrate  naive bayes appears

assumption independence features  typically accurate naive
bayes  however  added accuracy comes cost increased training classification time 
decision trees another popular type classifier allows even faster classification

   discussion
learning planning active field since early days planning  fikes  hart 
  nilsson         recently receiving growing attention community  however  despite
early work  rendell         relatively little work dealt learning state space search
guided distance estimating heuristics  one prominent approaches planning
days  works direction devoted learning macro actions  see  example 
finkelstein   markovitch        botea  enzenberger  muller    schaeffer        coles   smith 
       recently  learning heuristic search planning received attention  yoon et al 
       suggested learning  inadmissible  heuristic functions based upon features extracted
relaxed plans  arfaee  zilles  holte        attempted learn almost admissible heuristic
estimate using neural network  perhaps closely related work thayer 
dionne  ruml         learn correct errors heuristic estimates online  thayer et al  attempt improve accuracy single given heuristic  selective max attempts choose one
several given heuristics state  two works differ technically point  importantly  however  none aforementioned approaches guarantee resulting heuristic
admissible  thus optimal solution found  contrast  focus optimal planning  aware previous work deals learning optimal
heuristic search 
experimental evaluation demonstrates selective max effective method
combining arbitrary admissible heuristics baseline point wise maximization  advantageous selective maxs ability exploit pairs heuristics  one guaranteed always
least accurate other  example  hla heuristic used two action
cost partitioning schemes  uniform optimal  karpas   domshlak         heuristic induced
optimal action cost partitioning least accurate one induced uniform action
cost partitioning  takes much longer compute  selective max might used learn
worth spending extra time compute optimal cost partitioning  not 
contrast  max based combination two heuristics would simply waste time spent
computing uniform action cost partitioning 
controlled parametric experiments demonstrate right choice classifier
sampling method initial state space sample important  parameters
selective max appear affect performance much  long set reasonable
values  implies selective max could improved using faster  accurate  classifiers 
developing sampling methods represent state space well 
finally  remark fast downward autotune entry sequential optimal track
     edition international planning competition  used paramils  hutter  hoos 
leyton brown    stutzle        choose best configuration fast downward planner 
chose use selective max combine hlm cut hmax  bonet  loerincs    geffner
