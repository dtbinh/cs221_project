present section paper two main objectives  first  aims provide overview
different types approaches available comparison concepts ontologies and 
doing  identify foundations desired similarity measure may modeled 
taking account seven dimensions described previous study  calle et al         
secondly  aims select best way evaluate results yielded desired similarity
measure according studies regarding similarity metrics assessment 
basically two types methods exist comparison terms graph based ontology 
edge based methods using graph edges types data source node based methods
using graph nodes properties main data source  simplest intuitive
similarity measure  former method based mainly counting number edges
path two terms graph  rada  mili  bicknell   blettner         within edgebased method  two general approaches exist  firstly  distance approach selects either
shortest path average paths  when one path exists  secondly common

path approach calculates similarity directly length path lowest common
ancestor two terms root node  wu   palmer         past years 
variety edge based methods defined  resnik        leacock   chodorow        
edge based methods grounded two basic assumptions  firstly  nodes links
uniformly distributed ontology  is  terms depth
specificity  budanitsky        and  secondly  edges level ontology indicate
semantic distance terms  however  suppositions rarely true
majority ontologies  reason  several strategies proposed response
fact  one example strategy weighting edges according hierarchical
depth use node density link type  richardson  smeaton   murphy        
nevertheless  strategies solve aforementioned problems due fact terms
depth necessarily specificity edges level
necessarily represent semantic distance 
second  node based  method relies comparison properties terms
involved related terms themselves  ancestors descendants 
commonly used concept methods information content  ic   providing measure
specific informative term is  ic term c quantified negative
log likelihood  ic    log p c   p c  probability occurrence c specific
corpus  generally estimated annotation frequency  another approach employed
obtain ic based number children term ontological structure  seco 
veale   hayes         concept ic applied common ancestors two terms
order quantify information share and  thereby  measure semantic similarity 
way  two main approaches exist  first informative common ancestor  mica 
technique common ancestor highest ic considered  resnik        
second disjoint common ancestor  dca  technique disjoint common
ancestors considered  the common ancestors subsume common
ancestor   one definition  lin         similarity two concepts using node based
method expressed ratio amount information needed state

order evaluate performance proposed similarity measure  results

applied several studies similarity measures considered gold standard 
experimental phase  four training algorithms developed according different
perspectives  thus  phase included pair oriented  feature oriented  user oriented
hybrid experiment  every case  error rate calculated respect human subject
assessments  best results corresponded pair oriented method achieved error
rate        since implementation experiment realistic large ontologies 
feature oriented experiment required despite slightly worsening results previous
experiment  concretely  producing error rate        however  feature oriented
experiment big advantage able applied easily large ontologies 
moreover  user oriented training aimed adapt weights subject order
confirm assumption every test subject assigns value dimensions 
experiment highest error rate algorithms          demonstrated 
error rate follows decreasing trend line while  training done  error rate follows
asymptotic tendency  addition this  experiment shows slightly better results
taking account sort dimension  which average error rate      
maximum         reason  concluded user oriented experiment able
adapt individual judgment  although adaptation slow   finally  hybrid
experiment combines feature oriented user oriented training and  error rate
       nevertheless manages reduce error user oriented training  well
balancing error atypical cases common rest experiments

since hybrid experiment manages balance results experiments 
currently  improved hybrid algorithm developed  algorithm calculation
weights iteration affected depending error produced feature
experiment pair concepts corresponding iteration 
performance training methods proposed closely related available extent

quality completeness ontological knowledge  manual acquisition new
knowledge expert requires great deal resources would desirable develop
advanced mechanism learn new concepts relations  challenge attain
knowledge acquisition human like interaction human subjects  therefore 
lifetime system  knowledge bases would enriched interacting users 
finally  refinement similarities formulation interesting line work  especially
