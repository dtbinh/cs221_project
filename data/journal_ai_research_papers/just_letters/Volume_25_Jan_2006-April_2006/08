first sight  result may seem almost trivial  notion multilateral deal without

resources moved number agents  point view 
particularly surprising always reach optimal allocation  even single
step    furthermore  finding suitable deal complex task  may always
viable practice  crucial point theorem   sequence deals
result optimal allocation  is  whatever deals agreed early stages
negotiation  system never get stuck local optimum finding allocation
maximal social welfare remains option throughout  provided  course  agents
actually able identify deal theoretically possible   given restriction
deals individually rational agents involved  social welfare must increase
every single deal  therefore  negotiation always pays off  even stop early
due computational limitations

finegotiating socially optimal allocations resources

proof  given set agents set resources r  let    a  a       a 
deal system  need show collection utility functions
initial allocation necessary reach allocation maximal social
welfare  would case a  maximal social welfare  second highest
social welfare  initial allocation resources 
first prove existence collection functions case utility
functions required monotonic  fix             a   
must agent j a j     a   j   define utility functions ui
agents sets resources r r follows 

 r    r   a   i   r   a i     j

 r 
otherwise
observe ui monotonic utility function every a  get swu  a       r   a 
swu  a    swu  a         a  a    individually decomposable 
exists allocation b different a  either b i    a i  b i   
a   i  agents a  hence  swu  b  swu  a  allocation b 
is  a   unique  allocation maximal social welfare allocation
higher social welfare a  therefore  make initial allocation
   a  a    would deal increasing social welfare  lemma    means
would individually rational  and thereby possible  deal  hence 
indeed necessary achieve maximal utilitarian social welfare 
proof case dichotomous utility functions similar  need
show suitable collection dichotomous utility functions constructed  again 
let j agent a j     a   j   use following collection functions 

  r   a   i   r   a i     j 
ui  r   
  otherwise
get swu  a       a   swu  a    swu  a     swu  b  swu  a  allocations
b  hence  socially optimal and  initial allocation  would
deal individually rational 
 
stress set deals independently decomposable includes
deals involving number agents and or number resources  hence  theorem   
negotiation protocol puts restrictions structural complexity deals

section  going briefly consider two notions social preference
discuss context framework resource allocation negotiation  firstly 
going introduce idea elitist agent societies  social welfare tied
welfare agent currently best off  going discuss societies
envy free allocations resources desirable 
    elitist agent societies
earlier discussed maximin ordering induced egalitarian collective utility
function swe  see definition     ordering actually particular case class social
welfare orderings  sometimes called k rank dictators  moulin         particular
agent  the one corresponding kth element ordered utility vector  chosen
representative society  amongst class orderings  another particularly
interesting case welfare society evaluated basis happiest
agent  as opposed unhappiest agent  case egalitarian welfare   call
elitist approach measuring social welfare 
definition     elitist social welfare  elitist social welfare swel  a  allocation
resources defined follows 
swel  a    max ui  a    a 
elitist agent society  agents would cooperate order support champion  the
currently happiest agent   approach may seem somewhat unethical far
human society concerned  believe could indeed appropriate
certain societies artificial agents  applications  distributed multiagent system
may merely serve means helping single agent system achieve goal 
however  may always known advance agent likely achieve
goal therefore supported peers  typical scenario could
   

fiendriss  maudet  sadri    toni

system designer launches different agents goal  aim least one
agent achieves goal matter happens others  egalitarian agent
societies  contradict idea agents autonomous entities  agents may
physically distributed make autonomous decisions variety issues
whilst adhering certain social principles  case elitist ones 
technical point view  designing criterion would allow agents inhabiting elitist agent society decide locally whether accept particular deal
similar egalitarian case  analogy case equitable deals defined
earlier  suitable deal would increase maximal individual welfare amongst
agents involved one deal  egalitarian case  class deals
characterised local rationality criterion would exactly capture range deals
resulting increase elitist social welfare  because every agent system would
consulted first determine currently best off   prove convergence 
would resort auxiliary social welfare ordering  similarly use
leximin ordering proof theorem    
course  many cases much simpler way finding allocation
maximal elitist social welfare  instance  agents use monotonic utility functions 
moving resources agent assigning highest utility value full bundle
r would optimal elitist point view  generally  always find
elitist optimum checking whose utility function got highest peak  is 
highest possible elitist social welfare easily determined centralised manner 
distributed approach still provide useful framework studying process
actually reaching optimal allocation 
    reducing envy amongst agents
final example interesting approach measuring social welfare agent society
issue envy freeness  brams   taylor         particular allocation resources 
agent may envious another agent would prefer agents set resources
own  ideally  allocation envy free 
definition     envy freeness  allocation resources called envy free iff
ui  a i   ui  a j   agents i  j a 
egalitarian social welfare  related fair division resources amongst agents 
envy freeness desirable  though always achievable  societies self interested agents
cases agents collaborate longer period time 
case  agent believe ripped off  would incentive
leave coalition may disadvantageous agents society
whole  words  envy freeness plays important role respect stability
group  unfortunately  envy free allocations always exist  simple example would
system two agents single resource  valued them 
whichever agent holds single resource envied agent 
furthermore  aiming agreeing envy free allocation resources always
compatible with  say  negotiating pareto optimal outcomes  consider following example
two agents identical preferences alternative bundles resources 
   

finegotiating socially optimal allocations resources

u           
u    r        
u    r        
u    r    r        

u           
u    r        
u    r        
u    r    r        

example  either one two allocations one agent owns resources
none would envy free  as agent would prefer ones bundle
own   however  allocation would pareto optimal  hand 
allocation agent owns single resource would pareto optimal 
envy free  because agent holding r  would rather r    
stress envy defined sole basis agents private preferences 
i e  need take agents utility functions account  still  whether
agent envious depend resources holds  resources
could hold whether agents currently hold preferred bundle 
somewhat paradoxical situation makes envy freeness far less amenable methodology
notions social welfare discussed paper 
able measure different degrees envy  could  example  count number
agents envious given allocation  another option would compute
agent experiences envy difference ui  a i   ui  a j  
agent j envies most  sum differences would
provide indication degree overall envy  and thereby social welfare  
spirit egalitarianism  third option would identify degree envy society
degree envy experienced agent envious  lipton  markakis 
mossel    saberi         however  possible define local acceptability criterion
terms utility functions agents involved deal  and those 
indicates whether deal question would reduce envy according metric 
simple consequence fact deal may affect degree envy experienced
agent involved deal  because could lead one participating
agents ending bundle preferred non concerned agent question  

   conclusion
studied abstract negotiation framework members agent society
arrange multilateral deals exchange bundles indivisible resources  analysed
resulting changes resource distribution affect society respect different
social welfare orderings 
scenarios agents act rationally sense never accepting deal
would  even temporarily  decrease level welfare  seen systems
side payments possible guarantee outcomes maximal utilitarian social welfare 
systems without side payments allow  least  negotiation pareto optimal
allocations  considered two examples special domains restricted utility
functions  namely additive     scenarios  cases  able prove
convergence socially optimal allocation resources negotiation protocols
allow deals involving single resources pair agents  so called
  deals   case agent societies welfare measured terms egalitarian
collective utility function  put forward class equitable deals shown

negotiation processes agents use equitability acceptability criterion
converge towards optimal state  another result states that  relatively simple
    scenarios  lorenz optimal allocations achieved using one to one negotiation
implementing   deals either inequality reducing increase welfare
agents involved  discussed case elitist agent societies social
welfare tied welfare successful agent  finally  pointed
difficulties associated designing agents would able negotiate
allocations resources degree envy agents society minimal 
specifically  proved following technical results 
class individually rational deals   sufficient negotiate allocations
maximal utilitarian social welfare  theorem    
domains additive utility functions  class individually rational   deals
sufficient negotiate allocations maximal utilitarian social welfare  theorem    
class cooperatively rational deals sufficient negotiate pareto optimal allocations  theorem    
domains     utility functions  class cooperatively rational   deals
sufficient negotiate allocations maximal utilitarian social welfare  theorem    
class equitable deals sufficient negotiate allocations maximal egalitarian social welfare  theorem    
domains     utility functions  class simple pareto pigou dalton deals
 which   deals  sufficient negotiate lorenz optimal allocations  theorem    
three convergence results apply deals without structural restrictions
 rather   deals   proved corresponding necessity results  theorems      
    theorems show given deal  defined pair allocations 
independently decomposable may necessary able negotiate optimal allocation
resources  with respect chosen notion social welfare   deals required
conform rationality criterion question  consequence results 
negotiation protocol allow representation deals involving
number agents number resources could ever enable agents  whose behaviour
constrained various rationality criteria  negotiate socially optimal allocation
cases  rather surprisingly  three necessity results continue apply even
agents differentiate resource bundles would happy
would happy  using dichotomous utility functions   theorems  
  apply case agents required use monotonic utility functions 
natural question arises considering convergence results concerns
complexity negotiation framework  difficult agents agree deal
many deals required system converges optimal state  latter
questions recently addressed endriss maudet         paper
    recall individually rational deals may include monetary side payments
