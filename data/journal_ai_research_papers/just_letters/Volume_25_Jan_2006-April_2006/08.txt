abstract
a multiagent system may be thought of as an artificial society of autonomous software
agents and we can apply concepts borrowed from welfare economics and social choice theory
to assess the social welfare of such an agent society  in this paper  we study an abstract
negotiation framework where agents can agree on multilateral deals to exchange bundles
of indivisible resources  we then analyse how these deals affect social welfare for different
instances of the basic framework and different interpretations of the concept of social welfare
itself  in particular  we show how certain classes of deals are both sufficient and necessary
to guarantee that a socially optimal allocation of resources will be reached eventually 

   introduction
a multiagent system may be thought of as an artificial society of autonomous software
agents  negotiation over the distribution of resources  or tasks  amongst the agents inhabiting such a society is an important area of research in artificial intelligence and computer
science  rosenschein   zlotkin        kraus        chavez  moukas    maes        sandholm         a number of variants of this problem have been studied in the literature 
here we consider the case of an artificial society of agents where  to begin with  each agent
holds a bundle of indivisible resources to which it assigns a certain utility  agents may then
negotiate with each other in order to agree on the redistribution of some of these resources
to benefit either themselves or the agent society they inhabit 
rather than being concerned with specific strategies for negotiation  we analyse how the
redistribution of resources by means of negotiation affects the well being of the agent society
as a whole  to this end  we make use of formal tools for measuring social welfare developed
in welfare economics and social choice theory  moulin        arrow  sen    suzumura 
       in the multiagent systems literature  the utilitarian interpretation of the concept of
social welfare is usually taken for granted  rosenschein   zlotkin        sandholm       
wooldridge         i e  whatever increases the average welfare of the agents inhabiting a
society is taken to be beneficial for society as well  this is not the case in welfare economics

for instance  where different notions of social welfare are being studied and compared with
each other  here  the concept of egalitarian social welfare takes a particularly prominent
role  sen        rawls        moulin        arrow et al          in this model  social
welfare is tied to the individual welfare of the weakest member of society  which facilitates
the incorporation of a notion of fairness into the resource allocation process  while the
discussion of the respective advantages and drawbacks of different notions of social welfare
in the social sciences tends to be dominated by ethical considerations   in the context
of societies of artificial software agents the choice of a suitable formal tool for modelling
social welfare boils down to a clear cut  albeit not necessarily simple  technical design
decision  endriss   maudet         indeed  different applications may call for different
social criteria  for instance  for the application studied by lematre  verfaillie  and bataille
        where agents need to agree on the access to an earth observation satellite which has
been funded jointly by the owners of these agents  it is important that each one of them
receives a fair share of the common resource  here  a society governed by egalitarian
principles may be the most appropriate  in an electronic commerce application running on
the internet where agents have little or no commitments towards each other  on the other
hand  egalitarian principles seem of little relevance  in such a scenario  utilitarian social
welfare would provide an appropriate reflection of the overall profit generated  besides
utilitarian and egalitarian social welfare  we are also going to discuss notions such as pareto
and lorenz optimality  moulin         as well as envy freeness  brams   taylor        
in this paper  we study the effect that negotiation over resources has on society for a
number of different interpretations of the concept of social welfare  in particular  we show
how certain classes of deals regarding the exchange of resources allow us to guarantee that a
socially optimal allocation of resources will be reached eventually  these convergence results
may be interpreted as the emergence of a particular global behaviour  at the level of society 
in reaction to local behaviour governed by the negotiation strategies of individual agents
 which determine the kinds of deals agents are prepared to accept   the work described here
is complementary to the large body of literature on mechanism design and game theoretical
models of negotiation in multiagent systems  see e g  rosenschein   zlotkin        kraus 
      fatima  wooldridge    jennings         while such work is typically concerned with
negotiation at the local level  how can we design mechanisms that provide an incentive
to individual agents to adopt a certain negotiation strategy    we address negotiation at a
global level by analysing how the actions taken by agents locally affect the overall system
from a social point of view 
as we shall see  truly multilateral deals involving any number of agents as well as any
number of resources may be necessary to be able to negotiate socially optimal allocations
of resources  this is certainly true as long as we use arbitrary utility functions to model
the preferences of individual agents  in some application domains  however  where utility
functions may be assumed to be subject to certain restrictions  such as being additive   we
are able to obtain stronger results and show that also structurally simpler classes of deals
 in particular  deals involving only a single resource at a time  can be sufficient to negotiate
socially optimal allocations  nevertheless  for other seemingly strong restrictions on agents
   a famous example is rawls veil of ignorance  a thought experiment designed to establish what constitutes
a just society  rawls        

   

finegotiating socially optimal allocations of resources

utility functions  such as the restriction to dichotomous preferences  we are able to show
that no reduction in the structural complexity of negotiation is possible 
our approach to multiagent resource allocation is of a distributed nature  in general 
the allocation procedure used to find a suitable allocation of resources could be either centralised or distributed  in the centralised case  a single entity decides on the final allocation
of resources amongst agents  possibly after having elicited the agents preferences over alternative allocations  typical examples are combinatorial auctions  cramton  shoham   
steinberg         here the central entity is the auctioneer and the reporting of preferences
takes the form of bidding  in truly distributed approaches  on the other hand  allocations
emerge as the result of a sequence of local negotiation steps  both approaches have their
advantages and disadvantages  possibly the most important argument in favour of auctionbased mechanisms concerns the simplicity of the communication protocols required to implement such mechanisms  another reason for the popularity of centralised mechanisms is
the recent push in the design of powerful algorithms for combinatorial auctions that  for
the first time  perform reasonably well in practice  fujishima  leyton brown    shoham 
      sandholm         of course  such techniques are  in principle  also applicable in the
distributed case  but research in this area has not yet reached the same level of maturity
as for combinatorial auctions  an important argument against centralised approaches is
that it may be difficult to find an agent that could assume the role of an auctioneer  for
instance  in view of its computational capabilities or in view of its trustworthiness  
the line of research pursued in this paper has been inspired by sandholms work on
sufficient and necessary contract  i e  deal  types for distributed task allocation  sandholm 
       since then  it has been further developed by the present authors  their colleagues  and
others in the context of resource allocation problems  bouveret   lang        chevaleyre

  toni      a      b   in particular  we have extended sandholms framework by also
addressing negotiation systems without compensatory side payments  endriss et al       a  
as well as agent societies where the concept of social welfare is given a different interpretation
to that in the utilitarian programme  endriss et al       b  endriss   maudet         the
present paper provides a comprehensive overview of the most fundamental results  mostly on
the convergence to an optimal allocation with respect to different notions of social welfare 
in a very active and timely area of ongoing research 
the remainder of this paper is organised as follows  section   introduces the basic negotiation framework for resource reallocation we are going to consider  it gives definitions
for the central notions of allocation  deal  and utility  and it discusses possible restrictions
to the class of admissible deals  both structural and in terms of acceptability to individual
agents   section   also introduces the various concepts of a social preference we are going
to consider in this paper  subsequent sections analyse specific instances of the basic negotiation framework  characterised  in particular  by different criteria for the acceptability
of a proposed deal  with respect to specific notions of social welfare  in the first instance 
agents are assumed to be rational  and myopic  in the sense of never accepting a deal
that would result in a negative payoff  section   analyses the first variant of this model
of rational negotiation  which allows for monetary side payments to increase the range of
   

fiendriss  maudet  sadri    toni

acceptable deals  as we shall see  this model facilitates negotiation processes that maximise
utilitarian social welfare  if side payments are not possible  we cannot guarantee outcomes
with maximal social welfare  but it is still possible to negotiate pareto optimal allocations 
this variant of the rational model is studied in section    both section   and   also investigate how restrictions to the range of utility functions agents may use to model their
preferences can affect such convergence results 
in the second part of the paper we apply our methodology to agent societies where the
concept of social welfare is given a different kind of interpretation than is commonly the
case in the multiagent systems literature  firstly  in section   we analyse our framework
of resource allocation by negotiation in the context of egalitarian agent societies  then
section   discusses a variant of the framework that combines ideas from both the utilitarian
and the egalitarian programme and enables agents to negotiate lorenz optimal allocations
of resources  finally  section   introduces the idea of using an elitist model of social welfare
for applications where societies of agents are merely a means of enabling at least one agent
to achieve their goal  this section also reviews the concept of envy freeness and discusses
ways of measuring different degrees of envy 
section   summarises our results and concludes with a brief discussion of the concept of
welfare engineering  i e  with the idea of choosing tailor made definitions of social welfare
for different applications and designing agents behaviour profiles accordingly 

   preliminaries
the basic scenario of resource allocation by negotiation studied in this paper is that of an
artificial society inhabited by a number of agents  each of which initially holds a certain
number of resources  these agents will typically ascribe different values  utilities  to different bundles of resources  they may then engage in negotiation and agree on the reallocation
of some of the resources  for example  in order to improve their respective individual welfare
 i e  to increase their utility   furthermore  we assume that it is in the interest of the system
designer that these distributed negotiation processes somehow also result in a positive
payoff for society as a whole 
    basic definitions
an instance of our abstract negotiation framework consists of a finite set of  at least two 
agents a and a finite set of resources r  resources are indivisible and non sharable  an
allocation of resources is a partitioning of r amongst the agents in a 
definition    allocations  an allocation of s
resources is a function a from a to subsets
of r such that a i   a j        for i    j and ia a i    r 
for example  given an allocation a with a i     r    r     agent i would own resources r  and
r    given a particular allocation of resources  agents may agree on a  multilateral  deal to
exchange some of the resources they currently hold  in the most general case  any numbers
of agents and resources could be involved in a single deal  from an abstract point of view 
a deal takes us from one allocation of resources to the next  that is  we may characterise
a deal as a pair of allocations 
   

finegotiating socially optimal allocations of resources

definition    deals  a deal is a pair     a  a    where a and a  are allocations of
resources with a    a   
the set of agents involved in a deal     a  a    is given by a    i  a   a i     a   i   
the composition of two deals is defined as follows  if      a  a    and      a    a      then
        a  a      if a given deal is the composition of two deals that concern disjoint sets
of agents  then that deal is said to be independently decomposable 
definition    independently decomposable deals  a deal  is called independently
decomposable iff there exist deals   and   such that         and a   a        
observe that if     a  a    is independently decomposable then there exists an intermediate
allocation b different from both a and a  such that the intersection of  i  a   a i     b i  
and  i  a   b i     a   i   is empty  i e  such that the union of  i  a   a i    b i   and
 i  a   b i    a   i   is the full set of agents a  hence      a  a    not being independently
decomposable implies that there exists no allocation b different from both a and a  such
that either b i    a i  or b i    a   i  for all agents i  a  we are going to use this fact in
the proofs of our necessity theorems later on  
the value an agent i  a ascribes to a particular set of resources r will be modelled by
means of a utility function  that is  a function from sets of resources to real numbers  we
are going to consider both general utility functions  without any restrictions  and several
more specific classes of functions 
definition    utility functions  every agent i  a is equipped with a utility function
ui    r  r  we are going to consider the following restricted classes of utility functions 
 ui is non negative iff ui  r     for all r  r 
 ui is positive iff it is non negative and ui  r       for all r  r with r        
 ui is monotonic iff r   r  implies ui  r     ui  r    for all r    r   r 
p
 ui is additive iff ui  r    rr ui   r   for all r  r 
 ui is a     function iff it is additive and ui   r       or ui   r       for all r  r 
 ui is dichotomous iff ui  r      or ui  r      for all r  r 
recall that  given an allocation a  the set a i  is the bundle of resources held by agent i
in that situation  we are usually going to abbreviate ui  a    ui  a i   for the utility value
assigned by agent i to that bundle 
    deal types and rationality criteria
in this paper we investigate what kinds of negotiation outcomes agents can achieve by using
different classes of deals  a class of deals may be characterised by both structural constraints
 number of agents and resources involved  etc   and rationality constraints  relating to the
changes in utility experienced by the agents involved  
following sandholm         we can distinguish a number of structurally different types
of deals  the most basic are   deals  where a single item is passed from one agent to another 
   

fiendriss  maudet  sadri    toni

definition      deals  a   deal is a deal involving the reallocation of exactly one resource 
this corresponds to the classical form of a contract typically found in the contract net
protocol  smith         deals where one agent passes a set of resources on to another
agent are called cluster deals  deals where one agent gives a single item to another agent
who returns another single item are called swap deals  sometimes it can also be necessary
to exchange resources between more than just two agents  in sandholms terminology  a
multiagent deal is a deal that could involve any number of agents  where each agent passes
at most one resource to each of the other agents taking part  finally  deals that combine the
features of the cluster and the multiagent deal type are called combined deals by sandholm 
these could involve any number of agents and any number of resources  therefore  every
deal   in the sense of definition    is a combined deal  in the remainder of this paper  when
speaking about deals without further specifying their type  we are always going to refer to
combined deals  without any structural restrictions   
an agent may or may not find a particular deal  acceptable  whether or not an agent
will accept a given deal depends on the rationality criterion it applies when evaluating deals 
a selfish agent i may  for instance  only accept deals     a  a    that strictly improve its
personal welfare  ui  a    ui  a     we call criteria such as this  which only depend on
the utilities of the agent in question  personal rationality criteria  while we do not want
to admit arbitrary rationality criteria  the classes of deals that can be characterised using
personal rationality criteria alone is somewhat too narrow for our purposes  instead  we are
going to consider rationality criteria that are local in the sense of only depending on the
utility levels of the agents involved in the deal concerned 
definition    local rationality criteria  a class  of deals is said to be characterised
by a local rationality criterion iff it is possible to define a predicate  over  arr such
that a deal     a  a    belongs to  iff    i  ui  a   ui  a       i  a    holds true 
that is   is mapping a set of triples of one agent name and two reals  utilities  each to
truth values  the locality aspect comes in by only applying  to the set of triples for
those agents whose bundle changes with   therefore  for instance  the class of all deals
that increase the utility of the previously poorest agent is not characterisable by a local
rationality criterion  because this condition can only be checked by inspecting the utilities
of all the agents in the system  
    socially optimal allocations of resources
as already mentioned in the introduction  we may think of a multiagent system as a society
of autonomous software agents  while agents make their local decisions on what deals to
propose and to accept  we can also analyse the system from a global or societal point of
view and may thus prefer certain allocations of resources over others  to this end  welfare
economics provides formal tools to assess how the distribution of resources amongst the
members of a society affects the well being of society as a whole  sen        moulin       
arrow et al         
   the ontology of deal types discussed here is  of course  not exhaustive  it would  for instance  also be of
interest to consider the class of bilateral deals  involving exactly two agents but any number of items  

   

finegotiating socially optimal allocations of resources

given the preference profiles of the individual agents in a society  which  in our framework  are represented by means of their utility functions   a social welfare ordering over
alternative allocations of resources formalises the notion of a societys preferences  next we
are going to formally introduce the most important social welfare orderings considered in
this paper  some additional concepts of social welfare are discussed towards the end of the
paper   in some cases  social welfare is best defined in terms of a collective utility function 
one such example is the notion of utilitarian social welfare 
definition    utilitarian social welfare  the utilitarian social welfare swu  a  of an
allocation of resources a is defined as follows 
x
swu  a   
ui  a 
ia

observe that maximising the collective utility function swu amounts to maximising the
average utility enjoyed by the agents in the system  asking for maximal utilitarian social
welfare is a very strong requirement  a somewhat weaker concept is that of pareto optimality  an allocation is pareto optimal iff there is no other allocation with higher utilitarian
social welfare that would be no worse for any of of the agents in the system  i e  that would
be strictly better for at least one agent without being worse for any of the others  
definition    pareto optimality  an allocation a is called pareto optimal iff there is
no allocation a  such that swu  a    swu  a    and ui  a   ui  a    for all i  a 
the first goal of an egalitarian society should be to increase the welfare of its weakest
member  rawls        sen         in other words  we can measure the social welfare of
such a society by measuring the welfare of the agent that is currently worst off 
definition    egalitarian social welfare  the egalitarian social welfare swe  a  of an
allocation of resources a is defined as follows 
swe  a    min ui  a    i  a 
the egalitarian collective utility function swe gives rise to a social welfare ordering over
alternative allocations of resources  a  is strictly preferred over a iff swe  a    swe  a     this
ordering is sometimes called the maximin ordering  the maximin ordering only takes into
account the welfare of the currently weakest agent  but is insensitive to utility fluctuations
in the rest of society  to allow for a finer distinction of the social welfare of different
allocations we introduce the so called leximin ordering 
for a society with n agents  let  u            un   be the set of utility functions for that
society  then every allocation a determines a utility vector hu   a           un  a i of length n 
if we rearrange the elements of that vector in increasing order we obtain the ordered utility
vector for allocation a  which we are going to denote by  u a   the number  ui  a  is the ith
element in such a vector  for    i   a    that is   u   a  for instance  is the utility value
assigned to allocation a by the currently weakest agent  we now declare a lexicographic
ordering over vectors of real numbers  such as  u a   in the usual way   x lexicographically
precedes  y iff  x is a  proper  prefix of  y or  x and  y share a common  proper  prefix of length
k  which may be    and we have  xk      yk    
   

fiendriss  maudet  sadri    toni

definition     leximin ordering  the leximin ordering  over alternative allocations
of resources is defined as follows 
a  a 

 u a  lexicographically precedes  u a   

iff

we write a  a  iff either a  a  or  u a     u a     an allocation of resources a is called
leximin maximal iff there is no other allocation a  such that a  a   
finally  we introduce the concept of lorenz domination  a social welfare ordering that
combines utilitarian and egalitarian aspects of social welfare  the basic idea is to endorse
deals that result in an improvement with respect to utilitarian welfare without causing a
loss in egalitarian welfare  and vice versa 
definition     lorenz domination  let a and a  be allocations for a society with n
agents  then a is lorenz dominated by a  iff
k
x

 ui  a  

i  

k
x

 ui  a   

i  

for all k with    k  n and  furthermore  that inequality is strict for at least one k 
for any k with    k  n  the sum referred to in the above definition is the sum of the
utility values assigned to the respective allocation of resources by the k weakest agents  for
k      this sum is equivalent to the egalitarian social welfare for that allocation  for k   n 
it is equivalent to the utilitarian social welfare  an allocation of resources is called lorenz
optimal iff it is not lorenz dominated by any other allocation 
we illustrate some of the above social welfare concepts  and the use of ordered utility
vectors  by means of an example  consider a society with three agents and two resources 
with the agents utility functions given by the following table 
u           
u    r        
u    r        
u    r    r        

u           
u    r        
u    r        
u    r    r         

u           
u    r        
u    r        
u    r    r        

first of all  we observe that the egalitarian social welfare will be   for any possible allocation
in this scenario  because at least one of the agents would not get any resources at all  let
a be the allocation where agent   holds the full bundle of resources  observe that this is
the allocation with maximal utilitarian social welfare  the corresponding utility vector is
h        i  i e   u a    h        i  furthermore  let a  be the allocation where agent   gets
r    agent   gets r    and agent   has to be content with the empty bundle  now we get an
ordered utility vector of h       i  the initial element in either vector is    but        i e 
 u a  lexicographically precedes  u a     hence  we get a  a    i e  a  would be the socially
preferred allocation with respect to the leximin ordering  furthermore  both a and a  are
pareto optimal and neither is lorenz dominated by the other  starting from allocation a   
agents   and   swapping their respective bundles would result in an allocation with the
ordered utility vector h       i  i e  this move would result in a lorenz improvement 
   

finegotiating socially optimal allocations of resources

   rational negotiation with side payments
in this section  we are going to discuss a first instance of the general framework of resource
allocation by negotiation set out earlier  this particular variant  which we shall refer to as
the model of rational negotiation with side payments  or simply with money   is equivalent
to a framework put forward by sandholm where agents negotiate in order to reallocate
tasks  sandholm         for this variant of the framework  our aim will be to negotiate
allocations with maximal utilitarian social welfare 
    individual rationality
in this instance of our negotiation framework  a deal may be accompanied by a number
of monetary side payments to compensate some of the agents involved for accepting a loss
in utility  rather than specifying for each pair of agents how much money the former is
supposed to pay to the latter  we simply say how much money each agent either pays out
or receives  this can be modelled by using what we call a payment function 
definition     payment functions  a payment function is a function p from a to real
numbers satisfying the following condition 
x
p i     
ia

here  p i      means that agent i pays the amount of p i   while p i      means that it
receives the amount of p i   by definition of a payment function  the sum of all payments
is    i e  the overall amount of money present in the system does not change  
in the rational negotiation model  agents are self interested in the sense of only proposing or accepting deals that strictly increase their own welfare  for a justification of this
approach we refer to sandholm         this myopic notion of individual rationality may
be formalised as follows 
definition     individual rationality  a deal     a  a    is called individually rational
iff there exists a payment function p such that ui  a     ui  a    p i  for all i  a  except
possibly p i      for agents i with a i    a   i  
that is  agent i will be prepared to accept the deal  iff it has to pay less than its gain in
utility or it will get paid more than its loss in utility  respectively  only for agents i not
affected by the deal  i e  in case a i    a   i   there may be no payment at all  for example 
if ui  a      and ui  a         then the utility of agent i would be reduced by   units if it were
to accept the deal     a  a     agent i will only agree to this deal if it is accompanied by
a side payment of more than   units  that is  if the payment function p satisfies     p i  
for any given deal  there will usually be a range of possible side payments  how agents
manage to agree on a particular one is not a matter of consideration at the abstract level
at which we are discussing this framework here  we assume that a deal will go ahead
as long as there exists some suitable payment function p  we should point out that this
   as the overall amount of money present in the system stays constant throughout the negotiation process 
it makes sense not to take it into account for the evaluation of social welfare 

   

fiendriss  maudet  sadri    toni

assumption may not be justified under all circumstances  for instance  if utility functions
are not publicly known and agents are risk takers  then a potential deal may not be identified
as such  because some of the agents may understate their interest in that deal in order to
maximise their expected payoff  myerson   satterthwaite         therefore  the theoretical
results on the reachability of socially optimal allocations reported below will only apply
under the assumption that such strategic considerations will not prevent agents from making
mutually beneficial deals 
    an example
as an example  consider a system with two agents  agent   and agent    and a set of two
resources r    r    r     the following table specifies the values of the utility functions u 
and u  for every subset of  r    r    
u           
u    r        
u    r        
u    r    r        

u           
u    r        
u    r        
u    r    r        

also suppose agent   initially holds the full set of resources  r    r    and agent   does not
own any resources to begin with 
the utilitarian social welfare for this initial allocation is    but it could be    namely if
agent   had both resources  as we are going to see next  the simple class of   deals alone are
not always sufficient to guarantee the optimal outcome of a negotiation process  if agents
abide to the individual rationality criterion for the acceptability of a deal   in our example 
the only possible   deals would be to pass either r  or r  from agent   to agent    in either
case  the loss in utility incurred by agent      or    respectively  would outweigh the gain
of agent      for either deal   so there is no payment function that would make these deals
individually rational  the cluster deal of passing  r    r    from agent   to    on the other
hand  would be individually rational if agent   paid agent   an amount of  say      units 
similarly to the example above  we can also construct scenarios where swap deals or
multiagent deals are necessary  i e  where cluster deals alone would not be sufficient to
guarantee maximal social welfare   this also follows from theorem    which we are going
to present later on in this section  several concrete examples are given by sandholm        
    linking individual rationality and social welfare
the following result  first stated in this form by endriss et al       a   says that a deal  with
money  is individually rational iff it increases utilitarian social welfare  we are mainly going
to use this lemma to give a simple proof of sandholms main result on sufficient contract
types  sandholm         but it has also found useful applications in its own right  dunne
et al         dunne        endriss   maudet        
lemma    individually rational deals and utilitarian social welfare  a deal   
 a  a    is individually rational iff swu  a    swu  a    
   

finegotiating socially optimal allocations of resources

proof    by definition      a  a    is individually rational iff there exists a payment
function p such that ui  a     ui  a    p i  holds for all i  a  except possibly p i      in
case a i    a   i   if we add up the inequations for all agents i  a we get 
x

 ui  a     ui  a    

ia

x

p i 

ia

by definition of a payment function  the righthand side equates to   while  by definition of
utilitarian social welfare  the lefthand side equals swu  a     swu  a   hence  we really get
swu  a    swu  a    as claimed 
  now let swu  a    swu  a     we have to show that     a  a    is an individually
rational deal  we are done if we can prove that there exists a payment function p such that
ui  a     ui  a    p i  for all i  a  we define the function p   a  r as follows 
p i    ui  a     ui  a  

swu  a     swu  a 
 a 

 for i  a 

p
first  observe that p really is a payment function  because we get ia p i       we also
get ui  a     ui  a    p i  for all i  a  because we have swu  a     swu  a         hence  
must indeed be an individually rational deal 
 
lemma   suggests that the function swu does indeed provide an appropriate measure of
social well being in societies of agents that use the notion of individual rationality  as given
by definition     to guide their behaviour during negotiation  it also shows that individual
rationality is indeed a local rationality criterion in the sense of definition   
    maximising utilitarian social welfare
our next aim is to show that any sequence of deals in the rational negotiation model
with side payments will converge to an allocation with maximal utilitarian social welfare 
that is  the class of individually rational deals  as given by definition     is sufficient to
guarantee optimal outcomes for agent societies measuring welfare according to the utilitarian
programme  definition     this has originally been shown by sandholm        in the
context of a framework where rational agents negotiate in order to reallocate tasks and
where the global aim is to minimise the overall costs of carrying out these tasks 
theorem    maximal utilitarian social welfare  any sequence of individually rational deals will eventually result in an allocation with maximal utilitarian social welfare 
proof  given that both the set of agents a as well as the set of resources r are required
to be finite  there can be only a finite number of distinct allocations of resources  furthermore  by lemma    any individually rational deal will strictly increase utilitarian social
welfare  hence  negotiation must terminate after a finite number of deals  for the sake
of contradiction  assume that the terminal allocation a does not have maximal utilitarian
social welfare  i e  there exists another allocation a  with swu  a    swu  a     but then  by
lemma    the deal     a  a    would be individually rational and thereby possible  which
contradicts our earlier assumption of a being a terminal allocation

at first sight  this result may seem almost trivial  the notion of a multilateral deal without
any structural restrictions is a very powerful one  a single such deal allows for any number
of resources to be moved between any number of agents  from this point of view  it is not
particularly surprising that we can always reach an optimal allocation  even in just a single
step    furthermore  finding a suitable deal is a very complex task  which may not always
be viable in practice  the crucial point of theorem   is that any sequence of deals will
result in an optimal allocation  that is  whatever deals are agreed on in the early stages of
negotiation  the system will never get stuck in a local optimum and finding an allocation
with maximal social welfare remains an option throughout  provided  of course  that agents
are actually able to identify any deal that is theoretically possible   given the restriction to
deals that are individually rational for all the agents involved  social welfare must increase
with every single deal  therefore  negotiation always pays off  even if it has to stop early
due to computational limitations 
the issue of complexity is still an important one  if the full range of deals is too large
to be managed in practice  it is important to investigate how close we can get to finding
an optimal allocation if we restrict the set of allowed deals to certain simple patterns 
andersson and sandholm         for instance  have conducted a number of experiments on
the sequencing of certain contract deal types to reach the best possible allocations within
a limited amount of time  for a complexity theoretic analysis of the problem of deciding
whether it is possible to reach an optimal allocation by means of structurally simple types
of deals  in particular   deals   we refer to recent work by dunne et al         
    necessary deals
the next theorem improves upon sandholms main result regarding necessary contract
types  sandholm         by extending it to the cases where either all utility functions are
monotonic or all utility functions are dichotomous   sandholms original result  translated
into our terminology  states that for any system  consisting of a set of agents a and a
set of resources r  and any  not independently decomposable  deal  for that system  it
is possible to construct utility functions and choose an initial allocation of resources such
that  is necessary to reach an optimal allocation  if agents only agree to individually
rational deals  all other findings on the insufficiency of certain types of contracts reported
by sandholm        may be considered corollaries to this  for instance  the fact that 
say  cluster deals alone are not sufficient to guarantee optimal outcomes follows from this
theorem if we take  to be any particular swap deal for the system in question 
theorem    necessary deals with side payments  let the sets of agents and resources be fixed  then for every deal  that is not independently decomposable  there exist
utility functions and an initial allocation such that any sequence of individually rational
deals leading to an allocation with maximal utilitarian social welfare must include   this
continues to be the case even when either all utility functions are required to be monotonic
or all utility functions are required to be dichotomous 
   in fact  our theorem not only sharpens but also also corrects a mistake in previous expositions of this
result  sandholm        endriss et al       a   where the restriction to deals that are not independently
decomposable had been omitted 

   

finegotiating socially optimal allocations of resources

proof  given a set of agents a and a set of resources r  let     a  a    with a    a  be
any deal for this system  we need to show that there are a collection of utility functions
and an initial allocation such that  is necessary to reach an allocation with maximal social
welfare  this would be the case if a  had maximal social welfare  a had the second highest
social welfare  and a were the initial allocation of resources 
we first prove the existence of such a collection of functions for the case where all utility
functions are required to be monotonic  fix  such that           as we have a    a   
there must be an agent j  a such that a j     a   j   we now define utility functions ui
for agents i  a and sets of resources r  r as follows 

 r     if r   a   i  or  r   a i  and i    j 
ui  r   
 r 
otherwise
observe that ui is a monotonic utility function for every i  a  we get swu  a       r   a 
and swu  a    swu  a       because     a  a    is not individually decomposable  there
exists no allocation b different from both a and a  such that either b i    a i  or b i   
a   i  for all agents i  a  hence  swu  b   swu  a  for any other allocation b  that
is  a  is the  unique  allocation with maximal social welfare and the only allocation with
higher social welfare than a  therefore  if we were to make a the initial allocation then
    a  a    would be the only deal increasing social welfare  by lemma    this means that
 would be the only individually rational  and thereby the only possible  deal  hence   is
indeed necessary to achieve maximal utilitarian social welfare 
the proof for the case of dichotomous utility functions is very similar  we only need to
show that a suitable collection of dichotomous utility functions can be constructed  again 
let j be an agent with a j     a   j   we can use the following collection of functions 

  if r   a   i  or  r   a i  and i    j 
ui  r   
  otherwise
we get swu  a       a   swu  a    swu  a     and swu  b   swu  a  for all other allocations
b  hence  a is not socially optimal and  with a as the initial allocation   would be the
only deal that is individually rational 
 
we should stress that the set of deals that are not independently decomposable includes
deals involving any number of agents and or any number of resources  hence  by theorem   
any negotiation protocol that puts restrictions on the structural complexity of deals that
may be proposed will fail to guarantee optimal outcomes  even when there are no constraints
on either time or computational resources  this emphasises the high complexity of our
negotiation framework  see also dunne et al         chevaleyre et al         endriss  
maudet        dunne         the fact that the necessity of  almost  the full range of deals
persists  even when all utility functions are subject to certain restrictions makes this result
even more striking  this is true in particular for the case of dichotomous functions  which
are in some sense the simplest class of utility functions  as they can only distinguish between
good and bad bundles  
to see that the restriction to deals that are not independently decomposable matters 
consider a scenario with four agents and two resources  if the deal  of moving r  from
agent   to agent    and r  from agent   to agent   is individually rational  then so will be
   

fiendriss  maudet  sadri    toni

either one of the two subdeals of moving either r  from agent   to agent   or r  from
agent   to agent    hence  the deal   which is independently decomposable  cannot be
necessary in the sense of theorem    with reference to our proof above  in the case of 
there are allocations b such that either b i    a i  or b i    a   i  for all agents i  a 
i e  we could get swu  b    swu  a     
    additive scenarios
theorem   is a negative result  because it shows that deals of any complexity may be
required to guarantee optimal outcomes of negotiation  this is partly a consequence of the
high degree of generality of our framework  in section      we have defined utility functions
as arbitrary functions from sets of resources to real numbers  for many application domains
this may be unnecessarily general or even inappropriate and we may be able to obtain
stronger results for specific classes of utility functions that are subject to certain restrictions 
of course  we have already seen that this is not the case for either monotonicity  possibly
the most natural restriction  or dichotomy  possibly the most severe restriction  
here  we are going to consider the case of additive utility functions  which are appropriate for domains where combining resources does not result in any synergy effects  in the
sense of increasing an agents welfare   we refer to systems where all agents have additive
utility functions as additive scenarios  the following theorem shows that for these additive
scenarios   deals are sufficient to guarantee outcomes with maximal social welfare  
theorem    additive scenarios  in additive scenarios  any sequence of individually rational   deals will eventually result in an allocation with maximal utilitarian social welfare 
proof  termination is shown as for theorem    we are going to show that  whenever the
current allocation does not have maximal social welfare  then there is still a possible   deal
that is individually rational 
in additive domains  the utilitarian social welfare of a given allocation may be computed
by adding up the appropriate utility values for all the single resources in r  for any
allocation a  let fa be the function mapping each resource r  r to the agent i  a that
holds r in situation a  that is  we have fa  r    i iff r  a i    the utilitarian social welfare
for allocation a is then given by the following formula 
x
swu  a   
ufa  r    r  
rr

now suppose that negotiation has terminated with allocation a and there are no more
individually rational   deals possible  furthermore  for the sake of contradiction  assume
that a is not an allocation with maximal social welfare  i e  there exists another allocation
a  with swu  a    swu  a     but then  by the above characterisation of social welfare for
additive scenarios  there must be at least one resource r  r such that ufa  r    r    
ufa   r    r    that is  the   deal  of passing r from agent fa  r  on to agent fa   r  would
increase social welfare  therefore  by lemma     must be an individually rational deal 
i e  contrary to our earlier assumption  a cannot be a terminal allocation  hence  a must
be an allocation with maximal utilitarian social welfare 
 
   this has also been observed by t  sandholm  personal communication  september       

   

finegotiating socially optimal allocations of resources

we conclude this section by briefly mentioning two recent results that both extend  in
different ways  the result stated in theorem    a detailed discussion  however  would be
beyond the scope of the present paper   the first of these results shows that rational
deals involving at most k resources each are sufficient for convergence to an allocation
with maximal social welfare whenever all utility functions are additively separable with
respect to a common partition of r i e  synergies across different parts of the partition
are not possible and overall utility is defined as the sum of utilities for the different sets
in the partition  fishburn        and each set in this partition has at most k elements
 chevaleyre et al       a  
the second result concerns a maximality property of utility functions with respect to
  deals  chevaleyre et al       b  show that the class of modular utility functions  which is
only slightly more general than the class of additive functions considered here  namely  it is
possible to assign a non zero utility to the empty bundle   is maximal in the sense that for no
class of functions strictly including the class of modular functions it would still be possible
to guarantee that agents using utility functions from that larger class and negotiating only
individually rational   deals will eventually reach an allocation with maximal utilitarian
social welfare in all cases 

   rational negotiation without side payments
an implicit assumption made in the framework that we have presented so far is that every
agent has got an unlimited amount of money available to it to be able to pay other agents
whenever this is required for a deal that would increase utilitarian social welfare  concretely 
if a is the initial allocation and a  is the allocation with maximal utilitarian social welfare 
then agent i may require an amount of money just below the difference ui  a     ui  a  to be
able to get through the negotiation process  in the context of task contracting  for which
this framework has been proposed originally  sandholm         this may be justifiable 
but for resource allocation problems it seems questionable to make assumptions about the
unlimited availability of one particular resource  namely money  in this section  we therefore
investigate to what extent the theoretical results discussed in the previous section persist
to apply when we consider negotiation processes without monetary side payments 
    an example
in a scenario without money  that is  if we do not allow for compensatory payments  we
cannot always guarantee an outcome with maximal utilitarian social welfare  to see this 
consider the following simple problem for a system with two agents  agent   and agent   
and a single resource r  the agents utility functions are defined as follows 
u           
u    r      

u           
u    r      

now suppose agent   initially owns the resource  then passing r from agent   to agent  
would increase utilitarian social welfare by an amount of    for the framework with money 
agent   could pay agent    say  the amount of     units and the deal would be individually
rational for both of them  without money  i e  if p      however  no individually rational
deal is possible and negotiation must terminate with a non optimal allocation 
   

fiendriss  maudet  sadri    toni

as maximising social welfare is not generally possible  instead we are going to investigate
whether a pareto optimal outcome  see definition    is possible in the framework without
money  and what types of deals are sufficient to guarantee this 
    cooperative rationality
as will become clear in due course  in order to get the desired convergence result  we need
to relax the notion of individual rationality a little  for the framework without money  we
also want agents to agree to a deal  if this at least maintains their utility  that is  no strict
increase is necessary   however  we are still going to require at least one agent to strictly
increase their utility  this could  for instance  be the agent proposing the deal in question 
we call deals conforming to this criterion cooperatively rational  
definition     cooperative rationality  a deal     a  a    is called cooperatively rational iff ui  a   ui  a    for all i  a and there is an agent j  a such that uj  a    uj  a    
in analogy to lemma    we still have swu  a    swu  a    for any deal     a  a    that is
cooperatively rational  but not vice versa  we call the instance of our negotiation framework
where all deals are cooperatively rational  and hence do not include a monetary component 
the model of rational negotiation without side payments 
    ensuring pareto optimal outcomes
as the next theorem will show  the class of cooperatively rational deals is sufficient to
guarantee a pareto optimal outcome of money free negotiation  it constitutes the analogue
to theorem   for the model of rational negotiation without side payments 
theorem    pareto optimal outcomes  any sequence of cooperatively rational deals
will eventually result in a pareto optimal allocation of resources 
proof  every cooperatively rational deal strictly increases utilitarian social welfare  this is
where we need the condition that at least one agent behaves truly individually rational for
each deal   together with the fact that there are only finitely many different allocations
of resources  this implies that any negotiation process will eventually terminate  for the
sake of contradiction  assume negotiation ends with allocation a  but a is not pareto
optimal  the latter means that there exists another allocation a  with swu  a    swu  a   
and ui  a   ui  a    for all i  a  if we had ui  a    ui  a    for all i  a  then also
swu  a    swu  a     that is  there must be at least one j  a with uj  a    uj  a     but then
the deal     a  a    would be cooperatively rational  which contradicts our assumption of
a being a terminal allocation 
 
observe that the proof would not have gone through if deals were required to be strictly
rational  without side payments   as this would necessitate ui  a    ui  a    for all i  a 
cooperative rationality means  for instance  that agents would be prepared to give away
resources to which they assign a utility value of    without expecting anything in return  in
   note that cooperatively rational agents are still essentially rational  their willingness to cooperate
only extends to cases where they can benefit others without any loss in utility for themselves 

   

finegotiating socially optimal allocations of resources

the framework with money  another agent could always offer such an agent an infinitesimally
small amount of money  who would then accept the deal 
therefore  our proposed weakened notion of rationality seems indeed a very reasonable
price to pay for giving up money 
    necessity result
as our next result shows  also for the framework without side payments  deals of any
structural complexity may be necessary in order to be able to guarantee an optimal outcome
of a negotiation   theorem   improves upon previous results  endriss et al       a  by
showing that this necessity property persists also when either all utility functions belong to
the class of monotonic functions or all utility functions belong to the class of dichotomous
functions 
theorem    necessary deals without side payments  let the sets of agents and resources be fixed  then for every deal  that is not independently decomposable  there exist
utility functions and an initial allocation such that any sequence of cooperatively rational
deals leading to a pareto optimal allocation would have to include   this continues to be
the case even when either all utility functions are required to be monotonic or all utility
functions are required to be dichotomous 
proof  the details of this proof are omitted as it is possible to simply reuse the construction
used in the proof of theorem    observe that the utility functions defined there also
guarantee ui  a   ui  a    for all i  a  i e  a is not pareto optimal  but a  is  if we were
to make a the initial allocation  then     a  a    would be the only cooperatively rational
deal  as every other deal would decrease social welfare  
 
        scenarios
we conclude our study of the rational negotiation framework without side payments by
identifying a class of utility functions where we are able to achieve a reduction in structural
complexity   consider a scenario where agents use additive utility functions that assign
either   or   to every single resource  this is what we call     functions    this may be
appropriate when we simply wish to distinguish whether or not the agent needs a particular
resource  to execute a given plan  for example   this is  for instance  the case for some of
the agents defined in the work of sadri  toni  and torroni         as the following theorem
shows  for     scenarios  i e  for systems where all utility functions are     functions  
   this theorem corrects a mistake in the original statement of the result  endriss et al       a   where the
restriction to deals that are not independently decomposable had been omitted 
   as dichotomous functions are a special case of the non negative functions  the full range of  not independently decomposable  deals is also necessary in scenarios with non negative functions  interestingly  this
changes when we restrict ourselves to positive utility functions  now the result of theorem   would not
hold anymore  because any deal that would involve a particular agent  with a positive utility function 
giving away all its resources without receiving anything in return could never be cooperatively rational 
hence  by theorem    such a deal could never be necessary to achieve a pareto optimal allocation either 
   recall the distinction between     functions and dichotomous functions  the latter assign either   or  
to each bundle  while the former assign either   or   to each individual resource  the utilities of bundles
then follow from the fact that     functions are additive  

   

fiendriss  maudet  sadri    toni

  deals are sufficient to guarantee convergence to an allocation with maximal utilitarian
social welfare  even in the framework without monetary side payments  where all deals are
required to be cooperatively rational  
theorem        scenarios  in     scenarios  any sequence of cooperatively rational  deals will eventually result in an allocation with maximal utilitarian social welfare 
proof  termination is shown as in the proof of theorem    if an allocation a does not have
maximal social welfare then it must be the case that some agent i holds a resource r with
ui   r       and there is another agent j in the system with uj   r        passing r from i
to j would be a cooperatively rational deal  so either negotiation has not yet terminated or
we are indeed in a situation with maximal utilitarian social welfare 
 
this result may be interpreted as a formal justification for some of the negotiation strategies
proposed by sadri et al         

   egalitarian agent societies
in this section  we are going to apply the same methodology that we have used to study
optimal outcomes of negotiation in systems designed according to utilitarian principles in
the first part of this paper to the analysis of egalitarian agent societies  the classical
counterpart to the utilitarian collective utility function swu is the egalitarian collective
utility function swe introduced in definition    moulin        sen        rawls        
therefore  we are going to study the design of agent societies for which negotiation can be
guaranteed to converge to an allocation of resources with maximal egalitarian social welfare 
our first aim will be to identify a suitable criterion that agents inhabiting an egalitarian
agent society may use to decide whether or not to accept a particular deal  clearly  cooperatively rational deals  for instance  would not be an ideal choice  because pareto optimal
allocations will typically not be optimal from an egalitarian point of view  moulin        
    pigou dalton transfers and equitable deals
when searching the economics literature for a class of deals that would benefit society
in an egalitarian system we soon encounter pigou dalton transfers  the pigou dalton
principle states that whenever a utility transfer between two agents takes place which
reduces the difference in utility between the two  then that transfer should be considered
socially beneficial  moulin         in the context of our framework  a pigou dalton transfer
 between agents i and j  can be defined as follows 
definition     pigou dalton transfers  a deal     a  a    is called a pigou dalton
transfer iff it satisfies the following criteria 
 only two agents i and j are involved in the deal  a    i  j  
 the deal is mean preserving  ui  a    uj  a    ui  a      uj  a    
 the deal reduces inequality   ui  a     uj  a        ui  a   uj  a   
   

finegotiating socially optimal allocations of resources

the second condition in this definition could be relaxed to postulate ui  a    uj  a  
ui  a      uj  a     to also allow for inequality reducing deals that increase overall utility 
pigou dalton transfers capture certain egalitarian principles  but are they sufficient as
acceptability criteria to guarantee negotiation outcomes with maximal egalitarian social
welfare  consider the following example 
u           
u    r        
u    r         
u    r    r         

u           
u    r        
u    r        
u    r    r         

the first agent attributes a relatively low utility value to r  and a high one to r    furthermore  the value of both resources together is simply the sum of the individual utilities  i e 
agent   is using an additive utility function  no synergy effects   the second agent ascribes
a medium value to either resource and a very high value to the full set  now suppose the
initial allocation of resources is a with a       r    and a       r     the inequality
index for this allocation is  u   a   u   a        we can easily check that inequality is in
fact minimal for allocation a  which means that there can be no inequality reducing deal 
and certainly no pigou dalton transfer  given this allocation   however  allocation a  with
a         r    and a         r    would result in a higher level of egalitarian social welfare
 namely   instead of     hence  pigou dalton transfers alone are not sufficient to guarantee
optimal outcomes of negotiations in egalitarian agent societies  we need a more general
acceptability criterion 
intuitively  agents operating according to egalitarian principles should help any of their
fellow agents that are worse off than they are themselves  as long as they can afford to do
so without themselves ending up even worse   this means  the purpose of any exchange of
resources should be to improve the welfare of the weakest agent involved in the respective
deal  we formalise this idea by introducing the class of equitable deals 
definition     equitable deals  a deal     a  a    is called equitable iff it satisfies the
following criterion 
min ui  a    i  a     min ui  a      i  a  
recall that a    i  a   a i     a   i   denotes the set of agents involved in the deal  
given that for     a  a    to be a deal we require a    a    a can never be the empty set
 i e  the minima referred to in above definition are well defined   note that equitability is
a local rationality criterion in the sense of definition   
it is easy to see that any pigou dalton transfer will also be an equitable deal  because
it will always result in an improvement for the weaker one of the two agents concerned 
the converse  however  does not hold  not even if we restrict ourselves to deals involving
only two agents   in fact  equitable deals may even increase the inequality of the agents
concerned  namely in cases where the happier agent gains more utility than the weaker does 
in the literature on multiagent systems  the autonomy of an agent  one of the central
features distinguishing multiagent systems from other distributed systems  is sometimes
equated with pure selfishness  under such an interpretation of the agent paradigm  our
   

fiendriss  maudet  sadri    toni

notion of equitability would  of course  make little sense  we believe  however  that it is
useful to distinguish different degrees of autonomy  an agent may well be autonomous in
its decision in general  but still be required to follow certain rules imposed by society  and
agreed to by the agent on entering that society  
    local actions and their global effects
we are now going to prove two lemmas that provide the connection between the local
acceptability criterion given by the notion of equitability and the two egalitarian social
welfare orderings introduced in section      i e  the maximin ordering induced by swe as
well as the leximin ordering  
the first lemma shows how global changes are reflected locally  if a deal happens to
increase  global  egalitarian social welfare  that is  if it results in a rise with respect to the
maximin ordering  then that deal will in fact be an equitable deal 
lemma    maximin rise implies equitability  if a and a  are allocations with
swe  a    swe  a     then     a  a    is an equitable deal 
proof  let a and a  be allocations with swe  a    swe  a    and let     a  a     any
agent with minimal utility for allocation a must be involved in   because egalitarian social
welfare  and thereby these agents individual utility  is higher for allocation a    that is 
we have min ui  a    i  a     swe  a   furthermore  because a  a  we certainly have
swe  a     min ui  a      i  a    given our original assumption of swe  a    swe  a     we
now obtain the inequation min ui  a    i  a     min ui  a      i  a    this shows that 
will indeed be an equitable deal 
 
observe that the converse does not hold  not every equitable deal will necessarily increase
egalitarian social welfare  although an equitable deal will never decrease egalitarian social
welfare either   this is  for instance  not the case if only agents who are currently better off
are involved in a deal  in fact  as argued already at the end of section      there can be no
class of deals characterisable by a local rationality criterion  see definition    that would
always result in an increase in egalitarian social welfare 
to be able to detect changes in welfare resulting from an equitable deal we require
the finer differentiation between alternative allocations of resources given by the leximinordering  in fact  as we shall see next  any equitable deal can be shown to result in a strict
improvement with respect to the leximin ordering 
lemma    equitability implies leximin rise  if     a  a    is an equitable deal  then
a  a   
proof  let     a  a    be a deal that satisfies the equitability criterion and define   
min ui  a    i  a    the value  may be considered as partitioning the ordered utility
vector  u a  into three subvectors  firstly   u a  has got a  possibly empty  prefix  u a  
where all elements are strictly lower than   in the middle  it has got a subvector  u a  
 with at least one element  where all elements are equal to   finally   u a  has got a suffix
 u a    which again may be empty  where all elements are strictly greater than  
   

finegotiating socially optimal allocations of resources

by definition of   the deal  cannot affect agents whose utility values belong to  u a    
furthermore  by definition of equitability  we have    min ui  a      i  a    which means
that all of the agents that are involved will end up with a utility value which is strictly
greater than   and at least one of these agents will come from  u a     we now collect the
information we have on  u a     the ordered utility vector of the second allocation a    firstly 
it will have a prefix  u a     identical to  u a     this will be followed by a  possibly empty 
subvector  u a     where all elements are equal to  and which must be strictly shorter than
 u a     all of the remaining elements of  u a    will be strictly greater than   it follows
that  u a  lexicographically precedes  u a     i e  a  a  holds as claimed 
 
again  the converse does not hold  i e  not every deal resulting in a leximin rise is necessarily
equitable  counterexamples are deals where the utility value of the weakest agent involved
stays constant  despite there being an improvement with respect to the leximin ordering at
the level of society 
a well known result in welfare economics states that every pigou dalton utility transfer
results in a leximin rise  moulin         given that we have observed earlier that every deal
that amounts to a pigou dalton transfer will also be an equitable deal  this result can now
also be regarded as a simple corollary to lemma   
    maximising egalitarian social welfare
our next aim is to prove a convergence result for the egalitarian framework  in analogy to
theorems   and     we are going to show that systems where agents negotiate equitable
deals always converge towards an allocation with maximal egalitarian social welfare 
theorem    maximal egalitarian social welfare  any sequence of equitable deals will
eventually result in an allocation of resources with maximal egalitarian social welfare 
proof  by lemma    any equitable deal will result in a strict rise with respect to the leximinordering   which is both irreflexive and transitive   hence  as there are only a finite number
of distinct allocations  negotiation will have to terminate after a finite number of deals  so
suppose negotiation has terminated and no more equitable deals are possible  let a be the
corresponding terminal allocation of resources  the claim is that a will be an allocation
with maximal egalitarian social welfare  for the sake of contradiction  assume it is not  i e 
assume there exists another allocation a  for the same system such that swe  a    swe  a    
but then  by lemma    the deal     a  a    will be an equitable deal  hence  there is still
a possible deal  namely   which contradicts our earlier assumption of a being a terminal
allocation  this shows that a will be an allocation with maximal egalitarian social welfare 
which proves our claim 
 
from a purely practical point of view  theorem   may be of a lesser interest than the
corresponding results for utilitarian systems  because it does not refer to an acceptability
criterion that only depends on a single agent  of course  this coincides with our intuitions about egalitarian societies  maximising social welfare is only possible by means of
cooperation and the sharing of information on agents preferences 
after having reached the allocation with maximal egalitarian social welfare  it may be
the case that still some equitable deals are possible  although they would not increase social
   

fiendriss  maudet  sadri    toni

welfare any further  but they would still cause a leximin rise   this can be demonstrated
by means of a simple example  consider a system with three agents and two resources  the
following table fixes the utility functions 
u           
u    r        
u    r        
u    r    r        

u           
u    r        
u    r          
u    r    r          

u           
u    r        
u    r          
u    r    r          

a possible interpretation of these functions would be the following  agent   is fairly well off
in any case  obtaining either of the resources r  and r  will not have a great impact on its
personal welfare  the same is true for agent    although it is slightly less well off to begin
with  agent   is the poorest agent and attaches great value to r    but has no interest in
r    suppose agent   initially holds both resources  this corresponds to the ordered utility
vector h         i  passing r  to agent   would lead to a new allocation with the ordered
utility vector h         i and increase egalitarian social welfare to    which is the maximum
that is achievable in this system  however  there is still another equitable deal that could
be implemented from this latter allocation  agent   could offer r  to agent    of course  this
deal does not affect agent    the resulting allocation would then have the ordered utility
vector h         i  which corresponds to the leximin maximal allocation 
to be able to detect situations where a social welfare maximum has already been reached
but some equitable deals are still possible  and to be able to stop negotiation  assuming we
are only interested in maximising swe as quickly as possible   however  we would require a
non local rationality criterion  no criterion that only takes the welfare of agents involved
in a particular deal into account could be sharp enough to always tell us whether a given
deal would increase the minimum utility in society  see also our discussion after lemma    
we could define a class of strongly equitable deals that are like equitable deals but on top
of that require the  currently  weakest agent to be involved in the deal  this would be
a sharper criterion  but it would also be against the spirit of distributivity and locality 
because every single agent would be involved in every single deal  in the sense of everyone
having to announce their utility in order to be able to determine who is the weakest  
    necessity result
as our next theorem will show  if we restrict the set of admissible deals to those that
are equitable  then every single deal   that is not independently decomposable  may be
necessary to guarantee an optimal result  that is  no sequence of equitable deals excluding 
could possibly result in an allocation with maximal egalitarian social welfare   furthermore 
our theorem improves upon a previous result  endriss et al       b  by showing that this
holds even when all utility functions are required to be dichotomous   
theorem    necessary deals in egalitarian systems  let the sets of agents and resources be fixed  then for every deal  that is not independently decomposable  there exist
    this theorem also corrects a mistake in the original statement of the result  endriss et al       b   where
the restriction to deals that are not independently decomposable had been omitted 

   

finegotiating socially optimal allocations of resources

utility functions and an initial allocation such that any sequence of equitable deals leading to an allocation with maximal egalitarian social welfare would have to include   this
continues to be the case even when all utility functions are required to be dichotomous 
proof  given a set of agents a and a set of resources r  let     a  a    be any deal for this
system  as we have a    a    there will be a  at least one  agent j  a with a j     a   j  
we use this particular j to fix suitable  dichotomous  utility functions ui for agents i  a
and sets of resources r  r as follows 

ui  r   

  if r   a   i  or  r   a i  and i    j 
  otherwise

that is  for allocation a  every agent assigns a utility value of   to the resources it holds 
the same is true for allocation a  with the sole exception of agent j  who only assigns a
value of    for any other allocation  agents assign the value of   to their set of resources 
unless that set is the same as for either allocation a or a    as  is not independently
decomposable  this will happen for at least one agent for every allocation different from
both a and a    hence  for every such allocation at least one agent will assign a utility value
of   to its allocated bundle  we get swe  a         swe  a       and swe  b      for every
other allocation b  i e  a  is the only allocation with maximal egalitarian social welfare 
the ordered utility vector of a  is of the form h            i  that of a is of the form
h               i  and that of any other allocation has got the form h        i  i e  we have a  a 
and b  a for all allocations b with b    a and b    a    therefore  if we make a the
initial allocation of resources  then  will be the only deal that would result in a strict rise
with respect to the leximin ordering  thus  by lemma     would also be the only equitable
deal  hence  if the set of admissible deals is restricted to equitable deals then  is indeed
necessary to reach an allocation with maximal egalitarian social welfare 
 
this result shows  again  that there can be no structurally simple class of deals  such as the
class of deals only involving two agents at a time  that would be sufficient to guarantee an
optimal outcome of negotiation  this is the case even when agents only have very limited
options for modelling their preferences  as is the case for dichotomous utility functions    
while this negative necessity result is shared with the two other instances of our negotiation framework we have considered  there are currently no positive results on the sufficiency
of   deals for restricted domains in the egalitarian setting  see theorems   and     for instance  it is not difficult to construct counterexamples that show that even when all agents
are using additive     functions  complex deals involving all agents at the same time may be
required to reach an allocation with maximal egalitarian social welfare  a concrete example
may be found in endriss et al       b  
    however  observe that unlike for our two variants of the framework of rational negotiation  we do not
have a necessity result for scenarios with monotonic utility functions  see theorems   and     using a
collection of monotonic utility functions as in the proof of theorem   would not allow us to draw any
conclusions regarding the respective levels of egalitarian social welfare of a and a  on the one hand  and
other allocations b on the other

   negotiating lorenz optimal allocations
in this section  we are going to analyse our framework of resource allocation by negotiation in
view of the notion of lorenz optimal allocations introduced in definition     we begin with
a somewhat more general discussion of possible local rationality criteria for the acceptability
of a given deal 
    local rationality criteria and separability
so far  we have studied three different variants of our negotiation framework   i  rational negotiation with side payments  aiming at maximising utilitarian social welfare    ii  rational
negotiation without side payments  aiming at pareto optimal outcomes   and  iii  negotiation in egalitarian agent societies  the first two instances of our framework  where agents
are either individually rational or cooperatively rational  have been natural choices as they
formalise the widely made assumptions that agents are both purely self interested and myopic  for scenarios with and without monetary side payments  respectively  
the third variant of the framework  which applies to egalitarian agent societies  is attractive for both conceptual and technical reasons  conceptually  egalitarian social welfare
is of interest  because it has largely been neglected in the multiagent systems literature
despite being the classical counterpart to the widely used notion of utilitarian social welfare  technically  the analysis of egalitarian agent societies has been interesting  because
egalitarian social welfare does not admit the definition of a local rationality criterion that
directly captures the class of deals resulting in an increase with respect to this metric  this
is why we took the detour via the leximin ordering to prove termination 
the class of social welfare orderings that can be captured by deals conforming to a
local rationality criterion is closely related to the class of separable social welfare orderings
 moulin         in a nutshell  a social welfare ordering is separable iff it only depends on
the agents changing utility whether or not a given deal will result in an increase in social
welfare  compare this with the notion of a local rationality criterion  definition     here it
only depends on the agents changing bundle whether or not a deal is acceptable  a change
in utility presupposes a change in bundle  but not vice versa   hence  every separable
social welfare ordering corresponds to a class of deals characterised by a local rationality
criterion  but not vice versa   this means that every separable social welfare ordering gives
rise to a local rationality criterion and proving a general convergence theorem becomes
straightforward    the leximin ordering  for instance  is separable  moulin         which is
why we are not going to further discuss this social welfare ordering in this paper   
similarly  the ordering over alternative allocations induced by the notion of lorenz domination  definition     is also separable  hence  the definition of an appropriate class of
deals and the proof of a general convergence result would not yield any significant new
insights either  however  here the analysis of the effects that some of the previously intro    indeed  in the case of the framework of rational negotiation with side payments  the central argument in
the proof of theorem   has been lemma    which shows that individual rationality is in fact equivalent
to the local rationality criterion induced by swu  
    a suitable rationality criterion would simply amount to a lexicographic comparison of the ordered utility
vectors for the subsociety of the agents involved in the deal in question 

   

finegotiating socially optimal allocations of resources

duced rationality criteria have on agent societies when social well being is assessed in terms
of the lorenz condition is rather instructive  as we are going to see next 
    lorenz domination and existing rationality criteria
we are now going to try to establish connections between the global welfare measure induced
by the notion of lorenz domination on the one hand  and various local criteria on the
acceptability of a proposed deal that individual agents may choose to apply on the other  for
instance  it is an immediate consequence of definitions    and    that  whenever     a  a   
is a cooperatively rational deal  then a must be lorenz dominated by a    as may easily be
verified  any deal that amounts to a pigou dalton transfer  see definition     will also result
in a lorenz improvement  on the other hand  it is not difficult to construct examples that
show that this is not the case for the class of equitable deals anymore  see definition     
that is  while some equitable deals will result in a lorenz improvement  others will not 
our next goal is to check whether it is possible to combine existing rationality criteria
and define a class of deals that captures the notion of lorenz improvements in as so far
as  for any two allocations a and a  such that a is lorenz dominated by a    there exists
a sequence of deals  or possibly even a single deal  belonging to that class leading from
a to a    given that both cooperatively rational deals and pigou dalton transfers always
result in a lorenz improvement  the union of these two classes of deals may seem like a
promising candidate  in fact  according to a result reported by moulin        lemma      
it is the case that any lorenz improvement can be implemented by means of a sequence of
pareto improvements  i e  cooperatively rational exchanges  and pigou dalton transfers  it
is important to stress that this seemingly general result does not apply to our negotiation
framework  to see this  we consider the following example 
u           
u    r        
u    r        
u    r    r        

u           
u    r        
u    r        
u    r    r        

u           
u    r        
u    r        
u    r    r         

let a be the allocation in which agent   owns both resources  i e   u a    h        i and
utilitarian social welfare is currently     allocation a is pareto optimal  because any other
allocation would be strictly worse for agent    hence  there can be no cooperatively rational
deal that would be applicable in this situation  we also observe that any deal involving only
two agents would at best result in a new allocation with a utilitarian social welfare of    this
would be a deal consisting either of passing both resources on to one of the other agents 
or of passing the preferred resource to either agent   or agent    respectively   hence  no
deal involving only two agents  and in particular no pigou dalton transfer  could possibly
result in a lorenz improvement  however  there is an allocation that lorenz dominates
a  namely the allocation assigning to each one of the first two agents their respectively
preferred resource  this allocation a  with a         r     a         r    and a            has
got the ordered utility vector h       i 
the reason why the general result reported by moulin is not applicable to our domain
is that we cannot use pigou dalton transfers to implement arbitrary utility transfers here 
moulin assumes that every possible utility vector constitutes a feasible agreement  in the
   

fiendriss  maudet  sadri    toni

context of resource allocation  this would mean that there is an allocation for every possible
utility vector  in our framework  where agents negotiate over a finite number of indivisible
resources  however  the range of feasible allocations is limited  for instance  in the above
example there is no feasible allocation with the  ordered  utility vector h       i  in moulins
system  agents could first move from h        i to h       i  a pigou dalton transfer  and then
from h       i to h       i  a pareto improvement   in our system  on the other hand  this is
not possible 
    simple pareto pigou dalton deals and     scenarios
as we cannot use existing rationality criteria to compose a criterion that captures the notion
of a lorenz improvement  and that would allow us to prove a general convergence theorem  
we are going to investigate how far we can get in a scenario with restricted utility functions 
recall our definition of     scenarios where utility functions can only be used to indicate
whether an agent does or does not need a particular resource  as we shall see next  for    
scenarios  the aforementioned result of moulin does apply  in fact  we can even sharpen it a
little by showing that only pigou dalton transfers and cooperatively rational deals involving
just a single resource and two agents each are required to guarantee negotiation outcomes
that are lorenz optimal  we first give a formal definition of this class of deals 
definition     simple pareto pigou dalton deals  a deal  is called a simple
pareto pigou dalton deal iff it is a   deal and either cooperatively rational or a pigoudalton transfer 
we are now going to show that this class of deals is sufficient to guarantee lorenz optimal
outcomes of negotiations in     scenarios
theorem    lorenz optimal outcomes  in     scenarios  any sequence of simple
pareto pigou dalton deals will eventually result in a lorenz optimal allocation of resources 
proof  as pointed out earlier  any deal that is either cooperatively rational or a pigoudalton transfer will result in a lorenz improvement  not only in the case of     scenarios  
hence  given that there are only a finite number of distinct allocations of resources  after
a finite number of deals the system will have reached an allocation where no more simple
pareto pigou dalton deals are possible  that is  negotiation must terminate  now  for the
sake of contradiction  let us assume this terminal allocation a is not optimal  i e  there
exists another allocation a  that lorenz dominates a  amongst other things  this implies
swu  a   swu  a     i e  we can distinguish two cases  either  i  there has been a strict
increase in utilitarian welfare  or  ii  it has remained constant  in     scenarios  the former
is only possible if there are  at least  one resource r  r and two agents i  j  a such that
ui   r       and uj   r       as well as r  a i  and r  a   j   i e  r has been moved from
agent i  who does not need it  to agent j  who does need it   but then the   deal of moving
only r from i to j would be cooperatively rational and hence also a simple pareto pigoudalton deal  this contradicts our assumption of a being a terminal allocation 
now let us assume that utilitarian social welfare remained constant  i e  swu  a   
swu  a     let k be the smallest index such that  uk  a     uk  a      this is the first k for
which the inequality in definition    is strict   observe that we cannot have k    a   as
   

finegotiating socially optimal allocations of resources

this would contradict swu  a    swu  a     we shall call the agents contributing the first
k entries in the ordered utility vector  u a  the poor agents and the remaining ones the
rich agents  then  in a     scenario  there must be a resource r  r that is owned by
a rich agent i in allocation a and by a poor agent j in allocation a  and that is needed
by both these agents  i e  ui   r       and uj   r        but then moving this resource
from agent i to agent j would constitute a pigou dalton transfer  and hence also a simple
pareto pigou dalton deal  in allocation a  which again contradicts our earlier assumption
of a being terminal 
 
in summary  we have shown that  i  any allocation of resources from which no simple
pareto pigou dalton deals are possible must be a lorenz optimal allocation and  ii  that
such an allocation will always be reached by implementing a finite number of simple paretopigou dalton deals  as with our earlier convergence results  agents do not need to worry
about which deals to implement  as long as they are simple pareto pigou dalton deals  the
convergence to a global optimum is guaranteed by the theorem 

   further variations
in this section  we are going to briefly consider two further notions of social preference and
discuss them in the context of our framework of resource allocation by negotiation  firstly 
we are going to introduce the idea of elitist agent societies  where social welfare is tied to
the welfare of the agent that is currently best off  then we are going to discuss societies
where envy free allocations of resources are desirable 
    elitist agent societies
earlier we have discussed the maximin ordering induced by the egalitarian collective utility
function swe  see definition     this ordering is actually a particular case of a class of social
welfare orderings  sometimes called k rank dictators  moulin         where a particular
agent  the one corresponding to the kth element in the ordered utility vector  is chosen
to be the representative of society  amongst this class of orderings  another particularly
interesting case is where the welfare of society is evaluated on the basis of the happiest
agent  as opposed to the unhappiest agent  as in the case for egalitarian welfare   we call
this the elitist approach to measuring social welfare 
definition     elitist social welfare  the elitist social welfare swel  a  of an allocation
of resources a is defined as follows 
swel  a    max ui  a    i  a 
in an elitist agent society  agents would cooperate in order to support their champion  the
currently happiest agent   while such an approach may seem somewhat unethical as far
as human society is concerned  we believe that it could indeed be very appropriate for
certain societies of artificial agents  for some applications  a distributed multiagent system
may merely serve as a means for helping a single agent in that system to achieve its goal 
however  it may not always be known in advance which agent is most likely to achieve its
goal and should therefore be supported by its peers  a typical scenario could be where a
   

fiendriss  maudet  sadri    toni

system designer launches different agents with the same goal  with the aim that at least one
agent achieves that goal no matter what happens to the others  as with egalitarian agent
societies  this does not contradict the idea of agents being autonomous entities  agents may
be physically distributed and make their own autonomous decisions on a variety of issues
whilst also adhering to certain social principles  in this case elitist ones 
from a technical point of view  designing a criterion that would allow agents inhabiting an elitist agent society to decide locally whether or not to accept a particular deal
is very similar to the egalitarian case  in analogy to the case of equitable deals defined
earlier  a suitable deal would have to increase the maximal individual welfare amongst the
agents involved in any one deal  as for the egalitarian case  there can be no class of deals
characterised by a local rationality criterion that would exactly capture the range of deals
resulting in an increase in elitist social welfare  because every agent in the system would
have to be consulted first to determine who is currently best off   to prove convergence 
we would have to resort to an auxiliary social welfare ordering  similarly to the use of the
leximin ordering in the proof of theorem    
of course  in many cases there is a much simpler way of finding an allocation with
maximal elitist social welfare  for instance  if all agents use monotonic utility functions 
then moving all resources to the agent assigning the highest utility value to the full bundle
r would be optimal from an elitist point of view  more generally  we can always find an
elitist optimum by checking whose utility function has got the highest peak  that is  while
the highest possible elitist social welfare can easily be determined in a centralised manner 
our distributed approach can still provide a useful framework for studying the process of
actually reaching such an optimal allocation 
    reducing envy amongst agents
our final example for an interesting approach to measuring social welfare in an agent society
is the issue of envy freeness  brams   taylor         for a particular allocation of resources 
an agent may be envious of another agent if it would prefer that agents set of resources
over its own  ideally  an allocation should be envy free 
definition     envy freeness  an allocation of resources a is called envy free iff we
have ui  a i    ui  a j   for all agents i  j  a 
like egalitarian social welfare  this is related to the fair division of resources amongst agents 
envy freeness is desirable  though not always achievable  in societies of self interested agents
in cases where agents have to collaborate with each other over a longer period of time  in
such a case  should an agent believe that it has been ripped off  it would have an incentive
to leave the coalition which may be disadvantageous for other agents or the society as a
whole  in other words  envy freeness plays an important role with respect to the stability of
a group  unfortunately  envy free allocations do not always exist  a simple example would
be a system with two agents and just a single resource  which is valued by both of them 
then whichever agent holds that single resource will be envied by the other agent 
furthermore  aiming at agreeing on an envy free allocation of resources is not always
compatible with  say  negotiating pareto optimal outcomes  consider the following example
of two agents with identical preferences over alternative bundles of resources 
   

finegotiating socially optimal allocations of resources

u           
u    r        
u    r        
u    r    r        

u           
u    r        
u    r        
u    r    r        

for this example  either one of the two allocations where one agent owns all resources and
the other none would be envy free  as no agent would prefer the other ones bundle over
its own   however  such an allocation would not be pareto optimal  on the other hand 
an allocation where each agent owns a single resource would be pareto optimal  but not
envy free  because the agent holding r  would rather have r    
we should stress that envy is defined on the sole basis of an agents private preferences 
i e  there is no need to take other agents utility functions into account  still  whether an
agent is envious does not just depend on the resources it holds  but also on the resources
it could hold and whether any of the other agents currently hold a preferred bundle  this
somewhat paradoxical situation makes envy freeness far less amenable to our methodology
than any of the other notions of social welfare we have discussed in this paper 
to be able to measure different degrees of envy  we could  for example  count the number
of agents that are envious for a given allocation  another option would be to compute for
each agent i that experiences any envy at all the difference between ui  a i   and ui  a j  
for the agent j that i envies the most  then the sum over all these differences would also
provide an indication of the degree of overall envy  and thereby of social welfare   in the
spirit of egalitarianism  a third option would be identify the degree of envy in society with
the degree of envy experienced by the agent that is the most envious  lipton  markakis 
mossel    saberi         however  it is not possible to define a local acceptability criterion
in terms of the utility functions of the agents involved in a deal  and only those  that
indicates whether the deal in question would reduce envy according to any such a metric 
this is a simple consequence of the fact that a deal may affect the degree of envy experienced
by an agent not involved in the deal at all  because it could lead to one of the participating
agents ending up with a bundle preferred by the non concerned agent in question  

   conclusion
we have studied an abstract negotiation framework where members of an agent society
arrange multilateral deals to exchange bundles of indivisible resources  and we have analysed
how the resulting changes in resource distribution affect society with respect to different
social welfare orderings 
for scenarios where agents act rationally in the sense of never accepting a deal that
would  even temporarily  decrease their level of welfare  we have seen that systems where
side payments are possible can guarantee outcomes with maximal utilitarian social welfare 
while systems without side payments allow  at least  for the negotiation of pareto optimal
allocations  we have also considered two examples of special domains with restricted utility
functions  namely additive and     scenarios  in both cases  we have been able to prove the
convergence to a socially optimal allocation of resources also for negotiation protocols that
allow only for deals involving only a single resources and a pair of agents each  so called
  deals   in the case of agent societies where welfare is measured in terms of the egalitarian
collective utility function  we have put forward the class of equitable deals and shown that
   

fiendriss  maudet  sadri    toni

negotiation processes where agents use equitability as an acceptability criterion will also
converge towards an optimal state  another result states that  for the relatively simple
    scenarios  lorenz optimal allocations can be achieved using one to one negotiation by
implementing   deals that are either inequality reducing or that increase the welfare of
both agents involved  we have also discussed the case of elitist agent societies where social
welfare is tied to the welfare of the most successful agent  and finally  we have pointed
out some of the difficulties associated with designing agents that would be able to negotiate
allocations of resources where the degree of envy between the agents in a society is minimal 
specifically  we have proved the following technical results 
 the class of individually rational deals   is sufficient to negotiate allocations with
maximal utilitarian social welfare  theorem    
 in domains with additive utility functions  the class of individually rational   deals is
sufficient to negotiate allocations with maximal utilitarian social welfare  theorem    
 the class of cooperatively rational deals is sufficient to negotiate pareto optimal allocations  theorem    
 in domains with     utility functions  the class of cooperatively rational   deals is
sufficient to negotiate allocations with maximal utilitarian social welfare  theorem    
 the class of equitable deals is sufficient to negotiate allocations with maximal egalitarian social welfare  theorem    
 in domains with     utility functions  the class of simple pareto pigou dalton deals
 which are   deals  is sufficient to negotiate lorenz optimal allocations  theorem    
for each of the three convergence results that apply to deals without structural restrictions
 rather than to   deals   we have also proved corresponding necessity results  theorems      
and     these theorems show that any given deal  defined as a pair of allocations  that is not
independently decomposable may be necessary to be able to negotiate an optimal allocation
of resources  with respect to the chosen notion of social welfare   if deals are required
to conform to the rationality criterion in question  as a consequence of these results 
no negotiation protocol that does not allow for the representation of deals involving any
number of agents and any number of resources could ever enable agents  whose behaviour
is constrained by our various rationality criteria  to negotiate a socially optimal allocation
in all cases  rather surprisingly  all three necessity results continue to apply even when
agents can only differentiate between resource bundles that they would be happy with and
those they they would not be happy with  using dichotomous utility functions   theorems  
and   also apply in case all agents are required to use monotonic utility functions 
a natural question that arises when considering our convergence results concerns the
complexity of the negotiation framework  how difficult is it for agents to agree on a deal
and how many deals are required before a system converges to an optimal state  the latter
of these questions has recently been addressed by endriss and maudet         the paper
    recall that individually rational deals may include monetary side payments 

   

finegotiating socially optimal allocations of resources

establishes upper bounds on the number of deals required to reach any of the optimal allocations of resources referred to in the four convergence theorems for the model of rational
negotiation  i e  theorems          and     it also discusses the different aspects of complexity involved at a more general level  such as the distinction between the communication
complexity of the system  i e  the amount of information that agents need to exchange to
reach an optimal allocation  and the computational complexity of the reasoning tasks faced
by every single agent   dunne        addresses a related problem and studies the number
of deals meeting certain structural requirements  in particular   deals  that are required to
reach a given target allocation  whenever this is possible at all recall that our necessity
results show that excluding certain deal patterns will typically bar agents from reaching
optimal allocations  
in earlier work  dunne et al         have studied the complexity of deciding whether
one resource at a time trading with side payments is sufficient to reach a given allocation
 with improved utilitarian social welfare   this problem has been shown to be np hard 
other complexity results concern the computational complexity of finding a socially optimal allocation  independently from the concrete negotiation mechanism used  as mentioned
earlier  such results are closely related to the computational complexity of the winner determination problem in combinatorial auctions  rothkopf  pekec    harstad        cramton
et al          recently  np completeness results for this optimisation problem have been
derived with respect to several different ways of representing utility functions  dunne et al  
      chevaleyre et al          bouveret and lang        also address the computational
complexity of deciding whether an allocation exists that is both envy free and pareto optimal 
besides presenting technical results  we have argued that a wide spectrum of social
welfare orderings  rather than just those induced by the well known utilitarian collective
welfare function and the concept of pareto optimality  can be of interest to agent based
applications  in the context of a typical electronic commerce application  where participating agents have no responsibilities towards each other  a system designer may wish
to ensure pareto optimality to guarantee that agents get maximal payoff whenever this is
possible without making any of the other agents worse off  in applications where a fair
treatment of all participants is vital  e g  cases where the system infrastructure is jointly
owned by all the agents   an egalitarian approach to measuring social welfare may be more
appropriate  many applications are in fact likely to warrant a mixture of utilitarian and
egalitarian principles  here  systems that enable lorenz optimal agreements may turn out
to be the technology of choice  other applications  however  may require social welfare to
be measured in ways not foreseen by the models typically studied in the social sciences 
our proposed notion of elitist welfare would be such an example  elitism has little room in
human society  where ethical considerations are paramount  but for a particular computing
application these considerations may well be dropped or changed 
this discussion suggests an approach to multiagent systems design that we call welfare
engineering  endriss   maudet         it involves  firstly  the application driven choice  or
possibly invention  of a suitable social welfare ordering and  secondly  the design of agent
behaviour profiles and negotiation mechanisms that permit  or even guarantee  socially
optimal outcomes of interactions between the agents in a system  as discussed earlier 
designing agent behaviour profiles does not necessarily contradict the idea of the autonomy
   

fiendriss  maudet  sadri    toni

of an agent  because autonomy always has to be understood as being relative to the norms
governing the society in which the agent operates  we should stress that  while we have been
studying a distributed approach to multiagent resource allocation in this paper  the general
idea of exploring the full range of social welfare orderings when developing agent based
applications also applies to centralised mechanisms  such as combinatorial auctions  
we hope to develop this methodology of welfare engineering further in our future work 
other possible directions of future work include the identification of further social welfare
orderings and the definition of corresponding deal acceptability criteria  the continuation of
the complexity theoretic analysis of our negotiation framework  and the design of practical
trading mechanisms  including both protocols and strategies  that would allow agents to
agree on multilateral deals involving more than just two agents at a time
