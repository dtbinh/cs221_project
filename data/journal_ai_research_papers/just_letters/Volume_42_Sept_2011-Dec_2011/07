another reason added complication analyzing probability penetration

   summary
paper presents problem multi robot patrolling strong  full knowledge  adversarial environments  problem team robots required repeatedly visit
path  basic case perimeter  detect penetrations controlled
adversary  assume robots act strong adversarial model  adversary
full knowledge patrolling robots uses knowledge order penetrate
weakest spot patrol  describe framework basic case multirobot patrol around closed polygon  use framework developing  polynomial
time  optimal patrol algorithm  i e   algorithm strengthens weakest spot
patrol  framework extended order solve problem open
fence environment various movement sensing models robots 
paper makes several assumptions allowing computation optimal strategy
patrolling robots  one assumption rst order markovian strategy
patrolling robots  although proving disproving optimality using rst order markovian strategy hard  could interesting examine case higher order markovian
strategies compare time complexity performance solution discussed
here  another direction future work involves non uniform environments 
utility obtained detecting penetrations one hand succeeding penetration
uniform throughout environment  challenges left future work
include handling heterogenous robots non linear environments
