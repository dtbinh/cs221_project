abstract
standard belief change assumes an underlying logic containing full classical propositional logic  however  there are good reasons for considering belief change in less expressive
logics as well  in this paper we build on recent investigations by delgrande on contraction
for horn logic  we show that the standard basic form of contraction  partial meet  is too
strong in the horn case  this result stands in contrast to delgrandes conjecture that
orderly maxichoice is the appropriate form of contraction for horn logic  we then define a
more appropriate notion of basic contraction for the horn case  influenced by the convexity
property holding for full propositional logic and which we refer to as infra contraction  the
main contribution of this work is a result which shows that the construction method for
horn contraction for belief sets based on our infra remainder sets corresponds exactly to
hanssons classical kernel contraction for belief sets  when restricted to horn logic  this
result is obtained via a detour through contraction for belief bases  we prove that kernel
contraction for belief bases produces precisely the same results as the belief base version
of infra contraction  the use of belief bases to obtain this result provides evidence for the
conjecture that horn belief change is best viewed as a hybrid version of belief set change
and belief base change  one of the consequences of the link with base contraction is the
provision of a representation result for horn contraction for belief sets in which a version
of the core retainment postulate features 

   introduction
in his seminal paper  delgrande        has shed some light on the theoretical underpinnings
of belief change by weakening a usual assumption in the belief change community  namely
that the underlying logical formalism should be at least as strong as  full  classical propositional logic  gardenfors         delgrande investigated contraction functions for belief
sets  sets of sentences that are closed under logical consequence  restricted to horn formuc

las         delgrandes main contributions were essentially threefold  firstly  he showed
that the move to horn logic leads to two different types of contraction functions  referred
to as entailment based contraction  e contraction  and inconsistency based contraction  icontraction   which coincide in the full propositional case  secondly  he showed that horn
contraction for belief sets does not satisfy the controversial recovery postulate  but exhibits
some characteristics that are usually associated with the contraction of belief bases  arbitrary sets of sentences   and finally  delgrande made a tentative conjecture that a version
of horn contraction usually referred to as orderly maxichoice contraction is the appropriate
method for contraction in horn theories 
while delgrandes partial meet constructions are appropriate choices for contraction in
horn logic  we show that they do not constitute all the appropriate forms of horn contraction  moreover  as referred to above  although horn contraction is defined for horn belief
sets  it is related in some ways to contraction for belief bases  an aspect which has not yet
been explored properly in the literature 
in this paper we continue the investigation into contraction for horn logic  and address
both the issues mentioned above  as well as others  focusing on delgrandes entailmentbased contraction  we start by providing a more fine grained construction for belief set
contraction which we refer to in this paper as infra contraction  we then bring into the
picture a construction method for contraction first introduced by hansson         known
as kernel contraction  although kernel contraction is usually associated with belief base
contraction  it can be applied to belief sets as well  our main contribution is a result which
shows that infra contraction corresponds exactly to hanssons kernel contraction for belief
sets  when restricted to horn logic  in order to prove this  we first take a close look at
contraction for belief bases  defining a base version of infra contraction and proving that
this construction is equivalent to kernel contraction for horn belief bases  since horn belief
sets are not closed under classical logical consequence  they can be seen as a hybrid between
belief sets and belief bases  this justifies the use of belief bases to obtain results for belief
set horn contraction 
horn logic has found extensive use in artificial intelligence  in particular in logic programming  truth maintenance systems  and deductive databases  this explains  in part 
our interest in belief change for horn logic   despite our interest in horn formulas  it is
worth noting that in this work we do not consider logic programming explicitly and we do
not use negation as failure at all   another reason for focusing on this topic is because of its
application to debugging and repairing ontologies in description logics  baader  calvanese 
mcguinness  nardi    patel schneider         in particular  horn logic can be seen as
the backbone of the el family of description logics  baader  brandt    lutz         and
therefore a proper understanding of belief change for horn logic is important for finding
solutions to similar problems expressible in the el family 
the remainder of the present paper is organized as follows  after some logical preliminaries  section     we give the background on belief set contraction  section    and on belief
base contraction  section    that is necessary for the core section of the paper  section    
there we prove that kernel contraction and infra contraction are equivalent on the level
of belief bases  this enables us to prove that kernel contraction and infra contraction are
equivalent on the horn belief set level as well  from this we are led to provide a characterization of infra contraction for horn belief sets in which a version of the core retainment

postulate  hansson        for bases features  this provides even more evidence for the
hybrid aspect of horn belief change  all these results are stated for entailment based
contraction  e contraction   in section    where we discuss related work  we also mention
similar results for delgrandes i contraction and another relevant type of horn contraction 
namely booth et als        package contraction  we conclude with a summary of our contributions as well as a discussion on future directions of investigation  proofs of all new
results can be found in appendix a 

   preliminaries
we work in a finitely generated propositional language over a set of propositional atoms p 
together with the distinguished atom    true   and with the standard model theoretic
semantics  atoms are denoted by p  q         possibly with subscripts  the formulas of our
language are denoted by           those are recursively defined as follows 
     p            
all the other connectives                and the special atom   false  are defined in terms
of  and  in the usual way  with lp we denote the set of all formulas of the language 
classical logical consequence and logical equivalence are denoted by    and  respectively  for x  lp   the set of sentences logically entailed by x is denoted by cn x   a
belief set is a logically closed set  i e   for a belief set k  k   cn k   we usually denote
belief sets by k  possibly decorated by primes  p x  denotes the power set  set of all subsets  of x  when displaying belief sets we sometimes follow the convention of displaying
one representative of each equivalence class modulo logical equivalence  and dropping the
representative for the tautologies  as an example  for lp generated by the two atoms p
and q  the set cn  p   can be represented as  p  p  q  p  q  
a horn clause is a sentence of the form p   p          pn  q where n     pi   q  p
for    i  n  recall that the pi s and q may be one of  or   as well   if n     we write
q instead of  q  a horn formula is a conjunction of horn clauses  a horn set is a set of
horn formulas 
given a propositional language lp   the horn language lh generated from lp is simply
the set of horn formulas occurring in lp   the horn logic obtained from lh has the same
semantics as the propositional logic obtained from lp   but just restricted to horn formulas 
hence  we have that       and all other related notions are defined relative to the logic we
are working in  we use   pl and cnpl     to denote classical entailment and consequence for
propositional logic  for horn logic  we define cnhl     as follows  cnhl  x   def cnpl  x  
lh for x  lh   and we define   hl as follows  for x  lh and   lh   x   
 if and only
hl
if x   pl  
the consequence operator cnhl     is a tarskian consequence operator in the sense that
it satisfies the following properties for all horn sets x  x

a horn belief set  usually denoted by h  possibly with primes   is a horn set closed
under the operator cnhl      i e   h   cnhl  h   we shall dispense with such subscripts
whenever the context makes it clear which logic we are dealing with 
in the ai tradition  a given set of formulas of the underlying logical language is called
a knowledge base  or simply a set of beliefs  belief change deals with situations in which an
agent has to modify its beliefs about the world  usually due to new or previously unknown
incoming information  also represented as formulas of the language  common operations of
interest in belief change are the expansion  gardenfors        of an agents current beliefs x
by a given formula   usually denoted as x      where the basic idea is to add  regardless
of the consequences  and the revision  gardenfors        of its current beliefs by   denoted
as x      where the intuition is to incorporate  into the current beliefs in some way while
ensuring consistency of the resulting theory at the same time  perhaps the most basic
operation in belief change is that of contraction  alchourron  gardenfors    makinson 
      gardenfors         which is intended to represent situations in which an agent has to
give up  from its current stock of beliefs  denoted as x     indeed the revision operation
can be defined in terms of contraction and simple expansion via the levi identity  levi 
       therefore  contraction is the focus of the present paper and in what follows we shall
investigate it in detail  throughout sections   and   we assume we work in the language
of full propositional logic lp  

   belief set contraction
we commence with a discussion on belief set contraction  where the aim is to describe
contraction on the knowledge level  gardenfors         i e   independently of how beliefs are
represented syntactically  thus  contraction is defined only for belief sets 
definition    belief set contraction  a belief set contraction  for a belief set k is
a function from lp to p lp   
by the principle of categorical matching  gardenfors   rott        the contraction of a
belief set by a sentence is expected to yield a new belief set 
one of the standard approaches for constructing belief contraction operators is based
on the notion of a remainder set of a set k with respect to a formula   a maximal subset
of k not entailing   alchourron et al          here we define this for belief sets  but it has
been known in the literature that its basic principle can be applied to belief bases as well
 we shall recall this in section    
definition    remainder sets  given a belief set k and a formula   lp   x  k
if and only if
 x  k 
 x       and
 for every x   such that x  x    k  x       

we call the elements of k the remainder sets of k with respect to  
  

fipartial meet  kernel  and infra contraction in horn logic

it is easy to verify that k    if and only if      gardenfors        
since there is no unique method for choosing between possibly different remainder sets 
there is a presupposition of the existence of a suitable selection function for doing so 
definition    selection functions  a selection function  for a set k is a  partial 
function from p p lp    to p p lp    such that
  k     k  if k     and
    k   k otherwise 

selection functions provide a mechanism for identifying the remainder sets judged to be
most appropriate  the resulting contraction is obtained by taking the intersection of the
chosen remainder sets 
definition    partial meet contraction  for a selection function
  the belief set cont
traction operator  generated by  and defined as k    def  k  is a partial meet
contraction 
two subclasses of belief set partial meet deserve special mention 
definition    maxichoice and full meet  given a selection function    is a maxichoice contraction if and only if  k  is always a singleton set  it is a full meet contraction if and only if  k    k whenever k     
it is worth mentioning that belief set full meet contraction is unique  while belief set
maxichoice contraction usually is not 
kernel contraction was introduced by hansson        as a generalization of safe contraction  alchourron   makinson         instead of looking at maximal subsets not implying
a given formula  kernel operations are based on minimal subsets that do imply it 
definition    kernel  for a belief set k  x  k   if and only if
 x  k 
 x      and
 for every x   such that x    x  x        

k   is called the kernel set of k with respect to  and the elements of k   are called
the  kernels of the belief set k 
the result of a kernel contraction is obtained by removing at least one element from
every  non empty   kernel of k  using an incision function 
definition    incision functions  an incision function  for a set k is a function from
the set of kernel sets of k to p lp   such that
  

fibooth  meyer  varzinczak    wassermann

  k 
   

s

 k 
    and

 if   
  x  k
   then x   k        

given a belief set k and an incision function  for k  ideally we would want the kernel
contraction  for k generated by  be defined as 
k    def k    k   

   

it turns out that for a belief set k  the contraction operator in     does not respect
the principle of categorical matching  that is because  for a belief set as input  the kernel
contraction  from     above does not necessarily produce a belief set as a result  k  
is not in general closed under logical consequence  as shown by the following example 
example   let k   cn  p  q  q  r   and assume that we want to contract p  r
from k  we have k 
  p  r      p  r    p  q  q  r    p  q  p  q  r    for
the incision function  defined such that  k   p  r      p  r  p  q  p  q  r   we
have that applying the operator in     gives us k   such that k      p  q  r  but obviously
pq r 
  k   
of course  it is possible to ensure that one obtains a belief set by closing the result
obtained from the operator above under logical consequence 
definition    belief set kernel contraction  given a belief set k and an incision
function  for k  the belief set contraction operator  for k generated by  and defined
as k    def cn k    is a belief set kernel contraction 
we shall see in section   that belief set kernel contraction is closely related to a version of
belief base contraction referred to as saturated base kernel contraction  hansson        
belief set contraction defined in terms of partial meet contraction corresponds exactly to
what is perhaps the best known approach to belief change  the so called agm approach  alchourron et al          agm requires that  basic  belief set contraction be characterized by
the following set of postulates 
 k     k     cn k

fipartial meet  kernel  and infra contraction in horn logic

full agm contraction involves two extended postulates in addition to the basic postulates
given above  we shall not elaborate in detail on the intuition of these postulates  for that
we refer the reader to the book by gardenfors        or the handbook by hansson        
alchourron et al         have shown that these postulates characterize belief set partial
meet contraction exactly  as shown by the following result 
theorem    alchourron et al         every belief set partial meet contraction satisfies postulates  k     k      conversely  every belief set contraction which satisfies
postulates  k     k     is a belief set partial meet contraction 
hansson        has shown that postulates  k     k     also characterize kernel
contraction for belief sets 
theorem    hansson        every belief set kernel contraction satisfies the postulates
 k    k     conversely  every belief set contraction which satisfies postulates  k   
 k     is a belief set kernel contraction 
we conclude this section with an important new observation whose usefulness will become apparent in section   
theorem    convexity  let k be a belief set  let mc be a  belief set  maxichoice contraction  and let fm denote  belief set  full meet contraction  for every   lp and every
belief set x such that k fm   x  k mc   there is a  belief set  partial meet
contraction pm such that k pm    x  
this result shows that every belief set between the results obtained from full meet
contraction and some maxichoice contraction can also be obtained from some partial meet
contraction  so  it is possible to define a version of belief set contraction based on such sets 
definition    infra remainder sets  given a formula   lp   t
and belief sets k and
 
 
  
k   k  k   if and only if there is some k  k such that   k   k    k     
we refer to the elements of k   as the infra remainder sets of k with respect to  
it is easy to see that k      if and only if      note that by definition the set of infra
remainder sets of a belief set k are required to be belief sets themselves 
all remainder sets with respect to a formula  are also infra remainder sets with respect
to   and so is the intersection of any set of remainder sets with respect to   indeed  the
intersection of any set of infra remainder sets with respect to  is also an infra remainder
set with respect to   so the set of infra remainder sets with respect to  contains all belief
sets between some remainder set with respect to  and the intersection of all remainder
sets with respect to   this explains why infra contraction below is not defined as the
intersection of infra remainder sets  cf  definition    
definition     infra contraction  let k be a belief set  an infra selection function 
for k is a  partial  function from p p lp    to p lp   such that   k      k whenever
k       and   k     k   otherwise  a belief set contraction operator  is a belief
set infra contraction if and only if k       k

in a sense  then  infra contraction is closer to maxichoice contraction than to partial meet
contraction  since it chooses just a single element from the set of infra remainder sets  much
like maxichoice contraction chooses just a single element from the set of remainder sets 
one immediate consequence of theorem   and definition    is the following 
corollary   infra contraction and partial meet contraction coincide for belief sets 

   belief base contraction
now we turn our attention to belief base contraction  where an agents beliefs are represented
as a  usually finite  set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence  also
known as a base  we usually denote bases by b  possibly decorated with primes 
definition     belief base contraction  a base contraction  for a base b is a function from lp to p lp   
intuitively the idea is that  for a fixed belief base b  contraction of a formula  from b
produces a new base b   
given the construction methods for belief set contraction already discussed in section   
two obvious ways to define belief base contraction are to consider both partial meet contraction and kernel contraction for bases  below we present both cases 
all definitions required for partial meet in the base case are analogous to those given in
the belief set case in section    for the readers convenience  we state them explicitly here 
definition     base remainder sets  given a base b and a formula   x  b if
and only if
 x  b 
 x       and
 for every x   such that x  x    b  x       

we call the elements of b the base remainder sets of b with respect to  
similarly to the belief set case  it is easy to verify that b    if and only if     
definition     selection functions  a selection function  for a base b is a  partial 
function from p p lp    to p p lp    such that
  b     b  if b     and
    b   b otherwise 

definition     base partial meet contraction  for a selection function
t   the belief
base contraction operator  generated by  and defined as b    def  b  is a
base partial meet contraction 
  

fipartial meet  kernel  and infra contraction in horn logic

definition     base maxichoice and full meet  given a selection function    is
a base maxichoice contraction if and only if  b  is always a singleton set  it is a base
full meet contraction if and only if  b    b whenever b     
as in the belief set case  it can be checked that belief base full meet contraction is unique 
while base maxichoice contraction usually is not 
hansson        showed that belief base partial meet contraction can be characterized
by the following postulates 
 b     if       then b       

 success 

 b     b    b

 inclusion 

 b     if b       if and only if b       for all b    b  then b     b    uniformity 
 b     if    b    b      then there is a b   such that
 b     b    b and b         but b          

 relevance 

again  we shall not elaborate in detail on the intuition of these postulates  for that we
refer the reader to the handbook by hansson        
theorem    hansson        every base partial meet contraction operator satisfies postulates  b     b      conversely  every base contraction which satisfies  b     b    
is a base partial meet contraction 
one question that arises is whether the following belief base version of the convexity
principle from theorem   holds 
 base convexity  for a belief base b  let mc be a base maxichoice contraction  and
let fm denote base full meet contraction  for every set x and  such that b fm  
x  b mc   there is a base partial meet contraction pm such that b pm    x 
as in the belief set case  this principle simply states that every set between the results
obtained from base full meet contraction and some base maxichoice contraction can be
obtained from some belief base partial meet contraction  the following example shows that
it does not hold 
example   let b    p  q  q  r  pq  r  pr  q  and consider contraction by p  r 
it is easily verified that base maxichoice gives either b   p  r    b      p  q  p  r  q 
or b p  r    b       q  r  pq  r  pr  q   therefore the only other result obtained
from base partial meet contraction is that which is provided by base full meet contraction 
b   p  r    b        p  r  q   but observe that even though it is the case that
b      x  b    where x    p  q  r  p  r  q   x is not equal to any of b     b      or b      
we shall come back to this issue at the end of the section 
below we give the definitions for kernel contraction in the belief base case  again  they
are analogous to those given in the belief set case in the previous section  but for the readers
convenience we state them explicitly here 
  

fibooth  meyer  varzinczak    wassermann

definition     base kernels  for a belief base b and a formula   x  b   if and
only if
 x  b 
 x      and
 for every x   such that x    x  x        

b   is called the kernel set of b with respect to   and the elements of b   are called
the  kernels of b 
the result of a base kernel contraction is obtained by removing at least one element
from every  non empty   kernel of b  using an incision function 
definition     incision functions for bases  an incision function  for a base b is a
function from the set of kernel sets of b to p lp   such that
s
  b 
     b 
    and
 if   
  x  b
   then x   b        

we refer to an incision function  as minimal if and only if for every   and every incision
function       b 
        b 
    s
the  unique  maximum incision function  is defined
as follows  for every    b 
      b    
it is worthy of mention that minimal incision functions always exist 
definition     base kernel contraction  given an incision function  for a base b 
the base kernel contraction  for b generated by  is defined as  b     b    b    
base kernel contraction can be characterized by the same postulates as base partial meet
contraction  except that relevance is replaced by the core retainment postulate below 
 b     if    b    b      then
there is some b    b such that b        but b          

 core retainment 

theorem    hansson        every base kernel contraction satisfies postulates  b    
 b     and  b      conversely  every base contraction which satisfies postulates  b    
 b     and  b     is a base kernel contraction 
clearly  core retainment is slightly weaker than relevance  and indeed  it thus follows
that all base partial meet contractions are base kernel contractions  but as the following
example from hansson        shows  some base kernel contractions are not base partial
meet contractions 
example   let b    p  p  q  p  q   then b   p  q      p  p  q    p  q  p  q   
so there is an incision function  for b such that  b   p  q      p  q  p  q   and then
b   p  q     p   on the other hand  b p  q      p  p  q    p  q    from which it
follows that base partial meet contraction b   p  q  yields either  p  p  q   or  p  q  
or  p  p  q    p  q      none of which are equal to b   p  q     p  
  

fipartial meet  kernel  and infra contraction in horn logic

as we briefly pointed out after definition    our definition of kernel contraction for belief
sets is closely related to a version of belief base contraction that hansson        refers to
as saturated base kernel contraction 
definition     saturated base kernel contraction  given a belief base b and an
incision function  for b  the base contraction  for b generated by  and defined as
b    def b  cn b    is a saturated base kernel contraction 
it is easily shown  hansson        that when the set b in the definition for saturated base
kernel contraction is a belief set  the two notions coincide 
observation   for a belief set k and an incision function  for k  the saturated base
kernel contraction for  and the belief set kernel contraction for  are identical 
while saturated base kernel contractions are not in general base partial meet contractions  hansson        p       this distinction disappears when considering belief sets only 
theorem    hansson        let k be a belief set  a belief set contraction  is a saturated base kernel contraction if and only if it is a belief set partial meet contraction 
and as a result of observation   and theorem   we immediately have the following corollary 
corollary   let k be a belief set  a belief set contraction  is a belief set kernel contraction if and only if it is a belief set partial meet contraction 
thanks to theorem    convexity  we can extend corollary   to show that kernel contraction  partial meet contraction  and infra contraction all coincide for belief sets 
corollary   let k be a belief set  a belief set contraction  is a belief set kernel contraction if and only if it is a belief set partial meet contraction if and only if it is a belief set
infra contraction 
so far we have considered remainder sets for bases and kernel sets for bases  but not infra
remainder sets for bases  cf  end of section     we conclude this section with a discussion
on this commencing with the definition of base infra remainder sets 
definition     base infra remainder sets  given a formula
  and bases b and b    
t
 
  
b  b   if and only if there is some b  b such that   b   b    b      we refer
to the elements of b   as the base infra remainder sets of b with respect to  
observe that the definition of base infra remainder sets is the same as for infra remainder
sets  differing only in that it deals with belief bases and not belief sets  note in particular
that the elements are not required to be belief sets themselves  base infra remainder sets
can be used to define a form of base contraction in a way that is similar to the definition of
 belief set  infra contraction  cf  definition     
  

fibooth  meyer  varzinczak    wassermann

definition     base infra contraction  a base infra selection function  is a  partial 
function from p p lp    to p lp   such that   b      b whenever b       and
  b     b   otherwise  a belief base contraction operator  generated by  and
defined as b    def   b    is a base infra contraction 
a natural question to ask is how base infra contraction compares with base partial meet
contraction and base kernel contraction  the following result  which plays a central role in
this paper  shows that base infra contraction corresponds exactly to base kernel contraction 
theorem   a base contraction for a belief base b is a belief base kernel contraction for b
if and only if it is a base infra contraction for b 
from example   we know that base kernel contraction is more general than base partial
meet contraction  every base partial meet contraction is also a base kernel contraction  but
the converse does not hold  from theorem   the following result thus follows 
observation   base infra contraction is more general than base partial meet contraction 
theorem   has a number of other interesting consequences as well  on a philosophical
note  it provides evidence for the contention that the kernel contraction approach is more
appropriate than the partial meet approach  as mentioned earlier  it is well known that
kernel contraction and partial meet contraction coincide for belief sets  but differ for belief
bases  kernel contraction being more general than partial meet contraction in this case  
the importance of theorem   is that it shows a new and seemingly different approach to
contraction  infra contraction  to be identical to kernel contraction for both belief sets and
belief bases  but different from partial meet contraction for belief bases  thereby tilting the
scales of evidence towards kernel contraction  as we shall see in the next section  theorem  
is also instrumental in lifting this result to the level of horn belief sets 

   horn belief set contraction
in the previous sections we recalled several results from the belief change literature and
stated new ones  connecting different constructions to sets of rationality postulates  it is
important to note that although most of the examples in the literature assume that the
underlying logic contains classical propositional logic  the results are usually valid for a
broader set of languages  this has been discussed in different contexts by hansson and
wassermann         flouris et al          ribeiro and wassermann      a      b        
varzinczak               and wassermann         among others  for belief bases  it was
shown by hansson and wassermann        that in order to keep the representation theorems
for partial meet and kernel contraction  the logic only needs to be compact and monotonic 
this means that the results transfer directly to horn logics  however  for belief sets the
representation theorems demand more restrictions of the logic  as shown by flouris et
al          a contraction operation satisfying the basic agm postulates exists only if the
logic is decomposable 
definition     flouris et al         a logic is called decomposable if and only if for all
sets of formulas x  x     such that cn    cn x      cn x   there exists a set of formulas
x    such that cn x       cn x  and cn x    cn x    x      
  

fipartial meet  kernel  and infra contraction in horn logic

it was shown by ribeiro        that horn logic is not decomposable  therefore  new
constructions and sets of postulates are needed to deal with contraction of horn belief sets 
delgrande        investigated two distinct classes of contraction functions for horn
belief sets  entailment based contraction  e contraction   for removing an unwanted consequence  and inconsistency based contraction  i contraction   for removing formulas leading
to inconsistency  while booth et al         subsequently extended the work of delgrande
by providing more fine grained versions of his constructions  our focus in this paper is on
e contraction  although delgrande  as well as booth et al   also consider i contraction 
recall that we use h  sometimes decorated with primes  to denote a horn belief set 
definition     e contraction  an e contraction  for a horn belief set h is a function
from lh to p lh   
delgrandes method of construction for e contraction is in terms of partial meet contraction  the definitions of remainder sets  definition     selection functions  definition    
partial meet contraction  definition     as well as maxichoice and full meet contraction  definition    all carry over for e contraction  with the set k in each case being replaced by a
horn belief set h  and we refer to these as e remainder sets  denoted by he    e selection
functions  partial meet e contraction  maxichoice e contraction and full meet e contraction
respectively  we leave out the reference to the term horn  since there is no room for
ambiguity here   as in the full propositional case  it is easy to verify that all e remainder
sets are also horn belief sets  and that all partial meet e contractions  and therefore the
maxichoice e contractions  as well as full meet e contraction  produce horn belief sets 
although delgrande defines and discusses partial meet e contraction  he argues that
maxichoice e contraction is the appropriate approach for e contraction  to be more precise 
the version of maxichoice e contraction that delgrande advocates is actually a restricted version of maxichoice e contraction that we refer to as orderly maxichoice e contraction   this
is just the horn case of the maxichoice contraction operators satisfying all the agm postulates  including the supplementary ones   whereas  ordinary  maxichoice e contraction
is constructed by setting  for every   lh   h   equal to any element of h  orderly
maxichoice e contraction is more systematicsin nature  associated with every orderly maxichoice e contraction is a linear order  on lh  h   the union of all e remainder sets
of h with respect to all sentencess  lh   intuitively  the higher up in the linear order 
the more plausible an element of lh  h  is intended to be  the orderly maxichoice
e contraction generated from  is then obtained as follows  for every   lh   k   is
selected to be the most plausible e remainder set of h with respect to   the one that is
the highest up in the order   
here we argue that although all partial meet e contractions are appropriate choices for
e contraction  they do not make up the set of all appropriate e contractions  in other words 
delgrandes approach is not complete  the argument for appropriate e contractions other
than partial meet e contraction is based on the observation that the convexity result for full
propositional logic in theorem   does not hold for horn logic 
example   let h   cnhl   p  q  q  r    for the e contraction of p  r from h  maxi    cn   p  q   or h     cn   q  r  p  r  q    whereas full
choice yields either hmc
hl
hl
mc
  

fibooth  meyer  varzinczak    wassermann

meet yields hf m   cnhl   p  r  q    these are the only three partial meet e contractions 
now consider the horn belief set h     cnhl   p  q  r  p  r  q    it is clear that
    but there is no partial meet e contraction yielding h    
hf m  h    hmc
in order to rectify this situation  we propose that e contraction should be extended to
include cases such as h   above  the argument is as follows  since full meet e contraction is
deemed to be appropriate  it stands to reason that any belief set h   bigger than it should
also be seen as appropriate  provided that h   does not contain any irrelevant additions  but
since h   is contained in some maxichoice e contraction  h   cannot contain any irrelevant
additions  after all  the maxichoice horn e contraction contains only relevant additions 
since it is an appropriate form of contraction  hence h   is also an appropriate result of
e contraction 
in summary  every horn belief set between full meet and some maxichoice e contraction
ought to be seen as an appropriate candidate for e contraction  this is captured by the
definition below 
definition     infra e remainder sets  for horn
belief sets h and h     h    h e 
t
if and only if there is some h     he  such that   he    h    h      we refer to the
elements of h e  as the infra e remainder sets of h with respect to  
as with the case for full propositional logic  cf  definition     e remainder sets are also infra
e remainder sets  and so is the intersection of any set of e remainder sets  similarly  the
intersection of any set of infra e remainder sets is also an infra e remainder set  and the
set of infra e remainder sets contains all horn belief sets between some e remainder set and
the intersection of all e remainder sets  as in the full propositional case  this explains why
e contraction is not defined as the intersection of infra e remainder sets  cf  definition    
definition     horn e contraction  let h be a horn belief set and   lh be a horn
formula  an infra e selection function  is a  partial  function from p p lh    to p lh  
such that
   h e     h whenever h e      and
   h e    h e  otherwise 

an e contraction  is an infra e contraction if and only if h       h e   
the results on how kernel contraction  partial meet contraction and infra contraction
compare for the base case  kernel contraction and infra contraction are identical  while both
are more general than partial meet contraction  invite the question whether similar results
hold for horn belief sets  before we provide an answer to this  we need a suitable version
of kernel contraction for horn belief sets 
definition     horn kernel e contraction  given a horn belief set h and an incision function  for h  the horn kernel e contraction for h  abbreviated as the kernel econtraction for h  is defined as h e   def cnhl  h     where  is the belief base
kernel contraction for  obtained from  
  

fipartial meet  kernel  and infra contraction in horn logic

it turns out that infra e contraction and kernel e contraction coincide  as the following
result shows 
theorem   an e contraction for a horn belief set h is an infra e contraction for h if
and only if it is a kernel e contraction for h 
from theorem   and example   it follows that partial meet e contraction is more
restrictive than kernel e contraction  when it comes to horn belief sets  we therefore have
exactly the same pattern as we have for belief bases  kernel contraction and infra contraction
coincide  while both are strictly more permissive than partial meet contraction  contrast
this with the case for belief sets for full propositional logic where infra contraction  partial
meet contraction and kernel contraction all coincide 
one conclusion to be drawn from this is that the restriction to the horn case produces
a curious hybrid between belief sets and belief bases for full propositional logic  on the one
hand  horn contraction deals with sets that are logically closed  but on the other hand  the
results for horn logic obtained in terms of construction methods are close to those obtained
for belief base contraction 
either way  the new results on belief base contraction prove to be quite useful in the
investigation of contraction for horn belief sets  we conclude this section by providing
a representation result for horn contraction inspired by the new results on belief base
contraction in this paper 
theorem   every infra e contraction satisfies  k       k       k       k     and
core retainment  conversely  every e contraction which satisfies  k       k       k     
 k      and core retainment is an infra e contraction 
this result was inspired by theorem   which shows that base kernel and base infra
contraction coincide  given that core retainment is used in characterizing base kernel
contraction  theorem   shows that there is a link between core retainment and base infra
contraction  and raises the question of whether there is a link between core retainment and
infra e contraction  the answer  as we have seen in theorem    is yes  this result provides
more evidence for the hybrid nature of contraction for horn belief sets  in this case the
connection with base contraction is strengthened 

   related work
to our knowledge  the first formal proposal of taking non maximal remainder sets for a
contraction following the agm principles was made by restall and slaney         the
construction appears in a context very different from ours  they use a four valued logic
and show that by dropping the recovery postulate  they obtain a representation result
for partial meet with non maximal remainders  note that there is no restriction as to the
remainder sets containing a minimal core  as was made for infra remainders  and as a result
there is no postulate associated with any kind of minimal change 
while there has been some work on revision for horn formulas  eiter   gottlob       
liberatore        langlois  sloan  szorenyi    turan         it is only recently that attention
has been paid to contraction for horn logic  apart from the work of delgrande        which
  

fibooth  meyer  varzinczak    wassermann

has been discussed  there is some recent work on obtaining a semantic characterisation of
horn contraction using the system of spheres by fotinopoulos and papadopoulos        
and via epistemic entrenchment by zhuang and pagnucco        
billington et al         considered revision and contraction for defeasible logic which is
quite different from horn logic in many respects  but nevertheless has a rule like flavour to
it which has some similarity to horn logic 
the present paper is an extension of the work by booth et al         in which they
show that infra e contraction is captured precisely by the six agm postulates for belief set
contraction  except that recovery is replaced by the following  weaker  postulate  h e   
together with the failure postulate 
 h e    if   h    h     then t
there exists an x such that  he    x  h and x       but x        
 h e    if      then h e    h

 failure 

theorem     booth et al         every infra e contraction operator satisfies postulates  k     k       h e    and  h e     conversely  every e contraction which
satisfies  k     k       h e    and  h e    is an infra e contraction 
postulate  h e    bears some resemblance to the relevance postulate for base contraction in that it states that all sentences removed from h during a  contraction must have
been removed for a reason  adding them again brings back   postulate  h e    simply
states that contracting with a tautology leaves the initial belief set unchanged 
it is worth noting that  h e    is a somewhat unusual postulate in that it refers
directly to the construction method it is intended to characterize  i e   to e remainder sets 
here we have provided a more elegant characterization of infra e contraction by taking a
detour through base contraction  firstly  we replaced  h e    with the core retainment
postulate that is used in the characterization of base kernel contraction  then it turns out
that the vacuity postulate  k     and the failure postulate  h e    both follow from
core retainment and the inclusion postulate  k      from which we then obtained our
characterization of infra e contraction 
in addition to e contraction  delgrande also investigated a version of horn contraction
he refers to as inconsistency based contraction  or i contraction  where the purpose is to
modify an agents horn belief set in such a way as to avoid inconsistency when a sentence 
is provided as input  that is  an i contraction i should be such that  h i          
 
hl
in addition to both e  and i contraction  booth et al         considered package contraction  or p contraction   a version of contraction studied by fuhrmann and hansson       
for the classical case  i e   for logics containing full propositional logic   given a set of
formulas x  the goal is to make sure that none of the sentences in x is in the result obtained from p contraction  for full propositional logic this is similar to contracting with
the disjunction of the sentences in x  for horn logic  which does not have full disjunction 
package contraction is more interesting  although it seems that the new results presented
in this paper can be applied to both i contraction and p contraction  this still has to be
verified in detail 
  

fipartial meet  kernel  and infra contraction in horn logic

recent work by delgrande and wassermann        draws inspiration from the semantic
representation of remainder sets  in the classical agm approach  a remainder set can be
obtained semantically by adding to the models of a belief set h a counter model of the
formula  for contraction  with horn clauses  this construction will not necessarily lead to
sets that correspond to remainder sets  this is because  as is known in horn logic  given
any two models of m    m  of a horn belief set h  the model m  u m  is also a model of h 
where m  u m  denotes that model in which the atoms true in it are precisely the atoms
which are true in both m  and m    to illustrate this  consider the following example 
example    delgrande   wassermann        let p    p  q  r  and let the horn belief set h   cnhl  p  q   consider candidates for h   p  q   there are three e remainder
sets  given by the horn closures of p   r  q   q   r  p   and  p  q    q  p    r 
p    r  q   any infra e remainder set contains the closure of  r  p    r  q  
in example    the unique model of the set  p  q  r  is a countermodel of p  q  if we add it
to the models of h and close them under u so that the result represents a horn belief set 
we obtain the set of models of the formula p  which cannot be an e remainder set  as there
is an e remainder set  cnhl  p   r  q    containing it  this means that in an approach
based on e remainder sets we cannot have contraction operators with the same behaviour
as the classical ones 
delgrande and wassermann propose to mimic the semantic construction of classical
remainders  a weak remainder of h and  is formed by intersecting h with a maximal
consistent horn theory not containing   equivalently  the weak remainders can be semantically characterized by taking the closure under intersection of the models of h together
with a single counter model of   representation results for contraction based on weakremainders are then provided 
concerning the connection between partial meet contraction and kernel contraction for
bases  falappa et al         have shown how to construct a partial meet contraction from
a kernel contraction  which is always possible  and how to construct a kernel contraction
from a partial meet contraction  when this is possible  these results can be generalized so
that they apply to base infra contraction and base kernel contraction  that is  it should be
possible to construct a base infra contraction from every base kernel contraction  as well as
a base kernel contraction from every base infra contraction 

   concluding remarks
in bringing hanssons kernel contraction into the picture  we have made meaningful contributions to the investigation into contraction for horn logic  the main contributions of
the present paper are as follows   i  a result which shows that infra contraction and kernel
contraction for the belief base case coincide  and  ii  lifting the previous results to horn
belief sets to show that infra contraction and kernel contraction for horn belief sets coincide 
the investigation into base contraction also allowed us to improve on the rather unsatisfactory representation result proved by booth et al  for infra contraction  which relies
on a postulate referring directly to the construction method it is intended to characterize 
we obtained a more elegant representation result by replacing the postulate introduced by
  

fibooth  meyer  varzinczak    wassermann

booth et al  with the well known core retainment postulate  which is usually associated
with base contraction  the presence of core retainment here further enforces the hybrid
nature of horn belief change  lying somewhere between belief set change and base change 
we have seen that kernel e contraction and infra e contraction are more general than
partial meet e contraction  but there is also evidence that even these forms of horn contraction may not be sufficient to obtain all meaningful answers  consider  for example  our
horn belief set example cnhl   p  q  q  r   encountered in example    if we view basic
horn clauses  clauses with exactly one atom in the head and the body  as representative
of arcs in a graph  in the style of the old inheritance networks  there is a case to be made
for regarding the three arcs p  q  q  r  and p  r  as the basic information used to
generate the belief set  then one possible desirable outcome of a contraction by p  r is
cnhl  q  r   however  as we have seen in example    this is not an outcome supported
by infra e contraction  and therefore not by kernel e contraction either   ideally  a truly
comprehensive e contraction approach for horn logic would be able to account for such
cases as well 
here we focus only on basic horn contraction  for future work we plan to investigate
horn contraction for full agm contraction  obtained by adding the extended postulates 
another interesting question for further investigation is whether theorem   can be generalized to other logics  notably extensions of  full  propositional logic 
finally  as mentioned earlier  one of the reasons for focusing on this topic is because of
its application to debugging and repairing ontologies in description logics  in particular 
horn logic can be seen as the backbone of the el family of description logics  baader et al  
       and therefore a proper understanding of belief change for horn logic is important
for finding solutions to similar problems expressible in the el family  we are currently
investigating these possibilities

theorem   an e contraction for a horn belief set h is an infra e contraction for h if and
only if it is a kernel e contraction for h 
proof 
consider a belief base b and a formula   from theorem   it follows that the set of base
infra remainder sets of b with respect to   i e   the set b    is equal to the set of results
obtained from the base kernel contraction of b by   call it kcb   now let b be such that
it is a set of horn formulas closed under horn consequence  a horn belief set  and  a horn
formula  the elements of kcb are not necessarily closed under horn consequence  but if
we do close them  we obtain exactly the set of results obtained from kernel e contraction
when contracting b by   by the definition of kernel e contraction   let us refer to this
latter set as cnhl  kcb    i e   cnhl  kcb      cnhl  x    x  kcb    also  the elements
of b   are not closed under horn consequence  but if we do close them the resulting
set  refer to this set as cnhl  b     contains exactly the infra e remainder sets of b with
respect to   i e   cnhl  b      b e   to see why  observe that since b is closed under
horn consequence  the  base  remainder sets of b with respect to   i e   the elements of
b  are also closed under horn consequence  so thet
elements of b   are all the sets  not
necessarily closed under horn consequence  between  b  and some element of b 
therefore the elements of cnhl  b    are all those elements of b   that are closed under
horn consequence  i e   cnhl  b      b e  as was claimed  but since b     kcb   it is

theorem   every infra e contraction satisfies  k       k       k       k     and
core retainment  conversely  every e contraction which satisfies  k       k       k     
 k      and core retainment is an infra e contraction 
proof 
let h be a horn belief set  and let  be an infra e contraction  if h     h  then
 k       k       k       k     and core retainment are trivially satisfied  suppose
h      h  then h     x for some x  h e   then  by definition  h   is a
horn belief set  and hence h     cnhl  h     postulate  k       moreover  there is
an x    he  such that x  x     since x    h  it also follows that x  h  and then
h    h  postulate  k        k     is also satisfied from the definition of h e  and
the monotonicity of classical logic   k     follows straightforwardly from the fact that we
are working with horn belief sets  finally  for core retainment  suppose that   h and
 
  h    now assume that h          
 for every h    h such that h      
  in
hl
hl
 
 
particular then  for every h  he   h    t   hl   from that it follows that   h  
for every h    he   and therefore that    he    and from this we have that
  h    which contradicts our supposition 
conversely  let h be a horn belief set and let  be an e contraction which satisfies
postulate  k       k       k       k      and core retainment  we need to show that
for every   lh   h    h e   observe firstly that  satisfies  k      to see why  note
that from core retainment it follows that if  
  h then h    h        and therefore
that h  h    from  k     it then follows that h   h   
if  
  h it follows directly from  k     that h    h e   if   
 it follows directly
hl
from  k     and core retainment that h     h  and therefore that h    h e  
so  we suppose that   h and    
  to show that h    t
h e   we need to show
hl
that h   is a horn belief set  from postulate  k      such that  he    h    h  
for some h    he   observe firstly that  since h    h  by postulate  k      and
 
 

  h    by  k      
t there has to be an h  he  such that h    h   finally 
assume there is a    he   such that  
  h    by core retainment it then follows
  
  
that there is an h  h such that h    
 but h          
  from this it follows
hl
hl
that there is a horn belief set x such that h     x and x    hl  but
t x       hl   so
x  he   t
but  
  x  which contradicts our assumption that    he    it therefore
follows that  h   h
