abstract
voting is a simple mechanism to combine together the preferences of multiple agents  unfortunately  agents may try to manipulate the result by mis reporting their preferences  one barrier
that might exist to such manipulation is computational complexity  in particular  it has been
shown that it is np hard to compute how to manipulate a number of different voting rules  however  np hardness only bounds the worst case complexity  recent theoretical results suggest that
manipulation may often be easy in practice  in this paper  we show that empirical studies are
useful in improving our understanding of this issue  we consider two settings which represent
the two types of complexity results that have been identified in this area  manipulation with unweighted votes by a single agent  and manipulation with weighted votes by a coalition of agents 
in the first case  we consider single transferable voting  stv   and in the second case  we consider
veto voting  stv is one of the few voting rules used in practice where it is np hard to compute
how a single agent can manipulate the result when votes are unweighted  it also appears one of
the harder voting rules to manipulate since it involves multiple rounds  on the other hand  veto
voting is one of the simplest representatives of voting rules where it is np hard to compute how a
coalition of weighted agents can manipulate the result  in our experiments  we sample a number
of distributions of votes including uniform  correlated and real world elections  in many of the
elections in our experiments  it was easy to compute how to manipulate the result or to prove that
manipulation was impossible  even when we were able to identify a situation in which manipulation was hard to compute  e g  when votes are highly correlated and the election is hung   we
found that the computational difficulty of computing manipulations was somewhat precarious  e g 
with such hung elections  even a single uncorrelated voter was enough to make manipulation
easy to compute  

   introduction
the gibbard satterthwaite theorem proves that  under some weak assumptions like three or more
candidates and the absence of a dictator  voting rules are manipulable  gibbard        satterthwaite         that is  it may pay for agents not to report their preferences truthfully  one appealing
escape from this result was proposed by bartholdi  tovey and trick         whilst a manipulation
may exist  perhaps it is computationally too difficult to find  to illustrate this idea  they demonstrated that the second order copeland rule is np hard to manipulate  shortly after  bartholdi and
orlin        proved that the more well known single transferable voting  stv  rule is np hard
to manipulate  a whole subfield of social choice has since grown from this proposal  studying the
computational complexity of manipulation and of the control of voting rules  two good surveys have
recently appeared that provide many references into the literature  faliszewski  hemaspaandra   
hemaspaandra        faliszewski   procaccia         computational complexity results about the
manipulation of voting rules typically vary along five different dimensions 
weighted or unweighted votes  are the votes weighted or unweighted  although many elections involve unweighted votes  weighted votes are used in a number of real world settings like
shareholder meetings  and elected assemblies  weights are also useful in multi agent systems
where we have different types of agents  weights are interesting from a computational perspective for at least two reasons  first  weights can increase computational complexity  for

example  computing how to manipulate the veto rule is polynomial with unweighted votes but
np hard with weighted votes  conitzer  sandholm    lang         second  the weighted case
informs us about the unweighted case when we have probabilistic information about the votes 
for instance  if it is np hard to compute if an election can be manipulated with weighted
votes  then it is np hard to compute the probability of a candidate winning when there is
uncertainty about how the unweighted votes have been cast  conitzer   sandholm      a  
bounded or unbounded number of candidates  do we have a  small  fixed number of candidates  or is the number of candidates allowed to grow  for example  with unweighted votes 
computing a manipulation of the stv rule is polynomial if we bound the number of candidates and only np hard when the number of candidates is allowed to grow with problem size
 bartholdi   orlin         indeed  with unweighted votes and a bounded number of candidates  it is polynomial to compute how to manipulate most voting rules  conitzer et al         
on the other hand  with weighted votes  it is np hard to compute how to manipulate many
voting rules with a bounded number of candidates  for example  it is np hard to compute a
manipulation with the veto rule and   or more candidates  conitzer et al         
one manipulator or a coalition of manipulators  is a single agent trying to manipulate the
results or is a coalition of agents acting together  a single agent is unlikely to be able to change
the outcome of many elections  a coalition  on the other hand  may be able to manipulate
the result  with some rules  like stv  it is np hard to compute how a single agent needs to
vote to manipulate the result or to prove that manipulation by this single agent is impossible
 bartholdi   orlin         with other rules like borda  it may require a coalition of two
agents for manipulation to be np hard to compute  davies  katsirelos  narodytska    walsh 
      betzler  niedermeier    woeginger         with other rules like veto  we may require
a coalition of manipulating agents whose size is unbounded  and allowed to grow with the
problem size  for manipulation to be np hard to compute  conitzer et al         
complete or incomplete information  many results assume that the manipulator s  have complete information about the other agents votes  of course  we may not know precisely how
other agents will vote in practice  however  there are several reasons why the case of complete information is interesting  first  if we can show that it is computationally intractable to
compute how to manipulate the election with complete information then it is also intractable
when we have incomplete information  second  the complete information case informs the case
when we have uncertainty  for instance  if it is computationally intractable for a coalition to
compute how to manipulate an election with complete information then it is also intractable
for an individual to compute how to manipulate an election when we have only probabilistic
information about the votes  conitzer et al         
constructive or destructive manipulation  is the manipulator trying to make one particular
candidate win  constructive manipulation  or prevent one particular candidate from winning
 destructive manipulation   destructive manipulation is easier to compute than constructive
manipulation  for instance  constructive manipulation of the veto rule by a coalition of agents
with weighted votes is np hard but destructive manipulation is polynomial  conitzer et al  
       however  there are also rules where both destructive and constructive manipulation are
in the same complexity class  for example  both constructive and destructive manipulation of
plurality are polynomial to compute  whilst both constructive and destructive manipulation
of plurality with runoff for weighted votes are np hard  conitzer et al         
in figure    we give a representative selection of results about the complexity of manipulating
voting  references to many of these results can be found in the work of conitzer et al         
in this paper  we will focus on two cases that cover the main types of computational complexity
results that have been identified  manipulation of stv with unweighted votes by a single agent

figure    computational complexity of deciding if various voting rules can be manipulated by an
agent  unweighted votes  or a coalition of agents  weighted votes   p means that the
problem is polynomial  and np c that the problem is np complete  for example  constructive manipulation of the veto rule is polynomial for unweighted votes or for weighted
votes with   candidates  np hard for   or more candidates  on the other hand  destructive manipulation of the veto rule is polynomial for weighted votes with a coalition of
manipulating agents and   or more candidates 

and an unbounded number of candidates in the election  and manipulation of veto voting with
weighted votes by a coalition of agents and just   candidates in the election  in both cases  we
assume complete information about the votes of the other agents  the two cases thus cover cases
in which computational complexity is associated  unweighted votes  a small  bounded  number of
manipulators and a large  unbounded  number of candidates  weighted votes  a large  unbounded 
number of manipulators  and a small  bounded  number of candidates 
stv is a very obvious and interesting case to consider when we study the computational complexity of manipulation  stv is one of the few voting rules used in practice where manipulation is
np hard to compute when votes are unweighted  bartholdi and orlin argued that stv is one of
the most promising voting rules to consider in this respect 
stv is apparently unique among voting schemes in actual use today in that it is computationally resistant to manipulation    bartholdi   orlin        p       
stv also appears more difficult to manipulate than many other rules  for example  chamberlain
       studied four different measures of the manipulability of a voting rule  the probability that
manipulation is possible  the number of candidates who can be made to win  the coalition size
necessary to manipulate  and the margin of error which still results in a successful manipulation 
compared to other commonly used rules like plurality and borda  his results showed that stv was
the most difficult to manipulate by a substantial margin  he concluded that 
 this  superior performance       combined with the rather complex and implausible nature
of the strategies to manipulate it  suggest that it  the stv rule  may be quite resistant to
manipulation   chamberlin        p       
the second case considered in this paper  manipulation of the veto rule by a coalition of manipulators with three candidates  is interesting to study for several reasons  first  the veto rule is
a simple representative of voting rules where manipulation by a coalition of agents with weighted
votes and a small number of candidates is np hard to compute  second  the veto rule is very easy
to reason about  unlike stv  there are not multiple rounds and the elimination of candidates to
worry about  in fact  as we show  manipulation of the veto rule is equivalent to a simple number
partitioning problem  we can therefore use efficient number partitioning algorithms to compute manipulations  third  the veto rule is on the borderline of tractability since constructive manipulation

of the rule by a coalition of weighted agents is np hard but destructive manipulation is polynomial
 since the best way to ensure a candidate does not win is simply to veto this candidate   conitzer
et al         
our empirical study considers the computational difficulty of computing manipulations in practice  np hardness results only describe the worst case  there is increasing concern that computational complexity results like these may not reflect the actual difficulty of computing manipulations
in practice  for instance  a number of recent theoretical results suggest that manipulation may
often be computationally easy  conitzer   sandholm        procaccia   rosenschein      b  xia  
conitzer      a  friedgut  kalai    nisan        xia   conitzer      b   our results demonstrate
that we can profitably study this issue empirically  there are several reasons why empirical analysis
like that undertaken here is useful  first  theoretical analysis is often asymptotic so does not show
the size of hidden constants  in addition  elections are typically bounded in size  can we be sure
that asymptotic behaviour is relevant for the finite sized electorates met in practice  for instance 
our results suggest that we can easily compute manipulations for almost any type of stv election
with up to     candidates  second  theoretical analysis is often restricted to particular distributions
 e g  independent and identically distributed votes   manipulation may be very different in practice
due to correlations between votes  for instance  if all preferences are single peaked then a voting
rule which selects the median candidate is not manipulable  with the median voting rule  it is
in the best interests of all agents to state their true preferences  it is thus clear that correlations
between votes can have an impact on the manipulability of an election  indeed  a number of recent
results have studied whether manipulation remains computationally hard when votes are limited to
be single peaked  walsh        faliszewski  hemaspaandra  hemaspaandra    rothe        brandt 
brill  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra         our experiments will therefore look at elections
in which there are correlations between votes  third  many of the theoretical results about the
computational complexity of manipulation have been hard won and are limited in their scope  for
instance  a long standing open result was recently settled  proving that computing a manipulation of
the borda rule by a coalition of manipulators is np hard  davies et al         betzler et al         
however  both proofs require precisely   manipulators  it remains open if computing a manipulation of the borda rule by a larger coalition is np hard  an empirical study may quickly suggest
whether the result extends to larger coalitions  finally  empirical studies may suggest new avenues
for theoretical study  for example  the experiments reported here suggest a simple and universal
form for the probability that a coalition of agents in a veto election can elect a desired candidate 
it would be interesting to try to derive this form theoretically 

   background
we give some notation and background that will be used throughout the rest of the paper  let m
be the number of candidates in the election  a vote is a linear order  a transitive  antisymmetric 
and total relation  over the set of m candidates  let n the the number of agents voting  a profile
is a n tuple of votes  we let n  i  j  be the number of agents preferring i to j in a profile  a voting
rule is a function that maps any profile to an unique winning alternative  in this paper  we consider
a number of common voting rules 
scoring rules   w            wm   is a vector of weights  the ith candidate in a total order scores wi   and
the winner is the candidate with highest total score  the plurality rule has the weight vector
                   the veto rule has the vector                       whilst the borda rule has the vector
 m     m                 with the veto rule  each voter effectively vetoes one candidate and the
candidate with the fewest vetoes wins 
single transferable vote  stv   stv proceeds in a number of rounds  unless one candidate
has a majority of first place votes  we eliminate the candidate with the least number of first

 

fiwhere are the hard manipulation problems 

place votes  any ballots placing the eliminated candidate in first place are re assigned to the
second place candidate  we then repeat until one candidate has a majority 
copeland  aka tournament  
p the candidate with the highest copeland score wins  the copeland
score of candidate i is i  j  n  i  j    n      n  i  j    n     the copeland winner is the candidate that wins the most pairwise elections  in the second order copeland rule  if there is a
tie  the winner is the candidate whose defeated competitors have the largest sum of copeland
scores 
maximin  aka simpson   the candidate with the highest maximin score wins  the maximin
score of candidate i is mini  j n  i  j   the simpson winner is the candidate whose worst
performance in pairwise elections is best 
all these rules can be easily modified to work with weighted votes  a vote of integer weight w can be
viewed as w agents who vote identically  all these voting rules are anonymous as the order of votes in
the profile is unimportant  a profile can therefore be thought of as a multi set of n votes  to ensure
the winner is unique  we will sometimes need to break ties  e g  when two candidates have the same
number of vetoes  or when two candidates have the same number of first place votes   in the uk 
for example  when an election is tied  the returning officer will choose between the candidates using
a random method like lots or a coin toss  a typical assumption made in the literature  and in this
paper  is that ties are broken in favour of the manipulator  more precisely  given a choice of several
candidates  we tie break in favour of the candidate most preferred by the manipulator  suppose the
manipulator can make their preferred candidate win assuming ties are broken in their favour but
ties are in fact broken at random  then we can conclude that the manipulator can increase the
chance of getting their preferred result  it would be interesting to consider other tie breaking rules 
indeed  tie breaking can even introduce computational complexity into manipulation  for example 
computing how to manipulate the copeland rule with weighted votes is polynomial if ties are scored
with   but np hard if they are scored with    faliszewski  hemaspaandra    schnoor        
we will consider one agent or a coalition of k agents trying to manipulate the result of the election 
manipulation is the situation where the manipulators vote differently to their true preferences in
order to improve the outcome from their perspective  as is common in the literature  we assume
that the manipulators have complete knowledge of the other votes  and  where appropriate  complete
knowledge of all the weights associated with all the votes   whilst it may be unrealistic in practice
to assume we have complete knowledge about the other votes  there are several reasons why this case
is interesting to consider  first  complete information is likely to be a special case of any uncertainty
model  hence  any computational hardness results for complete information directly imply hardness
for the corresponding uncertainty model  second  results about the hardness of manipulation by
a coalition with weighted votes and complete information imply hardness of manipulation by an
individual agent with unweighted votes and incomplete information  conitzer et al          third 
by assuming complete information  we factor out any complexity coming from the uncertainty model
and focus instead on computing just the manipulation 
in addition to some of the standard uniform and random models of votes  we will consider
two restricted types of votes  single peaked and single troughed votes  with single peaked votes 
candidates can be placed on a line  and an agents preference for a candidate decreases with distance
from their single most preferred candidate  single peaked preferences are interesting from several
perspectives  first  single peaked preferences are likely to occur in a number of domains  for
example  if you are buying a house  you might have an optimal price in mind and your preference
for a house decreases as the distance from this price increases  second  single peaked preferences
are easy to elicit  conitzer              gives a strategy for eliciting any single peaked preference
ordering with a linear number of pairwise ranking questions  third  single peaked preferences prevent
certain problematic situations arising when aggregating preferences  in particular  they prevent the
existence of condorcet cycles  in fact  the median candidate of a single peaked profile beats all

 

fiwalsh

others in pairwise comparisons  that is  the median candidate is the condorcet winner   black 
       with single troughed votes  on the other hand  candidates can be placed on a line  and an
agents preference for a candidate increases with distance from their single least preferred candidate 
for example  if the candidates are locations to build a new incinerator  you might have a least
preferred location  your own neighbourhood   and your preference increases the further away the
incinerator is from this  single troughed votes have similar nice properties to single peaked votes

   single transferable voting
we begin with an empirical study of manipulation in stv elections  stv is used in a wide variety
of real world settings including the election of the irish presidency  the australian house of representatives  the academy awards  and many organisations including the american political science
association  the international olympic committee  and the british labour party  interestingly it
is np hard to compute if a single agent can manipulate the stv rule  indeed  it is one of the
few voting rules used in practice where manipulation is np hard to compute in this setting  more
precisely  stv is np hard to manipulate by a single agent if the number of candidates is unbounded
and votes are unweighted  bartholdi   orlin         or by a coalition of agents if there are   or
more candidates and votes are weighted  conitzer et al          coleman and teague give an enumerative method for a coalition of k unweighted agents to compute a manipulation of the stv rule
which runs in o m  n   mk   time where n is the number of agents voting and m is the number
of candidates  coleman   teague         for a single manipulator  conitzer  sandholm and lang
give an o n    m   time algorithm  called csl from now on  to compute the set of candidates that
can win an stv election  conitzer et al         
in figure    we give a modified version of the csl algorithm for computing a manipulation of
the stv rule  this uses a similar recursion as csl but changes the original algorithm in several
ways to take advantage of the fact that we only want to compute if one distinguished candidate can
win and do not need to know all of the other candidates that can possibly win  there are two main
changes to csl  first  we can ignore elections in which the chosen candidate is eliminated  second 
we can terminate search as soon as a manipulation is found in which the chosen candidate wins  in
particular  we do not need to explore the left branch of the search tree when the right branch gives
a successful manipulation 
we tested the modified algorithm with the simplest possible scenario  elections in which each
vote is equally likely  we have one agent trying to manipulate an election of m candidates where
n other agents vote  votes are drawn uniformly at random from all m  possible votes  this is the
impartial culture  ic  model  to show the benefits of our modifications to the csl algorithm  we
ran a simple experiment in which m   n  the experiment was run in clisp      on a     ghz
pentium   with  gb of memory running ubuntu         table   gives the mean nodes explored
and runtime needed to compute a manipulation or prove none exists  median and other percentiles
display similar behaviour  we see that our modified method can be considerably faster than the
original csl algorithm  in addition  as problems get larger  the improvement increases  at n      
our method is nearly    times faster than csl  this increases to roughly    times faster at n       
these improvements reduce the time to find a manipulation on the largest problems from several
hours to a couple of minutes 
    varying number of agents
we next performed some detailed experiments looking for phase transition behaviour and hard manipulation problems  in many other np hard problem domains  the computationally hard instances
have been shown to be often associated with the region of the parameter space in which there is
a rapid transition in the probability that a solution exists  cheeseman  kanefsky    taylor

probability that a manipulator can make a random agent win  and the cost to compute if this is
possible when we fix the number of candidates but vary the number of agents in the stv election  in
this and subsequent experiments  we tested      problems at each point  the number of candidates

candidates in the election  in figure    we plot the cost to compute if the manipulator can make
a random agent win an stv election when we fix the number of agents but vary the number of
candidates  the probability curve that the manipulator can make a random agent win resembles
figure    whilst the cost of computing a manipulation appears to increase exponentially with the
number of candidates m  the observed scaling is much better than the     m worst case scaling of
the original csl algorithm  we can easily compute manipulations for up to     candidates  note
that     m is over      for m        thus  we appear to be far from the worst case  we fitted the

what happens if we introduce correlation between votes  here we consider random votes drawn
from the polya eggenberger urn model  berg         in this model  we have an urn containing all
m  possible votes  we draw votes out of the urn at random  and put them back into the urn with

a additional votes of the same type  where a is a parameter   as a increases  there is increasing
correlation between the votes  this generalises both the impartial culture model  a      in which

size  we consider b   m 
  for instance  with b      there is a     chance that the second vote is the
same as the first 
in figures   and    we plot the probability that a manipulator can make a random agent win
an stv election  and the cost to compute if this is possible as we vary the number of candidates in
an election where votes are drawn from the polya eggenberger urn model  as before  the ability of
an agent to manipulate the election decreases as the number of candidates  m increases  the search
cost to compute a manipulation appears to increase exponentially with the number of candidates
m  however  we can easily compute manipulations for up to     candidates  we fitted the observed
data to the function cdm and found a fit with d         and a coefficient of determination r        
indicating a good fit 
in figure    we plot the cost to compute a manipulation when we fix the number of candidates
but vary the number of agents  as before  the ability of an agent to manipulate the election decreases
as the number of agents increases  only if there are few votes and few candidates is there any chance
that the manipulator will succeed  as in previous experiments  finding a manipulation or proving
none exists is easy even if we have many agents and candidates  we also observed results which are
almost indistinguishable when votes were correlated by being single peaked  or single troughed  and
were drawn either uniformly at random or from an urn model

   coalition manipulation
our algorithm for computing manipulation of an stv election by a single agent can also be used
to compute if a coalition can manipulate an stv election when the members of coalition vote in
unison  this ignores more complex manipulations where the members of the coalition need to vote
in different ways  insisting that the members of the coalition vote in unison might be reasonable if
we wish manipulation to have both a low computational and communication cost  slinko   white 
       in figures   and     we plot the probability that a coalition voting in unison can make a
random agent win an stv election  and the cost to compute if this is possible as we vary the size of
the coalition  theoretical results due to procaccia and rosenschein      a  and xia and conitzer

     a  suggest that the critical size of a coalition
that can manipulate an election grows as n 

we therefore normalize the coalition size by n 
the ability of the coalition to manipulate
the election increases as the size of the coalition

increases  when the coalition is about n in size  the probability that the coalition can manipulate
the election so that a candidate chosen at random wins is around      the cost to compute a
manipulation  or prove that none exists  decreases as we increase the size of the coalition  it is
easier for a larger coalition to manipulate an election than for a smaller one 
these experiments again suggest different behaviour occurs here than in other combinatorial
problems like propositional satisfiability and graph colouring  for instance  we do not see a rapid
transition that sharpens around a fixed point as in   satisfiability  when we vary the coalition size 
we see
 a transition in the probability of being able to manipulate the result around a coalition size
k   n  however  this transition appears smooth and does not seem to sharpen
 towards a step
function as n increases  in addition  hard instances do not occur around k   n  indeed  the
hardest instances are when the coalition is smaller than this and has only a small chance of being
able to manipulate the result

   sampling real elections
elections met in practice may differ from those sampled so far  there might  for instance  be some
votes which are never cast  on the other hand  with the models studied so far every possible vote
has a non zero probability of being seen  we therefore sampled some real voting records  we have
previously studied phase transition behaviour in other real world problems using similar sampling
techniques  gent   walsh        gent  hoos  prosser    walsh        
our first experiment uses the votes cast by    teams of scientists to select one of    different
trajectories for nasas mariner spacecraft  dyer   miles         each team ranked the different
trajectories based on their scientific value  we sampled these votes  for elections with    or fewer
agents voting  we simply took a random subset of the    votes  for elections with more than   
agents voting  we simply sampled from the    votes with uniform frequency  for elections with   
or fewer candidates  we simply took a random subset of the    candidates  finally for elections
with more than    candidates  we duplicated each candidate and assigned them the same ranking 
since stv works on total orders  we then forced each agent to break any ties randomly  each
agent broke ties independently of any other agent  new candidates introduced in this way are
clones of the existing candidates  it would be interesting to consider other  perhaps more random
methods for introducing new candidates  nevertheless  we note that clones are a feature of a
number of real world elections  indeed  one way to manipulate an election is to introduce clone
candidates for the opposition  and thereby to divide their vote  for example  as motivation for
studying clones  tideman        describes how he successfully won the vote for class treasurer as
a somewhat precocious    year old by nominating the best friend of his main rival  we therefore
believe it may be of interest to consider elections like those generated here in which clones can be
present 
in figures    to     we plot the cost to compute if a manipulator can make a random agent
win an stv election as we vary the number of candidates and agents  votes are sampled from the
nasa experiment as explained earlier  the probability that the manipulator can manipulate the
election resembles the probability curve for uniform random votes  the search needed to compute a
manipulation again appears to increase exponentially with the number of candidates m  however 
the observed scaling is much better than the     m worst case scaling of the original csl algorithm 
we can easily compute manipulations for up to     candidates 
in our second experiment  we used votes from a faculty hiring committee at the university of
california at irvine  dobra         this dataset had    votes for   different candidates  we sampled
from this data set in the same ways as from the nasa dataset and observed very similar results 
results are reported in figures    and     as in the previous experiments  it was easy to find a
manipulation or prove that none exists  the observed scaling was again much better than the     m
worst case scaling of the original csl algorithm 

   veto rule
we now turn to the manipulation of elections where there is a small  bounded number of candidates 
the votes are weighted and there is a coalition of agents trying to manipulate the result  for this
part of the empirical study  we consider the veto rule  we recall that veto is a scoring rule in
which each agent gets to cast a veto against one candidate  the candidate with the fewest vetoes
wins  as the next theorem shows  simple number partitioning algorithms can be used to compute a
successful manipulation of the veto rule  more precisely  as the following theorem demonstrates  the
manipulation of an election with   candidates and weighted votes by a coalition  which is np hard
to compute  can be directly reduced to   way number partitioning problem  we therefore compute
manipulations in our experiments using an efficient number partitioning algorithm like that proposed
by korf

fiwhere are the hard manipulation problems 

theorem   there exists a successful manipulation of an election with   candidates by a weighted
coalition using the veto rule if and only if there exists a partitioning of w    a p
b   into two bags
such that the difference between their two sums is less than or equal to a   b   c   iw i  where w
is the multiset of weights of the manipulating coalition  a  b and c are the weights of vetoes assigned
to the three candidates by the non manipulators and the manipulators wish the candidate with weight
c to win 
proof  it never helps a coalition manipulating the veto rule to veto the candidate that they
wish to win  the coalition does  however  need to decide how to divide their vetoes between the
candidates that they wish to lose  p
consider the case a  b  suppose the partition has weights
w     and w      where  w   iw   ab   i and  is the difference between the two sums 
the same partition of vetoes is a successful manipulation if and only if the winning candidate
has no more vetoes than the nextpbest candidate  that is pc  b    w       hence  
 w    b   c    a p
b     b   c   iw i    a   b p
  c      iw i  in the other case  a   b and
   b   a   c    iw i  thus   a   b   c   iw i   
as with the stv rule  we start our analysis with uniform votes  we first consider the case that
the n agents veto uniformly at random one of the   possible candidates  and vetoes carry weights
drawn uniformly from     w   when the coalition is small in size  it has too little weight to be able
to change the result  on the other hand  when the coalition is large in size  it is sure to be able to
make a favoured candidate win  there is thus a transition in the manipulability of the problem as
the coalition size increases  see figure

 achlioptas  chtcherba  istrate    moore        walsh         it is interesting to note that all these
decision problems are polynomial 
the theoretical results mentioned earlier leave open how hard it is to compute whether a manipulation is possible when the coalition size is critical  figure    displays the computational cost
to find a manipulation  or prove none exists  using korfs efficient number partitioning algorithm 
even in the critical region where problems may or may not be manipulable  it is easy to compute
whether the problem is manipulable  all problems are solved in a few branches  this contrasts
with phase transition behaviour in np complete problems like propositional satisfiability or in other
complexity classes  gent   walsh        bailey  dalmau    kolaitis        slaney   walsh       
where the hardest problems tend to occur around the phase transition 

   why hard veto problems are rare
based on our reduction of manipulation problems to number partitioning  we give aheuristic argument why hard manipulation problems become vanishing rare as n    and k     n   the basic
idea is simple  by the time the coalition is large enough to be able to change the result  the variance
in scores between the candidates is likely to be so large that computing a successful manipulation
or proving none is possible will be easy  our argument is approximate  for example  we replace discrete sums with continuous integrals  and call upon limiting results like the central limit theorem 
nevertheless  it provides insight into why manipulations are typically easy to compute 
suppose that n vetoes voted by the non manipulators carry weights drawn uniformly from     w  
suppose also that the k manipulators also have weights drawn uniformly from     w   that they want
candidates a and b to lose so that c wins  and that they have cast vetoes of weight a  b and c
for a  b and c respectively  without loss of generality we suppose that a  b  there are three
cases to consider  in the first case  a  c and b  c  it is then easy for the manipulators to make

mean number of branches used by the algorithm to find a manipulation or prove none

note that all problems are solved with little search  most took a single branch to solve 
only a few took   or more branches 

c win since c wins whether they veto a or b  in the second case  a  c   b  again  it is easy
for the manipulators to decide if they can make c win  they all veto b  there is a successful
manipulation if and only if c now wins  in the third case  a   c and b   c  the manipulators
must partition their k vetoes between a and b so that the total vetoes received by a and b exceeds
those for c  let d be the deficit in weight between a and c and between b and c  that is 
d    c  a     c  b     c  a  b  we can approximate d by the sum of n random variables drawn
uniformly with probability     from      w  and with probability     from  w      these variables
have mean   and variance  w      by the central limit theorem  d tends to a normal distribution
with mean    and variance t     nw      for a manipulation to be possible  d must be less than
s  the sum of the weights of the vetoes of the manipulators  by the central limit theorem  s also
tends to a normal distribution with mean    kw    and variance       kw     
a simple heuristic argument due to  karmarkar  karp  lueker    odlyzko        and also based
on the central
 limit theorem upper bounds the optimal partition difference of k numbers from
    w  by o w k  k    in addition  based on the phase transition in number partitioning  gent

since the integral is bounded by    k     n  and log   w     k   this upper bound varies as

k k

thus  we expect hard instances of manipulation problems to be exponentially rare  since even a
brute force manipulation algorithm takes o  k   time in the worst case  we do not expect the hard
instances to have a significant impact on the average case as n  and thus k  grows  we stress this
is only a heuristic argument  it makes many assumptions about the complexity of manipulation

problems  in particular that hard instances should lie within the narrow interval    s  d   k  
these assumptions are currently only supported by empirical observation and informal argument 
however  the experimental results reported in figure    support these conclusions 

   other distributions of vetoes
the theoretical analyses of manipulation due to procaccia and rosenschein      a  and xia and
conitzer      a  suggest that the probability of an election being manipulable is largely independent
of w  the size of the weights attached to the vetoes  figure    demonstrates that this indeed appears
to be the case in practice  when weights are varied in size from    to       the probability does not
appear to change  in fact  the probability curve fits the same simple and universal form plotted
in figure     we also observed that the cost of computing a manipulation or proving that none is
possible did not change as the weights were varied in size 
similarly  theoretical results typically place few assumptions about the distribution of votes 
for example  the results of procaccia and rosenschein
      a  and xia and conitzer      a  that
there is a critical coalition size that increases as   n  hold for any independent and identically
distributed random votes  similarly  our heuristic argument about why hard manipulation problems
are vanishingly rare depends on application of the central limit theorem  it therefore works with
other types of independent and identically distributed random votes 
we considered therefore another type of independent and identically distributed vote  in particular  we study an election in which weights are independently drawn from a normal distribution 
figure    shows that there is again a smooth phase transition in manipulability  we also plotted
figure    on top of figures    and     all curves appear to fit the same simple and universal form 
as with uniform weights  the computational cost of deciding if an election is manipulable was small
even when the coalition size was critical  finally  we varied the parameters of the normal distribution  the probability of electing a chosen candidate as well as the cost of computing a manipulation
did not appear to depend on the mean or variance of the distribution  we do not reproduce the
figures as they look identical to the previous figures 

   correlated vetoes
we conjecture that one place to find hard manipulation problems for veto voting is when votes are
highly correlated  for example  consider a hung election where all n agents veto the candidate

that the manipulators wish to win  but the k manipulators have exactly twice the weight of vetoes
of the n agents  this election is finely balanced  the preferred candidate of the manipulators wins
if and only if the manipulators perfectly partition their vetoes between the two candidates that
they wish to lose  note that this is precisely the trick used in reducing number partitioning to the
manipulation problem by conitzer et al          in figure     we plot the probability that the k
manipulators can make their preferred candidate win in such a hung election as we vary the size
of their weights w  similar to number partitioning  gent   walsh         we see a rapid transition
in manipulability around log   w  k     in figure     we observe that there is a rapid increase in
the computationally complexity to compute a manipulation around this point 
what happens when the votes are less correlated  we consider an election which is perfectly
hung as before except for one agent who vetoes at random one of the three candidates  in figure    
we plot the cost of computing a manipulation as the weight of this single random veto increases 
even one uncorrelated vote is enough to make manipulation easy if it has the same magnitude in
weight as the vetoes of the manipulators  this suggests that we will find hard manipulation problems
in veto elections only when votes are highly correlated

    related work
as indicated earlier  a number of theoretical results suggest elections are easy to manipulate in
practice despite worst case np hardness results  for example  procaccia and rosenschein proved
that for most scoring rules and a wide variety of distributions over votes  when the size of the

coalition
is o  n   the probability that they can change the result tends to    and when it is

  n   the probability that they can manipulate the result tends to    procaccia   rosenschein 
    a   they also gave a simple greedy procedure that will find a manipulation of a scoring rule
in polynomial time with a probability of failure that is an inverse polynomial in n  procaccia  
rosenschein      b   however  we should treat this result with caution as the junta distributions
used in this work may be of limited usefulness  erdelyi  hemaspaandra  rothe    spakowski        
as a second example  xia and conitzer have shown that for a large class of voting rules including
stv  as the number of agents grows  either the probability that a coalition can manipulate the result
is very small  as the coalition is too small   or the probability that they can easily manipulate the
result to make any alternative win is very large  xia   conitzer      a   they left open only a
small interval in the size for the coalition for which the coalition is large enough to manipulate but
not obviously large enough to manipulate the result easily 
friedgut  kalai and nisan proved that if the voting rule is neutral and far from dictatorial and
there are   candidates then there exists an agent for whom a random manipulation succeeds with
probability   n     friedgut et al          they were  however  unable to extend their proof to four
 or more  candidates  more recently  isaksson  kindler and mossel proved a similar result for  
or more candidates using geometric arguments  isaksson  kindler    mossel         starting from
different assumptions again  xia and conitzer showed that a random manipulation would succeed
with probability   n    for   or more candidates for stv  for   or more candidates for any scoring
rule and for   or more candidates for copeland  xia   conitzer      b  
as discussed earlier  coleman and teague proposed some algorithms to compute manipulations
for the stv rule  coleman   teague         they also conducted an empirical study which demonstrated that only relatively small coalitions are needed to change the elimination order of the stv
rule  they observed that most uniform and random elections are not trivially manipulable using a
simple greedy heuristic  on the other hand  our results suggest that  for manipulation by a single
agent  often only a small amount of backtracking is needed to find a manipulation or prove that
none exists 

    conclusions
we have studied empirically whether computational complexity is a barrier to the manipulation for
the stv and veto rules when the manipulating agents have complete information about the other
votes  we have looked at a number of different distributions of votes including uniform random
votes  correlated votes drawn from an urn model  and votes sampled from some real world elections 
we have looked at manipulation by a single unweighted agent in the case of stv  and by a coalition
of weighted agents in the case of veto voting  in many of the elections in our experiments  it was easy
to compute a manipulation or to prove no manipulation was possible  the situations we identified
where manipulations were computationally difficult to find depended either on the election having
hundreds of candidates or on the election being very tightly hung  these results increase the concern
that computational complexity may not be a significant barrier to manipulation in practice 
what other lessons can be learnt from this study  first  whilst we have focused on the stv and
veto rules  similar behavior is likely with other voting rules  it would  for instance  be interesting to
study the borda rule as this is one of the few rules used in practice where computing a manipulation
is np hard with unweighted votes  davies et al         betzler et al          it would also be
interesting to study voting rules like copeland  maximin and ranked pairs  these rules are members
of the small set of voting rules which are np hard to manipulate without weights on the votes
 xia  zuckerman  procaccia  conitzer    rosenschein         second  there may be a connection
between the smoothness of the phase transition and problem hardness  sharp phase transitions
like that for propositional satisfiability are associated with hard decision problems  whilst smooth
transitions are associated with easy instances of np hard problems and with polynomial problems
like   colourability  the phase transitions observed here appear to be smooth  third  given the
  

fiwhere are the hard manipulation problems 

insights provided by empirical studies  it would be interesting to consider similar studies for related
problems  for example  is computational complexity an issue in preference elicitation  conitzer  
sandholm      b  walsh        pini  rossi  venable    walsh         fourth  we have assumed that
the manipulators have complete information about the votes of the other agents  it is an interesting
future direction to determine if uncertainty in how agents have voted adds to the computational
complexity of manipulation in practice  conitzer   sandholm      a  walsh        lang  pini
