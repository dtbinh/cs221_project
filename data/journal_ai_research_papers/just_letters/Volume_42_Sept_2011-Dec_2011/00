stv obvious interesting case consider study computational complexity manipulation  stv one voting rules used practice manipulation

promising voting rules consider respect 
stv apparently unique among voting schemes actual use today computationally resistant manipulation    bartholdi   orlin        p

rule coalition weighted agents np hard destructive manipulation polynomial
 since best way ensure candidate win simply veto candidate   conitzer
et al         
empirical study considers computational difficulty computing manipulations practice  np hardness results describe worst case  increasing concern computational complexity results may reflect actual difficulty computing manipulations
practice  instance  number recent theoretical results suggest manipulation may
often computationally easy  conitzer   sandholm        procaccia   rosenschein      b  xia  
conitzer      a  friedgut  kalai    nisan        xia   conitzer      b   results demonstrate
profitably study issue empirically  several reasons empirical analysis
undertaken useful  first  theoretical analysis often asymptotic show
size hidden constants  addition  elections typically bounded size  sure
asymptotic behaviour relevant finite sized electorates met practice  instance 
results suggest easily compute manipulations almost type stv election
    candidates  second  theoretical analysis often restricted particular distributions
 e g  independent identically distributed votes   manipulation may different practice
due correlations votes  instance  preferences single peaked voting
rule selects median candidate manipulable  median voting rule 
best interests agents state true preferences  thus clear correlations
votes impact manipulability election  indeed  number recent
results studied whether manipulation remains computationally hard votes limited
single peaked  walsh        faliszewski  hemaspaandra  hemaspaandra    rothe        brandt 
brill  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra         experiments therefore look elections
correlations votes  third  many theoretical results
computational complexity manipulation hard limited scope 
instance  long standing open result recently settled  proving computing manipulation
borda rule coalition manipulators np hard  davies et al         betzler et al         
however  proofs require precisely   manipulators  remains open computing manipulation borda rule larger coalition np hard  empirical study may quickly suggest
whether result extends larger coalitions  finally  empirical studies may suggest new avenues
theoretical study  example  experiments reported suggest simple universal
form probability coalition agents veto election elect desired candidate 
would interesting try derive form theoretically

 m                   veto rule  voter effectively vetoes one candidate

rules easily modified work weighted votes  vote integer weight w
viewed w agents vote identically  voting rules anonymous order votes
profile unimportant  profile therefore thought multi set n votes  ensure
winner unique  sometimes need break ties  e g  two candidates
number vetoes  two candidates number first place votes   uk 
example  election tied  returning officer choose candidates using
random method lots coin toss  typical assumption made literature  and
paper  ties broken favour manipulator  precisely  given choice several
candidates  tie break favour candidate preferred manipulator  suppose
manipulator make preferred candidate win assuming ties broken favour
ties fact broken random  conclude manipulator increase
chance getting preferred result  would interesting consider tie breaking rules 
indeed  tie breaking even introduce computational complexity manipulation  example 
computing manipulate copeland rule weighted votes polynomial ties scored
  np hard scored    faliszewski  hemaspaandra    schnoor        
consider one agent coalition k agents trying manipulate result election 
manipulation situation manipulators vote differently true preferences
order improve outcome perspective  common literature  assume
manipulators complete knowledge votes  and  appropriate  complete
knowledge weights associated votes   whilst may unrealistic practice
assume complete knowledge votes  several reasons case
interesting consider  first  complete information likely special case uncertainty
model  hence  computational hardness results complete information directly imply hardness
corresponding uncertainty model  second  results hardness manipulation
coalition weighted votes complete information imply hardness manipulation
individual agent unweighted votes incomplete information  conitzer et al          third 
assuming complete information  factor complexity coming uncertainty model
focus instead computing manipulation 
addition standard uniform random models votes  consider
two restricted types votes  single peaked single troughed votes  single peaked votes 
candidates placed line  agents preference candidate decreases distance
single preferred candidate  single peaked preferences interesting several
perspectives  first  single peaked preferences likely occur number domains 
example  buying house  might optimal price mind preference
house decreases distance price increases  second  single peaked preferences
easy elicit  conitzer              gives strategy eliciting single peaked preference
ordering linear number pairwise ranking questions  third  single peaked preferences prevent
certain problematic situations arising aggregating preferences  particular  prevent
existence condorcet cycles  fact  median candidate single peaked profile beats

others pairwise comparisons  that is  median candidate condorcet winner   black 
       single troughed votes  hand  candidates placed line 
agents preference candidate increases distance single least preferred candidate 
example  candidates locations build new incinerator  might least
preferred location  your neighbourhood   preference increases away
incinerator this  single troughed votes similar nice properties single peaked votes
