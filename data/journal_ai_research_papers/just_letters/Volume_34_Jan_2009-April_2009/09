significant minority cases  certain pronouns  especially pronoun it 
used without referring specific entity  phenomenon pleonastic pronoun
usage poses serious problems systems aiming even shallow understanding natural

extrapositional cases identified using series queries web  cleft
cases identified using simple set syntactic rules  system evaluated four
