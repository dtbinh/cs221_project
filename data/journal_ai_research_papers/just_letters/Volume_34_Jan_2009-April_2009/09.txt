abstract
in a significant minority of cases  certain pronouns  especially the pronoun it  can
be used without referring to any specific entity  this phenomenon of pleonastic pronoun
usage poses serious problems for systems aiming at even a shallow understanding of natural
language texts  in this paper  a novel approach is proposed to identify such uses of it  the
extrapositional cases are identified using a series of queries against the web  and the cleft
cases are identified using a simple set of syntactic rules  the system is evaluated with four
sets of news articles containing     extrapositional cases as well as    cleft constructs  the
identification results are comparable to those obtained by human efforts 

   introduction
anaphora resolution  which associates a word or phrase  the anaphor  with a previously
mentioned entity  the antecedent   is an active field of natural language processing  nlp 
research  it has an important role in many applications where a non trivial level of understanding of natural language texts is desired  most notably in information extraction and
machine translation  to illustrate  an information extraction system trying to keep track
of corporate activities may find itself dealing with news such as microsoft today announced
that it is adopting xml as the default file format for the next major version of its microsoft
office software        it would be impossible to provide any insight into what microsofts
intention is without associating the pronominal anaphors it and its with their antecedent 
microsoft 
adding to the already complex problem of finding the correct antecedent  pronouns are
not always used in the same fashion as shown in the earlier example  it is well known
that some pronouns  especially it  can occur without referring to a nominal antecedent  or
any antecedent at all  pronouns used without an antecedent  often referred to as being
pleonastic or structural  pose a serious problem for anaphora resolution systems  many
anaphora resolution systems underestimate the issue and choose not to implement a specific
module to handle pleonastic pronouns but instead have their input sanitized manually to
exclude such cases  however  the high frequency of pronoun usage in general and pleonastic
cases in particular warrants that the phenomenon deserves more serious treatment  the
pronoun it  which accounts for most of the pleonastic pronoun usages  is by far the most
frequently used of all pronouns in the british national corpus  bnc   in the wall street
journal corpus  wsj  marcus  marcinkiewicz    santorini         upon which this study

is based  it accounts for more than     of personal pronoun usage  the percentage of
cases where it lacks a nominal antecedent is also significant  previous studies have reported
figures between     and      gundel  hedberg    zacharski        while our own analysis
based upon the wsj corpus results in a value around      more than half of which are
pleonastic cases 
applying criteria similar to those established by gundel et al          the usage of it
can be generally categorized as follows  the instances of it being analyzed are shown in
italics  and the corresponding antecedents  extraposed clauses  and clefted constituents are
marked by underlining 
   referential with nominal antecedent
            the thrift holding company said it expects to obtain regulatory approval
and complete the transaction by year end 
where it refers to the thrift holding company 
   referential with clause antecedent
           he was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems  but
he insists he made no secret of it 
where it refers to the fact that the person was on the board of an insurance company 
               everyone agrees that most of the nations old bridges need to be
repaired or replaced  but theres disagreement over how to do it 
where it  together with do  refers to the action of repairing or replacing the bridge 
   no antecedent  pleonastic
 a  extraposition
           but it doesnt take much to get burned 
where the infinitive clause to get burned is extraposed and its original position
filled with an expletive it  the equivalent non extraposed sentence is but to get
burned doesnt take much 
           its a shame their meeting never took place 
the equivalent non extraposed sentence is that their meeting never took place
is a shame 
 b  cleft 
           and most disturbing  it is educators  not students  who are blamed
for much of the wrongdoing 
the equivalent non cleft version is and most disturbing  educators  not students 
are blamed for much of the wrongdoing 
 

all example sentences are selected from the wsj corpus  with locations encoded in the format  article sentence  
 
some claim that cleft pronouns should not be classified as expletive  gundel        hedberg        
nevertheless  this does not change the fact that the pronouns do not have nominal antecedents  hence clefts
are included in this analysis

           it is partly for this reason that the exchange last week began trading
in its own stock basket product      
the equivalent non cleft version is the exchange last week began trading in its
own stock basket product partly for this reason 
 c  local situation
           it was not an unpleasant evening      
this category consists of it instances related to weather  time  distance  and other
information about the local situation  since the texts reviewed in this study lack
instances of other subtypes  only weather and time cases are discussed 
   idiomatic
           the governor couldnt make it  so the lieutenant governor welcomed the
special guests 
this paper focuses on pleonastic cases  the third category   where each subclass carries
its unique syntactic and or semantic signatures  the idiomatic category  while consisting of
non anaphoric cases as well  is less coherent and its identification is much more subjective
in nature  making it a less attractive target 
this paper is organized as follows  section   provides a brief survey of related work
toward both classification of it and identification of pleonastic it  section   proposes a
web based approach for identification of pleonastic it  section   demonstrates the proposed
method with a case study  section   follows with evaluation  and finally  section   discusses
the findings and presents ideas for future work 

   previous work
as evans        pointed out  usage of it is covered in most serious surveys of english
grammar  some of which  e g  sinclair        also provide classifications based on semantic
categories  in a recent study  gundel et al         classify third person personal pronouns
into the following comprehensive hierarchy 
 noun phrase  np  antecedent
 inferrable
 non np antecedent
 fact
 situation

 proposition
 reason

without going into the details of each category  it is apparent from the length of the
list that the phenomenon of pleonastic it  and more generally pronouns without explicit
nominal antecedents  have been painstakingly studied by linguists  however  despite being
identified as one of the open issues of anaphora resolution  mitkov         work on automatic
identification of pleonastic it is relatively scarce  to date  existing studies in the area fall
into one of two categories  one wherein a rule based approach is used  and the other using
a machine learning approach 

    rule based approaches
paice and husk        together with lappin and leass        provide examples of rulebased systems that make use of predefined syntactic patterns and word lists  the paice
and husk approach employs bracketing patterns such as it       to and it       who to meet
the syntactic restrictions of extraposition and cleft  the matched portions of sentences are
then evaluated by further rules represented by word lists  for example  the it       to rule
prescribes that one of the task status words  such as good or bad  must be present amid
the construct  in order to reduce false positives  general restrictions are applied on sentence
features such as construct length and intervening punctuation 
lappin and leasss        approach employs a set of more detailed rules such as it is
modaladj that s and it is cogv ed that s  where modaladj and cogv are predefined
lists of modal adjectives  e g  good and useful   and cognitive verbs  e g  think and believe  
respectively  compared to paice and husks        approach  this method is much more
restrictive  especially in its rigidly specified grammatical constraints  for example  it is
not clear from the original lappin and leass paper whether the system would be able to
recognize sentences such as            it isnt clear  however  whether        despite its claim
that the system takes syntactic variants into consideration 
lappin and leasss        approach is part of a larger system  and no evaluation is
provided  the paice and husk        approach  on the other hand  evaluates impressively 
it has an accuracy of       in determining pleonastic constructs on the same data used for
rule development  without using part of speech tagging or parsing 
both rule based systems rely on patterns to represent syntactic constraints and word
lists to represent semantic constraints  this makes them relatively easy to implement and
maintain  however  these features also make them less scalable  when challenged with
large and unfamiliar corpora  their accuracies deteriorate  for example  paice and husk
       noticed nearly a     decrease in accuracy when rules developed using one subset
of the corpus are applied to another subset without modifications  boyd  gegg harrison 
and byron        also observed a significant performance penalty when the approach was
applied to a different corpus  in other words  rule based systems can only be as good as they
are designed to be  denber        suggested using wordnet  fellbaum        to extend
the word lists  but it is doubtful how helpful this would be considering the enormous number
of possible words that are not included in existing lists and the number of inapplicable words
that will be identified by such an approach 
   

fiidentification of pleonastic it using the web

    machine learning approaches
recent years have seen a shift toward machine learning approaches  which shed new light on
the issue  studies by evans              and boyd et al         are examples of this class 
both systems employ memory based learning on grammatical feature vectors  boyd et al s
approach also includes a decision tree algorithm that produces less ideal results  in his
attempt to place uses of it into seven categories  including pleonastic and nominal anaphoric
among others  evans uses    features to encode information such as position proximity 
lemmas  and part of speech  related to both the pronoun and other components of interest 
such as words and noun phrases  in the sentence  evans reported        precision and
       recall for binary classification of pleonastic cases  and an overall binary classification
accuracy of         in a later study featuring mars    a fully automatic pronoun resolution
system that employs the same approach  mitkov  evans  and orasan        reported a
significantly higher binary classification accuracy of        when the approach is applied
to technical manuals 
boyd et al s        approach targets pleonastic it alone  it uses    features  most
of which concern lengths of specific syntactic structures  also included are part of speech
information and lemmas of verbs  the study reports an overall precision of     and recall
of      and  more specifically  recalls on extrapositional and cleft constructs of     and
     respectively 
in addition  clemente  torisawa  and satou        used support vector machines with a
feature set similar to that proposed by evans        to analyze biological and medical texts 
and reported an overall accuracy of        higher than that of their own memory based
learning implementation  ng and cardie        built a decision tree for binary anaphoricity
classification on all types of noun phrases  including pronouns  using the c    induction
algorithm  ng and cardie reported overall accuracies of       and       on the muc  
and muc   data sets  categorical results  however  are not reported and it is not possible
to determine the systems performance on pronouns  using automatically induced rules 
muller        reported an overall accuracy of       when detecting non referential it in
spoken dialogs  an inter annotator agreement study conducted in the same paper indicates
that it is difficult even for humans to classify instances of it in spoken dialogs  this finding
is supported by our own experiences 
machine learning approaches are able to partly circumvent the restrictions imposed by
fixed word lists or rigid grammatical patterns through learning  however  their advantage
also comes with a price  training is required in the initial development phase and for
different corpora re training is preferable since lemmas are part of the feature sets  since
the existing approaches fall within the area of supervised learning  i e  training data need
to be manually classified   the limited number of lemmas they gather from training may
lead to degraded performance in unfamiliar circumstances  moreover  the features used
during learning are unable to reliably capture the subtleties of the original sentences  especially when considering non technical documents  for example  the quantitative features
frequently used in machine learning approaches  such as position and distance  become less
reliable when sentences contain a large number of adjuncts  additionally  the meanings of
lemmas are often domain dependent and can vary with their local structural and lexical

environment  such nuances cannot be captured by the lemma features alone  in short 
while machine learning approaches generally deliver better performance classifying it than
their rule based counterparts do  they have their own inherent problems 

   a web based approach
both syntactic patterns and semantics of various clause constituents play important roles in
determining if a third person personal pronoun is pleonastic  the role of grammar is quite
obvious since both extrapositions and clefts must follow the grammatical patterns by which
they are defined  for example  the most commonly seen type of it extraposition follows the
pattern 
it   copula   status   subordinate clause
           it
is
easy
to see why the ancient art is on the ropes 
in contrast  the role semantics plays here is a little obscure until one sits down and starts
to dream up exceptions  paice   husk        analogous to                   it has taken
measures to continue shipments during the work stoppage  vis a vis                   it didnt
take a rocket scientist to change a road bike into a mountain bike         where referential
and pleonastic cases share the same syntactic structure  despite its less overt role  failure
to process semantic information can result in a severe degradation of performance  this
observation is supported by the word list based systems dramatic decay in accuracy when
they are confronted with text other than that they obtained their word lists from 
like every other classification system  the proposed system strives to cover as many cases
as possible and at the same time perform classification as accurately as possible  to achieve
this  it attempts to make good use of both syntactic and semantic information embedded
in sentences  a set of relaxed yet highly relevant syntactic patterns is first applied to the
input text to filter out the syntactically inviable cases  unlike the matching routines of some
previous approaches  this process avoids detailed specification of syntactic patterns  instead 
it tries to include every piece of text containing a construct of possible interest  different
levels of semantic examinations are performed for each subtype of pleonastic constructs 
for reasons discussed later in section        semantic analysis is not performed on clefts 
a wordnet based analysis is used to identify weather time cases because among the
samples examined during the systems development stage  cases pertaining to this class are
relatively uniform in their manner of expression  for the most complex and populous class 
the extrapositions  candidates are subjected to a series of tests performed as queries against
the web  results of the queries provide direct evidence of how a specific configuration of
clause constituents is generally used 
the reason that such a corpus based approach is chosen versus applying manually constructed knowledge sources  such as a word list or wordnet  is fourfold 
   manually constructed knowledge sources  regardless of how comprehensive they are 
contain only a small portion of general world knowledge  in the particular settings
of this study  general world knowledge is used for making judgements such as which
words are allowed to serve as the matrix verb of an extraposition  and even more
subtle  which specific sense of a word is permitted 
   

fiidentification of pleonastic it using the web

   manually compiled knowledge sources are subject to specific manners of organization
that may not satisfy the systems needs  taking wordnet as an example  it identifies
a large number of various relationships among entities  but the information is mainly
organized along the axes of synonyms  hypernyms  kind of relationship   and holonyms
 part of relationship  etc   while it is the surroundings of a particular word that are
of more interest to this study 
   natural languages are evolving quickly  taking english as an example  each year new
words are incorporated into the language  and the rules of grammar have not been
immune to changes either  using a large and frequently updated corpus such as the
web allows the system to automatically adapt to changes in language 
   most importantly  corpora collect empirical evidence of language usage  when the
sample size is large enough  as in the case of the web  statistics on how a specific
construct is generally used in corpora can be employed as an indicator of its speakers
intention 
the proposed approach is also inspired by hearsts        work on mining semantic
relationships using text patterns  and many other quests that followed in the same direction  berland   charniak        poesio  ishikawa  im walde    vieira        markert 
nissim    modjeska        cimiano  schmidt thieme  pivk    staab         unlike these
investigations that focus on the semantic relationship among noun phrases  the pleonastic
pronoun identification problem mandates more complex queries to be built according to
the original sentences  however  the binary nature of the problem also makes it simpler to
apply comparative analysis on results of multiple queries  which  in turn  leads to better
immunity to noise 
figure   illustrates the general work flow of the proposed system  a sentence is first
preprocessed to obtain a dependency tree with part of speech tags  which is then passed
on to the syntactic filtering component to determine whether minimum grammatical requirements of the pleonastic constructs are met  it is also during the syntactic filtering
process that clefts and weather time expressions are identified using syntactic cues and the
wordnet respectively  the candidate extrapositions are thereafter used to instantiate
various queries on search engines  the results returned from the queries serve as parameters
for the final decision making mechanism 
    preprocessing
the preprocessing component transforms the syntactic information embedded in natural
language texts into machine understandable structures  during the preprocessing stage 
each word is assigned a part of speech tag  and the whole sentence is parsed using a dependency grammar  dg  parser  for simplicitys sake  the current system is designed to use the
wsj corpus  which is already tagged and parsed with context free grammar  cfg   a head
percolation table similar to that proposed by collins        is used to obtain the head component of each phrase  the rest of the phrase constituents are then rearranged under the
 
metcalf and barnhart        have compiled a chronicle of many important additions to the vocabulary
of american english

as shown in figure    the function tags  e g  sbj  tmp  and clr  and tracing information
present in the context free parse tree are not ported to the dependency tree  this is because
real world parsers usually do not produce such tags  except this deliberate omission  both
parse trees contain essentially the same information  only presented in different manners 
in this study  dependency structure is preferred over the more popular phrase structure
mainly because of its explicit marking of both the head components and the complementing modifying relationships among various components  this feature is very helpful for
instantiating the search engine queries 
    syntactic filtering
the syntactic filtering process determines whether a clause meets the grammatical requirements of an extraposition or cleft construct by matching the clause against their respective
syntactic patterns 
      extrapositions
it extrapositions occur when a clause is dislocated out of its ordinary position and replaced
with it  an it extraposition usually follows the pattern 
matrix clause
z

   



 noun phrase




adjective phrase
be
 



prepositional phrase
itsubject  







verb phrase

 

 z

matrix verb phrase

  

 







  extraposed clause






 

   

this pattern summarizes the general characteristics of subject it extrapositions  where the
pronoun it assumes the subject position  when the matrix verb  the verb following it  is
the main copula to be  which serves to equate or associate the subject and an ensuing logical
predicate  it must be followed by either a noun phrase  an adjective phrase  or a prepositional
phrase   there is no special requirement for the matrix verb phrase otherwise  similarly 
there is almost no restriction placed upon the extraposed clause except that a full clause
should either be introduced without a complementizer  e g             its a shame their
meeting never took place   or led by that  whether  if  or one of the wh adverbs  e g 
how  why  when  etc    these constraints are developed by generalizing a small portion of
the wsj corpus and are largely in accordance with the patterns identified by kaltenbock
        compared to the patterns proposed by paice and husk         which also cover
cases such as it       to   it       that and it       whether   they allow for a broader range
of candidates by considering sentences that are not explicitly marked  such as             
the above configuration covers sentences such as 
 
other copula verbs do not receive the same treatment  this arrangement is made to accommodate
cases where verbs such as to seem and to appear are immediately followed by an extraposed clause

           since the cost of transporting gas is so important to producers ability to sell it  it helps to have input and access to transportation
companies 
           its a shame their meeting never took place 
           it is insulting and demeaning to say that scientists needed new crises
to generate new grants and contracts       
           it wont be clear for months whether the price increase will stick 
except in the case of the last sentence  the above constructs are generally overlooked by
the previous rule based approaches identified in section      as the last sample sentence
illustrates  the plus sign     in the pattern serves to indicate a forthcoming component
rather than suggest two immediately adjacent components 
some common grammatical variants of the pattern are also recognized by the system 
including questions  both direct and indirect   inverted sentences  and parenthetical expressions  paice   husk         this further expands the patterns coverage to sentences such
as 
           i remembered how hard it was for an outsider to become accepted      
           the sooner our vans hit the road each morning  the easier it is for
us to fulfill that obligation 
           americans it seems have followed malcolm forbess hot air lead and
taken to ballooning in a heady way 
aside from being the subject of the matrix clause  extrapositional it can also appear in
the object position  the system described here captures three flavors of object extraposition 
the first type consists of instances of it followed by an object complement 
           mrs  yeargin was fired and prosecuted under an unusual south
carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security 
in this case the system inserts a virtual copula to be between the object it and the object
complement  a crime   making the construct applicable to the pattern of subject extraposition  for example  the underlined part of the prior example translates into it is a crime
to breach test security 
the other two kinds of object extraposition are relatively rare 
 object of verb  without object complement 
           speculation had it that the company was asking      million for an operation said to be losing about     million a year      
 object of preposition
           they should see to it that their kids dont play truant      
these cases cannot be analyzed within the framework of subject extraposition and thus
must be approached with a different pattern 
verb    preposition  it object   full clause

   

 
neither insulting nor demeaning is in paice and husks        list of task status words and therefore
cannot activate the it       to pattern 

   

fiidentification of pleonastic it using the web

the current system requires that the full clauses start with a complementizer that  this
restriction  however  is included only to simplify implementation  although in object expositions it is more common to have clauses led by that  full clauses without a leading
complementizer are also acceptable 
according to kaltenbocks        analysis there are special cases in which noun phrases
appear as an extraposed component  such as its amazing the number of theologians that
sided with hitler  he noted that these noun phrases are semantically close to subordinate
interrogative clauses and can therefore be considered a marginal case of extraposition  however  no such cases were found in the corpus during the annotation process and they are
consequently excluded from this study 
      cleft
it clefts are governed by a slightly more restricted grammatical pattern  following hedberg
        it clefts can be expressed as follows 
it subject   copula   clefted constituent   cleft clause

   

the cleft clause must be finite  i e  a full clause or a relative clause   and the clefted constituents are restricted to either noun phrases  clauses  or prepositional phrases   examples
of sentences meeting these constraints include 
           its the total relationship that is important 
           it was also in law school that mr  okicki and his first wife had the
first of seven daughters 
           if the market goes down  i figure its paper profits im losing 
in addition  another non canonical and probably even marginal case is also identified as a
cleft 
           i really do not understand how it is that filipinos feel so passionately
involved in this father figure that they want to dispose of and yet they
need 
text following the structure of this sample  where a wh adverb immediately precedes it  is
captured using the same syntactic pattern by appending a virtual prepositional phrase to
the matrix copula  e g  for this reason   as if the missing information has already been
given 
each of the examples above represents a possible syntactic construct of it clefts  while
it is difficult to tell the second and the third cases apart from their respective extrapositional
counterparts  it is even more difficult to differentiate the first case from an ordinary copula
sentence with a restrictive relative clause  rrc   for example  the following sentence 
           its precisely the kind of product thats created the municipal landfill
monster  the editors wrote 
and its slightly modified version 
           its this kind of product thats created the municipal landfill monster  the editors wrote 
 
adjective and adverb phrases are also possible but they are relatively less frequent and are excluded
from this analysis 

   

fili  musilek  reformat    wyard scott

are similar in construction  however  the latter is considered a cleft construct while the
first is an rrc construct  to make things worse  and as pointed out by many  e g  boyd
et al         p    example     sometimes it is impossible to make such a distinction without
resorting to the context of the sentence 
fortunately  in the majority of cases the syntactic features  especially those of the clefted
constituent  provide some useful cues  in an it cleft construct  the cleft clause does not constitute a head modifier relationship with the clefted constituent  but instead forms an existential and exhaustive presupposition   davidse        hedberg        lambrecht        
for example  i figure its paper profits im losing  implies that in the context there is something  and only one thing  that the speaker is going to lose  and further associates paper
profits with it  this significant difference in semantics often leaves visible traces on the syntactic layer  some of which  such as the applicability of proper nouns as clefted constituents 
are obvious  others are less obvious  the system utilizes the following grammatical cues
when deciding if a construct is an it cleft   
 for the clefted constituent 
 proper nouns   or pronouns  which cannot be further modified by an rrc 
 common nouns without determiner  which generally refer to kinds    
 plurals  which violate number agreement 
 noun phrases that are grounded with demonstratives or possessives  or that are
modified by rrcs  which unambiguously identify instances  making it unnecessary in most cases to employ an rrc 
 noun phrases grounded with the definite determiner the  and modified by an
of  preposition whose object is also a noun phrase grounded with the or is in
plural  these constructs are usually sufficient for introducing uniquely identifiable entities  through association   thus precluding the need for additional rrc
modifiers  the words kind  sort  and their likes are considered exceptions of this
rule 
 adverbial constructs that usually do not appear as complements  for example 
phrases denoting location  here  there etc   or a specific time  today  yesterday
etc    or a clause led by when  and
 full clauses  gerunds  and infinitives 
 for the subordinate clause 
 some constructs appear awkward to be used as an rrc  for example  one would
generally avoid using sentences such as it is a place that is dirty  as there are
 

this applies to canonical clefts  which do not include the class represented by            
a construct is considered an it cleft if any of the conditions are met 
  
there are exceptional cases where proper names are used with additional determiners and rrc modifiers  such as in the john who was on tv last night  c f  sloats        account 
  
the validity of this assertion is under debate  krifka         nevertheless  considering the particular
syntactic setting in discussion  it is highly unlikely that bare noun phrases are used to denote specific
instances 
 

   

fiidentification of pleonastic it using the web

better alternatives  in the current implementation two patterns are considered
inappropriate for rrcs  especially in the syntactic settings described in equation    a  the subordinate verb phrase consists of only a copula verb and an
adjective  and b  the subordinate verb phrase consists of no element other than
the verb itself 
 combined 
 when the clefted constituent is a prepositional phrase and the subordinate clause
is a full clause  such as in the case of             the construct is classified as a
cleft    
some of these rules are based on heuristics and may have exceptions  making them less
ideal guidelines  moreover  as mentioned earlier  there are cleft cases that cannot be told
apart from rrcs by any grammatical means  however  experiments show that these rules
are relatively accurate and provide appropriate coverage  at least for the wsj corpus 
      additional filters
aside from the patterns described in earlier sections  a few additional filters are installed
to eliminate some semantically unfit constructs and therefore reducing the number of trips
to search engines  the filtering rules are as follows 
 for a clause to be identified as a subordinate clause and subsequently processed for
extraposition or cleft  the number of commas  dashes and colons between the clause
and it should be either zero or more than one  a rule adopted from paice and husks
       proposal 
 except the copula to be  sentences with matrix verbs appearing in their perfect tense
are not considered for either extraposition or cleft 
 when it is the subject of multiple verb phrases  the sentence is not considered for
either extraposition or cleft 
 sentences having a noun phrase matrix logical predicate together with a subordinate
relative clause are not considered for extraposition 
 sentences having both a matrix verb preceded by modal auxiliaries could or would
and a subordinate clause led by if or a wh adverb are not considered for extraposition 
for example                    it could complete the purchase by next summer if its bid
is the one approved by        is not considered for extraposition 
except for the first  these rules are optional and can be deactivated in case they introduce
false negatives 
    using the web as a corpus
the first question regarding using the web as a corpus is whether it can be regarded as a
corpus at all  as kilgarriff and grefenstette        pointed out  following the definition of
  
in case it is not a cleft  chances are that it is an extraposition  this assumption  therefore  does not
affect the overall binary classification

corpus hood that a corpus is a collection of texts when considered as an object of language
or literary study  the answer is yes  with the fundamental problem resolved  what remains
is to find out whether the web can be an effective tool for nlp tasks 
as a corpus  the web is far from being well balanced or error free  however  it has
one feature in which no other corpus can be even remotely comparable  its size  no one
knows exactly how big it is  but each of the major search engines already indexes billions
of pages  indeed  the web is so large that sometimes a misspelled word can yield tens of
thousands of results  try the word neglectible   this sends out a mixed signal about using
the web as a corpus  on the good side  even relatively infrequent terms yield sizable results 
on the bad side  the web introduces much more noise than manually compiled corpora do 
in markert and nissims        recent study evaluating different knowledge sources for
anaphora resolution  the web based method achieves far higher recall ratio than those that
are bnc  and wordnet based  while at the same time yielding slightly lower precision 
similar things can be said about the webs diverse and unbalanced composition  which
means that it can be used as a universal knowledge source  only if one can manage not to
get overwhelmed by non domain specific information 
that being said  it is still very hard to overstate the benefits that the web offers  as the
largest collection of electronic texts in natural language  it not only hosts a good portion
of general world knowledge  but also stores this information using the very syntax that
defines our language  in addition  it is devoid of the systematic noise introduced into
manually constructed knowledge sources during the compilation process  e g  failure to
include less frequent items or inflexible ways of information organization   overall  the web
is a statistically reliable instrument for analyzing various semantic relationships stored in
natural languages by means of examples 
as also suggested by kilgarriff        and many others  it is technically more difficult
to exploit the web than to use a local corpus and it can often be dangerous to rely solely
on statistics provided by commercial search engines  this is mainly due to the fact that
commercial search engines are not designed for corpus research  worse  some of their design
goals even impede such uses  for example  search engines skew the order of results using a
number of different factors in order to provide users with the best results  combined with
this is the fact that they only return results up to certain thresholds  making it essentially
impossible to get unbiased results  other annoyances include unreliable result counts  lack
of advanced search features     and unwillingness to provide unrestricted access to their
apis  before a new search engine specifically designed for corpus research is available  it
seems we will have to work around some of those restrictions and live with the rest 
    design of search engine queries
as discussed in previous sections  it extrapositions cannot be reliably identified using syntactic signatures alone or in combination with synthetic knowledge bases  to overcome the
artificial limitations imposed by knowledge sources  the proposed system resorts to the web
for the necessary semantic information 
  
for example  the wildcard    feature on google  which could be immensely useful for query construction  no longer restricts its results to single words since       yahoos ability to support alternate words
within quoted texts is limited  while msn does not offer that feature at all 

   

fiidentification of pleonastic it using the web

the system employs three sets of query patterns  the what cleft  the comparative expletive test  and the missing object construction  each set provides a unique perspective of
the sentence in question  the what cleft pattern is designed to find out if the sentence under investigation has a valid what cleft counterpart  since it extrapositions and what clefts
are syntactically compatible  as shown in section        and valid readings can usually be
obtained by transformations from one construct to the other  the validity of the what cleft
is indicative of whether or not the original sentence is extrapositional  the comparative
expletive test patterns are more straightforward  they directly check whether the instance
of it can be replaced by other entities that cannot be used expletively in the same context as
that of an extrapositional it  if the alternate construct is invalid  the original sentence can
be determined as expletive  the third set of patterns are supplemental  they are intended
only for identifying the relatively rare phenomenon of missing object construction  which
may not be reliably handled by the previous pattern sets 
designing the appropriate query patterns is the most important step in efforts to exploit
large corpora as knowledge sources  for complex queries against the web  it is especially
important to suppress unwanted uses of certain components  which could result from different word senses  different sentence configuration  or a speakers imperfect command of the
language  for example  the query it is a shame that could return both a valid extrapositional construct and an rrc such as it is a shame that is perpetuated in his life  and the
query what is right is that could return both valid what clefts and sentences such as why
we ought to do what is right is that        this study employs three different approaches to
curb unwanted results 
 the first and most important measure is comparative analysis  pairs of similarlyconstructed queries are sent out to the search engine and the ratios of result counts
are used for the decision  this method is effective for problems caused by both different
sentence configuration and bad language usage  since generally neither contribute a
fraction of results large enough to significantly affect the ratio  the method also
provides a normalized view of the web because what is of interest to this study is not
exactly how frequently a specific construct is used  but whether it is more likely to
carry a specific semantic meaning when it is used 
 the second measure is to use stubs in query patterns  as detailed in the following
sections  stubs help ensure that the outcomes of queries are syntactically and semantically similar to the original sentences and partly resolve the problems caused by
word sense difference 
 finally  when it is infeasible to use comparative analysis  part of the query results are
validated to obtain an estimated number of valid results 
      query pattern i  the what cleft
the first query pattern 
what   verb phrase   copula   stub

   

is a what  pseudo  cleft construct that encompasses matrix level information found in an
it extraposition  the pattern is obtained using a three step transformation as illustrated

step   transforms the original sentence  or clause  to the corresponding non extraposition
form by removing the pronoun it and restoring the information to the canonical subjectverb complement order  in the above example  the clause to see       is considered the real
subject and is moved back to its canonical position  the non extraposition form is subsequently converted during step   to a what cleft that highlights its verb phrase  finally  in
step    the subordinate clause is reduced into a stub to enhance the patterns coverage  the
choice of stub depends on the structure of the original subordinate clause  to is used when
the original subordinate clause is an infinitive  a gerund  or a for       infinitive construct    
for the rest of the cases  the original complementizer  or that  in the case where there is
no complementizer  is used as stub  the use of a stub in the pattern imposes a syntactic
constraint  in addition to the ones prescribed by the pronoun what and the copula is  that
demands a subordinate clause be present in query results  the choice of stubs also reflects 
to a certain degree  the semantics of the original texts and therefore can be seen as a weak
semantic constraint 
below are a few other examples of the what cleft transformation 
           it remains unclear whether the bond issue will be rolled over  
what remains unclear is whether
           its a shame their meeting never took place  
what is a shame is that
the what cleft pattern only identifies whether the matrix verb phrase is capable of
functioning as a constituent in an it extraposition  information in the subordinate clauses is
discarded because this construct is used relatively infrequently and adding extra restrictions
to the query will prohibit it from yielding results in many cases 
some it extraposition constructs such as it appears that        and it is said that       
do not have a valid non extraposition counterpart  but the what cleft versions often bear
certain degrees of validity and queries instantiated from the pattern will often yield results
 albeit not many  from reputable sources  it is also worth noting that although the input
and output constructs of the transformation are syntactically compatible  they are not
necessarily equivalent in terms of givenness  whether and how information in one sentence
  
according to hamawand         the for       infinitive construct carries distinct semantics  reducing it to
the infinitive alone changes its function  however  with only a few exceptional cases  we find this reduction
generally acceptable  i e  the lost semantics does not affect the judgment of expletiveness 

   

fiidentification of pleonastic it using the web

has been entailed by previous discourse   kaltenbock        noted that the percentage
of extrapositional it constructs carrying new information varies greatly depending on the
category of the text  in contrast  a what cleft generally expresses new information in the
subordinate clause  the presupposed contents in the two constructs are different  too 
what clefts  according to gundel         from which the it clefts are derived  have the
same existential and exhaustive presuppositions carried by their it cleft counterparts  on
the other hand  the it extrapositions  which are semantically identical to their corresponding
non extrapositions  lack such presuppositions or  at most  imply them at a weaker strength
 geurts   van der sandt         these discrepancies hint that a derived what cleft is a
stronger expression than the original extraposition  which may have been why queries
instantiated from the pattern tend to yield considerably less results 
another potential problem with this pattern is its omission of the subordinate verb 
which occasionally leads to false positives  for example  it does not differentiate between
it helps to have input and access to transportation companies and it helps expand our
horizon  this deficiency is accommodated by additional query patterns 
      query pattern ii  comparative expletiveness test
the second group of patterns provides a simplified account of the original text in a few
different flavors  after execution  the results from individual queries are compared to assess
the expletiveness of the subject pronoun  this set of patterns takes the following general
form 
pronoun   verb phrase   simplified extraposed clause
   
the only difference among individual patterns lies in the choice of the matrix clause subject
pronoun  it  which  who  this  and he  when the patterns are instantiated and submitted to
a search engine  the number of hits obtained from the it version should by far outnumber
that of the other versions combined if the original text is an it extraposition  otherwise the
number of hits should be at least comparable  this behavior reflects the expletive nature of
the pronoun in an it extraposition  which renders the sentence invalid when it is replaced
with other pronouns that have no pleonastic use 
a simplified extraposed clause can take a few different forms depending on its original
structure

infinitive  to meet you 
for       infinitive    for him to see the document 
gerund  meeting you

fili  musilek  reformat    wyard scott

similar to the case of pattern i  the stub is used both as a syntactic constraint and a
semantic cue  depending on the type of search engine  the stub can be either the  which
is the most widely used determiner  or a combination of various determiners  personal
pronouns and possessive pronouns  all of which indicate a subsequent noun phrase  in the
case that an infinitive construct involves a subordinate clause led by a wh adverb or that 
the complementizer is used as stub  this arrangement guarantees that the results returned
from the query conform to the original text syntactically and semantically  a null value
should be used for stubs in an object position if the original text lacks a nominal object 
to illustrate the rules of transformation  consider the following sentence 
           my teacher said it was ok for me to use the notes on the test  he
said 
the relevant part of the sentence is 
it   verb phrase   clause
it
was ok
for me to use the notes on the test
applying the clause simplification rules  the first query is obtained

it

the second query is generated by simply replacing the pronoun it with an alternative
pronoun 
alternative pronoun   verb phrase   simplified clause
he

to use the
google reports        hits for the it query  while only one page is found using the alternative
query  since the pronoun it can be used in a much broader context  replacing it with he
alone hardly makes a balanced comparison  instead  the combination of which  who  this 
and he is used  as illustrated in the following examples 
           my teacher said it was ok for me to use the notes on the test  he

      query pattern iii  missing object construction
one search engine annoyance is that they ignore punctuation marks  this means one
can only search for text that matches a specific pattern string  but not sentences that
end with a pattern string  the stubs used in pattern ii are generally helpful for excluding sentences that are semantically incompatible with the original from the search
results  however  under circumstances where no stub is attached to the queries  where the
query results should ideally consist of only sentences that end with the query string   the
search engine may produce more results than needed  sentences conforming to the pattern
it   copula   missing object construction  such as  referring to a book  it is easy to
read  present one such situation  what is unique about the construction  and why special
treatment is needed  is that a missing object construction usually has an it extraposition
counterpart in which the object is present  for example it is easy to read the book   since
the missing object constructions are virtually the same  only shorter  as their extrapositional counterparts  there is a good chance for them to be identified as extrapositions  the
following are some additional examples of the missing object construction 
           where non violent civil disobedience is the centerpiece  rather than
a lawful demonstration that may only attract crime  it is difficult to
justify

           he declined to elaborate  other than to say  it just seemed the right
thing to do at this minute 
two sets of patterns are proposed   to identify the likes of the foregoing examples  the
first pattern  the compound adjective test  is inspired by nannis        study considering
the easy type adjective followed by an infinitive  also commonly termed tough construction 
as a single complex adjective  the pattern takes the form
stub   adjectivebase  to  verb

   

where the stub  serving to limit the outcome of the query to noun phrases  takes a combination of determiners or a an alone  the original adjective is also converted to its base form
adjectivebase if it is in comparative or superlative form  expanding on nannis original
claims  the pattern can be used to evaluate all adjectives   as well as constructs furnished
with for       infinitive complements  the following example demonstrates the patterns
usage 
  

preliminary experiments have confirmed the effectiveness of the patterns  however  due to sparseness
of samples belonging to this class  they are not included in the reported evaluation 
  
this is based on the observation that compounds such as ready to fly  referring to model aircrafts 
exist  and that it is hard to obtain a complete enumeration of the easy type adjectives 

   

fili  musilek  reformat    wyard scott

           the machine uses a single processor  which makes it easier to program
than competing machines using several processors  
an easy to program
the second set consists of two patterns used for comparative analysis with the same
general profile 
that   verbgerund   stub
   
where verbgerund is the gerund form of the original infinitive  the complementizer that is
used for the sole purpose of ensuring that verbgerund appears as the subject of a subordinate
clause in all sentences returned by the queries  in other words  phrases such as computer
programming and pattern matching are excluded  for the first pattern  the stub is a
combination of prepositions  currently in and from are chosen   for the second one  a
combination of determiners or the alone is used  for example 
           the machine uses a single processor  which makes it easier to program
than competing machines
using several processors  
 
in from
that programming
the
this set of patterns tests the transitivity of the verb in a semantic environment similar
to that of the original sentence  if the verb is used transitively more often  the pattern
with determiners should yield more results  and vice versa  as supported by all preceding
sample sentences  a usually transitive verb used without an object   is a good indicator of
missing object construction and the sentence should be diagnosed as referential 
      query instantiation
patterns must be instantiated with information found in original sentences before they are
submitted to a search engine  considering the general design principles of the system  it is
not advisable to instantiate the patterns with original texts  doing so significantly reduces
the queries coverage  instead  the object of the matrix verb phrase is truncated and the
matrix verb expanded in order to obtain the desired level of coverage 
the truncation process provides different renditions based on the structure of the original
object 
 adjective phrases 
only the head word is used  when the head word is modified by not or too  the
modifier is also retained in order to better support the too       to construct and to
maintain compatibility with the semantics of the original text 
 common noun phrases 
 with a possessive ending pronoun  or an of  preposition 
the phrase is replaced by  prps  plus the head word   prps  is either a list of
possessive pronouns or one of those more widely used  depending on caliber of
the search engine used  for example  his location can be expanded to its   my
  our   his   her   their   your location 
  
an omitted object of a preposition  e g  it is difficult to account for   has the same effect  but it is
identifiable through syntactic means alone 

   

fiidentification of pleonastic it using the web

 with determiners 
the phrase is replaced by a choice of  dta    dtts    dttp   or a combination
of  dta  and  dtts   plus the head word   dta  is a list of  or one of the 
general determiners  i e  a  an  any etc     dtts  refers to the combination of
the definite article the and the singular demonstratives this and that   dttp  is
the plural counterpart of  dtts   the choice is based on the configuration of
the original text so as to maintain semantic compatibility 
 without determiner 
only the head word is used 
 proper nouns and pronouns 
the phrase is replaced by  prp   which is a list of  or one of the  personal pronouns 
 prepositional phrases 
the object of the preposition is truncated in a recursive operation 
 numeric values 
the phrase a lot is used instead 
matrix verbs are expanded to include both the simple past tense and the third person singular present form with the aid of wordnet and some generic patterns  where
applicable  particles such as out and up also remain attached to the verb 
generally speaking  truncation and expansion are good ways of boosting the patterns
coverage  however  the current procedures of truncation are still crude  especially in
their handling of complex phrases  for example  the phrase a reckless course of action
             yields  prps  course  which results in a total loss of the original semantics 
further enhancements of the truncation process may improve the performance but the
improvement will likely be limited due to the endless possibilities of language usage and
constraints imposed by search engines 
aside from truncating and expanding the original texts  a stepped down version of
pattern ii  denoted pattern ii    is also provided to further enhance the systems coverage 
the current scheme is to simply replace the extraposed clause with a new stub  to  if the
original extraposed clause is an infinitive  a for       infinitive  or a gerund construct  for

estimated popularity of the what cleft construct  query pattern i

fili  musilek  reformat    wyard scott

where nw is the number of results reported by the search engine  and vw is the
percentage of valid instances within the first batch of snippets  usually     depending
on the search engine service  returned with the query  validation is performed with
a case sensitive regular expression derived from the original query  since the whatcleft pattern is capitalized at the beginning  the regular expression only looks for
instances appearing at the beginning of a sentence  it is particularly important to
validate the results of what cleft queries because some search engines can produce
results based on their own interpretation of the original query  for example  google
returns pages containing whats found is that for the query what found is that 
which might be helpful for some but is counterproductive for the purpose of this
study 
result of the comparative expletiveness test  query pattern ii 
denoted as
nx
r 
nit
where nit is the number of results obtained from the original it version of the query 
and nx is the total number of results produced by replacing it with other pronouns
such as which and who  the smaller the ratio r is  the more likely that the sentence
being investigated is an extraposition  extrapositional sentences usually produce
an r value of     or less  when both versions of the query yield insufficient results
 max nit   nx     nmin    r takes the value rscarce         since it extrapositions
are relatively rare  it is better to assume that a sentence is not extrapositional when
there is insufficient data to judge otherwise  in the case where nx is sufficient but the
it version of the query produces no result  nx    nmin and nit       r takes the
value rzero        values of rzero and rscarce are large numbers chosen arbitrarily 
mainly for visualization purposes  in other words both rzero and rscarce hint that
the sentence is probably not extrapositional  however neither indicates the degree of

page       the stepped down queries are simplified versions of the queries used to
calculate r  due to this simplification  r  is usually more sensitive to extrapositions 
however not all queries have stepped down versions  in which case the original queries
are reused  causing r    r  similar to the way r is defined  r  also takes the values

r    if max nit   nx     nmin  

if the original queries yield enough results  r takes the value of r since the original
queries better preserve sentence context and are generally more accurate  however 
   

fiidentification of pleonastic it using the web

when original queries fail  the system resorts to the back up method of using the
stepped down queries and bases its judgement on their results instead  overall  r
can be seen as a synthesized indicator of how the subject pronoun is generally used
in a similar syntactic and semantic setting to that of the original sentence 
syntactic structure of the sentence
denoted as s  a binary variable indicating if the sentence under investigation belongs
to a syntactic construct that is more prone to generating false positives  on average
the what cleft queries yield fewer results and are less reliable since they cannot be
used to provide comparative ratios  however  they are still useful as the last line of
defence to curb the impacts of certain syntactic constructs that repeatedly cause the
comparative expletive tests to produce false positives  currently only one construct
is identified  the it verb infinitive construct  as in it helps to have input from
everyone and it expects to post the results tomorrow   therefore 
 

s 

true  if sentence matches it verb infinitive 
false  otherwise 

the final binary classification of it extraposition  e  is defined as follows 
 

e 

  r   rexp   and  w   nmin     if s   true 
 r   rexp   
if s   false 

    

where nmin and rexp   set to    and      respectively in this study  are threshold constants
chosen based upon empirical observations  in other words  the system recognizes an instance of it as extrapositional if it is unlikely  by comparing r to rexp   that an alternative
pronoun is used in its place under the same syntactic and semantic settings  for it verb
infinitive constructs  it is also required that the sentence has a viable what cleft variant
 by comparing w to nmin   
it is worth noting that todays major commercial search engines do not return the exact
number of results for a query but rather their own estimates  the negative effect of this is
somewhat mitigated by basing the final decision on ratios instead of absolute numbers

to better illustrate the system work flow  two sample sentences are selected from the wsj
corpus to be taken through the whole process  the first sample              is classified as

   evaluation
in order to provide a comprehensive picture of the systems performance  a twofold assessment is used  in the first evaluation  the system is exposed to the same sentence collection
that assisted its development  accordingly  results obtained from this evaluation reflect 
to a certain degree  the systems optimal performance  the second evaluation aims at revealing the systems performance on unfamiliar texts by running the developed system on
a random dataset drawn from the rest of the corpus  two additional experiments are also
conducted to provide an estimation of the systems performance over the whole corpus 
three performance measures are used throughout the section  precision  recall  and the
balanced f measure  van rijsbergen         precision is defined as the ratio of correctly
classified instances in a specific category  or a collection of categories  to the number of
instances identified by the system as belonging to the category  categories   in other words 
p
precision is calculated as p   t pt f
p   where t p and f p are the number of true positives
and false positives respectively  recall is defined as the ratio of correctly classified instances
in a specific category  or a collection of categories  to the total number of instances in the
p
category  categories   or r   t pt f
n   where f n denotes the number of false negatives 
finally  the f measure is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall used to indicate
a systems overall performance  when precision and recall are weighted equally  as used in
r
this study  the balanced f measure is defined as f   p p r
 
following efron and tibshiranis        bootstrap method      confidence intervals
are obtained using the    th and     th percentiles of the bootstrap replicates and are
provided alongside the system performance figures to indicate their reliability  the number
of replicates is arbitrarily set at b         which is much greater than the commonly
suggested value of       e g   see davison   hinkley        efron   tibshirani       
because pleonastic instances are sparse  in the case that a precision or recall value is      
the bootstrap percentile method reports an interval of            which makes little sense 
therefore  in this situation the adjusted wald interval  agresti   coull        is presented
instead  when two systems are compared  an approximate randomization test  noreen 
      similar to that used by chinchor        is performed to determine if the difference is
of statistical significance  the significance level         and number of shuffles r        
both chosen arbitrarily  are used where significance tests are performed

    development dataset
for the purpose of this study  the first      occurrences of it from the wsj corpus have been
manually annotated by the authors     a part of the set has also been inspected in order
to determine the values of the constants specified in section      and to develop the surface
structure processor  the annotation process is facilitated by a custom designed utility that
displays each sentence within its context represented by a nine sentence window containing
the six immediately preceding sentences  the original  and the two sentences that follow 
post annotation review indicates that this presentation of corpus sentences worked well 
except for a few  less than       cases  the authors found no need to resort to broader
contexts to understand a sentence  and under no circumstances were valid antecedents
located outside the context window while no antecedent was found within it

consensus  the category labeled other consists mostly of instances that do not fit well
into any other categories  e g  when the identified nominal antecedent is in plural or the
antecedent is inferred  as well as certain confusing instances  out of the twenty six instances 
only two might be remotely recognized as one of the types that interests this study 
           and though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant  recent experience with a similar program in central america
indicates that it could take several years before the new polish government can fully use the aid effectively 
           its just comic when they try to pretend theyre still the master race 
neither instance can be identified as anaphoric  however  the first construct has neither a
valid non extraposition version nor a valid what cleft version  making it difficult to justify
as an extraposition  while the it in the second case is considered to refer to the atmosphere
aroused by the action detailed in the when clause 
in order to assess whether the pleonastic categories are well defined and the ability of
ordinary language users to identify pleonastic instances  two volunteers  both native english
speakers  are invited to classify the it instances in the development dataset  to help them
concentrate on the pleonastic categories  the volunteers are only required to assign each
instance to one of the following categories  referential  extraposition  cleft  weather time

the simplified annotation scheme used by the volunteers 
there are many factors contributing to the apparently low  values in table    most
notably the skewed distribution of the categories and inappropriate communication of the
classification rules  as di eugenio and glass        and others pointed out  skewed distribution of the categories has a negative effect on the  value  since the distribution of
the it instances in the dataset is fairly unbalanced  the commonly accepted guideline for
interpreting  values          and        as thresholds for tentative and definite conclusions respectively  krippendorff        may not be directly applicable in this case  in
addition  the classification rules are communicated to the annotators orally through examples and some of the not so common cases  such as the object it extrapositions  might not
have been well understood by both annotators  another interesting note about the results
is that there is a strong tendency for both annotators  albeit on different cases  to classify
it clefts as it extrapositions  rather than taking this as a sign that the cleft category is not
well defined  we believe it reflects the inherent difficulties in identifying instances pertaining
to the category 
    baselines
two baselines are available for comparison  the wsj annotation  which is done manually
and provided with the corpus  and the results from a replication of paice and husks       
algorithm  pha   it should be cautioned that  given the subjectivity of the issues discussed
in this paper and lack of consensus on certain topics in the field of linguistics  recall ratios of
the presented baseline results and the forthcoming results of the proposed system should not
be compared quantitatively  for example  the original paice and husk algorithm does not
recognize certain types of object extrapositions and does not always distinguish between

individual types of pleonastic it  and the wsj corpus has neither special annotation for
parenthetical it  c f  section        page                  nor an established annotation
policy for certain types of object extrapositions  bies  ferguson  katz    macintyre        
no attempts have been made to correct these issues 
table    summarizes the performance of the baselines on the development dataset  as
expected  paice and husks        algorithm does not perform very well since the wsj
articles are very different from  and tend to be more sophisticated than  the technical
essays that the algorithm was designed for  compared to the originally reported precision
of     and recall of      the replicated pha yields only     and     respectively on the
development dataset  the performance of the replica is largely in line with what boyd et al

fiidentification of pleonastic it using the web

by stating that the characteristic of it extraposition is that the final clause can replace
it  bies et al         define the class in the narrowest sense  since interpretation of the
definition is entirely a subjective matter  there is no way of determining the real coverage
of the annotations  however  from the portions of the corpus that have been reviewed  the
practice of annotation is not entirely consistent 
two sentences are marked as extraposition in the corpus but the annotators consensus
indicates otherwise  considering the golden standard status of the wsj corpus  they are
also listed here 
           moreover  as a member of the mitsubishi group  which is headed by
one of japans largest banks  it is sure to win a favorable loan 
           it is compromises such as this that convince washingtons liberals
that if they simply stay the course  this administration will stray
from its own course on this and other issues 
the first sentence is considered dubious and most likely referring to the company that is a
member of the mitsubishi group  the second one is considered a cleft and is actually also
marked as cleft in the corpus  since it is the only case in the corpus with both annotations 
the extraposition marking was considered a mistake and was manually removed 
the paice and husk        algorithm suffers from false positive it       that and it       to
construct detection  which may be fixed by incorporating part of speech and phrase structure information together with additional rules  however  such fixes will greatly complicate

using the authors annotation as reference  the system outperforms both human volunteers  while higher performance is usually desirable  in this particular case  it could
indicate possible problems in the design of the experiment  since the english language is
not only used by its speakers but also shaped by the same group of people  it is impractical to have a system that speaks better english than its human counterparts do  one
plausible clue to the paradox is that an analytic approach is needed to gain insight into
the issue of pronoun classification  but the casual english speakers do not see it from that
perspective  as green and hecht        and many others indicated  capable users of a
language do not necessarily have the ability to formulate linguistic rules  however  these
kinds of analytic skills is a prerequisite in order to explicitly classify a pronoun into one of
the many categories  thus  the true performance of casual speakers can only be measured
by their ability to comprehend or produce the various pleonastic constructs  in addition 
other factors  such as time constraints and imperfections in how the category definitions
are conveyed  may also play a role in limiting the volunteers performance  the authors
annotation  on the other hand  is much less influenced by such issues and is therefore considered expert opinion in this experiment  as shown in section      the wsj annotation of
extrapositions and clefts  which is also considered expert opinion  is highly compatible with
that of the authors  the differences between the two annotations can mostly be attributed
to the narrower definition of extraposition adopted by the wsj annotators  therefore  the
wsj annotations precision of        for extrapositions  when verified against the authors
   

fiidentification of pleonastic it using the web

annotation  is probably a more appropriate hint of the upper limit for practically important
system performance 
in the extraposition category      individual cases passed the syntactic filters and were
evaluated by search engine queries  results of queries are obtained from google through its
web service  the google soap   search api  all three            cases of false positives
are caused by missing object constructions and can be corrected using the patterns detailed
in section       
the five            false negative cases are listed below

action for president bush to claim the authority without congressional approval 
           worse  it remained to a well meaning but naive president of the
united states to administer the final infamy upon those who fought
and died in vietnam 
           its not easy to roll out something that comprehensive  and make
it pay  mr  jacob says 
sentence            is misplaced as weather time  sentence            is not properly handled by the syntactic processing subcomponent  sentences            and            involve
complex noun phrases  underlined  at the object position of the matrix verbs  it is very
difficult to reduce them to something more generic  such as the head noun only or a pronoun  and still remain confident that the original semantics are maintained  the last case 
sentence             fails because the full queries  containing part of the subordinate clause 
failed to yield enough results and the stepped down versions are overwhelmed by noise 
the last four false negatives are annotated correctly in the wsj corpus  the systems
recall ratio on the    verified wsj extraposition annotations is therefore         comparable
to the overall recall 
    system performance on parser output
thus far  the system has been evaluated based on the assumption that the underlying
sentences are tagged and parsed with  almost  perfect accuracy  much effort has been
made to reduce such dependency  for example  tracing information and function tags in the
original phrase structures are deliberately discarded  and the system also tries to search for
possible extraposed or cleft clauses that are marked as complements to the matrix object 
however  deficiencies in tagging and parsing may still impact the systems performance 
occasionally  even the golden standard manual markups appear problematic and happen
to get in the way of the task 
  

the simple object access protocol is an xml based message protocol for web services 

   

fili  musilek  reformat    wyard scott

it is therefore necessary to evaluate the system on sentences that are automatically
tagged and parsed in order to answer the question of how well it would perform in the
real world  two state of the art parsers are employed for this study  the reranking parser
by charniak and johnson         and the berkeley parser by petrov  barrett  thibaux

    correlation analysis for extrapositions
figures   through   illustrate the correlation between the decision factors and the true
expletiveness of the pronoun it in question  all     items that passed the initial syntactic
filtering process are included in the dataset with the first     being extrapositional and
the rest separated by a break on the x axis  this arrangement is made in order to better
visualize the contrast between the positive group and the negative group  in figures  
through    different grey levels are used to indicate the number of results returned by
queries  the darker the shade  the more popular the construct in question is on the web 
the constant rexp        is also indicated with a break on the y axis

as illustrated  all factors identified in section     are good indicators of expletiveness  w
 figure    is the weakest of the four factors due to the number of false positives produced by
incorrect language usage  this is clear evidence that the web is noisier than ordinary corpora
and that the results counts from the web may not be appropriate as the sole decision making
factor  in comparison  r  figure    has almost perfect correlation with the expletiveness
of instances  however  full versions of the queries usually return fewer results and in many
cases yield too few results for expletive cases  unfilled items plotted on top of the graph
indicate cases that do not have enough results  c f  section       the stepped down versions
of the queries  figure     while being less accurate by themselves  serve well when used as
back up  as illustrated by the r plot  figure     part of the false positive outliers on the
r plot are produced by full queries for expressions that are habitually associated with it 
such as                   said it expects to post sales in the current fiscal year         when
used with a pronoun  these expressions usually describe information quoted from a person
or organization already named earlier in the same sentence  making it a more natural
choice of subject pronoun  normally the problematic expressions take the form of verb
infinitive complement  i e  s true  according to the decision process described in
section      w is also considered in this situation  which effectively eliminates such noise

the reported recall ratios and f measures are for the synthetic dataset only and cannot be extended

three of the false positives produced by the proposed approach are actually extrapositions     which is expected  c f  footnote     page       thus  in a binary classification
of pleonastic it  items in the cleft category will have higher contributions to the overall
precision than they do for their own category  until the whole corpus is annotated  it is
impossible to obtain precise recall figures of either the wsj annotations or the proposed
approach  however  since the rest of the corpus  other than the synthetic dataset  does not
contain any true positives for either system and contains the same number of false negatives
for both systems  the proposed system will maintain a higher recall ratio than that of the
wsj annotations on the whole corpus 
a similar experiment is conducted for extrapositions using sentences that are already
annotated in the corpus  all     annotated extrapositional it instances are manually verified
and              of them turn out to be valid cases  the system produced queries for    
instances and consequently recognized     of them  translating into             c i               recall ratio on the verified annotations  given the fact that on both the development
dataset and the test dataset the proposed system yields slightly higher recall on the whole
dataset than it does on the subsets identified by wsj annotations  its performance for
extrapositions on the whole wsj corpus is likely to remain above     in recall 
similar to the situation in the test based on random cases  a large portion of falsepositives are contributed by imperfect handling of both surface structures and noun phrases
in the matrix object position  particularly in the form of it takes took       to       from
additional experiments  it seems that this particular construct can be addressed with a
different pattern  what whatever it takes to verb  which eliminates the noun phrase 
alternatively  the construct could possibly be assumed as extrapositional without issuing
queries at all 
  
this kind of cleft can be separated from extrapositions using an additional pattern that attaches the
prepositional phrase to the subordinate verb  however  the number of samples are too few to justify its
inclusion in the study

   discussion
in this paper a novel pleonastic it identification system is proposed  unlike its precursors 
the system classifies extrapositions by submitting queries to the web and analyzing returned
results  a set of rules are also proposed for classification of clefts  whose particular manner
of composition makes it more difficult to apply the web based approach  components of the
proposed system are simple and their effectiveness should be independent of the type of text
being processed  as shown in the generalization tests  the system maintains its precision
while recall degrades by only a small margin when confronted with unfamiliar texts  this
is an indication that the general principles behind the system are not over fitted to the text
from which they were derived  overall  when evaluated on wsj news articles  which can
be considered a difficult type of nonfiction  the system is capable of producing results
that are on par with or only slightly inferior to that of casually trained humans 
the systems success has important implications beyond the particular problem of
pleonastic it identification  first  it shows that the web can be used to answer linguistic questions that are based upon more than just simplistic semantic relationships  second 
the comparative study is an effective means to get highly accurate results from the web despite the fact that it is noisier than the manually compiled corpora  in addition  the success
of the simple guidelines used in identifying clefts may serve as evidence that a speakers
intention can be heavily reflected by the surface structures of her utterance  in a bid to
make it distinguishable from similarly constructed sentences 
some problems are left unaddressed in the current study  most notably the handling
of complex noun phrases and prepositional phrases  generally speaking  its approach to
query instantiation is somewhat crude  to solve the noun phrase issue  a finer grained query
downgrading is proposed  viz  first to supply the query with the original noun phrase  then
the head noun  and finally the adjective that modifies the head noun  if there is one  the
effectiveness of this approach is to be determined  as discussed in section        a special
rule can be used for the verb take  this  however  may open the door to exception based
processing  which contradicts the principle of the system to provide a unified approach to
pleonastic pronoun identification  overall  much more data and further experiments are
needed before the query instantiation procedures can be finalized 
aside from the two sets of patterns that are currently in use  other information can
be used to assess the validity of a possible extraposition  for example  in extrapositions
the matrix verbs are much more likely to remain in present tense than past tense  the
noun phrases  if any  at the matrix object position are more likely to be indefinite  and
the extraposed clauses are generally longer than the matrix verb phrases  a fuzzy based
decision system with multiple input variables could possibly provide significant performance
gains 
although the system is able to yield reasonable performances on the output of either
parser tested  both of them introduce additional errors to the final results  on the combined
dataset of development and test items  both parsers cause statistically significant deteriorations in performance at a significance level of      charniak parser  p       for f measure
on extrapositions  p       for f measure on clefts   it is possible that incorporating a
pattern based method will compensate for the problems caused by imperfect parsing and
further improve recall ratios  however  more data is needed to confirm this 
   

fiidentification of pleonastic it using the web

another concern is that the syntactic processing component used in the system is limited 
this limitation  caused by the designers lack of exposure to a large variety of different
constructs  is essentially different from the problem imposed by the limited number of
patterns in some previous systems  eventually  for the proposed system  this limitation can
be eliminated  to illustrate  the current design is not able to correctly process sentences like
what difference does it make which i buy  however  it only takes minor effort to correct this
by upgrading the subsystem so that it recognizes pre posed objects  each such upgrade 
which may be performed manually or even automatically through some machine learning
approaches  solves one or more syntactic problems and moves the system closer to being able
to recognize all grammatically valid constructs  in contrast  it will take considerably more
effort to patch the rigidly defined rules or to upgrade the word lists before the rule based
systems can achieve comparable performances 
during the writing of this article  google deprecated their soap based search api  this
move makes it technically difficult to precisely replicate the results reported in this study
since other search engines lack the ability to process alternate expressions  i e  worda or
wordb   embedded within a quoted query  to use a different search engine  the matrix verbs
should not be expanded but should instead be converted to their respective third person
singular present form only  stubs should also be in their simplest form only  as described
in earlier sections  from preliminary experiments it also seems possible to replace the
combination of which who this he with they alone  plus some necessary changes to maintain
number agreement among the constituents of the queries  these changes may have some
negative effects on the final outcome of the system  but they are unlikely to be severe 
like most other nlp tasks  classifying the usage of it is inherently difficult  even for
human annotators who already have some knowledge about the problem  it is one thing
to speak the language  and another to then clearly explain the rationale behind a specific
construct  although it is widely accepted that an extrapositional it is expletive  the line
between extrapositional cases and referential ones can sometimes be very thin  this is
clearly manifested by the existence of truncated extrapositions  gundel et al          which
obviously have valid referential readings  similar things can be said about the relationship
among all three pleonastic categories as well as idioms  for example  paice and husk classify
it remains to        as an idiom while the same construct is classified as an extraposition
in our evaluations  aside from applying the syntactic guidelines proposed in this study  it
is assumed during the annotation process that an extraposition should have either a valid
non extraposed reading or a valid what cleft reading  it is also assumed that a cleft should
generate a valid non clefted reading by joining the clefted constituent directly to the cleft
clause without any leading relative pronoun or adverb  in light of the subjective nature
of the problem  our annotations are published on the web as an online appendix to better
serve readers
