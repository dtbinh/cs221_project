abstract

an important characteristic of many logics for artificial intelligence is their nonmonotonicity  this means that adding a formula to the premises can invalidate some of the
consequences  there may  however  exist formulae that can always be safely added to the
premises without destroying any of the consequences  we say they respect monotonicity 
also  there may be formulae that  when they are a consequence  can not be invalidated
when adding any formula to the premises  we call them conservative  we study these
two classes of formulae for preferential logics  and show that they are closely linked to the
formulae whose truth value is preserved along the  preferential  ordering  we will consider some preferential logics for illustration  and prove syntactic characterization results
for them  the results in this paper may improve the eciency of theorem provers for
preferential logics 

   introduction
over the past decades  many non classical logics for artificial intelligence have been defined
and investigated  the need for such logics arose from the unsuitability of classical logics to
describe defeasible reasoning  these classical logics are monotonic  which means that their
consequence relation  j  satisfies 
 ff  fi   

   ff j fi   ff     j fi  

 monotonicity 

this means that whenever we learn new information     and add this to what we already
know  ff   all the old theorems  fi   are still derivable  this is clearly undesirable when
describing defeasible reasoning  therefore  monotonicity is not satisfied by many logics for
artificial intelligence 
on the other hand  monotonicity is a very attractive feature from a practical point of
view  when learning new information  we do not have to start all over again  but we can
retain our old conclusions  and focus on deriving possible new ones  furthermore  when we
have a lot of information  we are allowed to focus on only part of it  conclusions derived
from this part are then automatically also valid when considering all the information we
have  this is sometimes called local reasoning  
even though it is clear that we do not want monotonicity to hold in general  it might
be worthwhile to investigate restricted variants of monotonicity  in the past  such variants
have been defined which allow us to keep the old theorems  when either the new information follows from the old premise  this variant is called cautious monotonicity by kraus 
lehmann    magidor        or its negation can not be derived from the old premise  this
is called rational monotonicity by kraus et al

we will take a somewhat different perspective  and consider two classes of formulae  the
class of formulae that can always be added to a premise without invalidating old conclusions
 we say these formulae respect monotonicity   and the class of formulae which can always be
retained as conclusions  no matter which new information is added to the premise  we say
these formulae are conservative   the advantages of monotonicity sketched above would
still hold when we restrict   to the class of formulae that respect monotonicity  or when
we restrict fi to be conservative  whether such classes exist  and what these classes are 
depends of course on the particular nonmonotonic logic considered  we will focus here on
an important class of nonmonotonic logics  the class of preferential logics  shoham       
       these logics are based on a monotonic logic  such as propositional logic  predicate
logic or modal logic  augmented with a preference order on its models  the nonmonotonic
consequences of a formula ff are those formulae which are true in all models of ff which
are minimal in the preference order among all models of ff  an extensive discussion of
preferential logics is provided by van benthem         we will give a formal definition 

definition    preferential logic  a preferential logic consists of a language l  a class

of models mod together with a satisfaction relation j  between models and formulae  and
a partial order  on mod  a model m   mod is called a minimal model of a formula ff
 denoted m j  ff  if m j  ff and for all models n  if n  m and n j  ff then n   m 
preferential entailment  j    between formulae is defined as follows  for ff  fi   l   ff j  fi
if fi is true in all minimal models of ff 

our presentation uses a partial order  i e   a reexive  antisymmetric and transitive
relation  shoham        uses a strict partial order  i e   an irreexive transitive relation 
with a slightly different notion of minimal model  the presentations can be translated into
each other 
it will turn out that formulae whose truth is preserved when going to more preferred
or less preferred models  play an important role with respect to the two classes of formulae
defined above  the class of formulae that respect monotonicity  and the class of conservative
formulae   we will first give a definition 

definition    persistence  given a preferential logic  l  mod  j      a formula ff   l is
called downward persistent in this logic  if

 m  n   mod    m j  ff

and n  m    n j  ff 

and it is called upward persistent if
 m  n   mod    n j  ff

and n  m    m j  ff 

in the next section  we will introduce some preferential logics to illustrate the material
in the rest of the paper  in section   we will consider formulae that respect monotonicity 
and in section   conservative formulae will be treated  the practical implications of the
results of this paper are discussed in section    section   gives conclusions and suggestions
for further research  part of the material in this paper appeared in  engelfriet      b  
 

fimonotonicity and persistence in preferential logics

   some preferential logics

in this section we will describe the following preferential logics  ground s   minimal temporal epistemic logic and circumscription  since we have already defined preferential
entailment in general  for each logic we only have to give its ingredients  i e   l  mod  j  
and   the preferential entailment relation is then fixed by definition    the first logic we
will consider is ground s  

    ground s 

ground s  is a nonmonotonic modal logic for auto epistemic reasoning  originally proposed
by halpern and moses         their aim was to formalize statements of the form  i only
know     it allows  for example  to derive that an agent which only knows p  does not
know q  ground s  falls into the general scheme of ground nonmonotonic modal logics
 donini  nardi    rosati         a lot of interest is devoted to logics of minimal knowledge
 levesque        schwarz   truszczynski        chen        halpern        
semantically  states in which an agent only knows    are states in which   is known  but
otherwise the amount of knowledge is minimal  we will use a modal propositional language
to express the knowledge of the agent  and s  will be the monotonic logic  we will give a
treatment of ground s  slightly different  but equivalent to the one given by halpern and
moses        

definition    epistemic language  let p be a  finite or countably infinite  set of propositional atoms  the language ls  is the smallest set closed under 


if p   p then p   ls   



if   

  ls 

then k              ls   

furthermore  we introduce the following abbreviations 

  

         

      

     

  m    k        p    p        

if every atom occurring in a formula   is in the scope of a k operator  we call   subjective 

an example of a subjective formula is  kp   k  q   p   whereas k  p   q    s is not
subjective  in the rest of this paper we will only be interested in subjective formulae  they
describe  just  the knowledge and ignorance of the agent 
in the usual s  semantics  a model is a triple  w  r     where w is a set of worlds  r is
an equivalence relation on w and  is a function that assigns a propositional valuation to
each world in w   we may however  in the case of one agent  restrict ourselves to normal s 
models  in which the relation is universal  each world is accessible from every world   and
worlds are identified with propositional valuations  a proof of soundness and completeness
of s  with respect to these semantics is given by meyer   van der hoek        

definition    s  semantics  let p be a  finite or countably infinite  set of propositional

atoms  a propositional valuation is a function from p into f    g where   stands for false
and   for true  the set of all such valuations will be denoted by mod p    a normal s 
 

fiengelfriet

model m is a non empty subset of mod p    the truth of an s  formula   in such a model 
evaluated in a world m   m   denoted  m  m  j s     is defined inductively 
    m  m  j s  p
  m p       for p   p
    m  m  j s         m  m  j s    and  m  m  j s 
    m  m  j s       it is not the case that  m  m  j s   
    m  m  j s  k     m  m    j s    for every m    m
we have the following elementary results on subjective formulae  the proofs are straightforward 

proposition    subjective formulae 

   let   be a subjective formula  for a normal s  model m and m    m    m it holds 
 m  m    j s       m  m    j s    
we define m j s    if  m  m  j s    for some  or  equivalently  all m   m   the set
of all normal s  models  sometimes called information states  is denoted by is 
   an s  formula   is subjective if and only if it is equivalent to a formula of the form
k  with     ls  
a subjective formula describes the knowledge of an agent  but we want to formalize that
this is all the agent knows  therefore we are looking for models in which the knowledge of
the agent is minimal  or in other words  in which the ignorance of the agent is maximal  we
introduce a preference order over information states which favors models with less knowledge  the definition of this ordering is based on the observation that the more valuations
the agent considers possible  the less knowledge the agent has  indeed  for any propositional
formula   we have  if m  j  k  and m   m  then m  j  k  
definition    degree of knowledge  we define the degree of knowledge ordering  on
normal s  models as follows  for m    m    is   m   m    m   m   
ground s  is the preferential logic based on this ordering 
definition    ground s   ground s  is the preferential logic with the subjective formulae of ls  as its language  is as its class of models  the satisfaction relation of proposition  
and the ordering of definition    we will denote preferential entailment  as defined in definition    of ground s  by j gs   
the reader can now check that  for instance  kp j gs   kq  the  unique  minimal
s  model of kp consists of all propositional valuations in which p is true  and this indeed
contains a model in which q is false  the entailment relation is nonmonotonic since kp  
kq  j gs   kq  another example illustrates the minimality of the agent s knowledge  kp  
kq j gs    kp   kq  
let us define a consequence relation j by   j if k  j gs  k   then it turns out
that this is the consequence relation of halpern and moses         apart from the fact that
they only defined it for premises which have a unique minimal model  premises with a
unique minimal model are called honest  to give an example  the formula kp is honest 
but kp   kq is not  both the s  model consisting of all valuations in which p is true  and
the model with all valuations in which q is true  are minimal models 
 

fimonotonicity and persistence in preferential logics

    minimal temporal epistemic logic

in ground s   we are only able to express something about  all the agent knows  at a
particular instant  we will extend this logic in such a way that we are also able to say
something about the changing knowledge of the agent over time  originally  this extended
logic was intended as a means of specifying nonmonotonic reasoning processes and of reasoning about their properties  engelfriet   treur              engelfriet      a   the idea
is that a temporal formula describes the nonmonotonic inferences the agent has to perform
during the course of a reasoning process  analogously to the use of temporal logic for specifying computer processes   but these inferences should also be the only cause of increases
in the agent s knowledge  therefore  we again have to minimize the agent s knowledge  but
now over time  analogously to the use of minimization for dealing with the frame problem
in temporal logics for describing action and change  shoham         to this end  we will
temporalize the epistemic language  epistemic models and the degree of knowledge ordering 
in order to describe past and future we introduce temporal operators p  h  f  g and
   denoting respectively  sometimes in the past    always in the past    sometimes in the
future    always in the future  and  always   we do not want to describe the agent s knowledge of the future and past  but the future and past of the agent s knowledge  therefore 
temporal operators are not allowed to occur within the scope of the epistemic k operator 

definition    temporal epistemic language  the language
closed under 


if     ls  then     ltel  



if ff  fi   ltel then ff   fi   ff  pff  fff   ltel  

ltel

is the smallest set

again the abbreviations for         and   are introduced  as well as 

gff   f   ff   hff   p   ff  and  ff  hff   ff   gff 
if in the first clause we restrict ourselves to subjective formulae  we get the set of subjective
tel formulae 

in the rest of this paper we will be interested in subjective tel formulae since they
describe how the knowledge of the agent is changing over time  based on the set of natural
numbers  n  as ow of time  and normal s  models as formalization of states in a temporal
model  the following semantics is introduced for temporal epistemic logic  tel  

definition    semantics of tel  a tel model is a function m   n   is   the truth
of a formula     ltel in m at time point t   n  denoted  m  t  j     is defined inductively
as follows 

  
  
  
  
  

 m  t  j   
 m  t  j     
 m  t  j    
 m  t  j  p 
 m  t  j  f 

  m t  j s     if     ls 
   m  t  j    and  m  t  j 
  it is not the case that  m  t  j

such that s   t and  m  s  j   
   s  
such that t   s and  m  s  j

a formula   is true in a model m   denoted m j     if  m     j     a tel model m
is called conservative  or a telc model  if for all s   t   n   m s   m t   with the
ordering  of definition    the set of telc models is denoted by tcis 

note that the above definition is in principle ambiguous  a formula like kp   kq is
an s  formula which can be interpreted according to the first semantic clause  but it can
also be seen as a conjunction  to be interpreted according to the second clause  as the
interpretation of the conjunction  and the same holds for negation  is the same in s  as in
tel  this ambiguity is harmless 
we will briey explain the reason we have defined m j    if  m     j     later on  we
will make the general assumption on preferential logics that the language contains negation 
and that m j     if and only if m  j     assumption     if we define m j    if  m  t  j   
for all t   n  then this assumption would not hold for tel  the two definitions can be
translated into each other  since  m     j    if and only if  m  t  j   p       for all t   n
and  m  t  j    for all t   n if and only if  m     j      g   this is also one of the reasons
we gave a slightly different presentation of ground s   using subjective formulae  
in conservative models  the propositional knowledge of an agent can only increase in
time  we will restrict ourselves to these models  i e   an agent can not forget or revise its
 propositional  knowledge  indeed  for a propositional formula   and a telc model m   if
 m  t  j  k  then  m  s  j  k  for all s   t  this restriction can be made when the agent
is reasoning about a fixed  non changing  situation  and we are abstracting from particular
implementation details  such as the use of backtracking implementations for nonmonotonic
logics   we now extend the ordering and minimal consequence relation to telc models 
the ordering is extended in a pointwise fashion 

definition     minimal temporal epistemic logic 
   we extend the degree of knowledge ordering to telc models by defining
mn  

for all s   n   m s   n  s  

   minimal temporal epistemic logic  mtel  is the preferential logic with the subjective
tel formulae as its language  tcis as its class of models  the satisfaction relation
 m j     of definition   and the ordering of item    we will denote preferential
entailment  as defined in definition    of mtel by j mtel 

the idea behind using mtel for specifying reasoning processes is that a subjective
tel formula   describes the reasoning of an agent over time  it can  for example  describe
the use of nonmonotonic inference rules  see proposition      the minimal models of  
represent the process of the agent reasoning in time  we can then use minimal consequence
to infer properties of this reasoning process 
it is easy to see that mtel is a generalization of ground s   for subjective s  formulae
   we have that   j mtel if and only if   j gs    as an example of the use of the
notion of minimal temporal epistemic consequence  it has been shown by engelfriet and
treur        that it can capture default logic  reiter      b  
 

fimonotonicity and persistence in preferential logics

proposition     default logic in mtel  let a finite  propositional default theory   

hw  d i

be given and let

 

 

  f  kff   g  k  fi     g k    j  ff  fi      dg   fkff j ff   w g 
then   is a sceptical consequence of  in default logic if and only if j mtel f  k   
the conjuncts of the form   kff   g  k  fi     g k    ensure the application of the
default rules  in words  if the agent knows the prerequisite  ff   and the justification  fi  
remains consistent with what the agent knows throughout the future  then the agent must
conclude the consequent     in the next moment in time  and it will know  henceforth  

    circumscription

one of the earliest approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning is circumscription  mccarthy 
            davis        lifschitz        etherington         a preferential logic based on
first order predicate logic  the main idea behind circumscription is a kind of completeness
of information given to us   the premises as stated give us  the whole truth  about the
matter   van benthem         this leads to at least two kinds of minimality  predicateminimality and domain minimality  the intuition behind predicate minimality is that for
some relevant property  predicate   all objects that have this property  are explicitly said
to have this property in the premise  this allows us to formulate defaults stating that all
normal objects have some property  minimizing abnormality will allow us to conclude an
object has this property  unless we can deduce from the premise that this object is abnormal 
the intuition behind domain minimality  is that the domain  of discourse  contains no other
objects than those that can be deduced to exist from the premise   this intuition is strongly
tied to the domain closure assumption of reiter      a   these two kinds of minimality are
formalized by two variants of circumscription  both of them will be treated below 
the classical logic underlying circumscription is first order predicate logic  we assume
a standard first order language l with a finite number of predicate symbols  including
equality  we will also assume that the language contains no function or constant symbols 
this is not a severe limitation  since we can eliminate function and constant symbols by
introducing new predicate symbols  davis         we will first give the definition of the
orderings and then define predicate and domain circumscriptive consequence 

definition   

   let p be a predicate symbol in the language l  for a structure m for the language 
p m denotes the interpretation of p in m  so p m is a subset of dom m  n   where
dom m   is the domain of m   and n is the arity of p    for two structures m  n  
we say m is p  preferred to n   denoted m p n   if they have the same domain 
the same interpretation of predicate symbols other than p   and p m  p n   predicate
circumscription of p is the preferential logic which uses first order predicate logic for
the language  models and satisfaction relation  augmented with the ordering p   we
will denote preferential entailment  as defined in definition    in this logic by j pc
p  
   for two structures m  n for the language l  we say n is a substructure of m   denoted
n d m   if the domain of n is a subset of the domain of m   and the interpretation
 

fiengelfriet

of each predicate symbol in n is the restriction of the corresponding interpretation in
m to dom n    domain circumscription is the preferential logic which uses first order
predicate logic for the language  models and satisfaction relation  augmented with the
ordering d   we will denote preferential entailment in this logic by j dc  
   if we restrict the model class to finite structures  the resulting preferential logics are
called finite predicate circumscription and finite domain circumscription 

we refer the reader to the references given above for standard results and motivation of
circumscription 

   respecting monotonicity

in this section we will study formulae which respect monotonicity  we will first give a
formal definition 

definition     respecting monotonicity  given a preferential logic  we say a formula
  respects monotonicity  if

 ff  fi

  ff j  fi   ff     j  fi 

next  we will make some basic assumptions about the  underlying logic of the  preferential logic 

assumption   from now on we will assume that any preferential logic satisfies the following 


the language has conjunction     and m j     

  m j   



the language has implication     and m j     



the language has negation     and m j       m  j    

and m j   

  m  j   

or m j   

we can then immediately identify a class of formulae that respect monotonicity 

proposition    downward persistent formulae respect monotonicity 
proof  suppose   is downward persistent  let ff  fi be formulae and suppose ff j  fi   let

m be a minimal model of ff      then it is also a minimal model of ff  for suppose it is not 
then there exists n  m  n    m and n j  ff  since m j    and   is downward persistent  we
have n j     but then n j  ff     which contradicts the assumption that m was a minimal
model of ff      since m is a minimal model of ff and ff j  fi   we have m j  fi   we have
proved that ff     j  fi   thus    respects monotonicity 
 
of course  valid and unsatisfiable sentences are downward persistent  but the question is whether non trivial downward persistent formulae exist  for the preferential logics
introduced in section    the answer is armative 
 

fimonotonicity and persistence in preferential logics

definition     diam  define the class of s  formulae diam by 
diam     m     j diam   diam j diam   diam j m  diam 
where   is propositional 

formulae from diam essentially only contain the m operator  the  diamond  of s   and
not the  box  operator k    formulae in this class are the only subjective formulae  up to
equivalence  which are downward persistent in ground s   this was proved by engelfriet 
    a  

theorem    a subjective s  formula   is downward persistent in ground s  if and only
if it is s  equivalent to a formula in diam 

so in ground s  there is a non empty class of downward persistent formulae  that
respect monotonicity by proposition     essentially  these formulae only say something
about the ignorance of the agent  one might think that formulae from diam are completely
uninteresting  and never yield any new insights in ground s   the converse of monotonicity
for these formulae  ff     j gs  fi   ff j gs  fi   however  does not hold  even when   is
consistent with ff  we do not have that kp   kq j gs  kq  whereas we do have that
 kp   kq    m   p  j gs  kq with m   p    diam  so knowledge of ignorance can be
useful 
an analogous result holds for minimal temporal epistemic logic 

definition     td 
   define
td     diam j td   td j td   td j f  td  j g td  j p  td  j h  td 
   for two subjective tel formulae     

 

 def

for all telc models m   m j      m j   

td stands for  temporal diamond  formulae  the following was also proved by engelfriet
     a  

theorem    in mtel  a formula   is downward persistent if and only if it is equivalent
 in the sense of   to a formula in td 

as in the case of ground s   these formulae express  temporal  ignorance of the agent 

definition     positive and universal formulae  a first order predicate formula is negative in a predicate p   if all occurrences of the predicate p are in the scope of an odd number
of negations  a formula is universal if it is of the form  x        xn where is quantifier
free 
 

fiengelfriet

the following result links these formulae to downward persistence in circumscription 
the first is a variant of lyndon s theorem and is folklore  we leave the details to the
reader   the second result is known as the los tarski theorem  chang   keisler       
theorem        

theorem   
   a first order predicate formula   is downward persistent in predicate circumscription
 of p   if and only if it is equivalent to a formula that is negative in p  
   a first order predicate formula   is downward persistent in domain circumscription if
and only if it is equivalent to a universal formula 

so downward persistent formulae in predicate circumscription essentially only say something about elements not having property p  besides the other properties they mention  
and downward persistent formulae in domain circumscription essentially only mention universal properties  and do not say anything about the existence of objects  
for our examples  we have shown that non trivial classes of formulae that respect monotonicity exist  the question is whether there are more such formulae  besides those that are
downward persistent  we will give a criterion that ensures that there are no more formulae
that respect monotonicity 

definition     expressibility of preference  a preferential logic satisfies expressibility of preference if the following holds 

 m   mod     m   l    n   mod    n j   m   m  n  

the formula  m expresses   i am less preferred than m   and describes exactly those
models which are larger in the preferential ordering  the criterion of expressibility of
preference poses a requirement on the expressiveness of the language  given its semantics 
we will prove that in preferential logics that satisfy the condition in this definition  the
downward persistent formulae are the only ones that respect monotonicity  the above
condition can be generalized by taking into account equivalent models  we have not done
this immediately as it makes things rather cumbersome  if whenever n  m and m  k
 where m  k means that m and k satisfy the same formulae   there exists a model l such
that l  n and l  k  then we can generalize the condition to   m   mod     m   l    n  
mod    n j   m    k   mod   m  k   k  n  

theorem     only if         for a preferential logic that satisfies expressibility of preference we have  if a formula respect monotonicity  then it is downward persistent 

proof  suppose a formula   is not downward persistent  then there exist models m and

n such that m j     n  j    and n  m  define ff    n         m   and fi       first
we claim that ff j  fi   since n  n  we have n j   n   and as n  j    we get n j  ff 
furthermore  for any model k  if k j  ff then in particular k j   n so n  k  therefore 
n is the only minimal model of ff  and since n  j     we have n j  fi   on the other hand 
ff      j  fi   n  m so m j   n and m  m so m j   m from which we conclude that m j  ff
  

fimonotonicity and persistence in preferential logics

so m j  ff      furthermore  for any model k  if k j  ff      then k j    and k j       m
so k j   m   from this it follows that m  k  but this means that m is a  actually  the
only  minimal model of ff     and m j    so m  j  fi   we conclude that   does not respect
monotonicity  since we have found formulae ff and fi such that ff j  fi but ff      j  fi    
it may seem that the condition of expressibility of preference is too restrictive  however 
we will see that it is useful for the examples 

proposition    for ground s   mtel and finite predicate and domain circumscription 
only downward persistent formulae respect monotonicity 

proof  remark that all of these logics satisfy assumption    first consider ground s  
let us first take the language to be finite  that is  p is finite   take any
s  model m  
v
m
m
for each
propositional valuation m  define the formula ff by ff   fp   p j m j 
pg   vf vp j p   p  m  j  pg  this is a well defined formula since p is finite  now construct
 m   fk   ffm   j m    m g  which is again a well defined formula since mod p   is
finite  it can easily be seen that any s  model n satisfies  m if and only if m  n   so
expressibility of preference is satisfied  whence theorem    ensures that only downward
persistent formulae respect monotonicity for this finite language  now let p be arbitrary 
and suppose   in this language respects monotonicity  then it is easy to see that if we
restrict the language to atoms occurring in    it still respects monotonicity  so it is downward
persistent in the restricted language  it follows easily that   is also downward persistent in
the full language 
for mtel  the same considerations make it sucient to give a formula  m for a finite
language only  so let us take p finite  then every s  model m i  is a finite set of propositional valuations  since the sequence fm i g is decreasing with respect to set inclusion
 as m is conservative   there will be an index k such that m j     m k  for all j   k 
to improve readability of the formula  m we define the formulae ati to be p i     h i    
 where p i stands for a sequence of p operators of length i   it is easy to see that for any
model n we have  n   j   j  ati if and only if j   i  now define 
 m   vf  ati    m i    j    i  kg  where  m i  is the formula as defined in the case of
ground s  for the s  model m i    it is easy to show that n j   m if and only if m  n  
for finite circumscription  we need the more general definition of expressibility of preference hinted at before  in first order logic  there may be equivalent models  different models
that satisfy the same first order formulae   here we need not restrict the language  in
predicate circumscription  the required formula  m for a finite structure m expresses   i 
the exact number of elements of the domain of m    ii  for which of these elements p holds 
and  iii  for all other predicates q it expresses for which elements q holds  and for which its
negation holds  in domain circumscription  the required formula  m for a finite structure
m expresses the fact that there are  at least  as many elements as in m   and for each
predicate q  it expresses for which of these elements q holds  and for which elements its
negation holds 
 
it is not possible to find the required formula  m in  non finite  circumscription in
general  for infinite structures we are not in general able to express the number of elements 
  

fiengelfriet

and we can not describe the entire extensions of predicates in general  indeed  the above
result does not hold for domain circumscription  it is still an open question whether it holds
for predicate circumscription 

proposition    for domain circumscription  there exists a first order predicate formula
which respects monotonicity but is not downward persistent 

proof  consider the first order language l   f    g  and let   be a sentence stating that

  is a dense linear ordering without begin  or endpoint  this is a complete theory  rabin 
      theorem     which means that for any ff   l  either   j  ff or   j   ff  now suppose
ff j dc fi   if   j   ff then ff     is inconsistent  so ff     j dc fi trivially  otherwise we
have that   j  ff so ff     is equivalent to    but it is easy to see that   does not have a
minimal model  so again we have ff     j dc fi   however    is not downward persistent  it
holds in the real numbers  but not in the substructure of the natural numbers 
 
until now we have considered formulae that can be added to any premise  but we can
also ask the question whether a formula respects monotonicity for a given  fixed premise 

proposition    given a preferential logic such that mod is finite and for all m   mod

there exists ffm   l such that n j  ffm if and only if n   m  let ff be a fixed formula in l 
then we have for all     l 
 fi  ff j 

fi   ff     j  fi      m   mod m j  ff       m j  ff  
proof  the right to left direction is trivial  and does not depend on the assumption   for
the other direction  suppose that  fi  ff j  wfi   ff     j  fi    let m   mod be arbitrary
and suppose m j  ff      now define fi   fffn j n j  ffg  this is a well defined formula
since mod was assumed finite  it is easy to see that ff j  fi   suppose n j  ff  then ffn
is one of the disjuncts of fi   and by definition of ffn   we have n j  ffn   so n j  fi   but the
assumption now gives that ff     j  fi   as m j  ff      we have m j  fi   so there is an
n   mod with n j  ff and m j  ffn  but by definition of ffn this means that m   n so
m j  ff 
 
proposition    states that a formula   respects monotonicity for a fixed premise ff if
and only if the minimal models of ff     are minimal models of ff  of course the criterion
on the right hand side is hard to check  we can give another criterion  but for that  we first
need the following definition  kraus et al         

definition     smoothness  a preferential logic is called smooth  if the following holds 
 ff   l    m   mod    m j  ff    n   mod   n  m   n j  ff  
this condition  which is also called stopperedness or well foundedness  and is akin to
the limit assumption  lewis         forbids chains of ever decreasing models satisfying a
formula  it is one of the basic properties in the framework of kraus et al         
proposition    given a smooth preferential logic  we have   m   mod m j  ff      
m j  ff  if and only if  m   mod m j  ff        n   mod n  m  n j  ff and n j      
  

fimonotonicity and persistence in preferential logics

the proof of this proposition is straightforward  and again it may not help much  as
far as the examples are concerned  the conclusion of proposition    holds for both ground
s  and mtel  the properties depend only on ff and   so we may restrict the signature and
then use the proposition   proposition    holds for ground s   which is smooth   from
these propositions we can find some sucient conditions  if   is downward persistent in
the models of ff  then proposition    ensures that   respects monotonicity with respect to
ff  if ff j    then proposition    ensures that   respects monotonicity with respect to ff
 but this also follows immediately with the rule of cautious monotonicity  which is satisfied
in smooth preferential logics  kraus et al          it seems hard to find a simple criterion
necessary and sucient for respecting monotonicity for a given premise  we leave this for
further research 

   conservativity

in the previous section we have considered formulae that can always be added to a premise
without invalidating any of the conclusions  in this section we will focus on the conclusions 
and study formulae that  when they are concluded  can always be kept  no matter which
new information is added to the premise  we will call these formulae conservative 

definition     conservative  given a preferential logic  we say a formula fi is conservative  if

 ff      ff j 

fi   ff     j  fi 

we have the following result connecting upward persistent and conservative formulae 
in analogy with proposition    

proposition    given a preferential logic that is smooth  if a formula is upward persistent 
it is conservative 

proof  let fi be upward persistent in a smooth preferential logic  now suppose ff j  fi  
take any model m such that m j  ff      then m j  ff so by smoothness  there is a model
n with n  m and n j  ff  then  as ff j  fi   we have n j  fi   since n  m and fi is
upward persistent  we have m j  fi   this shows that ff     j  fi   so fi is conservative   
again  we can ask if the upward persistent formulae are the only conservative formulae 
and this is true under the same conditions as in the case of respecting monotonicity 
proposition     only if         for a preferential logic that satisfies expressibility of preference we have  if a formula is conservative  then it is upward persistent 
proof  suppose fi is not upward persistent  then there are n  m   mod such that n  m 
and n j  fi but m  j  fi   now take ff    n and      m   then n is the only minimal model
of ff and n j  fi so ff j  fi   but m is a  actually  the only one  minimal model of ff      and
m  j  fi   so ff      j  fi   thus  fi is not conservative 
 
let us first identify the upward persistent formulae for our examples  this is relatively
straightforward  since we have the following elementary result 
  

fiengelfriet

proposition    for any preferential logic    is upward persistent if and only if    is
downward persistent 

this gives us the following 

proposition   
   define box     k     j box   box j box   box j k  box  with   propositional 
then a subjective s  formula   is upward persistent in ground s  if and only if it is
s  equivalent to a formula in box 
   define tb     box j tb   tb j tb   tb j f  tb  j g tb  j p  tb  j h  tb   then a
subjective tel formula   is upward persistent in mtel if and only if it is equivalent
 in the sense of   to a formula in tb 
   a first order formula is upward persistent in predicate circumscription  of p   if and
only if it is equivalent to a formula that is positive in p  meaning that all occurrences
of the predicate p are in the scope of an even number of negations   a first order
formula is upward persistent in domain circumscription if and only if it is equivalent
to an existential formula  a formula of the form  x        xn where is quantifier
free  

proof  straightforward 

 

in the above definition  formulae from box essentially only contain the k operator  the
 box  of s    tb stands for  temporal box  formulae  now let us see what propositions   
and    say about the examples  ground s  satisfies expressibility of preference  for a finite
language  and is smooth  so the conservative formulae are exactly the upward persistent
formulae  which express only knowledge  and not ignorance   this can be lifted again
to an infinite language  the fact that in ground s   formulae that express propositional
knowledge  are conservative  was already noted by donini et al          mtel also satisfies
expressibility of preference  for a finite language   so any formula that is conservative  must
be upward persistent  and must be equivalent to a formula in tb  expressing knowledge
over time  not ignorance   this can be lifted to an infinite language  unfortunately  mtel
is not smooth  the formula f  kp  is satisfiable  but has no minimal model  in mtel 
we have that f  kp  j mtel f  kq   but f  kp    kp  j mtel f  kq   f  kp    kp has a
minimal model  in which only p is known  from the first point in time onwards   this means
that the formula f  kq  is not conservative  although it is upward persistent  it is easy to
see that in any preferential logic  valid formulae are always conservative  but in mtel 
these are  almost  the only ones 

definition    we call a tel model m totally ignorant  if for all propositional formulae

  we have  if m j  f  k   then   is a propositional tautology  define the totally ignorant
model mti by mti  i    mod p   for all i 
in a totally ignorant model  no knowledge is ever gained  the totally ignorant model is
certainly a totally ignorant model  and if p is finite  it is the only one 
  

fimonotonicity and persistence in preferential logics

proposition    for mtel  in case p is infinite  we have that a formula is conservative
if and only if it is true in all models  when p is finite  a formula is conservative if and
only if it is true in all models except possibly the totally ignorant model 

proof  we will prove that fi is conservative if and only if it is true in all models that are not

totally ignorant  both when p is finite and when it is infinite   first  suppose m is a model
that is not totally ignorant  in which fi is not true  so m j  f  k   for some propositional
formula  that is not a propositional tautology  if p is finite  we can consider the formula
 m  see the proof of proposition    for the definition of  m    if p is infinite  one can
show that m can be chosen in such a way that it is a  inherently finite  model  allowing the
construction of a formula  m with the same properties as for the case when p is finite  using
essentially the same construction   the details of this argument are left to the reader  the
formula f  k   does not have a minimal model   must be known sometimes in the future 
but this moment can always be postponed  yielding a smaller model   so f  k   j mtel fi  
on the other hand  it can easily be shown that the only minimal model of f  k      m is
m   which gives us f  k      m  j mtel fi   this means that fi is not conservative 
now suppose that fi is true in all models that are not totally ignorant  and suppose
ff j mtel fi   let m be a minimal model of ff      if m is not totally ignorant  then
m j  fi   if it is totally ignorant  then also mti j  ff      it can be shown by induction that
all totally ignorant models satisfy the same formulae   but then mti j  ff  since no model
is preferred over mti   this means that mti j  ff so mti j  fi   whence m j  fi   it follows
that ff     j mtel fi   so fi is conservative 
let us look at the case when p is infinite  suppose m  j  fi   with m totally ignorant 
now take a propositional atom p not occurring in fi   it can easily be shown that we can
find a model of kp in which fi is not satisfied  this model is of course not totally ignorant 
this shows that if fi is true in all models that are not totally ignorant  then it is true in all
models  in case p is finite  mti is the only totally ignorant model 
 
so in mtel with an infinite p   valid formulae are the only conservative formulae 
these formulae are of course upward persistent  in a trivial way   and they are equivalent
to a formula in tb  for instance k      when the signature is finite  there are some extra
formulae that are conservative  for example if p   fp  qg  then the formula f  k  p   q   
k   p   q    k  p    q    k   p    q   is also conservative  it is true in all models except
the totally ignorant one   of course  this formula is upward persistent  and it is in tb 
finite predicate and domain circumscription satisfy both expressibility of preference
and smoothness  so the conservative formulae coincide with the upward persistent formulae
which have the syntactic characterization of proposition    
full circumscription satisfies neither of the conditions 

proposition    in predicate and domain circumscription there are upward persistent formulae that are not conservative 

proof  first consider predicate circumscription  let the language consist of three predicates besides equality  namely p   succ and    and p is circumscribed   define the formulae
  

fiengelfriet

ff and   as follows 
ff    x  y succ x  y   
     xy px   succ y  x    py 
 x  y  succ y  x   
 xy  succ x  y     x   y   
 xyz  x   y   y   z   x   z   
 x   x   x   
 xy  x   y   y   x   x   y   
 xpx
 xy  px   succ x  y     py  
the intuitive meaning of ff is that there are succ chains of elements  extending indefinitely
in both directions  if p occurs somewhere on such a chain  it must be true in all successors
as well  a model of ff can be made smaller  more preferred  by making p false in a point
and all of its predecessors  leaving it true in all successors   we will now make this argument
formal  the first claim is that ff has no p   minimal models  let m be a model of ff  then
there must be an x   dom m   with x   p m   define a   fxg   fy   p m j  y  x    m g 
let n be the structure with the same domain as m   the same extension of succ and    and
p n   p m n a  it is straightforward to verify that n is a model of ff  and that n p m
and n    m  
on the other hand  ff     has minimal models  let m be the structure with dom m     z
 the integers    a  b    succm   b   a       a  b    m   a   b in the natural ordering
on the integers  and p m   z  it can easily be checked that m j  ff      now suppose
n p m   n    m and n j  ff      this means that p n  z  strict inclusion   and p n     
 as n j   xpx   but then there must be x  y   z with y   x      and either x   p n and
y    p n   or x    p n and y   p n   contradicting either n j   xy px   succ x  y    py 
 n j  ff  or n j     therefore m is a minimal model of ff     
now define fi    x x    x   which is trivially upward persistent  since ff has no minimal
pc
models  we have ff j pc
p fi   but m  j  fi   so ff      j p fi   this shows that fi is not
conservative 
for domain circumscription  the example is quite similar  again take fi    x x    x  
now define the formulae ff and   as follows 
ff    x  y succ x  y   
     y x succ x  y  
 xy  succ x  y     x   y   
 xyz  x   y   y   z   x   z   
 x   x   x   
 xy  x   y   y   x   x   y   
 xyz  succ x  z     succ y  z     x   y  
one can now check that ff has no d  minimal models  but ff     does  so the same fi is
upward persistent but not conservative in domain circumscription  the details are left to
the reader 
 
until now  we have looked at formulae which  once concluded  are never lost  regardless
of what new information comes in  but also regardless of what the initial premise was 
  

fimonotonicity and persistence in preferential logics

however  we can also consider the situation with the premise fixed  analogously to the last
part of the previous section   given a premise  which conclusions may be kept regardless of
new information 

proposition    for a preferential logic that satisfies expressibility of preference  if
ff j  fi   then
      ff     j  fi     ff j  fi 
proof  suppose ff j  fi  
    if ff j  fi then for any   we have ff     j  fi so ff     j  fi  

    suppose ff  j  fi   then there exists m   mod such that m j  ff but m  j  fi   then
m j  ff    m      so ff    m  j  fi  
 
note that the condition ff j  fi was not used in the proof  if ff  j  fi the equivalence is
still true  as both sides are false  the proposition shows that the monotonic consequences
of a premise are the only ones conservative with respect to this fixed premise 

corollary    let fi be a conservative formula for a preferential logic that satisfies expressibility of preference  then ff j  fi   ff j  fi  
proof  if ff j  fi then in any preferential logic it follows that ff j  fi   on the other hand  if
ff j  fi   then for any   we have ff     j  fi   since fi is conservative  with proposition   
 

it follows that ff j  fi  

in the last two sections  we have derived a number of results on formulae that respect
monotonicity and conservative formulae and the links with persistent formulae  in the next
section we will discuss the impact of these results in practice 

   practical implications

the results in this paper may improve the eciency of theorem provers for preferential
logics  depending on a number of factors  in the first place  it is important how the theorem
prover is used 
consider the situation where we have a stand alone theorem prover which gets different
 unrelated  queries  furthermore  suppose the theorem prover is asked to prove ff           
ffn j  fi   then there are at least two possibilities for using the results in the paper 
first of all  suppose the preferential logic satisfies expressibility of preference  then if fi
is upward persistent  we do not have to prove ff            ffn j  fi   as it is equivalent to
prove ff            ffn j  fi  corollary      in most preferential logics  preferential entailment
is harder to compute than entailment in the underlying logic 
in the second place  sometimes local reasoning is possible  which is not possible in general
for non monotonic logics   the theorem prover may derive the conclusion from part of the
premise  so it may be the case that there is a    k   n such that ff            ffk j  fi which
is easier to verify than the original query  then if ffk             ffn are downward persistent 
proposition    implies that ff         ffn j  fi   if fi is upward persistent  and the preferential
logic is smooth   proposition    sanctions ff            ffn j  fi   for these results to be usable
  

fiengelfriet

in a theorem prover  we need heuristic knowledge to decide if there is a promising split of
the premise into two parts a and b   for such a split  we can then try to prove a j  fi
and downward persistence of b or upward persistence of fi   in case ff            ffk j  fi can
not be proved  we may have to directly prove ff            ffn j  fi after all 
these two methods will of course only improve eciency if the determination of persistence is easier than the original query  we will treat this question below  
the second kind of situation is when we have a theorem prover which is used by an
agent which has a lot of knowledge about the world  and from time to time performs
observations to increase its knowledge  then  although sometimes the agent will need to
perform revisions  we are often in the situation that  many  conclusions from a premise
 ff  have been proved  and the premise is augmented by a new formula      if this new
formula is downward persistent  then the agent can retain all the old conclusions  and may
only need to derive some new conclusions   if it is not  it can at least retain all the upward
persistent conclusions  if the preferential logic is smooth   we may also try to determine
if   is downward persistent given ff  or if fi is conservative given ff  again  these methods
only improve eciency if it is easier to determine if   respects monotonicity  possibly given
ff  than recomputing all old conclusions  or if it is easier to determine that fi is conservative
 possibly given ff  than checking ff     j  fi  
the possible eciency improvement in both cases heavily depends on the cost of determining persistence relative to the cost of determining preferential consequence  unfortunately  it is very hard to say anything about this issue in general  it depends on the
preferential logic at hand  on the representation of the logic  syntactically  as a proof calculus  or semantically  as models with a preference relation   and on other implementation
issues  for instance  it can be important how much information is retained from previous
queries  whether proofs or minimal models are stored  let us consider the examples again 
preferential entailment in both ground s  and mtel is qp   complete  engelfriet 
    a   whereas full circumscription is undecidable  restricted versions of circumscription
exist which are decidable  but still highly complex   unfortunately  determining downward
or upward persistence is not easier for these logics  we have seen that the classes of persistent formulae have syntactic representations of the form    is upward downward persistent
if and only if it is equivalent to a formula in c   where c is a  syntactic  class of formulae 
now  of course  determining equivalence to a formula in c is as complex as determining
persistence  but there may be subclasses of a class of persistent formulae  with a lower
complexity  for instance  determining membership of c is much easier  namely polynomial 
the members of c are persistent  so what we propose is to check membership of c   instead
of equivalence to a member of c   in that case  we will miss some persistent formulae  and
have to prove the original query   but this disadvantage is outweighed by the complexity
advantage of checking membership  the checking of membership can be improved upon by
adding some  easy  checks for equivalence to a formula in c   for instance  in ground s  
if we consider  for a formula    for each propositional sub formula  the nearest k operator
in which scope it lies  then if all of these k operators are in the scope of an odd number of
negations  we can conclude that   is downward persistent  the formula  k  q   kp   for
example  satisfies this condition  and although it is not a member of diam  it is equivalent
to  kq    kp   diam  this check is obviously polynomial 
  

fimonotonicity and persistence in preferential logics

given a preferential logic  the designer of a theorem prover could proceed as follows 
first  syntactic classes of formulae that are downward and upward persistent have to be
identified  for ground s   mtel and predicate and domain circumscription  these can be
found in definitions            and proposition     for other preferential logics  if such
classes are trivial  they may  for instance  only include tautologies and contradictions  
then the usefulness of the results is limited  otherwise  the theorem prover could work
as follows  given a query of the form ff     j  fi   first it is checked if   belongs to the
syntactic class of downward persistent formulae or if fi belongs to the syntactic class of
upward persistent formulae  this latter test should only be performed if the preferential
logic is smooth   if fi is conservative and the logic satisfies expressibility of preference  it
tries to prove ff     j  fi  this usually has a lower complexity than the original query  for
ground s  and mtel  monotonic consequence is np complete  engelfriet      a   the
answer of this query is the answer to the original query  see corollary      otherwise  if
  belongs to the syntactic class of downward persistent formulae or if fi belongs to the
syntactic class of upward persistent formulae  but the logic does not satisfy expressibility
of preference   then the theorem prover tries to prove ff j  fi   if this succeeds  it outputs
yes  otherwise  it will try to answer the original query directly 
as stated before  the practical savings in part depend on representation and implementation aspects  it also depends on the application domain and use of the theorem prover 
if formulae in these syntactic classes occur often  the eciency improvement is higher than
if they are infrequent 

   conclusions and further research
we have looked at restrictions of monotonicity in preferential logics  while monotonicity
does not hold in general  we can identify  in general non trivial  classes of formulae for
which restricted versions of monotonicity holds  this may make  nonmonotonic  deduction
in preferential logics easier  since we may sometimes keep conclusions  or identify which
conclusions may be kept  when adding new information to a premise  the results in this
paper may lead to more ecient implementations of preferential logics  experimenting with
theorem provers which use these results is necessary in order to determine the eciency
improvement in practice 
it would be nice to find a better characterization of formulae that can be added to a
given  fixed premise without destroying conclusions 
syntactic characterizations of persistent formulae were given for a number of example
preferential logics  but we would like to have a result for broader classes of preferential
logics  such as the class of ground nonmonotonic modal logics  donini et al
