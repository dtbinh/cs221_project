important characteristic many logics artificial intelligence nonmonotonicity  means adding formula premises invalidate

means whenever learn new information     add already
know  ff   old theorems  fi   still derivable  clearly undesirable
describing defeasible reasoning  therefore  monotonicity satisfied many logics
artificial intelligence 
hand  monotonicity attractive feature practical point
view  learning new information  start again 
retain old conclusions  focus deriving possible new ones  furthermore 
lot information  allowed focus part it  conclusions derived
part automatically valid considering information
 this sometimes called local reasoning  
even though clear want monotonicity hold general  might
worthwhile investigate restricted variants monotonicity  past  variants
defined allow us keep old theorems  either new information follows old premise  this variant called cautious monotonicity kraus 
lehmann    magidor        negation derived old premise  this
called rational monotonicity kraus et al

proposition    predicate domain circumscription upward persistent formulae conservative 

proof  first consider predicate circumscription  let language consist three predicates besides equality  namely p   succ    and p circumscribed   define formulae

  follows 
   x  y succ x  y   
     xy px   succ y  x    py 
 x  y  succ y  x   
 xy  succ x      x

 x   x   x   
 xy  x       x   x

 xy  px   succ x      py  
intuitive meaning succ chains elements  extending indefinitely
directions  p occurs somewhere chain  must true successors
well  model made smaller  more preferred  making p false point
predecessors  leaving true successors   make argument
formal  first claim p   minimal models  let model ff 
must x   dom m   x   p   define   fxg   fy   p j  y  x    m g 
let n structure domain   extension succ

 the integers    a  b    succm   b         a  b    m     b natural ordering
integers  p   z  easily checked j       suppose
n p   n    n j       means p n z  strict inclusion   p n     
 as n j   xpx   must x    z   x      either x   p n
   p n   x    p n   p n   contradicting either n j   xy px   succ x  y    py 
 n j  ff  n j     therefore minimal model

define formulae   follows 
   x  y succ x  y

fimonotonicity persistence preferential logics

given preferential logic  designer theorem prover could proceed follows 
first  syntactic classes formulae downward upward persistent
identified  ground s   mtel predicate domain circumscription 
found definitions            proposition     preferential logics 
classes trivial  they may  instance  include tautologies contradictions

syntactic class downward persistent formulae belongs syntactic class
upward persistent formulae  this latter test performed preferential
logic smooth   conservative logic satisfies expressibility preference 
tries prove     j   this usually lower complexity original query

   conclusions research
looked restrictions monotonicity preferential logics  monotonicity
hold general  identify  in general non trivial  classes formulae
restricted versions monotonicity holds  may make  nonmonotonic  deduction
preferential logics easier  since may sometimes keep conclusions  identify
conclusions may kept  adding new information premise  results
paper may lead ecient implementations preferential logics  experimenting
theorem provers use results necessary order determine eciency
improvement practice 
would nice find better characterization formulae added
given  fixed premise without destroying conclusions 
syntactic characterizations persistent formulae given number example
preferential logics  would result broader classes preferential
logics  class ground nonmonotonic modal logics  donini et al
