action formalisms  well known frame problem introduced mccarthy
hayes         moreover  still problem axiomatising effects action 
called effect axioms  logical axiomatisation requires conditions
effects take place executing action precisely specified  however 
potentially infinitely many conditions  reasoner may never

case original qualification problem stated mccarthy       
dynamics actions events need finitely axiomatisable
unexpected qualification action arises  agent must necessarily retract
initial expectation effects caused action would take place  making
underlying reasoning machinery non monotonic  see section     discussion
qualification problem

actions always succeed  action omniscience assumption  precisely  assumption dictates qualification problem skipped

counterintuitive supposition victim shooting somehow still alive

allows default saying victim persists alive regarding shooting
action applicable  consequence  gun must loaded
shooting action  therefore  blocks application default saying
gun persists loaded regarding waiting action  words  loaded

even though doherty kvarnstroms        solution closest spirit

several effects  killing victim  making loud noise  emptying cartridge  etc 
conditions action executable is  gun  gun
broken  gun loadable  etc  action executable  necessary

cartridge emptied victim still alive since victim wearing bulletproof jacket  assuming reasoner somehow aware possibility

end troubles though  presence qualification
ramification constraints causes several complications  firstly  syntactically distinguishable  secondly  mentioned doherty kvarnstrom
        qualification constraints may cause indirect effects arise vice versa  i e 
ramification constraints may reveal implicit action preconditions

ramification constraint   reasoner could easily conjecture passenger fails
board plane  hand  fact passenger possesses gun
trying board plane must fail board plane result qualification

far havent taken consideration issues concurrent actions indirect
effects  ensure formalisation introduced expressive enough deal
complex domains  show issues coped approach  firstly 
motivate formalisation informal discussion 
    concurrent non deterministic events
given temporal representation  formulating concurrent events difficult issue
framework  however  subtleties need carefully considered 
firstly  use assumptions  presented earlier paper  qualification assumptions
fluent oriented  i e  qualify effects action rather action itself 
whilst manifests capability formulating actions multiple effects  thus
effect qualified independently  may fail formalise concurrent events
effects  example  actions hit vase hammer shoot
loaded gun bring effect vase broken  words 
essential qualification assumptions dependent actions bring
effect consideration  thus  given n actions fluents whose values
changed actions  potentially introduce   n qualifications
assumptions    therefore  instead subscripting assumption symbols aq
fluent literals f   extend set subscripts aq  denoted af  contain
    fact  see later  potentially    n      qualification assumptions case
since one special event corresponding  natural  events bring indirect effects

nonetheless  several issues still remain within framework need treatment achieve optimal solution  firstly  formalism may suitable
large scale problems many assumptions need taken account 
address problem  localisation procedure invented guarantee adequate sub language used capture circumstance agent reasoning about 
consequence  set assumptions restricted necessary
infer conclusions agent interested  idea development  furthermore 
uniform solution major problems reasoning action may quite
attractive especially regarding toy scenarios considered paper
well literature  solution may pragmatic  considering locality
account reasoning  particular assumptions used default reasoning  promising
solution achieved computational representational points view 
undertaking investigation towards research direction 
major limitation framework ability deal disjunctive axiomatisation action occurrences  instance  domain axiomatisation constains
disjunction action occurrences  t     t      t    t       plausible sets
assumptions  accordingly  cpmms  resp  cpmqms  produced account
effects actions  initial formalisation framework allowed
complex expressions action occurrences premises inference rules overcame problem  formalisation appeared complex technical
results could established  investigation  therefore  needed overcome
problem avoiding produce overly complex formalisation 
provided formalism designed provide general framework reasoning action  following comes natural question  extent proposed
approach used formalise dynamic domains  sandewall        suggests one
systematise framework reasoning action standard criteria
provide formal indications expressiveness capacity formalism 
contrast traditional approach prevailed many years
reasoning action one tries come examples show
existing approaches able deal scenario claims ones approach
better others solve proposed scenario 
relative sandewalls standard criteria  approach enjoys following properties 
   approach non inertia allows observations later state correct systems predictions states using explanation mechanism
use assumptions 
   formalism able deal non deterministic concurrent events 
another issue abduction problem known literature
explanation problem  example  stolen car scenario  observing car
disappeared parking lot reasoner left it  expectation failure arises 
formalisms would try accommodate problem introducing stealing action
part vocabulary try bind disappearance car action 
arguably intuitive good reason include action
vocabulary first place others car towed away

police fairy turning car pumpkin  etc  pragmatic point view 
reasoners may simply acquire information  perhaps police  instead
confusing kinds explanations towards possible uncertain causes 
words  effectively isolate issues deducing new conclusions
existing knowledge base abducing possible causes observations
