abstract
in this paper we propose a crossover operator for evolutionary algorithms with real
values that is based on the statistical theory of population distributions  the operator is
based on the theoretical distribution of the values of the genes of the best individuals in
the population  the proposed operator takes into account the localization and dispersion
features of the best individuals of the population with the objective that these features
would be inherited by the offspring  our aim is the optimization of the balance between
exploration and exploitation in the search process 
in order to test the efficiency and robustness of this crossover  we have used a set of
functions to be optimized with regard to different criteria  such as  multimodality  separability  regularity and epistasis  with this set of functions we can extract conclusions
in function of the problem at hand  we analyze the results using anova and multiple
comparison statistical tests 
as an example of how our crossover can be used to solve artificial intelligence problems 
we have applied the proposed model to the problem of obtaining the weight of each network
in a ensemble of neural networks  the results obtained are above the performance of
standard methods 

   introduction
evolutionary algorithms  eas  are general purpose searching methods  the selection process and the crossover and mutation operators establish a balance between the exploration
and exploitation of the search space which is very adequate for a wide variety of problems
whose solution presents difficulties that are insolvable using classical methods  most of
these problems are defined in continuous domains  so the evolutionary algorithms applied
use real values  namely  evolution strategies  eps   real coded genetic algorithms  rcgas  
and evolutionary programming  ep   for these paradigms the precision of the solution does
not depend on the coding system  as in binary coded genetic algorithms  but on the precision
of the computer system where the algorithms are run 
the selection process drives the searching towards the regions of the best individuals 
the mutation operator randomly modifies  with a given probability  one or more genes of a
chromosome  thus increasing the structural diversity of the population  as we can see  it is
clearly an exploration operator  that helps to recover the genetic diversity lost during the
selection phase and to explore new solutions avoiding premature convergence  in this way 
the probability of reaching a given point in the search space is never zero  this operator

in fact  implements a random search whose well studied features are useful in the field of
evolutionary computation 
the crossover operator combines the genes of two or more parents to generate better
offspring  it is based on the idea that the exchange of information between good chromosomes will generate even better offspring  the effect of the crossover operator can be
studied from two different points of view  at chromosome level and at gene level  the effect
of the crossover operator at chromosome level can be considered in a geometric way  given
two parents                 and                 with two genes  we denote by h      the
hypercube defined by their genes  figure  a   at gene level the representation would be
linear  defining in this case a segment or interval s       for each pair of genes  figure  b

most crossover operators generate individuals in the exploitation zones  s        or h       
i

in this way  the crossover operator implements a depth search or exploitation  leaving the
breadth search or exploration for the mutation operator 
this policy  intuitively very natural  makes the population converge to values within
the hypercubes defined by their parents  producing a rapid decrease in the population
diversity which could end up in a premature convergence to a non optimal solution  recent
studies on blx  crossover  eshelman   schaffer         the crossover based on fuzzy
connectives  herrera  herrera viedma  lozano    verdegay         and fuzzy recombination
 voigt  muhlenbein    cvetkovic         have confirmed the good performance of those
crossover operators that also generate individuals in the exploration zone  these operators
avoid the loss of diversity and the premature convergence to inner points of the search
space  but also the generation of new individuals in the exploration zone could slow the
search process  for this reason  the crossover operator should establish an adequate balance
between exploration  or interpolation  and exploitation  or extrapolation   and generate
offspring in the exploration and exploitation zones in the correct proportion 
establishing a balance between exploration and exploitation is important  but it is also
important that such a balance is self adaptive  kita        beyer   deb        deb  
beyer         that is  it must guarantee that the dispersion of the offspring depends on
 

ficixl   a crossover operator for evolutionary algorithms

the dispersion of the parents  so  two close parents must generate close offspring  and two
distant parents must generate distant offspring  the control of dispersion in the crossover
based on fuzzy connectives is based on the generation of offspring using the fuzzy connectives t norms  t conorms  average functions  and a generalized operator of compensation
 mizumoto         in fuzzy recombination the offspring is generated using two triangular
distributions whose averages derive from each of the genes of the two parents  in blx 
we have the same probability of generating an offspring between the parents  and in an area
close to the parents whose amplitude is modulated by the  parameter 
ono and kobayashi        have proposed a unimodal normally distributed crossover
 undx   where three parents are used to generate two or more children  the children are
obtained using an ellipsoidal distribution where one axis is the segment that joins the two
parents and the extent of the orthogonal direction is decided by the perpendicular distance
of the third parent from the axis  the authors claim that this operator should preserve the
statistics of the population  this crossover is also self adaptive  but it differs from blx 
by the fact that it is more probable to generate offspring near the average of the first two
parents 
another self adaptive crossover is the simulated binary crossover  sbx   deb   agrawal 
       based on the search features of the single point crossover used in binary coded genetic algorithms  this operator respects the interval schemata processing  in the sense that
common interval schemata of the parents are preserved in the offspring  the sbx crossover
puts the stress on generating offspring near the parents  so  the crossover guarantees that
the extent of the children is proportional to the extent of the parents  and also favors
that near parent individuals are monotonically more likely to be chosen as children than
individuals distant from the parents 
the main goal of this paper is to propose a crossover operator that avoids the loss
of diversity of the population of individuals  and  at the same time  favors the speed of
convergence of the algorithm  these two goals are  at first  conflicting  their adequate
balance is controlled by two of the basic features of the crossover operator  i  the balance
between exploration and exploitation and  ii  the self adaptive component  these two
features make the evolutionary algorithms avoid premature convergence and favor local
fine tuning  both attributes are highly appreciated in any search algorithm 
in most current crossover operators  the features of the offspring depend on the features
of just a few parents  these crossovers do not take into account population features such
as localization and dispersion of the individuals  the use of these statistical features of the
population may help the convergence of the population towards the global optimum 
the crossover operator implements basically a depth or exploitative search  just like
other methods such as steepest gradient descent  local search or simulated annealing  but
in these three search methods the algorithm takes the quality of the solutions into account 
so  it is reasonable to think that it is also convenient for the crossover operator to consider
the performance on the individuals involved in the crossover operation  this idea is already
implemented by some heuristic crossovers  wright        
nevertheless  following the previous line of argument  it seems rather poor to use just
two parents  and not to consider the most promising directions towards which it would
be advisable to drive the search  that is  instead of using a local heuristic that uses two
 

fiortiz boyer  hervas martnez    garca pedrajas

individuals  involving the whole population or an adequate subset in the determination of
the direction of the search whose features would be specially suitable 
motivated by this line of argument  in this paper we propose a crossover operator  which
will be called confidence interval based crossover using l  norm  cixl    on the one
hand  it takes advantage of the selective component that is derived from the extraction of
the features of the best n individuals of the population and that indicates the direction of
the search  and on the other hand  it makes a self adaptive sampling around those features
whose width depends on the number of best individuals  dispersion of those best individuals 
confidence coefficient  and localization of the individuals that participate in the crossover 
now  the exploitation region is not the area between the two parents that are involved
in the crossover  but the area defined by the confidence interval built from the n best
individuals of the population  and the exploratory region is the rest of the search domain 
to the previous concepts of exploration and exploitation  merely geometrical  is added a
probabilistic component that depends on the population features of the best individuals 
estimation of distribution algorithms  edas  or probabilistic model building evolutionary algorithms  muhlenbein   paa        muhlenbein  mahnig    rodriguez       
are based on a  seemingly  similar idea  these algorithms do not have mutation and crossover
operators  after every generation the population distribution of the selected individuals is
estimated and the new individuals are obtained sampling this estimated distribution  however  the underlying idea behind our crossover is the extraction of population features  mean
and standard deviation  in order to detect the regions where there is a higher probability
of getting the best individuals  in order to perform the crossover  we create three virtual
parents that represent the localization estimator mean  and the bounds of the confidence
interval from which  with a certain confidence degree  this localization estimator takes the
values  in this way  the children generated from these three parents will inherit the features
of the best individuals of the population 
the rest of the paper is organized as follows  section   explains the definition of cixl 
and its features  section   discusses the problem of the selection of the test sets  and
justifies the use of a test set based on the one proposed by eiben and back      a   section
  describes the experimental setup of evolutionary algorithm  rcga  used in the tests 
section   studies the optimal values of the parameters of cixl   section   compares the
performance of cixl  against other crossovers  section   compares cixl  with edas 
section   describes the application of rcgas with cixl  to neural network ensembles 
and  finally  section   states the conclusions of our paper and the future research lines 

   cixl  operator
in this section we will explain the theoretical base that supports the defined crossover
operator  and then we will define the crossover  we will use an example to explain the
dynamics of a population subject to this crossover operator 
    theoretical foundation
in this section we will study the distribution of the i th gene and the construction of a
confidence interval for to the localization parameter associated with that distribution 
 

ficixl   a crossover operator for evolutionary algorithms

let  be the set of n individuals with p genes that make up the population and   
 the set of the best n individuals  if we assume that the genes i of the individuals
belonging to   are independent random variables with a continuous distribution h i  
with a localization parameter i   we can define the model
i   i   ei  

for i           p 

   

being ei a random variable  if we suppose that  for each gene i  the best n individuals form
                of the distribution of     then the model takes the form
a random sample  i  
i  
i n
i

ij
  i   eij  

for i           p and j           n 

   

using this model  we analyze an estimator of the localization parameter for the i th
gene based on the minimization of the dispersion function induced by the l  norm  the l 
norm is defined as
n
x
 eij     
   
kei k    
j  

hence the associated dispersion induced by the l  norm in the model   is
d   i    

n
x
j  


 ij
 i     

   

and the estimator of the localization parameter i is 


i

  arg min d        arg min
i

n
x
j  


 ij
 i     

   

using for minimization the steepest gradient descent method 
s   i     
we obtain
s   i      

d   i

and making     equal to   yields

so  the estimator of the localization parameter for the i th gene based on the minimization of the dispersion function induced by the l  norm is the mean of the distribution of
i  kendall   stuart         that is  i   i  
 

fiortiz boyer  hervas martnez    garca pedrajas

the sample mean estimator is a linear estimator    so it has the properties of unbiasedness  and consistency    and it follows a normal distribution n  i       n  when the
i
distribution of the genes h i   is normal  under this hypothesis  we construct a bilateral
confidence interval for the localization of the genes of the best n individuals  using the
studentization method  the mean as the localization parameter and the standard deviation

where tn     is the value of students t distribution with n    degrees of freedom  and
    is the confidence coefficient  that is  the probability that the interval contains the true
value of the population mean 
    cixl  definition
from this definition of the confidence interval  we define three intervals to create three virtual parents  formed by the lower limits of the confidence interval of each gene  cill     the
upper limits  ciu l    and the means cim     these parents have the statistical information
of the localization features and dispersion of the best individuals of the population  that is 
the genetic information the fittest individuals share  their definition is

the cill and ciu l individuals divide the domain of each gene into three subintervals

being ai and bi the bounds of the domain  see figure    
the crossover operator creates one offspring  s   from an individual of the population
 f    randomly selected  and one of the individuals cill  ciu l or cim   depending
on the localization of  f   as follows 
   it is a linear combination of the sample values 
   an estimator  is an unbiased estimator of  if the expected value of the estimator is the parameter to

   a consistent estimator is an estimator that converges in probability to the quantity being estimated as

where r is a random number in the interval        
with this definition  the offspring always takes values in the direction of the best of the
two parents but never between them  if the virtual individual is one of the bounds of the
confidence interval and is better than the other parent  the offspring is generated in the
direction of the confidence interval where it is more likely to generate better individuals 
if the virtual individual is worse than the other parent  the offspring is generated near the
other parent in the opposite direction of the confidence interval  on the other hand  if a
parent selected from the population is within the confidence interval  the offspring can be
outside the interval  but always in its neighborhood  if the fitness of the center of the
confidence interval is worse  this formulation tries to avoid a shifting of the population
towards the confidence interval  unless this shifting means a real improvement of the fitness
in the population 
if  f is distant from the other parent  the offspring will probably undergo a marked
change  and if both parents are close  the change will be small  the first circumstance will
be likely to occur in the first stages of the evolutionary process  and the second one in the
final stages 
the width of the interval i ci depends on the confidence coefficient       the number
of best individuals  n  and the dispersion of the best individuals  in the first stages of the
evolution  the dispersion will be large  specially for multimodal functions  and will decrease
together with the convergence of the genetic algorithm  these features allow the balance
between exploitation and exploration to adjust itself dynamically  the crossover will be
more exploratory at the beginning of the evolution  avoiding a premature convergence  and
more exploitative at the end  allowing a fine tuning  the parameters n and   regulate the
dynamics of the balance favoring a higher or lower degree of exploitation  that suggests the
cixl  establishes a self adaptive equilibrium between exploration and exploitation based
on the features that share  with a certain confidence degree      the best n individuals

figure    effect of the cixl  crossover over a population used for the minimization of the
rosenbrock function with two variables

of the population  a preliminary theoretical study of this aspect is carried out by hervasmartnez and ortiz boyer        
    crossover dynamics
figure   shows a simulation of the behavior of the crossover for the optimization of rosenbrock function  eiben   back      b  with two variables  on figure  a  we observe how
most of the individuals are within the domain d cip   while the best n are within the confidence domain d ci  i ci i ci   dci is shifted towards the minimum of the function placed
in         the domain d cip of the new population  generated after applying cixl   will be
shifted to the optimum  this displacement will be higher in the first stages of evolution 
and will decrease during evolution  it may be modulated by the parameters n and     
figure  a shows how the population  after applying the crossover operator  is distributed
in a region nearer the optimum whose diversity depends on the parameters of the operator 
figure  b shows how the whole population and the n best individuals are distributed  as
we can see  the distribution of the best n individuals keeps the features of the distribution of
the population  but it is shifted to the optimum  the shifting towards the optimum will be
more marked if the value of n is small  the tails of the distribution of the best individuals
will be larger if the dispersion of the best individuals is also large  and smaller if they are
concentrated in a narrow region  the size of these tails also depends on the features of the
problem  the stage of the evolution  and the particular gene considered  the effect of the
crossover on the distribution of the population is to shift the distribution towards the best
n individuals and to stretch the distribution modulately depending on the amplitude of the
confidence interval  the parameters n and     are responsible for the displacement and
the stretching of the region where the new individuals will be generated 
if n is small  the population will move to the most promising individuals quickly  this
may be convenient for increasing the convergence speed in unimodal functions  nevertheless 
it can produce a premature convergence to suboptimal values in multimodal functions  if
n is large  both the shifting and the speed of convergence will be smaller  however  the
 

ficixl   a crossover operator for evolutionary algorithms

evolutionary process will be more robust  this feature being perfectly adequate for the
optimization of multimodal  non separable  highly epistatic functions 
the parameter n is responsible for the selectiveness of the crossover  as it determines
the region where the search will be directed  the selection is regulated by the parameter
     this parameter bounds the error margin of the crossover operator in order to obtain
a search direction from the feature that shares the best individuals of the population 

   benchmark problems
in the field of evolutionary computation  it is common to compare different algorithms using
a large test set  especially when the test involves function optimization  gordon   whitley 
       however  the effectiveness of an algorithm against another algorithm cannot be
measured by the number of problems that it solves better  the no free lunch theorem
 wolpert   macready        shows that  if we compare two searching algorithms with all
possible functions  the performance of any two algorithms will be   on average  the same
  as a result  attempting to design a perfect test set where all the functions are present
in order to determine whether an algorithm is better than another for every function  is a
fruitless task 
that is the reason why  when an algorithm is evaluated  we must look for the kind
of problems where its performance is good  in order to characterize the type of problems
for which the algorithm is suitable  in this way  we have made a previous study of the
functions to be optimized for constructing a test set with fewer functions and a better
selection  whitley  mathias  rana    dzubera        salomon         this allows us to
obtain conclusions of the performance of the algorithm depending on the type of function 
taking into account this reasoning  the test set designed by eiben and back      b  is
very adequate  the test set has several well characterized functions that will allow us to
obtain and generalize  as far as possible  the results regarding the kind of function involved 
nevertheless  we have added two functions to the test set with the aim of balancing the
number of functions of each kind  these two new functions are the function of rosenbrock
 rosenbrock        extended to p dimensions and the function of schwefel  schwefel        
both of them have been widely used in evolutive optimization literature  table   shows the
expression of each function and a summary of its features  separability  multimodality  and
regularity 
a function is multimodal if it has two or more local optima  a function of p variables is
separable if it can be rewritten as a sum of p functions of just one variable  hadley        
the separability is closely related to the concept of epistasis or interrelation among the
variables of the function  in the field of evolutionary computation  the epistasis measures
how much the contribution of a gene to the fitness of the individual depends on the values
of other genes 
non separable functions are more difficult to optimize as the accurate search direction
depends on two or more genes  on the other hand  separable functions can be optimized for
each variable in turn  the problem is even more difficult if the function is also multimodal 
the search process must be able to avoid the regions around local minima in order to
approximate  as far as possible  the global optimum  the most complex case appears when
the local optima are randomly distributed in the search space

table    definition of each function together with its features

the dimensionality of the search space is another important factor in the complexity
of the problem  a study of the dimensionality problem and its features was carried out by
friedman         in order to establish the same degree of difficulty in all the problems  we
have chosen a search space of dimensionality p      for all the functions 
sphere function has been used in the development of the theory of evolutionary strategies
 rechenberg         and in the evaluation of genetic algorithms as part of the test set
proposed by de jong         sphere  or de jongs function f   is a simple and strongly
convex function  schwefels double sum function was proposed by schwefel         its main
difficulty is that its gradient is not oriented along their axis due to the epistasis among their
variables  in this way  the algorithms that use the gradient converge very slowly  rosenbrock
function  rosenbrock         or de jongs function f   is a two dimensional function with
a deep valley with the shape of a parabola of the form x     x  that leads to the global
minimum  due to the non linearity of the valley  many algorithms converge slowly because
they change the direction of the search repeatedly  the extended version of this function
was proposed by spedicato         other versions have been proposed  oren        dixon 
       it is considered by many authors as a challenge for any optimization algorithm
 schlierkamp voosen         its difficulty is mainly due to the non linear interaction among
its variables 
rastrigin function  rastrigin        was constructed from sphere adding a modulator
term   cos  xi    its contour is made up of a large number of local minima whose value
increases with the distance to the global minimum  the surface of schwefel function  schwefel        is composed of a great number of peaks and valleys  the function has a second
  

ficixl   a crossover operator for evolutionary algorithms

best minimum far from the global minimum where many search algorithms are trapped 
moreover  the global minimum is near the bounds of the domain 
ackley  originally proposed by ackley        and generalized by back         has an
exponential term that covers its surface with numerous local minima  the complexity of
this function is moderated  an algorithm that only uses the gradient steepest descent
will be trapped in a local optima  but any search strategy that analyzes a wider region
will be able to cross the valley among the optima and achieve better results  in order to
obtain good results for this function  the search strategy must combine the exploratory and
exploitative components efficiently  griewangk function  back  fogel    michalewicz       
has a product term that introduces interdependence among the variables  the aim is the
failure of the techniques that optimize each variable independently  as in ackley function 
the optima of griewangk function are regularly distributed 
the functions of fletcher powell  fletcher   powell        and langerman  bersini 
dorigo  langerman  seront    gambardella        are highly multimodal  as ackley and
griewangk  but they are non symmetrical and their local optima are randomly distributed 
in this way  the objective function has no implicit symmetry advantages that might simplify
optimization for certain algorithms  fletcher powel function achieves the random distribution of the optima choosing the values of the matrixes a and b  and of the vector  at
random  we have used the values provided by back         for langerman function  we
have used the values of a and c referenced by eiben and back      b  

   evolutionary algorithm
the most suitable evolutionary algorithms to solve optimization problems in continuous
domains are evolutionary strategies  schwefel        rechenberg         genetic algorithms
 holland        goldberg      a  with real coding  goldberg        and evolutionary programming  fogel  owens    walsh        fogel         for evaluating cixl  we have
chosen real coded genetic algorithms  because they are search algorithms of general purpose where the crossover operator plays a central role  the general structure of the genetic
algorithm is shown in figure   
nevertheless  cixl  could be applied to any evolutionary algorithms with a crossover
or similar operator  on the other hand  the real codification is the most natural one in
continuous domains  each gene representing a variable of the function  in this way  the
precision of the solution only depends on the data type used to store the variables 
our objective is the comparison of the behavior of the proposed crossover against other
crossovers  this comparison must be made in a common evolutionary framework that is
defined by the features of the genetic algorithm  for the definition of such features  we have
taken into account the previous studies on the matter  in the following paragraphs we will
describe in depth the different components of our genetic algorithm 
    structure of the individual and population size
each individual is made up of p      genes  the dimensionality of the functions to optimize 
the size of the population is one of the critical parameters for many applications  if
the size of the population is too small  the algorithm could converge quickly towards suboptimal solutions  if it is too large  too much time and resources could be wasted  it is also

end
figure    structure of the genetic algorithm  t is the current generation 
obvious that the size of the population  together with the selective pressure  influences the
diversity of the population 
several researches have studied these problems from different points of view  grefenstette        used a meta genetic algorithm for controlling the parameters of another genetic
algorithm  such as population size and the selection method  goldberg      b  made a theoretical analysis of the optimum population size  a study of the influence of the parameters
on the search process was carried out by schaffer  caruana  eshelman and das        
smith        proposed an algorithm that adjusts the size of the population with respect to
the error probability of the selection   another method consists of changing the size of the
population  arabas  michalewicz    mulawka        dynamically 
the size of the population is usually chosen in an interval between    and     individuals 
depending on the difficulty of the problem  as a general practice  in function optimization 
the size is in the interval           for unimodal functions  and in the interval           
for multimodal functions  however  several papers use a compromise size of     for all the
functions in order to homogenize the comparison environment  we will also use a population
size of     individuals like other comparative studies  zhang   kim        takahashi  kita 
  kobayashi        
    selection
zhang and kim        a comparative study was carried out of the performance of four
selection methods  proportional  ranking  tournament and genitor  in contrast to other
studies that are based on an asymptotic study under more or less ideal conditions  this
paper is devoted to a practical case  the problem of machine layout  the paper analyzes
the quality of the solutions obtained in a reasonable amount of time and using mutation
and crossover operators  the study concludes that the methods of ranking and tournament
selection obtain better results than the methods of proportional and genitor selection 
  

ficixl   a crossover operator for evolutionary algorithms

we have chosen the binary tournament selection  against the ranking selection  used by
zhang and kim        for two reasons 
 the complexity of the tournament selection is lower than the complexity of the ranking
selection  back        
 the selective pressure is higher  this feature allows us to measure whether each
crossover is able to keep the population diversity  goldberg   deb        
tournament selection runs a tournament between two individuals and selects the winner 
in order to assure that the best individuals always survive to the next generation  we use
elitism  the best individual of the population in generation t is always included in the
population in generation t      it has been proved  both theoretically  rudolph        and
empirically  back        michalewicz        zhang   kim         the convenience of the
use of elitism 
    population update model
there are different techniques for updating the population  among the most important are
the generational model and the steady state model  in the generational model in each
generation a complete set of n new offspring individuals is created from n parents selected
from the population  in most such generational models  the tournament selection is used to
choose two parent individuals  and a crossover with pc probability and a mutation operator
con pm probability are applied to the parents 
this contrasts with the steady state model  where one member of the population is
replaced at a time  the steady state model selects an individual to be mutated and the
mutated individual replaces another individual of the population  for the crossover two
individuals are selected and one of the offspring replaces one individual of the population 
there are a number of different replacement strategies  replace worst  replace a randomly
chosen member  select replacement using negative fitness 
the model that extrapolates between generational and steady state is said to have a
generation gap g  de jong        jong   sarma         thus for a generational model 
g      while for a steady state model  g     n   one of the most widely used variants of
the steady stated genetic algorithm is the minimal generation gap  mgg  model  satoh 
yamamura    kobayashi         this model takes two parents randomly from the population and generates  children  two individuals are selected from the parents and the
offspring  the best individual  and another individual chosen by roulette selection  these
two individuals substitute the parents in the population 
the generational model is the most frequently used in the comparative studies that use
blx  sbx  logical crossover and fuzzy recombination  this is the reason why it will be the
model used in this paper  however  for undx crossover we have used the mgg model 
because undx and mgg are commonly used together and the generational model can
have a negative influence on the performance of undx 
for the parameters of the two models we have used the most commonly used in the
literature  for the generational model  we use a probability of crossover of p c        de
jong        herrera  lozano    verdegay         for the mgg model we have used        
  

fiortiz boyer  hervas martnez    garca pedrajas

as this is a value commonly used in papers about undx  ono   kobayashi        ono 
kita    kobayashi        ono  kobayashi    yoshida         for the mutation probability 
values in the interval pm               are usual  de jong        herrera et al        
michalewicz        back         we have chosen a value of pm        for both models 
    initialization
in a search algorithm  the initialization method is very important  in many cases the
initialization determines the success or failure of the search process  we have opted  as in
other papers  herrera et al         de jong        beyer   deb        herrera  lozano 
  sanchez         for initializing the values of the genes by means of a uniform random
distribution within the domain of each variable 
    mutation
as mutation operator we have chosen the non uniform mutation with parameter b    
 michalewicz        as its dynamical nature makes it very suitable for a wide variety of
problems  herrera   lozano        
the individuals  m generated by this mutation are obtained as follows

where t is the generation  gmax is the maximum number of generations   is a random value 
          r is a random number in the interval        and b is a parameter that determines
the degree of dependence of the mutation with regards to the number of iterations  equation
   gives values in the interval     y   the probability of obtaining a value near   increases
as the algorithm progresses  this operator performs a uniform search in the initial stages
of the evolution  and a very localized search in the final stages 
    stop criterion
the part of the genetic algorithm that takes up most of the time is the evaluation of the
fitness function  the number of evaluations of the fitness in each generation depends on the
operators used and the population update model  different operators and update models
can lead to very different numbers of evaluations per generation  that is the reason why
it is common to use the number of evaluations as the stop criterion instead of the number
of generations  we have used a limit of         evaluations  eiben  van der hauw    van
hemert        de jong   kosters        as stop criterion  the precision of the solutions
is bounded by the precision of the data type used in the implementation of the genetic
algorithm  we have used a double precision data type of    bits following the specification
ansi ieee std           ieee standard for binary floating point arithmetic   this
data type has a precision of         digits 
  

ficixl   a crossover operator for evolutionary algorithms

   analysis of cixl 
in this section we will perform an analysis of the crossover  and will obtain for every test
function the following information 
   the optimal value for the confidence coefficient     of the confidence interval  the
values used are                                
   the optimal number of best individuals used by the crossover to calculate the confidence intervals of the mean  the values used are n                       
these two factors are not independent  so we will perform an analysis using all the
possible pairs       n  of the cartesian product of the two sets  for each pair we will
perform    runs of the genetic algorithm with different random seeds  table   shows the
average value and standard deviation of the    runs for each experiment 
the study of the results has been made by means of an analysis of variance anova
ii  dunn   clark        miller        snedecor   cochran         with the fitness of the
best individuals  a  as test variable  this fitness is obtained independently in    runs and
depending on two fixed factors and their interaction  the fixed factors are  the confidence
coefficient c with four levels and the number of best individuals b with five levels  the
linear model has the form 

aij      ci   bj   cbij   eij

    

i               and j                
where 
 ci is the effect over a of the i th level of factor c  where c  represents a confidence
coefficient of       c  of       c  of      and c  of      
 bj is the effect over a of the j th level of factor b  where b  represents a value of
n      b  of n       b  of n       b  of n      and b  of n      
 cbij represents the effect of the interaction between the confidence coefficient c and
the number of best individuals b 
  is the global mean of the model  the variation of the experimental results from 
is explained by the effects of the different levels of the factors of the model and their
interaction 
 eij are error variables 
the hypothesis tests try to determine the effect of each term over the fitness of the best
individuals  a  we have carried out tests for every factor and for the interaction among
the factors  this and subsequent tests are performed with a confidence level of      the
coefficient r  of the linear model tells us the percentage of variance of a that is explained
by the model

ficixl   a crossover operator for evolutionary algorithms

for determining whether there are significant differences among the various levels of
a factor  we perform a multiple comparison test of the average fitness obtained with the
different levels of each factor  first  we carry out a levene test  miller        levene 
      for evaluating the equality of variances  if the hypothesis that the variances are
equal is accepted  we perform a bonferroni test  miller        for ranking the means of
each level of the factor  our aim is to find the level of each factor whose average fitness
is significantly better than the average fitness of the rest of the levels of the factor  if
the test of levene results in rejecting the equality of covariance matrixes  we perform a
tamhane test  tamhane   dunlop        instead of a bonferroni test  tables        and
   in appendix a show the results obtained following the above methodology 
for sphere function  the significant levels  of each term of the linear model on table  
show that none of the factors of the linear model has a significant effect on the model built
to explain the variance of the fitness a  this effect is due to the fact that fsph is easy to
optimize and the fitness behaves as a singular random variable with sample variance near
   we can see in table   that the best results are obtained with the pair            the
multiple comparison test of table    confirms that the means obtained with the value n    
are significatively better than the means obtained with other values  in the same way  the
average fitness for            is significantly the best one  the results show that  for any
value of n  the best value of      in general  is             due to the simple form of
fsph   the best parameters of the crossover show a high exploitative component with a fast
shifting towards the region of the best individuals 
for the unimodal and non separable functions fschds and fros   both factors and their
interaction are significant in the linear model that explains the sample variance of a with
a determination coefficient around      table   shows that the best results are obtained
with n      the tamhane test shows that the means obtained with this value of n are
significatively better than the means obtained with other values  the results for the value
of the confidence coefficient are less conclusive  in fact  for fros there are no significant
differences among the different values of      although the best results are obtained with
           for fschds the average fitness for      is the best one  but without significant
differences with             together with n     is the one that shows the best results  we
can conclude that the feature of non separability of the functions does not imply a notable
change in the parameters of the crossover with respect to the parameters used for f sph  
for fras and fsch   which are separable and multimodal  the most adequate pair of
parameters is            for fras   the test shows that the performance of this pair is significantly better  however  for fsch   the best mean is obtained with   with results that are
significantly better than these obtained with other values  with the exception of       there
are no significant differences among             and      the three factors of the linear
model are significant with quite large determination coefficients of       for f ras and      
forfsch   this means that the factors and their interaction explain a high percentage of the
variance of the fitness a 
for fack   the best results are obtained with the pair            the tamhane test confirms
that n     is the most suitable value  while there are no significant differences among        
     and        for fgri the best results are obtained with the pair             the test
shows that large values of n are the most suitable for the optimization of this function 
there are no significant differences among the performance of the different values of     
  

fiortiz boyer  hervas martnez    garca pedrajas

for both functions the determination coefficient of the linear model is low  showing that
the linear model does not explain the variance of the fitness  the lack of a linear relation
among n      and the fitness makes it more difficult to determine the best value of the
parameters of the crossover 
the case of ff le and flan is similar  as the linear model hardly gives any information
about the effect of the parameters on the fitness  the most adequate pair for the optimization of these two functions is            the test shows that the best values of n are n    
and n       on the other hand  there are no significant differences among the performance
of the crossover for the different values of     
the overall results show that the selection of the best n     individuals of the population
would suffice for obtaining a localization estimator good enough to guide the search process
even for multimodal functions where a small value of n could favor the convergence to
local optima  however  if the virtual parents have a worse fitness than the parent from the
population  the offspring is generated near the latter  and the domain can be explored in
multiple directions  in this way  the premature convergence to suboptimal virtual parents
is avoided 
however  if the best n individuals are concentrated in a local optimum the algorithm
will very likely converge to such optimum  that is the reason why in complex functions a
larger value of n may be reasonable  adding to the confidence interval individuals located in
or near different optima  as an example of this  the case of fgri for which the best results
are achieved with n      and n      is noteworthy 
the confidence coefficient bounds the error in the determination of the localization
parameter and is responsible for focussing the search  the multiple comparison tests show
that the value            is the best for   problems  and is  as least  no worse than the
best one in the other problems  so it can be chosen as the most adequate value of the
parameter 

   comparative study of the crossovers
due to the large amount of different crossovers available  it is unfeasible to make a comprehensive comparison between all those crossovers and cixl   we have chosen those
crossovers that obtain interesting results and those whose features are similar to our crossover 
that is  which are self adaptive and establish a balance between the exploration and the exploitation of the search space  the way in which these two features are balanced is regulated
by one or more parameters of each crossover  these parameters have been chosen following
the authors recommendations and the papers devoted to the comparison of the different
operators 
the crossovers used in the comparison are  blx  eshelman   schaffer        with
different degrees of exploration determined by the values                herrera et al  
       fuzzy recombination  voigt et al          based on fuzzy connectives of the logical

ficixl   a crossover operator for evolutionary algorithms

following the setup of the previous study  we performed an anova ii analysis and
a multiple comparison test  as might have been expected  keeping in mind the no free
lunch theorem and the diversity of the functions of the test set  the tests show that there is
no crossover whose results are significatively better than the results of all other crossovers 
this does not mean that these differences could not exist for certain kinds of functions 
so  in order to determine for each kind of function whether a crossover is better than the
others  we have performed an anova i analysis  where the only factor is the crossover
operator  and a multiple comparison test  additionally  we graphically study the speed
of convergence of the rcga with regard to the crossover operator  in order to enforce the
clearness of the graphics for each crossover  we show only the curve of the best performing
set of parameters for blx and sbx crossovers

table   shows the average values and standard deviations for the    runs performed for
each crossover operator  table    in appendix a shows how  for all the functions  except
fros   the crossover operator has a significant effect on the linear model  the table also
shows that the results of the levene test indicate the inequality of the variances of the
results of all the functions  excepting ff le   so  we use the bonferroni test for ff le   and the
tamhane test for all the others  the results of the multiple comparison test  the ranking
established by the tests and the significant level of the differences among the results of the
crossovers are shown on tables        and     appendix a   figures         in appendix
b  show  in logarithmic scale  the convergence curves for each function 
  

fiortiz boyer  hervas martnez    garca pedrajas

for fsph the high value of the determination coefficient shows that the linear model
explains much of the variance of the fitness  the best values are obtained with blx      
blx      and cixl   in this order  with these operators we obtain precisions around
 e     figure   shows that cixl  is the fastest in convergence  but it is surpassed by blx
in the last generations 
for fschds and fros the best results are obtained with cixl   for fschds the difference
in performance with the other crossovers is statistically significant  for f ros the differences
are significant  when cixl  is compared with logical and undx  for f schds the figure  
shows how cixl  achieves a quasi exponential convergence and a more precise final result 
for fros   in the figure   we can see how the speed of convergence of cixl  is the highest 
although the profile of all the crossovers is very similar with a fast initial convergence
followed by a poor evolution due to the high epistasis of the function  the differences in
the overall process are small  this fact explains that in the linear model the influence of
the factor crossover is not significant and the determination coefficient is small 
for fras   blx      again obtains the best results but without significant difference to the
average values obtained with cixl  and blx       these three operators also obtain the
best results for fsch   however  the tests show that there are significant differences between
cixl  and blx       and that there are no differences between blx      and blx      
the latter obtains the best results  figures   and   show that blx is the best in terms of
convergence speed followed by cixl   the large value of r   means that the crossover has
a significant influence on the evolutive process 
for fack   cixl  obtains significantly better results  in figure    we can see how it
also converges faster  the large value of r  means that the crossover has a significant
influence on the evolutive process  for fgri   the fuzzy operator obtains significantly better
results  the following ones  with significant differences between them  are logical and
cixl   figure    shows a fast initial convergence of cixl   but in the end logical and
fuzzy obtain better results 
for ff le the best results are obtained with cixl   but the difference is only significant
with sbx and undx  figure    shows that cixl  is the fastest in convergence  but with
a curve profile similar to blx and fuzzy  for flan   the best operator is blx       with
differences that are significant for all the other operators with the exception of blx      
undx and cixl  are together in third place  figure    shows that the behavior of all
crossovers is similar  except for the logical crossover that converges to a value far from the
other operators 

   comparison with estimation of distribution algorithms
edas are evolutionary algorithms that use  as cixl   the best individuals of the population
to direct the search  a comparison with this paradigm is interesting  although there are
significant differences between edas and rcgas 
edas remove the operators of crossover and mutation  in each generation a subset of the
population is selected and the distribution of the individuals of this subset is estimated  the
individuals of the population for the next generation are obtained sampling the estimated
distribution  although any selection method could be applied  the most common one is the
selection of the best individuals of the population 
  

ficixl   a crossover operator for evolutionary algorithms

the first edas were developed for discrete spaces  later  they were adapted to continuous domains  we can distinguish two types of edas  whether they take into account
dependencies between the variables or not  one of the most used among the edas that do
not consider dependencies is u m dac  univariate marginal distribution algorithm for continuous domains   larranaga  etxeberria  lozano    pena         in every generation and
for every variable the u m dac carries out some statistical test in order to find the density
function that best fits the variable  once the densities have been identified  the estimation
of parameters is performed by their maximum likelihood estimates  if all the distributions
are normal  the two parameters are the mean and the standard deviation  this particular
case will be denoted u m dag
c  univariate marginal distribution algorithm for gaussian
models  
among the other type of edas  we can consider egn abge  estimation of gaussian
network algorithm   larranaga et al         whose good results in function optimization
are reported by bengoetxea and miquelez         in each generation  egn a bge learns
the gaussian network structure by using a bayesian score that gives the same value for
gaussian networks reflecting the same conditional dependencies are used  next  it calculates
estimations for the parameters of the gaussian network structure 
in the experiments we have used the parameters reported by bengoetxea and t  miquelez
        a population of      individuals  initialized using a uniform distribution  from which
a subset of the best      individuals are selected to estimate the density function  and the
elitist approach was chosen  the best individual is included for the next population and     
individuals are simulated   each algorithm has been run    times with a stop criterion of
        evaluations of the fitness function 
the results of edas are compared with the results of a rcga with cixl  of parameters
n     and             we performed an anova i analysis where the three levels of the
factor are the different algorithms  rcga with cixl   u m dac and egn abge   we also
carried out a multiple comparison test 
table   shows the average values and standard deviations for    runs for each algorithm 
table    in appendix a shows how  for all the functions excepting fack   the type of algorithm has a significant effect over the linear model and exist inequality of the variances of
the results  levene test   so  we have used tamhane test for all the functions and bonferroni test for fack   table     appendix a  shows the results of the multiple comparison test
and the ranking established by the test 
for fsph the results are very similar  the fitness behaves as a singular random variable
with sample variance near   and the statistical tests are not feasible 
for fschds the results of cixl  are significantly better than the results of u m dac and
egn abge   the same situation occurs for fros   fras   fsch and fack   with the exception
that in these four functions there are no significant differences between the two edas  for
fgri   egn abge and u m dac achieve the best results  significantly better than cixl  
for ff le   u m dac is significantly better than egn abge and cixl   but there are no
differences between these two  for flan   cixl  obtains the best results  but there are no
significant differences among the three algorithms 
the estimation of the distribution function of the best individuals of the population
performed by edas is an advantage in fsph   unimodal and separable  and fgri and fack
whose optima are regularly distributed  the results of edas for fgri are better than
  

fiortiz boyer  hervas martnez    garca pedrajas

the results of cixl   but the results for fack are worse  the results for fsph of all the
algorithms are very similar  for non separable unimodal functions  such as f schds and fros  
the interdependence among their variables should favor the performance of egn a bge over
u m dac and cixl   nevertheless  cixl  achieves the best results for these two functions 
for multimodal separable functions  fras and fsch   it is difficult to identify the distribution
of the best individuals and the performance of edas is below the performance of cixl  
for extremely complex functions  such as ff le and flan   the results are less conclusive 
for ff le the best results are obtained with u m dac   and there are no differences between
egn abge and cixl   for flan   cixl  achieves the best results  but the differences
among the three algorithms are not statistically significant

to the estimation of the weight of each network in an ensemble  this is an interesting
problem where standard methods encounter many difficulties 
    estimation of the weights of the networks of an ensemble
neural network ensembles  perrone   cooper         garca pedrajas  hervas martnez 
  ortiz boyer        are receiving increasing attention in recent neural network research 
due to their interesting features  they are a powerful tool specially when facing complex
  

ficixl   a crossover operator for evolutionary algorithms

problems  network ensembles are made up of a linear combination of several networks that
have been trained using the same data  although the actual sample used by each network to
learn can be different  each network within the ensemble has a potentially different weight
in the output of the ensemble  several papers have shown  perrone   cooper        that
the network ensemble has a generalization error generally smaller than that obtained with
a single network and also that the variance of the ensemble is lesser than the variance of a
single network  the output of an ensemble  y  when an input pattern x is presented  is 
y x

i yi  x  

    

i  

where yi is the output of network i  and wi is the weight associated to that network  if the
networks have more than one output  a different weight is usually assigned to each output 
the ensembles of neural networks have some of the advantages of large networks without
their problems of long training time and risk of over fitting 
moreover  this combination of several networks that cooperate in solving a given task
has other important advantages  such as  liu  yao    higuchi        sharkey        
 they can perform more complex tasks than any of their subcomponents 
 they can make an overall system easier to understand and modify 
 they are more robust than a single network 
techniques using multiple models usually consist of two independent phases  model
generation and model combination  merz      b   once each network has been trained and
assigned a weights  model generation   there are  in a classification environment three basic
methods for combining the outputs of the networks  model combination  
   majority voting  each pattern is classified into the class where the majority of networks places it  merz      b   majority voting is effective  but is prone to fail in two
scenarios 
 a  when a subset of redundant and less accurate models comprise the majority  and
 b  when a dissenting vote is not recognized as an area of specialization for a particular model 
   sum of the outputs of the networks  the output of the ensemble is just the sum of
the outputs of the individual networks 
   winner takes all  the pattern is assigned to the class with the highest output over all
the outputs of all the networks  that is  the network with the largest outputs directly
classify the pattern  without taking into account the other networks 
the most commonly used methods for combining the networks are the majority voting
and sum of the outputs of the networks  both with a weight vector that measures the

 is not an easy task  usually  the values of the weights i are constrained

have been proposed over the last few years  among others  there are methods based on
linear regression  leblanc   tibshirani         principal components analysis and leastsquare regression  merz      a   correspondence analysis  merz      b   and the use of a

genetic algorithm has an additional advantage over the optimal linear combination  as the

      experimental setup
each set of available data was divided into two subsets      of the patterns were used
for learning  and the remaining     for testing the generalization of the networks  there
are two exceptions  sonar and vowel problems  as the patterns of these two problems are
prearranged in two specific subsets due to their particular features  a summary of these
data sets is shown in table    no validation set was used in our experiments

application  from medical diagnosis to vowel recognition  testing our model on this wide
variety of problems can give us a clear idea of its performance  these are all the sets to
which the method has been applied 
in order to test the efficiency of the proposed crossover in a classical artificial intelligence
problem  we have used a rcga to adjust the weight of each network within the ensemble 
our method considers each ensemble as a chromosome and applies a rcga to optimize
the weight of each network  the weight of each network of the ensemble is codified as a
real number  the chromosome formed in this way is subject to cixl  crossover and nonuniform mutation  the parameters of cixl  are the same used in the rest of the paper 
n     and            the combination method used in the weighted sum of the outputs
of the networks  nevertheless  the same genetic algorithm could be used for weighting each
network if a majority voting model is used 
the exact conditions of the experiments for each run of all the algorithms were the
following 
 the ensemble was formed by    networks  each network was trained separately using
and standard back propagation algorithm using the learning data 
 once the    networks have been trained  the different methods for obtaining the
weights were applied  so  all the methods use the same ensemble of networks on each
run of the experiment  for the genetic algorithm  the fitness of each individual of the
population is the classification accuracy over the learning set 
 after obtaining the vector of weights  the generalization error of each method is evaluated using the testing data 
tables   and   show the results in terms of accurate classification for the    problems 
the tables show the results using a rcga with cixl   and the standard bem and gem
methods  in order to compare the three methods we have performed a sign test over the
win draw loss record of the three algorithms  webb         these tests are shown in table
  
table   shows the comparison statistics for the three models  webb         for each
model we show the win draw loss statistic  where the first value is the number of data sets
for which col   row  the second is the number for which col   row  and the third is the
number for which col   row  the second row shows the p value of a two tailed sign test
on the win loss record  the table shows that the genetic algorithm using cixl  is able
to outperform the two standard algorithms bem and gem with a     confidence  on
the other hand  there are no significant differences between bem and gem  this result
is especially interesting because we have used a comprehensive set of problems from very
different domains  different types of inputs  and different numbers of classes 

   conclusions and future work
in this paper we have proposed a crossover operator that allows the offspring to inherit
features common to the best individuals of the population  the extraction of such common
features is carried out by the determination of confidence intervals of the mean of the

best individuals of the population  from these confidence intervals  cixl  creates three
virtual parents that are used to implement a directed search towards the region of the fittest
individuals  the amplitude and speed of the search is determined by the number of best
individuals selected and the confidence coefficient 
the study carried out in order to obtain the best parameters for cixl  concludes that
the value of n     best individuals is suitable to obtain the localization estimator to guide
the search in most of the problems tested  however  in very difficult problems  it would be
advisable to have a larger value of n to avoid the premature convergence of the evolutionary
process  the confident coefficient       is responsible  together with the dispersion of the
best individuals  for the modulation of the wideness of the confidence interval centered on
the localization estimator  the study results in the best value of             this pair of
values has an acceptable performance for all problems  although there is not an optimum
pair of values for all problems 
the comparative analysis of the crossover operators shows that cixl  is a good alternative to widely used crossovers such as blx for unimodal function such as fsph   fschds  
and fros   noteworthy is the performance of cixl  in the two non separable functions 
fschds and fros   where the other crossovers have a disparate behavior 
if in unimodal functions the strategy of extracting the statistical features of localization
and dispersion of the best individuals is a guarantee of good performance  the case for
multimodal functions is quite different  and the performance of the algorithm is not assured
a priori  nevertheless  the results obtained for this kind of functions show that cixl  is
always one of the best performing operators  for instance  in functions of a high complexity
such as fack  multimodal  non separable and regular  and ff le  multimodal  nonseparable and irregular  cixl  obtains the best results  this behavior reveals that
the determination of the region of the best individuals by means of confidence intervals
provides a robust methodology that  applied to crossover operator  shows an interesting
performance even in very difficult functions  in summary  we can affirm that this paper
proves that cixl  is a promising alternative to bear in mind  when we must choose which
crossover to use in a real coded genetic algorithm 
edas have shown very good performance for unimodal and separable functions  f sph  
and for functions whose optima are regularly distributed  fack and fgri   the performance
of edas decreases in multimodal  fras and fsch   and epistatic functions  fschds and fros  
on the other hand  cixl  is less sensitive to the type of function  the main reason for this
behavior may be found in the fact that cixl  uses the distribution information obtained
from the best individuals of the population differently  cixl  creates three virtual parents
  

fiortiz boyer  hervas martnez    garca pedrajas

from this distribution  but if the virtual parents have worse fitness than the individual
which mates  the offspring is not generated near these virtual parents  in this way  cixl 
prevents a shifting of the population to the confidence interval if the improvement of the
performance is not significant 
the applicability of the proposed crossover to a problem of artificial neural network
ensembles shows how this model can be used for solving standard artificial intelligence
problems  rcgas with cixl  can also be used in other aspects of ensemble design  such
as  selection of a subset of networks  and sampling of the training set of each network 
these promising results motivate the beginning of a new line of research geared to the
study of the distribution of the best individuals taking into account the kind of problem at
hand  we aim to propose new techniques of selection of individuals to be considered for
obtaining the confidence interval in a more reliable way  in multimodal  irregular  or with
many chaotically scattered optima functions the difficulty of obtaining the distributions
of the best individuals is enormous  in these kind of functions it would be interesting to
perform a cluster analysis of the selected best individuals and to obtain a confidence interval
for every cluster  this idea would allow the implementation of a multi directional crossover
towards different promising regions 
on the other hand  it is likely that as the evolutive process progresses the distribution
of the best individuals changes  in such a case  it would be advisable to perform  at regular
intervals  statistical tests to determine the distribution that best reflects the features of the
best individuals on the population 
alternatively  we are considering the construction of non parametric confidence intervals 
in this way  we need more robust estimators of the parameters of localization and dispersion
of the genes of the best individuals  we have performed some preliminary studies using the
median and different measures of dispersion and the results are quite encouraging 
another research line currently open is the study of the application of cixl  to problems of optimization with restrictions  especially in the presence of non linearity  where
the generation of individuals in the feasible region is a big issue  the orientation of the
search based on the identification of the region of the best individuals that is implemented
by cixl  could favor the generation of feasible individuals  this feature would be an
interesting advantage with respect to other crossover operators
