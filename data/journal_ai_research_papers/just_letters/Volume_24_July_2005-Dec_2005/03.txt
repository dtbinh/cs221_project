abstract
we present a uniform non monotonic solution to the problems of reasoning about action
on the basis of an argumentation theoretic approach  our theory is provably correct relative
to a sensible minimisation policy introduced on top of a temporal propositional logic 
sophisticated problem domains can be formalised in our framework  as much attention of
researchers in the field has been paid to the traditional and basic problems in reasoning
about actions such as the frame  the qualification and the ramification problems  approaches
to these problems within our formalisation lie at heart of the expositions presented in this
paper 

   motivation and introduction
the need for a good reasoning about action formalism is apparent for research in artificial
intelligence  ai   alongside the logicist point of view to artificial intelligence  more recently 
there emerges the cognitivist and situated action based approaches see kushmerick      
and the references therein   the latter approaches provide some immediate and practical
answers to certain issues of ai  the current problem domains for  soccer  robot cup
seem to be an area where these approaches promise to gain fruitful results  on the other
hand  the logicist approach aims at long term solutions for the general problems of ai 
from a logicist approach  formalising dynamic domains for reasoning about action can
be realised within a logical knowledge representation  the general idea is that intelligent
agents should be able to represent all kinds of knowledge in a uniform way such that some
general problem solver can fully employ and find a solution based on their knowledge  as
it turns out  there are difficulties with such a general approach to ai  consider the task of
formalising dynamic domains in some logical language  to formalise the dynamics of an
action  or event  in a language with n fluents     one will need to axiomatise not only about
the fluents that are effected by the action but also about those that are not  essentially  it
requires that n axioms be asserted  such a formalisation can hardly be considered a good
   fluent is a technical term referring to functions or predicates whose values can be varied relative to time

representation  hence  there is the need to solve this problem in logic based reasoning about
action formalisms  this is the well known frame problem as introduced by mccarthy and
hayes         moreover  there is still a problem in axiomatising the effects of an action 
called the effect axioms  a logical axiomatisation requires that the conditions under which
the effects will take place after executing the action be precisely specified  however  there
are potentially infinitely many such conditions  some of which the reasoner may never have
thought about  no realistic formalisation would ever be able to exhaustively enumerate all
of those conditions  nonetheless  to start a car  most people only worry about whether they
have the key to that car  they never bother checking whether there is something blocking
the tailpipe or checking all electric circuits to make sure that they are all well connected 
such a story has long been well known within the community of commonsense reasoning 
in particular reasoning about action  this is known as the qualification problem and was
introduced by mccarthy        
while there have been a number of solutions to the frame problem  e g   shanahan       
reiter        castilho  gasquet    herzig         the qualification problem has largely been
ignored with the notable exception of thielschers        solution within the fluent calculus and doherty and kvarnstroms        circumscription based solution using fluent
dependency constraints  some people argue that the frame problem is already very challenging and it would be a good approach to thoroughly solve the frame problem before
complicating a formalism with the qualification problem  we argue that there is a danger
of approaching these problems from that point of view for  at least  two reasons 
   it may be very hard to come up with a uniform solution for all problems  while many
existing solutions for the frame problem are monotonic  e g   reiter        castilho
et al          the qualification problem inherently requires a non monotonic solution 
this is the case with the original qualification problem as stated by mccarthy       
for the dynamics of actions events need to be finitely axiomatisable and when an
unexpected qualification for an action arises  the agent must necessarily retract his
initial expectation that the effects caused by the action would take place  making the
underlying reasoning machinery non monotonic  see section     for a discussion on
the qualification problem  
   many solutions to the frame problem can only succeed under some precise assumptions 
for instance 
 actions always succeed  this is the action omniscience assumption  more precisely  this assumption dictates that the qualification problem is skipped  this
is the case with all monotonic solutions to the frame problem   
 fluents change if and only if the reasoner knows that there exists an action
that possibly changes its value  this can be termed as domain omniscience
   the argument that any solution to the frame problem which works with nondeterministic action is not
subject to this assumption does not stand  the quick fix of allowing such an approach to a fortiori express
actions that may fail by representing failure as a possible effect is an invalid one  it is because we can
no longer infer that  in the absence of evidences that suggest otherwise  actions would normally succeed 
its also worth noting that lins        extension of reiters        solution to the frame problem in the
situation calculus to deal with nondeterministic action is based on circumscription

assumption  it assumes that the reasoner has complete  ontological  knowledge
of the domain about which he is reasoning 
the above two reasons are of course closely related as the former arises due to the
underlying assumptions in the latter which no longer holds once the qualification problem
is taken into consideration 
in the remainder of this section  we review several works on this topic before introducing
the reader to our approach 
    the frame problem
in the late     s  the frame problem had been recognised as a major obstacle to formalising
dynamic domains  see the discussions and exposition by mccarthy   hayes        green 
       several alternative responses to the frame problem have been proposed along way 
to respond to the explosive number of axioms required for theorem proving based planners
as proposed by green         fikes and nilsson        introduce procedures that operate
on special data structures used to represent dynamic domains  however  for complex and
sophisticated problem domains  e g  those with domain constraints  concurrent actions 
observations at different time points  etc  strips quite often fails to express the domain
knowledge  in fact  the expressivity of strips is quite limited as has been pointed out
by lifschitz         another response attributing the frame problem as an artefact of
the situation calculus has proved to be ungrounded  there are attempts to distinguish
a logical or epistemological aspect of the frame problem from the computational aspect
 e g   mcdermott        kowalski         while the computational inefficiency associated
with a representation of dynamic domains in the situation calculus can be attributed to
the explosive number of global situations required by the situation calculus as argued by
kowalski and sergot         the logical aspect of the frame problem is inherent to any
logic based representation of dynamic domains  it is thus essential that a logical approach
to ai and knowledge representation have a decent solution to the frame problem 
later  with the introduction of the qualification problem by mccarthy         it is
reckoned that formalising dynamic domains not only is about solving the frame problem
but would require systematic studies to fundamental issues of knowledge representation  in
the early     s  the frame and the qualification problem were considered to be instances
of commonsense reasoning problems  in particular  many believed that a non monotonic
reasoning framework would solve the frame problem  it was argued that the principle of
inertia  which is considered to be the key to the frame problem can be formalised in terms
of default rules or default axioms in default reasoning  moreover  it was also argued that to
solve the qualification problem  the following common sense law should be rendered  an
action  by default  would qualify to succeed and bring about the intended effects unless there
is known reason for it not to  in formalisations of dynamic domains 
with the introduction of several non monotonic reasoning formalisms  e g  truth maintenance systems  tmss  by doyle         default logics by reiter         circumscriptive
approaches by mccarthy         modal non monotonic logic by mcdermott and doyle
   the principle of inertia or the common sense law of inertia basically states that by default a fluent
is assumed to persist over time unless there is evidence to believe otherwise  the reader is referred to
shanahans        book for more details on this principle and the issues around it

        autoepistemic logic by moore         etc   it was believed that these problems were
solved  the solutions to these problems were illustrated as examples for the proposed nonmonotonic reasoning frameworks  for instance  mccarthy        showed how circumscription is used to solve the frame problem relative to the blocks world domain  unfortunately 
hanks and mcdermott        show that these formalisations do not work correctly in a
simple dynamic domain known as the yale shooting problem  ysp   we will now review
successful attempts to solve the frame problem 
   baker        successfully modifies the original  and incorrect  circumscription policy
proposed by mccarthy        to deal with the yale shooting problem  in the traditional circumscriptive policy  the predicate abnormal is minimised with the predicate
holds allowed to vary  baker suggests that  instead of allowing holds to vary  the
function result should be the one to be varied  while this does not solve the frame
problem in its full generality  this initiates the line of research which brings many
fruitful results to reasoning about action community  for a more detailed discussion
about these solutions and the follow up works  the reader is referred to shanahans
       book  furthermore  foo  zhang  vo  and peppas        present an exposition on the issue from an automata and system theory point of view  in order for
bakers        solution to work correctly  additional axioms need to be introduced 
e g  domain closure axioms  axioms about the existence of situations  etc  this emphasises that   i  the circumscriptive approach to reasoning about action only works
under careful designation and considerations of the domain  and more importantly 
 ii  circumscription is domain dependent  that is  a domain dependent circumscriptive policy is required to correctly render the common sense of a particular problem
domain 
   a number of researchers argue that in many cases  a monotonic solution to the frame
problem will be sufficient  pednault        assumes that the effect of actions on fluents
are specified by effect axioms of the following forms 
x   y   s   f   x  do a  y    s   
 
f   
x   y   s 

f   

 f   x  do a  y    s   

   
   

here  a  y   and f   x  s  are the parameterised action and fluent  respectively    
x   y   s 
f   
and 
  
x

pednault
f
       makes the following causal completeness assumption 
the axioms     and     specify all the causal laws relating the action a
and the fluent f  
note that the causal completeness assumption is a stronger form of the domain
omniscience assumption presented above  under this assumption  the following frame
axioms can be introduced 
f   x  s   
x   y   s   f   x  do a  y    s   
f

f   
schubert         elaborating on a proposal of haas         employs the so called
explanation closure axioms of the following forms 

f   x  s   f   x  do a  s    f   x  a  s  

   

f   x  s   f   x  do a  s    f   x  a  s  

   

or  equivalently  we can rewrite the above two axioms as follows 

f   x  s   f   x  a  s   f   x  do a  s   
and
f   x  s   f   x  a  s   f   x  do a  s   
schuberts proposal is correct under the following assumption  called the explanation closure assumption 
f completely characterises all those actions a that can cause the fluent
f s truth value to change from true to false  similarly for  f  
reiter        then combines the merits of the above two proposals by systematically
generating the frame axioms as proposed by pednault        with the quantifiers over
the set of actions as proposed by haas        and schubert        
other researchers who also propose monotonic solution to the frame problem include
castilho et al          and zhang and foo        
   attempts to solve the frame problem using default logic  reiter        also encounter
some problematic issues  hanks and mcdermott        show that a natural formulation of the yale shooting problem in default logic suffers the same problem as that
with circumscriptive approaches  viz  the existence of anomalous extensions  morris
       proposes a slight modification on hanks and mcdermotts original formulation
to the yale shooting problem in an attempt to avoid the anomalous extensions  as
pointed out by turner         morris formulation is complete  and thus eliminates the
anomalous extensions in the yale shooting problem  but unsound  more importantly 
from morris formulation it is not clear how dynamic domains should be formulated
in general  turner        himself then proposes a way to formalise dynamic domains
using default logic  and also logic programming   his solution is based on the following observation  in the yale shooting domain and similar dynamic domains  the
anomalous extensions arise because undesired effects of an action can be derived by
reasoning backward in time  for instance  in the yale shooting domain  by making
   

fivo   foo

the counterintuitive supposition that the victim of the shooting is somehow still alive
after the shooting  an anomalous extension come up in the following way  first  it
allows the default saying that the victim persists to be alive regarding the shooting
action to be applicable  as a consequence  the gun must not be loaded before the
shooting action  therefore  it blocks the application of the default saying that the
gun persists to be loaded regarding the waiting action  in other words  the loaded
gun would get unloaded  magically  during the waiting action which is an undesirable conclusion  to block these lines of backward reasoning  turner appeals to the
non contrapositivity of inference rules and replaces the implications by inference rules 
to guarantee that this formulation work correctly  additional techniques are required
such as a fact  will be formulated as an inference rule 

false
and enforcing the completeness of the initial situation by adding the following rules 
  holds f  s   
holds f  s   

  holds f  s   
holds f  s   

for every fluent f  
however  turners        formulation is still fairly ad hoc as different techniques are
added to fix the known issues  for example  the inference rules are used in place of
implications to block the application of the undesirable backward reasoning  the
rules completing the initial situations are added to overcome the unsoundness issue in
morris        formulation  etc  this also shows the problematic side of default logic as
a uniform formalisation to various problems of common sense reasoning  this becomes
a serious issue if one proceeds with the question of how the qualification problem  a
typical problem of default reasoning  is solved in turners        formalisation of
dynamic domains  this is the case  for example  when instead of asserting that the
victim dies whenever it is shot by a loaded gun the reasoner can only maintain that as
a default proposition as there may be many hidden possible conditions under which
the victim may not die  thus the reasoner is able to deal with surprising situations
in which the victim is observed to be still alive after the shooting action  of a loaded
gun   another  symmetric  case is with surprises regarding the persistence of fluents 
for instance  after a waiting action  which is not supposed to unload a gun  the gun 
which was loaded before the wait action  is observed to be unloaded  such a scenario
was first introduced by kautz        in a scenario called the stolen car problem 
in both cases  reasoning backward in time is necessary  it is not clear how these
will be rendered in turners formulation which explicitly intends to block backward
reasoning  these scenarios will be analysed in the solution we present later in this
paper 
    the qualification problem
while there have been several solutions to the qualification problem  none of these addressed
the original qualification problem introduced by mccarthy        and later formalised by
ginsberg and smith        
   

fireasoning about action  an argumentation theoretic approach

   lin and reiter        propose a formalisation for action theories in the situation calculus  sc   their formalism is an extension of reiters        solution to the frame
problem  sometimes  by incorporating state constraints  they discover that there are
at least two different kinds of state constraints which they call ramification and qualification constraints  they then go further to claim a solution to the qualification  and
the ramification  problem  the basic idea behind their solution to the qualification
problem is that certain state constraints imply implicit preconditions of some actions 
thus an action may not be qualified even though it appears  from the explicit action
description  to be  while this is of course a special case of the qualification problem  the classical qualification problem as introduced by mccarthy        has a much
broader extent  in this setting  the qualification problem is more a pragmatic issue
than a technical issue  similar to the frame problem  it is impractical  and sometimes
impossible  to axiomatise all the possible preconditions of an action  for example  in
addition to the requirement that the gun be loaded  to guarantee that performing the
action shoot would kill the victim  many preconditions must also be included such as 
the gun is not malfunctioning  the shooter does not miss the victim  the victim does
not wear a bullet proof jacket  etc  among which some may be very improbable such
as  no alien interferes with the bullet  the reasoner simply does not want to consider these conditions by assuming that they are not the case unless there are explicit
evidences stating otherwise  in other words  the qualification problem in its original
form requires that the reasoner be able to tolerate the mistaken conclusions possibly
jumped to by previous inferences and to correct them appropriately  henceforth  we
will always refer to the qualification problem in this original form  it is this similarity
to the frame problem that led john mccarthy to conjecture that 
the frame problem may be a sub case of what we call the qualification
problem  and a good solution of the qualification problem may solve the
frame problem also 
 mccarthy        p        italics are original  
roughly    years after his introduction of the qualification problem  mccarthy       
presented his solution to the problem using his non monotonic formalism of circumscription  however  this solution suffers an almost identical flaw as its counterpart
regarding the frame problem  simple minimisation of abnormalities sanctions anomalous models  e g   thielscher        
   mccain and turner        propose a solution to the problem described by lin and
reiter         viz  the problem of deriving the implicit preconditions from state
constraints  mccain and turners solution is posed in a model based representation
of action theories 
   similar to mccain and turners        result  baral        offers a solution to the
problem defined by lin and reiter using a state based representation  baral extends
the language of disjunctive logic programs for state specification and as an action
description language 
   

fivo   foo

   doherty and kvarnstrom        make a careful investigation to the qualification problem  they are aware of the shortcomings present in the definition of the qualification
problem introduced by lin and reiter         they proceed one step further to distinguish between the weak and strong forms of the qualification problem  to deal
comprehensively with the qualification problem in its full extent  doherty and kvarnstrom apply circumscription on a predicate which plays a similar role to the predicate
p oss used by lin and reiter        
even though doherty and kvarnstroms        solution is closest in spirit to the
original form of the qualification problem  there is still a serious problem with their
approach  the intended designation on predicate p oss and its variants is actionoriented  that is  it would qualify on the executability condition for the action under
consideration  not towards the effects that action is supposed to cause  in other
words  only circumscribing p oss does not guarantee to capture the full extent of
the qualification problem  for example  a single action of shooting a gun may cause
several effects  killing the victim  making a loud noise  emptying the cartridge  etc 
the conditions for such an action to be executable is  having the gun  the gun is not
broken  the gun is loadable  etc  once the action is executable  it is not necessary
that all effects will take place  it may be the case that there is a loud noise and the
cartridge is emptied but the victim is still alive since the victim was wearing a bulletproof jacket  assuming that the reasoner is somehow aware about this possibility 
should he include the requirement that the victim not wear a bullet proof jacket as a
qualification for the action shoot  perhaps he should not for he would still expect to
hear a loud noise and the cartridge to be emptied after the shoot action 
these are not the end of all the troubles though  the presence of both qualification
and ramification constraints causes several complications  firstly  they are not syntactically distinguishable  secondly  as has been mentioned by doherty and kvarnstrom
        qualification constraints may cause indirect effects to arise and vice versa  i e 
ramification constraints may reveal implicit action preconditions 
remark  the terms ramification constraints and qualification constraints were first
introduced by lin and reiter        when a careful examination to state constraints
was taken  as discussed by doherty and kvarnstrom         these two kinds of constraints might interact in several ways  consider the example introduced by doherty
and kvarnstrom         the only preconditions of the action board a plane are havingticket and at gate  however  to a passenger who places a gun into his pocket at home
before travelling to the airport and proceeding to the gate  a new qualification for
the action board materialises  because one ramification of putting an object in your
pocket is that it will stay with you as you travel from location to location  i e  result of
a ramification constraint   a reasoner could easily conjecture that our passenger fails
to board the plane  on the other hand  the fact that a passenger who possesses a gun
when trying to board the plane must fail to board the plane is a result of a qualification
constraint  now  not only the fact that a passenger possesses a gun disqualifies the
action of boarding a plane but it also brings about an indirect effect when the action
of boarding a plane is executed  the passenger being put under arrest  note that for
this indirect effect to take place  both requirements must be present  the action of
   

fireasoning about action  an argumentation theoretic approach

boarding a plane being executed  and the above qualification constraint is present  in
other words  a qualification constraint might also bring about indirect effects 
we believe that all these problems are too sophisticated for any circumscription policy to successfully address in most situations  furthermore  such a policy would be
extremely hard to understand and error prone  recall the failure of non monotonic
reasoning formalisms regarding the frame problem  in its simplest form viz  without
the ramification and the qualification problems   researchers had failed to point out
this bug for several years before hanks and mcdermott discovered it in their award
winning paper        
   more recently  thielscher        gives an exposition on the qualification problem 
thielscher discusses the problem sustained by mccarthys        simplistic circumscription policy  viz  the anomalous models  he then introduces a default logic based
formalisation for the qualification problem in the fluent calculus and shows that
his formalisation does not suffer the problem of anomalous models  note that in
thielschers formalisation  circumscription is still required to generate the initial theories of the default theories  in addition to the set of default rules   nevertheless 
thielschers solution still suffers the following drawbacks   i  thielschers use of the
predicate p oss is in the same way as has been formulated by doherty and kvarnstrom
        thus  qualifications are taken over the executability conditions for the actions
rather than over different effects of the actions  and  ii  while thielscher shows that
the problem of anomalous models sustained by mccarthys        circumscription
policy is overcome in his formalisation  its not entirely clear whether thielschers
formalisation which is based on both circumscription and default logic will not suffer
from other anomalies 
    the ramification problem
in the context of reasoning about action  the ramification problem is mainly related to
indirect effects  finding a solution to this problem may not be easy as indirect effects
indicate exceptions to frame assumptions and require special treatment  while there have
been several formalisms dealing with the ramification problem  e g   see  lin        mccain
  turner        thielscher         there are still several issues that need a more careful
consideration  we consider three examples to motivate our discussion 
example   consider thielschers        circuit 
this example is interesting because it gives a counterexample for the minimalistic approaches e g  in the work of mccain and turner         in this domain  the intended
relationship between relay and sw  is that when relay is on  it would make sw   jump off 
thus  when sw  and sw  are both closed  sw  can not be also closed as that is prevented
by relay  however  there is certainly a duration  no matter how short it is  before sw  
is forced to jump off by relay  in the state given in figure    after performing the action
of closing switch sw    two next states are equally possible  one in which detect is on  in
another it is off   only the latter is sanctioned in a minimalistic account  through this
   the reason for nondeterminism in this case is due to insufficiency of domain information  depending on
the sensitivity of relay  light and detect  when light could get lit quickly and detect is very sensitive to

   

fivo   foo

 sw 

sw 
 light

 detect

 relay
sw 

figure    thielschers circuit
example  thielscher pointed out the need for keeping track of the chains of applications of
indirect effects 
thielscher        proposes a way to remedy this problem by keeping track of the applications of the domain constraints which are re expressed in terms of causal relationships 
thus  given the above example  his formalism is able to arrive at a next state in which the
detect is on  following such chains of causal relationships  the dynamic system undergoes
several intermediate states before arriving at the next state 
 
in this paper  we proceed one step further from thielschers        position by formally
representing the intermediate states as possible states of the world    we believe that an
intelligent agent should be able to reason about these intermediate states even though
they may not satisfy all domain constraints  this capability is especially important if the
reasoner needs to explain certain observations about the world in a systematic way  we
note that given an observation  there may be several chains of causal relationships that
bring about that observation   unless intermediate states are explicitly represented and
reasoned about  there is no way for an agent to have a full insight to the system in hand
and certain information would be missing 
example   consider lins        spring loaded suitcase with two latches  lets assume
that the latches can be toggled if the suitcase is closed  the following state constraint is
supposed to apply in this domain  up latch      up latch     open suitcase  
the question is  how does a robot close the above suitcase back after opening it  mccain
and turner        also consider this problem and their answer is 
detect any glimpse of light and relay is not sensitive enough to make the switch sw  jump off quickly
enough then detect will be on  otherwise it will stay off 
   note that this point of view also corresponds to the traditional definition of states as snapshots of the
world 
   for example  given detect is not on in the next state  it can be that either the light has never been bright
or the light may have been bright but the detect is not sufficiently sensitive to detect its momentary
brightness 

   

fireasoning about action  an argumentation theoretic approach

in general  when both latches are up  it is impossible to perform only the action
of closing the suitcase  one must also concurrently toggle at least one of the
latches 
 mccain   turner        p       italic is original  
the problem now is how to represent the action of holding the suitcase closed such
that it would overcome the above indirect effect caused by the loaded spring  this also
suggests another kind of actions whose direct effects are to keep the world unchanged 
these actions have usually been formalised by other researchers as fluents  e g  holding 
our main objection to this approach is that agents also need to reason about these actions
since they may also require certain preconditions such as the agent is strong enough to
hold the object  moreover  under certain  abnormal  circumstances  agents may also fail to
perform such actions  that is  these actions are also subject to the qualification problem
discussed in the previous subsection 
 
example   consider the circuit in figure     

 relay 

 sw 
sw 

 relay 
figure    a dynamic domain with a  potentially  infinite sequence of indirect effects
it is quite obvious that after performing the action f lip   whose direct effect is having sw 
closed  the following circular sequence of indirect effects will take place   relay     relay    
sw    relay    relay     sw    relay    relay     this sequence of course would
potentially carry on the above sequence of indirect effects indefinitely unless sw   is flipped
open or some device stopped functioning correctly  e g  when the battery is out of charge 
in other words  this action domain requires some action to be inserted in between a series
of on going indirect effects which can not be captured by the above representation  note
also that none of the causation based representations proposed by lin         mccain and
turner        or thielscher        is able to deal with the above action domain 
 
    towards a solution
to address the problems discussed in the previous sections  we argue that in order to find a
uniform solution to these problems one should avoid cryptic formalisms whose consequences
   this example is an instance of the so called vicious cycles scenarios  e g   see  shanahan        

   

fivo   foo

can not be seen clearly from the formalisation of the problem domains  as a consequence 
we propose a uniform non monotonic solution to the main problems of reasoning about action  essentially  when performing commonsense reasoning  the reasoner relies on a number
of plausible assumptions  e g   assuming that an instance of birds flies  or assuming that
shooting a turkey with a loaded gun causes it to die  etc  in traditional default reasoning
formalisms such as circumscriptive approaches or default logic  these assumptions are made
implicit  for example  these are the instances of predicates which are minimised away by
circumscription or the implicitly asserted justifications in default rules when they are still
consistent with the extension under consideration in default logic  the proposed representation formalism aims at making these assumptions explicit so that an automated reasoner
is conscious  at least  about what assumptions it relies on when performing reasoning 
then the reasoner can always manipulate these assumptions independently of each other 
it is also the basic idea of assumption based frameworks which are at heart of bondarenko 
dung  kowalski  and tonis        argumentation theoretic approach 
we then proceed to consider the ramification problems and domain theories with concurrent and non deterministic events  among the major results  we show that our framework
captures the essence of the causation based approaches regarding the ramification problem 
moreover  we also show the expressiveness of our formalism through two examples in which
indirect effects also need qualifications and infinite sequence of indirect effects  to the best
of our knowledge  none of the existing formalisms are able to cope with these scenarios 
based on the basic idea of assumption based frameworks  our approach comprises the
following major aspects of representation 
   we introduce different types of assumptions to render various laws of common sense
in dynamic domains  for instance  frame assumptions are introduced to capture
the common sense law of inertia whilst  two types of  qualification assumptions are
introduced to overcome the qualification problem 
   we introduce a special class of  system generated  dummy actions to allow the explanation problem  i e  when some actions or events occur outside of the reasoners
knowledge  to be dealt with in a uniform manner 
   being based on bondarenko et al s        argumentation theoretic framework  our
approach makes use of the inference rules to represent domain knowledge 
   lying at heart of our approach is an argumentation theoretic semantics  called plausibility semantics  which is argued to best render common sense knowledge in dynamic
domains  this semantics consists in a particular policy of resolving conflicting assumptions when computing the argumentation to be accepted 
to summarise  in this paper we formalise an expressive representation scheme in order
to cope with sophisticated action domains  we believe that such a formalisation sometimes
requires certain advanced knowledge to be encoded in a precise and well engineered way 
the representation of action theories proposed in this paper can be considered as the intermediate level between commonsense and scientific knowledge  the expressiveness of the
formalism is improved through several independent steps by adding further assumptions

into the domain descriptions  this also shows one advantage of our solution  a simple representation can be achieved by simply removing the involved assumptions  this is arguably
a desirable feature as the reasoner has the option of either increasing the expressibility of the
representation formalism or improving the simplicity and  as a consequence  the efficiency
of the reasoning system 
the rest of the paper is organised as follows  section   summarises relevant features of
the abstract argumentation framework proposed by bondarenko et al          its semantics and concrete instances  in section   we present the syntax and semantics of the basic
temporal logic and the extension for reasoning about action  in section   we present our
formalisation for reasoning about action based on the argumentation theoretic approach
introduced by bondarenko et al          our approach to reasoning about action  in particular a uniform solution to the frame and the qualification problems  as well as the main
results of the paper are presented in section    in section    we show how the proposed
formalism is extended to deal with more complex dynamic domains  including those with
concurrent and non deterministic events  and indirect effects  related work and future
research directions are discussed in section    we will defer most proofs of the results
presented in the paper to the appendix 
this paper is an extended version of two earlier conference papers  vo   foo       
       the main differences are that in this version all proofs are included  lemmas that are
used in the proofs of the theorems are introduced to help the reader more easily comprehend
these results  and the presentation has been improved and extended with more examples of
the various constructions 

   defeasible reasoning by argumentation
let a deductive system hl  ri be given  where l is some formal language with countably
many sentences and r is a set of inference rules  given a theory   l and a sentence
  l  we write   hl ri  if there is a deduction from  whose last element is   t h hl ri   
denotes the set    l     hl ri    since the language l is generally kept fixed whereas
the set of inference rules r is likely to vary depending on the description of the domain 
when there is no possible confusion we will abbreviate   hl ri and t hhl ri as  r and t hr  
respectively  thus the classical inference relation   can also be written as   rc where rc is
the set of inference rules of classical propositional logic  note also that every set of inference
rules considered in this paper will be a super set of r c  
given a deductive system hl  ri  an assumption based framework with respect to hl  ri
consists of a theory  representing the current knowledge of the reasoner about the domain 
an assumption base ab and a contrariness operator    i e  given an assumption   ab  
denotes the contrary of  
remark  the notion of the contrary of an assumption is intended to generalise the classical
negation   note that in general assumptions may be constructed by special operators
 e g  negation as failure in the case of logic programming  or the modal operator l in the
case of autoepistemic logic  moore         thus the contrariness operator must also be sufficiently general

the hardest part in reasoning with assumption based frameworks is computing the set
of assumptions to augment the given theory   in an argumentation theoretic approach 
this is realised by the attack relation  to determine which assumptions to be accepted 
assumptions are put together to form arguments  the assumptions behind the best arguments are considered to be acceptable  several semantics for best arguments are presented
by bondarenko et al         based on the notions of attack  given an assumption based
framework h  ab  i and an assumption set   ab 
  attacks an assumption   ab iff   t h     
  attacks an assumption set    ab iff  attacks some assumption       
  is closed iff    ab  t h     
  is conflict free iff there does not exist any   ab such that      r    
assumption based frameworks in which assumption sets are always closed are referred
to as flat  in a flat assumption based framework  the conflict free property of a set of
assumptions  is equivalent to the property that  does not attack itself  the major
argumentation theoretic semantics defined by bondarenko et al         for assumptionbased frameworks include 
 stability semantics  an assumption set   ab is stable iff
    is closed 
    does not attack itself  and
    attacks each assumption  
   
bondarenko et al         show that the above stability semantics corresponds to the
standard semantics of extensions of theorist  poole         minimal models of  many
cases of  circumscription  mccarthy               extensions of default logic  reiter 
       stable expansions of autoepistemic logic  moore         and stable models of
logic programming  in other words  from a complexity theoretic perspective  any
approach based on the existing formalisms to default reasoning can be rendered in a
corresponding assumption based argumentation framework with no loss in terms of
computational complexity 
 admissibility and preferability semantics  bondarenko et al         go further to
extend these existing formalisms by generalising the semantics of admissible and preferred arguments which were originally proposed for logic programming only  the
new semantics are defined in terms of admissible and preferred sets of assumptions extensions  an assumption set   ab is admissible iff
    is closed 
    does not attack itself  and
   for all closed sets of assumptions     ab if   attacks  then  attacks    
maximal  with respect to set inclusion  admissible assumption sets are called preferred

throughout this paper assumptions are expressed in terms of usual propositions  thus 
we will replace the notion of contrariness  in bondarenko et al s        system with the
classical negation  and omit it from the specification of assumption based frameworks 
that is  an assumption based framework h  abi consists of a theory   l  and the
assumption base ab which contains the assumptions to be used in the reasoning 

   domain descriptions
we introduce a propositional action description language based on a more comprehensive
representation formalism proposed by sandewall         in particular  we extend drakengren and bja relands        language so that it is possible to describe narratives in our
framework 
    syntax
following sandewall         the underlying representation of time is a  discrete  time structure t   ht        i consisting of
 a time domain t whose members are called time points which are integers in this
paper  except in a later part of the paper where the distinction will be made explicit  
        are as usual for integers 
given a time structure t   ht        i  a signature  with respect to t is a tuple
  ht   f  ai  where t is a set of countably infinitely many time point variables  f is a set
of propositional fluent names  and a is a set of action names  since the time structure t is
fixed in the rest of this paper  t will be taken implicitly whenever a signature is introduced 
we assume that all sets in  are countable  we denote f       f   f  f    a member
of f  is a fluent literal  moreover  a   a   da  where a  is the set of domain dependent
action names  called basic actions  e g  load  shoot  etc  and da    da l   l  f    is the set
of dummy actions  as will be explained later in this paper  our solution to the problems
of reasoning about action is based on the basic guideline of attributing changes to events 
given the reasoners ignorance about certain events that bring about changes in the world 
the dummy actions are to be used to make up for these gaps in the reasoners belief state 
that is why we need to associate the dummy actions with the fluent literals from f   
for each fluent literal l  f    we introduce the following two symbols  aq l   and f al  
 aql is associated with the assumed qualifications upon the preconditions of an action
regarding the fluent literal l  essentially  aq l when used in the description of the
dynamics of an action  allows the reasoner to describe only the main preconditions
of   with regards to the fluent literal l  while leaving other possible  but less probable 
qualifications to be rendered by a single assumption aq l  
 f al is associated with the frame assumptions regarding l  f a l   when coupled with
a particular frame inference rule  allows the reasoner to infer that the fluent literal l
continues to hold in future time points unless there is a reason that defeats f a l  
   the notation    means that the formula following it may  or may not  be negated

the domain description language ld  over   is defined  ld     ab  
     means the action  has a duration corresponding to the interval           aq l
means the fluent literal l is assumed to be qualified to hold by the end of the interval

for example  in the blocks world domain  to say that block a is on block b at the time

time points t      and t     and that the relation   holds between t       and t    we write

formalise something with the domain description language  we choose to denote it by ld

   representing dynamic domains in the argumentation theoretic
approach
we now proceed to showing an assumption based framework for representing dynamic domains  we subsequently introduce a uniform framework for solving the frame and the
qualification problems based on the argumentation theoretic approach  general solutions
for the frame and the qualification problems can be obtained by computing plausible sets
of assumptions which guarantee that extensions computed from these sets of assumptions
will be consistent when the given theory is consistent  we now introduce some additional
notations  given an inference rule r  r  we denote by prem r  and cons r  the premise
and the consequence of rule r  respectively 
definition
s     a deductive system hl d   ri is well defined iff for each subset s  r  if
the set rs prem r  is consistent then the set con s s     cons r    r  s  is also
consistent 
henceforth  we will assume that deductive systems are well defined  being formalised
in terms of the argumentation theoretic approach  the representation requires an extended
notion of consistency 
definition     let hld   ri be a deductive system 
 i  a set of sentences   ld is r consistent iff    r false 
 ii  an assumption based framework h  abi with respect to hl d   ri is consistent iff  is
r consistent

is not equivalent to r consistency  for instance  let r        the  logically  consistent

rules     and     represent the descriptions of the actions load and shoot  respectively 
action wait does not cause any effect to the world  so there is no need to describe it  other
rules render the common sense law of inertia  at any time point  a fluent literal presumably
persists to the next time point 
most argumentation theoretic semantics  e g  stability  admissibility  preferability  complete  well founded semantics  etc   bondarenko et al         are based on the notion of
attack  however  to reason about problem domains with incomplete information  especially
action domains  this notion alone may not be sufficient as we may not always be able to
construct explicit arguments to defeat unsound assumptions  for example  consider the
yale shooting problem  by observing that a turkey is shot with a loaded gun at time point
   the reasoner infers plausibly that the turkey is dead at time point   using the assumption
that the action shoot is qualified to bring about the effect of killing the victim  however 
at time point    the reasoner could observe that the turkey is still alive  existing solutions
to the frame problem  e g  reiters         thielschers         castilho et al s         etc 
fail to deal with such a surprise since they allow a contradiction to be derived  observe that
the reasoner does not have any explicit reason to defeat the above qualification assumption 
i e  she is not aware of any cause that prevents the application of this qualification assumption  she only knows that it is not acceptable in this case by common sense  to formalise
such phenomena  we introduce the notion of rejected assumptions 
   

fivo   foo

definition     given an assumption based framework h  abi  a set of assumptions  
ab rejects an assumption   ab iff
 a   is conflict free  and
 b       attacks itself 
for instance  in example    the set of assumptions          f aalive      f aalive      f aloaded  
attacks the assumption    f aalive     moreover  relative to the given action description  any
set of assumptions attacks the assumption    f a loaded   on the other hand  the set of assumptions         f aalive      f aalive      f aalive   rejects the assumption    f aloaded but
  does not attack it 
observation   given an assumption based framework h  abi and a conflict free set of
assumptions   ab  if  attacks an assumption  
   then  rejects  
then  why do we not generalise the contrariness notion of an assumption so that it
would be general enough to account for all rejected assumptions  the reason is because we
want to isolate the set of assumptions that are rejected but are not attacked as part of our
solution to the frame problem 
definition     given an assumption based framework h  abi  a set of assumptions  
ab leniently rejects an assumption   ab iff
 a   rejects   and
 b   does not attack  
def

we denote lr        ab    is leniently rejected by   
to show that our solution provides an intuitive account for problems of reasoning about
action  several scenarios should be considered  these include the projection problem  the
most basic form of the frame problem  whose typical example is the infamous ysp  another
scenario concerns with the explanation problem which are usually discussed with the stolen
car problem  kautz        and the stanford murder mystery  baker         we will first
provide an informal discussion of our approach through these examples 
in the present solution  the frame assumptions are the essence of the principle of inertia and their role in the argumentation approach is illustrated below by the yale shooting
problem  in this formulation we intentionally ignore the qualification problem  it is addressed in the next section  to highlight how the frame problem is solved  we now reconsider the well worn example ysp to motivate our approach to the frame problem 
example    continued  given the theory  ysp   the argumentation theoretic approach will
yield the following preferred set of assumptions  bondarenko et al         
  t f al   t  t and l   loaded  alive  loaded  alive         f a loaded      f aalive   
which corresponds to the intended model of this scenario in which the gun remains loaded
at time point   and the victim is not alive at time point   
this extension is also the stable extension and well founded semantics  bondarenko
et al         of the given theory under the argumentation theoretic approach  note that in
    in fact  any set of assumptions containing the assumption    f aloaded would attack    f aalive  

   

fireasoning about action  an argumentation theoretic approach

case one would like to be uncertain about whether the gun is still loaded after the shooting
action  one just simply needs to add an axiom      shoot     f a loaded to dictate that
the persistence of the fluent loaded after the action shooting is not guaranteed  in that
case  we can still derive that    loaded for          but we can no longer give a definite
assertion about    loaded for     
as the above formalisation of ysp resembles that using default logic  it may be surprising that the problem of unintended models pointed out by hanks and mcdermott
       for circumscription  default logic  autoepistemic logic does not happen here  the
principal reason is the interaction of the inference rules and the notion of attack in the
argumentation theoretic framework  which invalidates undesired assumptions  notice that
even if    loaded can be  magically  derived  it cannot lead to    f a loaded   therefore  the
set of assumptions corresponding to this case does not satisfy the conditions of preferred
set of assumptions  thus ruling out this unintended model  this shows one of the important
features of assumption based frameworks on its capability of making explicit the assumptions used by the reasoner during the course of inference  recall that defaults justifications
are accepted as long as they are consistent with some extension for credulous semantics
or all extensions for skeptical semantics  thus the name consistency based approach   in
light of the inertia principle  its considered to be abnormal if a fluent does not persist
from a state to the next state  to minimise the abnormality   normal  default rules are
introduced to express the fact that if its consistent to believe that there is no abnormality
with respect to a fluent f and an action a in a situation s then assert that  but then we
would fail to distinguish between the abnormalities brought about by reasonable causes and
those unintuitively generated to make them consistent with some possible extension  the
latter is of course corresponding to the anomalous models  by using explicit assumptions 
not only consistency is maintained  by preventing the accepted assumptions from attacking
themselves  but each rejection of assumptions must also be justified by the known facts
from the given theory 
discussion 
   turner        showed that an alternative representation of the ysp in default logic
can help solve the issue of anomalous models introduced by hanks and mcdermotts
       representation  turner formulates the yale shooting scenario as follows 
holds alive  s   
false

    

true
holds loaded  result load  s  

    

holds loaded  s 
holds alive  result shoot  s  

    

  holds f  s   
holds f  s   

    

   

fivo   foo

  holds f  s   
holds f  s   

    

holds f  s    holds f  result a  s  
holds f  result a  s  

    

holds f  s    holds f  result a  s  
holds f  result a  s  

    

notice that turner also uses the inference rules to block the backward reasoning
that generates the anomalous models of the yale shooting scenario  however  this also
means that all kinds of useful backward reasoning will also be blocked  in other words 
turners formulation fails to deal with surprising observations about states at later
time points  as a consequence  turners formulation only works when the domain is
restricted to qualification free  as soon as the action descriptions  e g  the one for
the shoot action in ysp  need to rely on some default justifications  e g  qualification
assumptions  turners formulation would also encounter the problem of undesirable
extensions  our approach offers solutions to both of the above issues 
   after hanks and mcdermotts        seminal paper in which early approaches to
the frame problems were exposed  besides new attempts to solve the frame problem 
sandewall        should be accredited as the first who tried to approach the problems of reasoning about action in a systematic way  as part of this effort  he also
examines the reason behind the failure of early approaches to the frame problem  as
discussed by sandewall  early approaches to reasoning about action while attempting
to formulate the inertia principle have made the common mistake of making changes
the abnormality regarding this principle but failing to distinguish between normal
changes triggered by actions and anomalous changes  this important insight turns
out to be a consequence of a much more general law for reasoning about dynamic
domains discovered by researchers in the community in pursuit of solutions to various
problems of reasoning about actions  action dynamics are causality based  it is this
principle that underpins most solutions to the problems of reasoning about action 
the anomalous models that arise in early approaches to the frame problem discovered by hanks and mcdermott        or to the qualification problem as discussed
by thielscher        are those in which the causes of abnormalities are not present 
on the other hand  regarding the ramification problem  given a domain constraint
involving a number of fluents  its important to know which of these fluents are the
causes influencing the other fluents  i e  the causality direction between the involved
fluents 
in light of the above analysis  turners        approach appears to be rather ad hoc 
note that turners solution to the problem of anomalous models is to block backward reasoning by the use of inference rules without any motivation on why backward
reasoning is a bad thing  while his approach appears to share with solutions based
on chronological ignorance  which will be discussed in more details in section    the

notion of directedness  by minimizing chronologically or blocking backward reasoning  one tends to minimize causes rather than effects  however  a more systematic
approach to various problems of reasoning about action is still very much desired 
nevertheless  while the preferability semantics copes successfully with the ysp  it can
not properly account for the explanation problem  e g  the stanford murder mystery  baker 
       the stolen car problem  kautz         the subtlety lies in the derivation of the
contrary of the frame assumptions  the contrary of a frame assumption is derived only
when both the occurrence of the event that brings about the change  absent in the stolen
car problem  and the preconditions required to be satisfied for the change to actually take
place  absent in the stanford murder mystery  are explicitly derivable  this is where the
notion of  leniently  rejected assumptions is called into service

   reasoning about action  the frame and the qualification problems
in general  we adopt the following guidelines in seeking a uniform solution to the problems
of reasoning about action 
 the derived pieces of information do not conflict with the given facts 
 occurrences of events are minimised  and
 the inertia of fluents is maximised though the minimality of the event occurrences
will be of higher priority 
aside from the trivial case of occurrences of actions causing the frame assumptions to
be rejected  two aspects of actions can be distinguished 
   an action happens but the change it is supposed to cause does not take place  we
call this expectation failure and this is more or less the qualification problem  and
   no actions that are known to have happened and caused a change but the change
did take place  we call this surprise and this is usually known as the explanation
problem 
the following assumption represents our underlying intuition behind reasoning about
action formalisms 
assumption   intuitive models contain minimal  with respect to set inclusion  sets of
surprises 
now we introduce some model theoretic counterpart notions of the assumption based
notions presented above 
definition     let    ht   f  ai be a signature and d   hl d   r  ab  i a domain description over   an interpretation i   hh       q   f i is a model of d iff
   i is a model of  
   for each r  r  if i    prem r  then i    cons r  
the following definition captures one of several aspects of the  model theoretic  solution
of the frame problem  this aspect is known as the action oriented frame problem in lin
and shohams        terms  the proposed minimisation policy formalises the intuition that
change does not happen by itself but is caused by some kind of event  thus  for each fluent 
if its value is changed between two timepoints  and    at least  an occurrence of some
event must end at  that brings about that change 
definition     let d   hld   r  ab  i be a domain description and i a model of d  i is
a coherent model of d iff
   for each basic action   a  and     t e  if i         then            and
   

fireasoning about action  an argumentation theoretic approach

   for each l  f  and t  t  if i     t l   t   l then either
 a  there are   a  and s  t such that r  
i    prem r     s     t       or
 b  i     t  t   dal

                    aql
 r and
    l      f al

thus  in a coherent model   i  all satisfiable basic actions must follow from the given
theory  and  ii  all changes are attributable to events of one kind or another 
given an interpretation i  we want to extract the sets of assumptions satisfiable in i 
definition     let    ht   f  ai be a signature and i an interpretation over   the set
of frame assumptions satisfiable in i  denoted  if a   is defined as follows 
if a     t f al    t  f al    f ai  
and the set of qualification assumptions satisfiable in i  denoted  iaq   is  
iaq     t    t   aql    t    aql   t     aqi  
we also write iqf   iaq  if a  
conversely  given a theory  and a set of assumptions   a reasoner can also construct
his models about the domain of interest 
definition     let d   hld   r  ab  i be a domain description and   ab  a model
i   hh      q   f i of d is  relativised iff
   for each   ab  i     iff     and
   occi   oad  das    where 
 a  oad                    t  a   t                 and
 b  das       t  dal   t     t  da  t     fal 
   and there do not exist any
action
                    aql
 r and i   
  a  and s  t such that r  
    l      f al
prem r     s     t     
 relativised models are one of the central notions of our framework  essentially  assumptions underpin our machinery to conjecture information based on common sense knowledge  as such  we will try to accept as many assumption as possible unless there is a good
reason not to  therefore  given a set of assumptions  we will attribute every missing frame
assumption to a possible change in the domain the agent is reasoning about which is caused
by either a known action event or some unknown action  called dummy actions in this
paper 
the following observation is immediate from condition      in the above definition 
observation   let a domain description d   hl d   r  ab  i and a set of assumptions
  ab be given  if the model i of d is  relativised then  iqf   i   t  for every t  t 
    the notation  v   t            vn  tn   is standard in logic and meant to be the instantiation of the formula 
with the variables v            vn being replaced by the terms t            tn   respectively

    the frame problem
first we will address the frame problem in a simple setting viz  without qualification
assumptions  but we will lift the restrictions later 
definition     let d   hld   r  ab  i be a domain description  d is a simple domain
description  or s domain  iff rq    and aq does not occur anywhere in r or  
definition     let d   hld   r  ab  i a domain description  an interpretation i  
hh      q   f i is a simple model  or s model  of d iff
   i is a model of d  and
   q  t  aql   u    true for every  t  aql   u   t  aqf   t 
this effectively isolates the frame problem from the qualification problem  note also
that if i is an s model then iaq   abaq   a coherent s model is an s model which is
coherent 
example    continued   the following is part of one of the coherent models of d ysp  
       load     loaded     loaded     alive     alive 
      wait        daloaded      loaded     alive 
      shoot     loaded     alive  
which corresponds to one of the anomalous models of this scenario  the one pointed out by
hanks and mcdermott  
but it is not desirable to admit the occurrence of an event when there is no evidence
for it  thus we need to minimise the set of action occurrences in a given action theory 
definition     let d be an s domain  a coherent s model i of d is a prioritised minimal
model  or simply pmm  of d iff there does not exist any coherent s model i   of d such
 
that occi  occi  
note that the above model theoretic minimisation policy is not based on the frame
assumptions  this solution to the frame problem is thus amenable to well known techniques
such as circumscription     but we believe an argumentation theoretic approach is not only
more direct but also has wider applicability  in order to provide the connection between
the above  model theoretic  minimisation policy and the  argumentation theoretic  notion
of plausible sets of assumptions we need to maximise the set of assumptions satisfiable in a
pmm 
definition     let d be an s domain  a pmm i of d is a canonical prioritised minimal
model  or simply cpmm  of d iff there does not exist any pmm i   of d such that
 
f ai  f a i  
we now want to see how the account of plausible sets of assumptions connects to this
account of minimality 
    in combination with the introduction of occurrences of dummy actions

proof  let  denote the assumption  t f a l   first we observe that   lr iqf   implies

that i      t l   t   l  as the denotation of f a in i is required to be maximal since i is a

      discussion 
so  how does our account of the frame problem relate to the existing approaches to the frame
problem  while there has been a long line of development behind monotonic approaches
to the frame problem starting with haass        and schuberts        early attempts and
resulting in reiters        monotonic solution to the frame problem together with other
solutions proposed by others such as castilho et al         and zhang and foo        or
thielschers        fluent calculus based monotonic solution to the frame problem  with
the notable exception of thielschers        attempt to address the qualification problem 
few have tried to tackle the qualification within the framework they use to address the frame
problem 
on the other hand  in the action languages  gelfond   lifschitz        and related
approaches such as those proposed by mccain and turner               giunchiglia  kartha 
and lifschitz         and giunchiglia and lifschitz         state transition systems are
employed as the underlying computation machinery which essentially provides the reasoner
with all possible complete states of the world  furthermore  as domain decsriptions can
be uniquely translated to state transition systems  the reasoner could safely derive the
successor state s  based on the current together with the transition function 
    solving the qualification problem  in the presence of the frame problem 
the results reported in the previous section are established in a simple setting  if we add
the following observation to the theory in example       alive  i e  after the shoot action 
the victim is still alive  then like most existing formalisms  the above account of plausibility
would come up with a contradiction  in fact  it would be more reasonable that such a
failure is explained as an occurrence of some qualification  in this section  we remove certain
restrictions on the qualifications of actions in order to achieve a more general framework 
there are some subtleties in the way action theories are represented in our proposed
assumption based framework  note first that there is a potential difficulty if frame assumptions and qualification assumptions are treated equally  which can be illustrated by a version
of the ysp  consider the following action description 
 

   alive     f aalive    loaded      shoot      aqalive
 
   r 
     alive
  alive     f aalive

    loaded     alive        shoot    
from this  we have  at least  two stable sets of assumptions  one contains the frame
assumption    f aalive which rejects the qualification assumption       aq alive and another
contains       aqalive which attacks    f aalive   only the latter is intuitive in this case but
we do not have any explicit criterion to prefer one over another  the following assumption
   

fireasoning about action  an argumentation theoretic approach

asserts that in our solution to the frame problem in the presence of the qualification problem 
an action is presumed to bring about its effects unless there is an explicit justification for
its disqualification 
assumption   when there is a direct conflict between a frame assumption and a qualification assumption  over a fluent literal   the qualification assumption takes precedence 
given the presence of several kinds of assumptions  i e  frame and qualification  we
will adopt the following convention  we will write lr p    instead of  lr   p for p 
 f a  aq   since we no longer exclude qualification assumptions from our assumptionbased domain descriptions  we will simply refer to assumption based domain descriptions
as q domains 
definition     let d   hld   r  ab  i be a q domain  a presumable set of assumptions
  ab is semi q plausible wrt d iff lr f a    is minimal  with respect to set inclusion  
definition      let d   hld   r  ab  i be a q domain  a set of assumptions   ab
is q plausible wrt d iff
    is semi q plausible wrt d 
   aq is maximal  i e  there does not exist any     ab such that   is semi qplausible  wrt d  and aq   aq   and
   f a is maximal relative to the above two conditions  i e  there does not exist any
   ab such that   satisfies the above two conditions and  f a   f a  
we will now refer to models of a q domain as q models  a coherent q model is a qmodel which is coherent  we minimise the set of action occurrences in coherent q models
of a given action theory 
definition      let d be a q domain  a coherent q model i of d is a prioritised minimal
q model  or simply pmqm  of d iff there does not exist any coherent q model i   of d
 
such that occi  occi  
definition      let d be an s domain  a pmqm i of d is a canonical prioritised minimal
q model  or simply cpmqm  of d iff
 

   there does not exist any pmqm i   of d such that aqi  aqi   and
 

   there does not exist any pmm i   of d such that f ai  f ai  
now we can proceed to obtaining the main results for cpmqms regarding q plausible
sets of assumptions which are similar to those for cpmms regarding plausible sets of assumptions  the following lemma  which is a straightforward extension of lemma   and
lemma   proved in the previous section  is introduced to assist in the proof of theorem    
lemma   let d   hld   r  ab  i be an q domain and i a cpmm of d 
   

fivo   foo

   for each assumption   ab   
  iqf iff  is rejected by iqf  
   if       f al  lr iqf   then i           dal  
theorem   let d be a q domain  if i is a cpmqm of d then  iqf is q plausible wrt
d 
similar to the previous section  we now prove that not only can we derive a plausible set
of assumptions from a given cpmqm but we can also construct cpmqms from a plausible
set of assumptions of a given domain description  the set of  relativised models of a
q domain d is denoted as m odq
  d  
the following observation is obvious 
observation   let d be a q domain and  a set of assumptions of d  for each i 
i
m odq
  d      qf  
theorem   let d   hld   r  ab  i be a q domain and   ab   is q plausible wrt d
q
iff m odq
  d      and for each i  m od  d   i is a cpmqm of d 
theorem   let d be a q domain  furthermore  suppose that cp m qm  d  is the set of
q
cpmqms of d and
s p laus  d  is qthe set of q plausible sets of assumptions of d  then
cp m qm  d    p lausq  d  m od  d  
q plausible sets of assumptions allow one to overcome scenarios in which expectation
failures  or  qualification surprises  arise  e g  shooting a turkey with a loaded gun and
observing that the turkey is still alive  when such surprises arise  the reasoner knows
whos to blame  qualification assumptions  she can then accordingly remove the guilty
assumptions  just as the anomalous models forming obstacle to early approaches to the
frame problem  similar anomalous models can also arise in solutions to the qualification
problem  this important issue related to the qualification problem has been thoroughly
discussed by thielscher        and a solution was presented within the framework of the
fluent calculus  to give the reader a flavour of this problem within our framework  we
invite the reader to consider the following classical example 
example   consider the problem of starting a car whose tail pipe could possibly be
blocked by a potato  formalised in our formalism as follows 
   the set of inference rules r is   
   blockedt p
 
    aqgetstarted
   hasp otato      insertp otato      aq blockedt p
 
  blockedt p     f ablockedt p
   haskey      t urnonignition      aq getstarted
 
  getstarted     f agetstarted
    of course we also have the frame based inference rules for haskey  blockedt p   etc  but we omit them
from this representation for sake of readability 

   

fireasoning about action  an argumentation theoretic approach

   the theory  is      hasp otato     haskey     blockedt p     getstarted 
      insertp otato        t urnonignition  
of course  we have designed this example to try to avoid any possible troubles with
the frame problem  we have to consider two conflicting qualification assumptions in this
case which are       aqblockedt p and       aqgetstarted   given the above action theory  any
q plausible set of assumptions would contain exactly one of them  thus  there will be at
least two extensions  one in which the car can not get started since the tailpipe is blocked
and its no longer consistent to assume       aq getstarted   the other extension disqualifies
the action of inserting the potato into the tailpipe and thus the action of starting the car
becomes successful  only the former is intuitive in this case and the account of q plausible
sets of assumptions fails to deliver this desired solution 
however  in exactly the same way the problem of anomalous models arising in the solution to the frame problem is tackled  the above problem is easily addressed within our framework  the key insight is of course also underlined by the notion of causality     blockt p
was caused  by the action       insertp otato  which in turn allows       aq getstarted to be
derived  on the other hand  there was no cause that allows       aq blockt p to be derived 
how is the above insight realised in our framework  the answer turns out to be rather simple  just as the distinction between leniently rejected frame assumptions and non leniently
rejected frame assumptions allows us to distinguish between normal changes  i e  actiontriggered  and anomalous changes  a distinction between leniently rejected qualification assumptions and non leniently rejected qualification assumptions will allow us to distinguish
between normal disqualifications  i e  those underlined by a cause  and anomalous disqualifications  thus  facing a collection of q plausible sets of assumptions  a reasoner simply
selects the set of assumptions that contains the smallest  with respect to set inclusion  set
of leniently rejected qualification assumptions 
the ability to introduce different argumentation theoretic semantics for assumptionbased frameworks is arguably the biggest advantage of our approach  the following example
illustrates this critical point 
example   we modify an example presented by lin and shoham        which is in turn
a modification of kautzs        stolen car problem  a spy possessed a microfilm of a top
secret evidence which an organisation  a  tried to steal  for some reason  another organisation  b  wanted to murder this spy  the microfilm was in the safe at the spys home at
time    the spy was not at home at time    a tried to steal the evidence between the
time points   and    the spy might return home at any time between   and    b tried to
murder the spy at any time between   and    return cancels the effects of steal  murder
cancels the effects of return and steal cancels the effects of murder  any of the three
actions steal  return  and murder takes only one time step  the domain is formalised as
follows         evstolen     alive     athome   and r contains
 

    return      aqathome     murder      aqalive
    steal      aqevstolen
 
 
 
  evstolen     f aevstolen   athome     f aathome   alive     f aalive

   athome         alive         evstolen     
 
 
  
    aqevstolen
    aqathome
    aqalive
   

fivo   foo

given the above formalisation of the problem  traditional accounts of non monotonic
reasoning  i e  default logic  circumscription  autoepistemic logic  etc   can not provide
one with a solution since these formalisms can not produce any extension under their standard semantics  however  the argumentation theoretic approach does gives several semantics for this problem including preferability semantics  note  however  that all admissible
sets of assumptions and preferred sets of assumptions for this domain contain none of the
assumptions        aqevstolen         aqathome   and       aqalive   this essentially means
that  under the admissibility and the preferability semantics  the reasoner could only infer
that none of the above actions would succeed on the other hand  our proposed plausible
semantics gives an alternative solution for this problem in which each consistent set of assumptions can contain at most one of the following three assumptions        aq evstolen  
      aqathome   and       aqalive   moreover  each plausible set of assumptions must contain exactly one of them  among the other two assumptions which do not belong to a
plausible set of assumptions  one is attacked and the other is leniently rejected 
we believe that the above examples have underlined the major advantages of our approach in which a reasoner is aware of the  defeasible  assumptions used in her reasoning as
well as being able to explicitly reason about these assumptions  the flexibility of allowing
a reasoner to introduce different argumentation theoretic semantics for assumption based
framework by simply varying the notion of acceptability of sets of assumptions is certainly
another advantage in favour of our approach 

   more complex dynamic domains and indirect effects
so far we havent taken into consideration the issues of concurrent actions and indirect
effects  to ensure that the formalisation introduced is expressive enough to deal with
complex domains  we will show how these issues are coped with by our approach  firstly 
we motivate our formalisation with an informal discussion 
    concurrent and non deterministic events
given our temporal representation  formulating concurrent events is not a difficult issue in
our framework  however  there are some subtleties which need to be carefully considered 
firstly  the use of assumptions  as presented earlier in this paper  qualification assumptions
are fluent oriented  i e  we qualify over the effects of action rather than over the action itself 
whilst this manifests the capability of formulating actions with multiple effects  and thus
each effect should be qualified independently  it may fail to formalise concurrent events
with the same effects  for example  both actions hit the vase with a hammer and shoot
it with a loaded gun bring about the effect that the vase is broken  in other words  it
is essential that qualification assumptions be dependent on the actions that bring about
the effect under consideration  thus  given n actions and m fluents whose values can
be changed by those actions  we have to potentially introduce    m  n qualifications
assumptions    therefore  instead of subscripting the assumption symbols aq with the
fluent literals from f    we extend the set of subscripts of aq  denoted as af  to contain
    in fact  as we will see later  there are potentially    m   n      qualification assumptions in this case
since there is one special event corresponding to all  natural  events that bring about the indirect effects 

   

fireasoning about action  an argumentation theoretic approach

both the action and the corresponding fluent literals     for example  given the above two
actions hit and shoot and an additional action repair whose effect is change a broken vase
to being non broken  viz  broken  we will need to introduce the following qualification
assumptions  aqhit broken   aqshoot broken and aqrepair broken   therefore  syntactically
we also extend the set ab aq        aq       t e and   af  and semantically
the function q   t  aqaf  t   true  false   in the definition of an interpretation
i   hh      q   f i  we also have i     aq   t    q       aq        where     t e
and   af 
though this does increase the complexity of the framework  it is the price we have to
pay for the expressiveness of the resulting system  to the best of our knowledge  none of
the existing formalisms possesses such an expressiveness 
how about non deterministic actions  the solution turns out to be quite simple  we can
treat action non determinism as a special kind of action qualification  for example  to formulate the russian shooting scenario  sandewall        in which a gun non deterministically
gets loaded or not after spinning its revolver  the following action descriptions can be asserted 
    spin      aqspin loaded
    spin      aqspin loaded
adr   
and adr   
  loaded     f aloaded
  loaded     f aloaded
together with the following two qualification rules 
qr   

  loaded
  loaded
and qr   
 
    aqspin loaded
    aqspin loaded

the above guarantee that either   loaded or   loaded will follow from     spin  remark that the set of qualification assumptions  aq is maximised   but not both  as a
consequence  two possible extensions will arise given the above non deterministic action 
dealing with non determinism could be more complicated when the information used to
encode the action description is disjunctive  as we only restrict the conclusion of an action
description rule to contain only fluent literals  such disjunctive effect is not straightforwardly
dealt with in our framework  however  note that the restriction is similar to that imposed
on action language a  gelfond   lifschitz         an extension to action descriptions
which is similar to the way the action language a is extended into the action language
c can be done to allow a complex expression in the conclusion of action description rule 
however  for the sake of presentation  we choose to use a simpler language to introduce our
framework to the reader 
    formalisation
from the analysis in the introductory section regarding indirect effects  we observe that
the ordering in which domain constraints are applied plays an essential role in a technically
sound framework  moreover  its no longer guaranteed that domain constraints would be
strictly satisfied at every time point     to help the reader better understand this technical
subtlety  its useful to think that changes are attributable to events  however  events
    the reader is referred to section   for the general formalisation 
    of course  its not necessary that the state of the world at every time point is observable to a reasoner 
however  it is important that she be aware of such states and able to reason about them 

   

fivo   foo

are further divided into two categories  external and internal  basically  external events
correspond to the direct effects of actions performed by some agents  including the reasoner  
on the other hand  internal events correspond to the indirect effects when certain conditions
about the world are met and can be attributed to nature    
like external events  internal events also happen in a certain order  although it is not
straightforward to observe this order      it is important that a reasoner be able to reason
about them  hence we propose to add one more dimension into the set of assumptions
of a given domain description  since these assumptions play essentially the same role as
that of qualification assumptions     we can subsume them under the set of qualification
assumptions aqaf   as they are not associated with any specific action  we can ignore the
initial of the action name from the subscripts of aq  for example we will write aq broken
in case we want to qualify over the fluent broken as an indirect effect  i e  independently of
any action  moreover  to avoid the axiomatiser from the confusion of determining the time
span taken by indirect effects  we will assume that it is atomic  it means all indirect effects
always take place between one time point and the next one  this does not mean that all
indirect effects have the same real time duration  it simply means that relative to the given
time structure t they take place between two consecutive time points  this allows us to
avoid the granularity problem as it is irrelevant from the viewpoint of the problems we are
trying to solve 
      a representation issue and some notations 
one important remark is in place here  until now  we have used integers and the corresponding expressions to denote time points  there are two reasons for this pratice   i  it
significantly simplifies the presentation  and  ii  without the complication of the ramification problem  all time points which are reasoned about are also observable to the reasoner 
however  as will be discussed thoroughly in the next section  in the presence of ramifications
a time point at which some change takes place maight not be observable to the reasoner as
such a change could be one of the indirect effects after the execution of some action  such
representation issues make the integer based time structure employed so far in this paper
inappropriate  we do need a richer representation of time structure  following sandewalls
       basic formulation  the only basic constant to be included in the representation of
the time structure t is denoted by the symbol  and is referred to as the origin of t 
the standard algebraic operations   and  are still employed to obtain time expressions
and bear their usual meanings  the relation symbol   will also be used to compare time
expressions  however  we can no longer allow expressions such as      for integers are no
longer elements of the time structure 
given a time expression   
    we avoid the use of the terms exogenous endogenous events to label these two categories because
throughout the literature of reasoning about action  exogenous events are used to refer to actions that
carried out by agents that are different from the reasoner or outside events whose occurrences are beyond
the reasoners control 
    unless indirect effects are somehow delayed and become observable to the reasoner  they usually take
place immediately after direct effects 
    the only difference is that these assumptions are qualified over the indirect effects which can be considered
to be the effects of the actions of nature

 we will continue to denote the next time point of  by     
 we define     to be    and  let n       n  to be    n        
furthermore  as we will assume throughout that an indirect effect takes place between
two consecutive time points  we also simplify the presentation by using the following syntactical sugar  instead of writing        aql  for some   t e and l  f     we will write
   aql   this also provides a simple way to distinguish between qualification assumptions
for ramificational effects and those caused directly by an action or event 
how are domain descriptions affected from this augmentation  the only change is for
the set ra of action descriptions which consists of rules either of the form
            aq  l
  l     f al
or of the form

     aql
 
    f al

     l

for convenience  we will refer to the set of inference rules having the latter form as r i  
     aql
for some fluent literal l  f     now  regarding
i e  ri    r  ra   r    
   l     f al
the ramification problem  the basic idea is that the state obtained by updating the previous
state may not necessarily be stable due to the presence of indirect effects  by representing
indirect effects as causal rules  using inference rules in our framework  we can reason about
which causal rules have fired and  relatively  when  moreover  since these causal rules
may not take the same amount of time to fire  we should be able to reason about different
possible orders in which they fire  this will be achieved by a distinction between stable and
unstable states 
definition     a time point expression   t e is stable wrt a given domain description
d   hld   r  ab  i and   ab iff there does not exist any fluent literal l  f  such that
  

     aql
 ri and     r     aql   and
     l     f al

        r   l 
definition     let d   hld   r  ab  i be a domain description  a set of assumptions 
is said to be ramification compliant iff
   there does not exist any   ab aq such that t hr           t hr        
   there does not exist any unstable time point expression   t e such that    f a l  
for every l  f   
we note that by using unstable time points  we have conceptually isolated the ramification problem from the task of reasoning about the  explicit  actions 
   

fivo   foo

definition     let d   hld   r  ab  i be a domain description  a set of assumptions 
is generally plausible for action domains  or simply ad plausible  iff
  is ramification compliant  and
  is q plausible relative to the above condition 
remarks 
   from the above definition  it can be seen that a solution for the ramification is  in
a sense  independent from the frame and the qualification problems regarding action
occurrences 
   given the above temporal ontology  it is worth noting that the traditional notion
of state constraints may no longer hold in this representation regarding time points 
more precisely  only states associated with stable time points are subject to these
constraints 
    connection to causation based formalisms
the question is  of course  whether the above computational mechanism gives satisfactory
conclusions for problems in reasoning about action  while many formalisms have been
proposed  a general criterion for reasoning about action formalisms still seems to be missing 
the major stream of research towards a solution to the ramification problem is based on the
notion of causality  e g   lin        mccain   turner        thielscher         as has been
discussed above  none of these approaches can deal with domains in which  potentially 
infinite sequences of indirect effects are present  most of these approaches  including the
above three references   however  produce a successor state after the execution of an action
to capture changes that have taken place either as direct or as indirect effects of that action 
in this sub section  we show how our formalism captures the notion of successor states in
the absence of the infinite sequences of indirect effects 
definition     a domain description d   hl d   r  ab  i is non stratified iff there exist
two sets    and  l            ln    f  such that
   for each    i  n        li   is r consistent  for every   t e  and
   for each    i  n  if k    i mod n       then there exists a set  k   such that
      li    r k   and
k      aqlk

     lk     f alk

   let d   hld   r  ab  i be a domain description  d is simplistic iff     
the motivation behind the introduction of instantwise states is to allow the reasoner
to reason about the intermediate states which may not be practically observable to her 
that is  when indirect effects  following an occurrence of an action or event  take place 
the world might transit through a number of intermediate states before becoming stabilised in a final state in which all domain constraints necessarily hold  the ability to
explicitly reason about such  unstable  intermediate states is one of the advantages offered by our approach  for instance  lets consider the scenario in example   which
was originally introduced by thielscher         thielschers        approach allows two
possible successor states as the results of closing the switch sw   in the initial state s  
 sw    sw    sw    relay  light  detect   these are t      sw    sw    sw    relay  light  detect 
and t     sw    sw    sw    relay  light  detect   however  to an outside observer who has
no idea about the tricky internal mechanism of this circuit  it could be quite difficult to
explain why t  should be one of the possible outcomes of the action of closing the switch
sw    starting from an initial state in which detect and light are both off  after performing
an action toggle sw     light remains off but somehow detect becomes on  in other words 
thielschers        framework fails to render the intermediate  and unstable  state in which
light was on  albeit for only a short instant  before it was turned off again  on the other
hand  such states are explicitly represented and reasoned about as instantwise states in our
framework  as a consequence  domain constraints do not necessarily hold in an instantwise
state

remark   
here  it is also important to raise the question whether our solution to the ramification
problem conflicts with the formulation of concurrent actions  when two actions    and  
are concurrently performed    causes an indirect effect e and   triggers a non terminating
chains of effects  if the direct and indirect effects caused by    dont interfere with   s
production of e then the reasoner can reason about time points after the execution of   
where e holds for being an indirect effect of      these time points are of course unstable
due to the non terminating chains of indirect effects caused by      on the other hand 
if the direct and indirect effects caused by    have the potential to prevent the former
from producing e  the reasoning could be more complex  if it is observable that the direct
effects of both actions take place at the same time then the concurrent occurrences of the two
actions can be viewed as one single occurrence of one complex actions whose direct effects are
a combination of the direct effects of the two actions  further reasoning about ramifications
will then be carried out as usual  on the other hand  when the reasoner herself is unsure
about the temporal correlation between the direct effects of the two actions  every possible
order of changes must be taken into consideration leading to a highly nondeterministic
outcome about what fluent will hold in the future time points  however  such a situation
can still be handled nicely by our formalisation  the only representation issue which is
not addressed by our framework is about indirect effects with duration  as asserted above 
given the state of the world at a time point    we assume that all subsequent indirect
effects will take place at the next time point      this certainly fails to deal properly with
indirect effects whose durations are different  a simple solution to this problem can be to
associate one next time point operator for each possible indirect effect  this  however  will
significantly complicate the representation 

   discussion and future work
we developed a uniform framework for reasoning about action using an argumentationtheoretic approach  more precisely  assumption based approach   we have also presented
how our framework copes with the frame  the qualification and the ramification problems in
several sophisticated settings  we have shown how our framework can be naturally extended
to become more expressive 
we also explored a new abstraction level which we believe to be an intermediate layer
between the common sense knowledge and the scientific knowledge  sophisticated domain
knowledge as well as representation are  we argue  required to achieve an adequate underlying representation and reasoning process  among the merits of this approach  we emphasise
the following 
 non monotonicity is handled by assumptions and argumentation theoretic approach 
    the authors would like to acknowledge an anonymous referee for pointing out this very subtle issue 

   

fivo   foo

 the flexibility of working with different kinds of information representation since there
is no restriction on the syntax of the system 
 expressivity  temporal information is explicitly represented  thus the system is capable of capturing many important features of temporal reasoning 
as reviewed in the introductory section of this paper  numerous approaches to reasoning
about action have been proposed  as such  much research related to these approaches and
frameworks has evolved around the central problems addressed in this paper  namely the
frame  qualification and the ramification problems  however  as non monotonic reasoningbased formalisms for reasoning about actions were shown to be flawed by hanks and mcdermott         many existing solutions of the frame problem are based on other approaches
which are usually monotonic  since one of the inherent properties of the argumentationtheoretic approach is monotonicity  few have attempted to solve the problems of reasoning
about actions using this approach 
a framework for reasoning about actions under the argumentation theoretic approach is
independently proposed by kakas  miller  and toni                     in their approach 
the admissibility semantics is also employed to resolve conflicts between adversary arguments  to represent common sense knowledge  e g  the common sense law of inertia  an
order is imposed on the set of inference rules of the assumption based framework  the computation of the arguments and their competing is performed on top of the so called proof
trees  nodes on the proof trees are arguments which are sets of propositions     construction of proof trees is on the same level of hardness as known frameworks for argumentationtheoretic computation  while their framework allows the persistence of  inertial  fluents to
be captured and dealt with  it is not very clear whether their formalisation can be extended
to deal with other problems of reasoning about actions such as the qualification and the
ramification problems 
more recently  dimopoulos  kakas  and michael         and bracciali and kakas       
extended kakas et al s framework to deal with the ramification and the qualification problems  essentially  in their solution to the ramification problem  the so called r propositions
of the following form   
l whenever c
are added to the domain description  a resulting model for a given domain description will
then be computed by first computing all possible indirect effects as the fixed point of repeated application of r propositions  and then completing the model by allowing unaffected
fluent literals to persist over time  it should be clear that the above representation of indirect effects is quite restrictive as it doesnt allow more complex expressions for the conditions
of an indirect effects and the indirect effects themselves  these restriction is essentially due
to their use of answer set programming  asp  as the underlying computation mechanism
of their framework  on the other hand  their solution to the qualification problem lies in the
use of default rules for representing the effects of actions  this approach is fairly similar to
    in kakas et al s              terminologies  each node is a set of arguments which is equivalent to the
notion of arguments in our exposition 
    l is a fluent literal and c is a set of fluent literals which is essentially equivalent to a conjunction of
fluent literals 

   

fireasoning about action  an argumentation theoretic approach

thielschers        solution to the qualification problem discussed above  as their approach
is essentially based on stability semantics  its not clear how the argumentation theoretic
approach will bring about any benefit to their framework 
as discussed earlier in the paper  the key insight behind the solutions implemented in
our framework is the exploitation of causality to drive the inference  it is causality that has
helped throughout in our solutions to the frame and the qualification problems to provide
the mechanisms to eliminate the anomalous models while retaining the intuitive models
during the process of reasoning  this insight is certainly a more general version of the conclusions derived by sandewall        when investigating the reason behind the production
of anomalous models in early approaches to the frame problem  namely the failure to distinguish between normal changes which are triggered by actions and abnomalous changes 
sandewalls insight has certainly originated the occlusion based solution to the frame problem  sandewall        doherty        gustafsson   doherty         roughly speaking  in
this approach each action type is associated with a subset of fluents that are influenced
by the action  also  a predicate occlude is introduced to allow this subset of fluents to
be specified  when reasoning about dynamic domains  changes are minimised with the
exception of the fluents specified by occlude  in other words  occlude distinguishes the
normal changes  associated with the action types  from the anomalous changes and thus
avoids unintended models from arising 
regarding the qualification problem  thielschers        solution to the problem of
anomalous models in relation to the qualification problem shares the key insight of causality
with our approach  however  thielschers framework is based on the standard semantics
of default logic  with the initial theories are generated using circumscription   thus  his
approach does not deal with problem domains where standard semantics of default logic
does not produce an extension  furthermore  as discussed in the introductory section of our
paper  in thielschers framework qualifications are taken over the executability conditions
for the actions instead of over different effects of the actions 
in parallel to the causality based insight to dynamic domains  other mechanisms for
solving various problems of reasoning about action exist  for instance  a number of approaches employ the concept of chronological ignorance  shoham              to tackle
the problem of anomalous models  in general  causality based frameworks and approaches
based on chronological ignorance share the notion of directedness  when changes are minimised chronologically  causes are minimised instead of effects as causes are likely to precede
effects  however  as a consequence  backward reasoning is blocked which prevents chronological ignorance based approaches from dealing with surprises and expectation failures 
furthermore  non deterministic actions or incomplete state knowledge are known to cause
difficulty to chronological minimization  for a more detailed comparison between causalitybased approaches and their counterparts that are based on chronological ignorance  the
reader is referred to an article by thielscher         on the other hand  approaches that
are based on motivated action theory  mat   amsterdam        stein   morgenstern 
      can be considered as a special case of the causality based paradigm  mat frameworks also advocate for the insight that an appropriate notion of causality is necessary when
assuming away abnormalities  mat frameworks  however  dont cope very well with the
explanation problem and the ramification problem as pointed out by jr         who also
introduce an approach to improve mat and overcome these problems

nonetheless  several issues still remain within our framework and will need further treatment to achieve an optimal solution  firstly  this formalism may not be very suitable for
the large scale problems as too many assumptions will need to be taken into account  to
address this problem  a localisation procedure is invented to guarantee that only an adequate sub language will be used to capture the circumstance the agent is reasoning about 
as a consequence  the set of assumptions will be restricted to those which are necessary to
infer the conclusions the agent is interested  this idea is under development  furthermore 
while a uniform solution to all major problems of reasoning about action may be quite
attractive especially regarding the toy scenarios such as those considered in this paper as
well as in the literature  such a solution may not be pragmatic  by considering the locality
account of reasoning  in particular of the assumptions used in default reasoning  promising
solution can be achieved from both computational and representational points of view  we
are undertaking further investigation towards this research direction 
a major limitation of our framework is the ability to deal with disjunctive axiomatisation of action occurrences  for instance  when the domain axiomatisation constains a
disjunction about the action occurrences such as  t     t       t    t       then no plausible sets
of assumptions  and accordingly  no cpmms  resp  cpmqms  will be produced to account
for the effects of these actions  while an initial formalisation of our framework allowed
complex expressions for action occurrences in the premises of inference rules which overcame this problem  the formalisation appeared to be too complex and some of the technical
results could not be established  further investigation  therefore  is needed to overcome
this problem while avoiding to produce an overly complex formalisation 
provided that our formalism has been designed to provide a general framework for reasoning about action  the following comes as a natural question  to what extent the proposed
approach can be used to formalise dynamic domains  sandewall        suggests that one
should systematise a framework for reasoning about action against some standard criteria
to provide the formal indications about the expressiveness and capacity of a formalism 
this is in contrast to the more traditional approach that had prevailed for many years in
reasoning about action in which one tries to come up with some examples to show that no
existing approaches are able to deal with such a scenario and claims that ones approach is
better than others in which it can solve the proposed scenario 
relative to sandewalls standard criteria  our approach enjoys the following properties 
   our approach is non inertia as it allows observations about the later state to correct the systems predictions about those states using some explanation mechanism
through the use of assumptions 
   our formalism is able to deal with non deterministic and concurrent events 
another issue is the abduction problem which is also known in the literature as the
explanation problem  for example  in the stolen car scenario  by observing that the car
disappeared from the parking lot where the reasoner had left it  an expectation failure arises 
most formalisms would try to accommodate this problem by introducing a stealing action
as part of the vocabulary and try to bind the disappearance of the car to this action  this
arguably is not very intuitive as there is no good reason why we should include this action
in the vocabulary in the first place but not others such as the car being towed away by the
   

fireasoning about action  an argumentation theoretic approach

police or a fairy turning the car into a pumpkin  etc  from a pragmatic point of view  some
reasoners may just simply acquire more information  perhaps from the police  instead of
confusing themselves with all kinds of explanations towards possible but uncertain causes 
in other words  we effectively isolate the issues of deducing the new conclusions from the
existing knowledge base from abducing the possible causes of some observations  this is
of course closely related to shanahans approach in his ijcai   paper  shanahan       
whose title clearly indicated that prediction is deduction but explanation is abduction 
we are also working on an assumption based framework to solve the abduction problem
