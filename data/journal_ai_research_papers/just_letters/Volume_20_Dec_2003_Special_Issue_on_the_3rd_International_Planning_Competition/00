order evaluate scaling behaviour first explore whether competing planners

might seem straightforward ensure problem set consists increasingly difficult
problems  for example  generating instances increasing size  fact straightforward achieve this  appears problem size difficulty strongly correlated 
whether size taken measure number objects  number relations even

appendix a  problem domains
a   first international planning competition
first competition used following domains 
logistics transportation problem involving aircraft trucks  trucks constrained movement within cities aircraft constrained movement
 inter city  airports  domain allows considerable parallelism 
mystery transportation domain vehicles limited capacity consuming limited stocks fuel 
mprime variant mystery domain possible pipe fuel
locations order allow vehicles different movement options 
grid problem single robot moves locations grid shaped
map  locations may locked keys must collected gain access
locations  objectives problem instances involve transporting
keys particular locations 
gripper simple domain  originally designed demonstrate limitations
graphplan  collection identical balls must transported robot
two grippers one room adjacent room 
movie simple domain intended explore use conditional effects  collection
snacks must assembled prior rewinding video watching movie 
assembly complex adl domain challenging use quantified conditional
effects 
a   second international planning competition
second competition introduced several new domains 
blocks classic blocks world problem  encoded without explicit reference
gripper  domain significant goal interaction 
job schedule problem involving machining parts  problem exercises
adl features involving conditional quantified effects  although less complex assembly domain 
freecell classic solitaire card game widely available computer
game  encoding strips domain represents larger problem
previous benchmarks includes awkward addition encoded set integers 
miconics elevator domain inspired problem planning efficient call sequence elevator car travelling floors large building 
several variants  complex including numeric preconditions

domain consists actions load unload trucks  using hoists available
fixed locations  loads crates stacked unstacked onto fixed set
pallets locations  trucks hold crates particular order 
act table blocks domain  allowing crates reordered 
domain devised foremost intention testing strips planners 
second competition demonstrated logistics domain longer serious
challenge  that  planners using hand coded controls  blocks domain
solved  fully automated planners blocks domain still represents challenge  although second competition showed planners solve quite large problems
 up twenty blocks  reasonably efficient plans within minutes  however  performance vary widely problems range prove unsolvable
planners  wanted see whether performance achieved
domains could successfully brought together one domain  interested

metric version domain adds weight attributes crates weight capacities trucks  addition  trucks consume fuel travels plans must
minimise fuel use  fuel use constant dependent locations  fuel consumed lifting crates  tradeoff considered crates must restacked

stacking performed using locally available pallets transfer space 
temporal versions allow concurrent activities trucks hoists  at
locations   full temporal variant makes time driving dependent truck

a     driverlog domain
domain drivers walk locations trucks drive
locations  walking requires traversal different paths used driving 
always one intermediate location footpath two road junctions 
trucks loaded unloaded packages  with without driver present

metric variant domain adds costs walking driving problem instances required planner optimise linear combination total walking

additional variant  hard numeric variant  complicates cost driving
making dependent load carried  additional package added truck

a     zeno travel domain
domain actions embark disembark passengers onto aircraft fly
two alternative speeds locations  strips variant rather uninteresting
two speeds offer meaningful alternatives  metric variant
planes consume fuel different rates according speed travel  two alternatives 
distances locations vary  problem instances require plans minimise

different means travel different levels fuel consumption  contrast
original zeno problem fuel consumption described continuous function 
discrete step functions applied end points durative actions  fact
fuel aircraft cannot affected multiple different concurrent actions

continuous consumption replenishment fuel means discrete model fuel use

a     satellite domain
