abstract
this paper reports the outcome of the third in the series of biennial international planning competitions  held in association with the international conference on ai planning
and scheduling  aips  in       in addition to describing the domains  the planners and
the objectives of the competition  the paper includes analysis of the results  the results
are analysed from several perspectives  in order to address the questions of comparative
performance between planners  comparative difficulty of domains  the degree of agreement
between planners about the relative difficulty of individual problem instances and the question of how well planners scale relative to one another over increasingly difficult problems 
the paper addresses these questions through statistical analysis of the raw results of the
competition  in order to determine which results can be considered to be adequately supported by the data  the paper concludes with a discussion of some challenges for the future
of the competition series 

   introduction
beginning in      the international planning community has held a biennial event to support the direct comparison of planning systems on a changing collection of benchmark
planning problems  the benefits of this series of events have been significant  over five
years  planning systems have been developed that are capable of solving large and complex
problems  using richly expressive domain models and meeting advanced demands on the
structure and quality of solutions  the competition series has inspired many advances in
the planning research community as well as an increasingly empirical methodology and a
growing interest in the application of planners to real problems 
in this paper we describe the structure  objectives and outcomes of the third competition 
which took place in toulouse in       the competition was colocated with the ai planning
and scheduling  aips  conference  at that conference a brief report was presented of some
of the results achieved by the participating planners  we begin by presenting an overview of
the main results as presented at the conference  showing the number of problems attempted
and solved by each planner and identifying the competition prize winners  as in previous
years the competition resulted in the collection of a large data set comprising data points
for several different domains  a certain comparative understanding can be obtained by
examining the data for the individual domains  but conclusions drawn on this basis cannot
be generalised across domains  one of the goals of this paper is to try to reveal some
insights that cross the boundaries of the domains and allow some general questions to be
answered  these include  which planners reveal the most consistent  stable performance

across domains  what benefit is obtained by exploiting hand coded control knowledge  is
there any general agreement over what makes a planning problem hard  are particular
planning approaches best suited to particular kinds of problem domains 
the accepted scientific methodology for addressing such questions is to frame precise
hypotheses prior to the collection of the data sets in order to control for any extraneous
variables that might distort the reality with respect to these questions  to date this has
not been the practice of the planning community with respect to the competitions  in the
third competition we proceeded  as in previous years  by collecting data prior to detailed
consideration of the specific questions we wished to answer  the community has not yet
agreed that the primary role of the competition is to provide a carefully crafted platform for
the scientific investigation of planners  indeed  its main roles so far have been to motivate
researchers in the field  to identify new research goals and thereby push forward the research
horizons  and to publicise progress to the wider community  however  because competitions
have winners there is a natural tendancy to draw conclusions from the competition data
sets about the state of the art  if these conclusions are not scientifically supported they can
be misleading and even erroneous  therefore there is an argument for trying to combine
the two objectives  although admittedly there is a tension between them that might make
it difficult to combine them successfully 
because of the way in which the planning competitions are currently conducted  the
analyses we describe in this paper are post hoc  we conducted all of our analyses on the
data collected during the competition period  we did not run any further experiments after
the competition because the participants felt that it was important that the data they
submitted during the competition should comprise the evidence on which they were judged 
we have identified a number of analyses which we think provide interesting information
to the planning community and  in the following sections  we explore each theme in as
rigorous a way as possible within the constraints of the data we have at our disposal  it has
been difficult to work with a fixed data set that was collected without precise experimental
questions in mind  and we were unable to test many of the hypotheses that occurred to us
during our analyses because the data was inappropriate or incomplete  however  despite
the limitations of the data set we believe we have been able to pose and answer some
important questions about the comparative performances revealed in the competition  we
phrase the objectives of our analyses in terms of null and alternative hyptheses because
this is the standard approach when applying statistical tests  our approach was partly
inspired by the earlier work of howe and dahlman         their work raised the standard
to which evaluation of planners should be done and compels the planning community to
decide whether future planning competitions should be conducted in a way that supports
the goals of scientific investigation of progress in the field 
the rest of this paper is organised as follows  we begin by discussing the context 
the competition series itself and the general form of the third competition  including the
domains  the competitors and the specific challenges raised  we then briefly summarise the
results of the competition before embarking on a detailed post hoc analysis of the competition results  this analysis investigates the relative performances of the planners  the relative
difficulties of the problem sets used and the relative scaling behaviours of the competitors
across domains and levels  we provide an appendix in which we present summaries of the
competing planners and details of the domains used 
 

fithe  rd international planning competition

   the international planning competition series
the first event was held in conjunction with the fourth international artificial intelligence
planning and scheduling conference  aips     it was organised by drew mcdermott 
together with a committee of senior members of the research community  mcdermott 
       the event took some time to organise  with evolving agreement on the form of the
event  the kinds of planning systems that should be compared  the basis of comparison and
so on  the final event became a direct comparison of   strips based planners  with two
of the planners also attempting an extended adl based language  mcdermott        long 
       the systems included three graphplan based systems  one forward heuristic search
system and one planning as satisfiability satsolver planner  a very important outcome
of the first competition was the adoption of pddl  mcdermott   the aips   planning
competition committee        as a common representation language for planning 
although the opportunity was offered for competitors to hand code control knowledge
for their planners  in fact all of the planners were fully automated and ran on the problem
instances without any priming  the entire event was staged at the conference over a period
of some four days  involving intensive sessions of generating and checking solutions and
attempting to evaluate the results  one idea that was tried  but that turned out to be
problematic in practice  was to score the planners performances using a function that
attempted to take into account the time taken to generate a plan  the length of the plan
and the relative performance of all of the competitors on the problems  for example  a
planner that produced a plan faster than all of its competitors would be rewarded based on
how much faster it was than the average for the problem  this attempt to score planners
using a one dimensional measure proved difficult  with counter intuitive results in certain
cases  in the end it was abandoned in favour of two dimensions  length of plan and time
taken to produce it  this decision indicates that  even for only five systems and a relatively
small set of problems  it is impossible to make unequivocal decisions about which system is
best  nevertheless  the community can  and did  learn much from the data that is gathered 
offering a variety of interpretations of the data  but ultimately being inspired to improve
on it in every way possible 
in the second competition  chaired by fahiem bacchus     planners competed  the
increase in participation and the ambitions for larger scale testing required that the event
be spread over a much longer period  in fact  testing was spread over a couple of months 
with only one final test being carried out at the conference site  aips   in breckenridge   in
the second competition there was a more formal split between systems  with a small number
using hand coded control knowledge and others being fully automated  there was also a
split between strips and adl capable systems  the larger number of competitors included
a wider range of approaches  as well as graphplan based systems  forward heuristic search
and a satsolver  there were several planners based on model checking approaches using
bdds  and one using planning by rewriting  again  it proved difficult to compare planners
unequivocally  but several important observations could be made  the advantages of handcoded control rules in most domains could be seen clearly  as would be expected   although
there remained an important question about the difficulty of generating and writing the
rules  of the fully automated planners  the forward heuristic search approach proved to be
particularly successful  dominating performance in most domains  pure graphplan based

planning seemed to have reached its zenith between the first two competitions and no longer
appeared competitive 
the third competition  and most recent at the time of writing  was held in association
with aips   at toulouse  fourteen planners participated  the primary objective of the
competition was to help to push forward research into temporal and resource intensive
planning  extensions were made to pddl to support the modelling of temporal and numeric
domain features  these resulted in the pddl    language  fox   long         the extensive
changes to pddl    and the ambitious objectives of the competition help to account for the
fact that fewer people participated in      than in       once again  the real testing and
gathering of data took place over the two months prior to the conference  although initial
results were presented at the conference  no detailed analysis took place at the conference
itself  the rest of this paper examines the objectives of the third competition  the results
and some future challenges for the series 

   overview  the third international planning competition
as organisers of the third international planning competition we chose to address several
new challenges that we believe are important to the ambitions of the planning community  the management of problems with metric constraints on numerically valued variables 
temporal planning  including managing concurrency and scheduling of activities  and the
construction of plans subject to specified optimisation criteria other than a simple count of
the numbers of steps 
setting these goals has obvious implications for the potential competitors in terms of
extended expressive power and additional problem solving required to manage the extensions  in order to control the extent to which competitors would be required to handle
all of these extensions successfully  we constructed variants  or levels  of all of the domains
used in the competition  for most of the domains we included a strips level  a numeric
level  using strips and metric variables only   a simpletime level in which actions have
duration but there are no other metric values in the domain and a full temporal level  time 
using durative actions with durations determined by the context of their usage  so duration
depends on the parameter values and not only on the action name   the simpletime and
time levels did not involve numeric resources other than time  to address this combination
we introduced some additional domain variants  as we discuss below  each of the four levels
corresponds to a particular degree of expressive power of pddl     and there are different
challenges posed by the versions of each domain at each level 
a secondary goal was to assess the relative effort of generating and encoding control
rules for planners  unfortunately  we failed to find any way to usefully quantify this effort 
we discuss this question further in the following sections 
    problem domains
the problem domains selected for the competitions have been  or have become  benchmark
domains used by much of the community for empirical evaluation  the domains that have
been used have often been chosen to probe some specific detail of performance  this has
sometimes meant that the domains are not representative of general features of planning
 

fithe  rd international planning competition

and are inappropriate for use in more widespread testing  a description of the domains
used in all of the competitions so far can be found in appendix a 
in the third competition  eight families of domains were used  broadly divided into
transportation domains  depots  driverlog and zenotravel   applications inspired domains
 rovers and satellite  and a small collection of others  settlers  freecell and um translog   
we briefly summarise the collection here and describe them in more detail in appendix a 
 depots this domain combines the transportation style problem of logistics with the
well known blocks domain  the logistics domain exhibits a high degree of parallelism 
since separate vehicles can be utilised concurrently  in contrast  the blocks domain
is characterised by significant goal interaction  our intention in doing this was to
discover whether the successes of planners in each of these domains separately could
be brought together when the problems were combined 
 driverlog this problem involves transportation  but with the twist that the vehicles
must be supplied with a driver before they can move 
 zeno travel another transportation problem  inspired by a domain used in testing
the zeno planner developed by pemberthy and weld         in which people must
embark onto planes  fly between locations and then debark  with planes consuming
fuel at different rates according to speed of travel 
 satellite this domain was inspired by the problem of scheduling satellite observations  the problems involve satellites collecting and storing data using different
instruments to observe a selection of targets 
 rovers this domain was motivated by the      mars exploration rover  mer 
missions and the planned      mars science laboratory  msl  mission  the objective
is to use a collection of mobile rovers to traverse between waypoints on the planet 
carrying out a variety of data collection missions and transmitting data back to a
lander  the problem includes constraints on the visibility of the lander from various
locations and on the ability of individual rovers to traverse between particular pairs
of waypoints 
 settlers this domain revolves around the management of resources  measured using
metric valued variables  products must be manufactured from raw materials and used
in the manufacture or transportation of further materials  new raw materials can be
generated by mining or gathering  the objective is to construct a variety of structures
at various specified locations 
 um translog   this domain is a pddl    encoding of a new variant of the umtranslog  wu   nau        domain  this was generated for us by dan wu of the
university of maryland  this is essentially a transportation domain  but one that
is significantly more complex than previous transportation benchmarks  in fact  this
domain was introduced late in the competition and very little data was collected  it
is therefore not discussed further in this paper

we also reused the freecell domain from the second competition  this domain presented
a serious challenge to participants in      and we were interested to see whether planning
technology had surpassed this challenge in the intervening two years  although the domain
produced some interesting data we did not attempt to precisely measure the extent to which
the      performance surpassed that of      
each domain  other than settlers  freecell and um translog    was presented to the
competitors for at least the four different levels previously identified  strips  numeric
simpletime and time  the problems presented at each of these levels comprised distinct
tracks and the competitors were able to choose in which tracks they wished to compete 
in addition to the four main tracks we also included two additional tracks  intended to
explore particular ideas  these tracks did not necessitate the use of additional expressive
power but simply allowed existing expressiveness to be combined to produce interesting
planning challenges  for example  the hardnumeric track consisted of problems from the
satellite domain that had very few logical goals  plans were evaluated by a metric based on
amount of data recorded rather than by determining whether a specified logical goal had
been achieved  the challenge was for planners to respond to the plan metric and include
actions that would acquire data  the complex track consisted of problems that combined
temporal and numeric features  the challenge was to reason about resource consumption in
parallel with managing temporal constraints  in total  we defveloped    domains  with   
problem instances in each domain  a few  unintentially  ended up with    or    instances  
in most domains there were an additional    instances of large problems intended for the
hand coded planners  in total there were nearly      problem instances to be solved  of
which about half were intended primarily for the fully automated planners 
    the competitors
the population of competing planning systems has changed over the three competitions 
few systems have competed more than once and no system has appeared in all three competitions  in part  this is a reflection of the speed of development of planning systems  revealing
the extent to which the technology of      has been surpassed by that of       it is also
a reflection of the growing interest in the series  which has encouraged more competitors
to come forward  and of the work involved in taking part which has discouraged previous
competitors from repeating their effort  entering the competition involves more than generating interesting and efficient approaches to solving the planning problem  it demands
the ability to construct a system that can respond robustly and reliably when confronted
with previously unseen challenges  including domains that were not amongst those used in
development of the system  it must be sufficiently well engineered that its performance is
not dominated by poor programming rather than by the real algorithmic effort of solving
the problem  careless choice of a data structure can undermine the opportunity to show
off a clever new planning algorithm   for systems that use hand coded rules to guide the
planning system there is an additional demand  the time required to read and understand
domains sufficiently to construct sensible control knowledge and to then encode and test
the knowledge to achieve good performance  the time table for the testing was relatively
compressed  the entire problem suite was generated and delivered to the competitors over a
two month period and testing was carried out remotely on a single machine   so those using
 

fithe  rd international planning competition

hand coded controls were forced to find time to analyse the domains  hypothesise and test
rules in intense sessions 
details of the competing systems can be found in appendix b  to summarise  many
of the fully automated planners use relaxed plan heuristics to guide a heuristic search 
lpg  gerevini  saetti    serina        uses local search to improve candidate plan structures formed in a graphplan style plan graph  several planners  mips  ff and sapa  also
extend the use of relaxed plan heuristics to include numeric features  vhpop is a partialorder planner  demonstrating that partial order planning can be competitive with the more
recently fashionable heuristic forward state space search planners  for various reasons 
several planners generated only small collections of results  which are disregarded in the
analysis 
a few competitors used more than one version of their planner  or more than one
parameter setting  we did not attempt to enforce the use of unique versions  but left it to
competitors to ensure that we were informed where variations were used  multiple versions
of ff  mips and lpg were used  ff submitted almost all data for a version optimised
for speed performance  a small subset of data was submitted for a version optimised for
quality  showing that there are alternative criteria by which performance can be evaluated 
in all of the analyses we report we have used the data generated by ff optimised for
speed exclusively  mips also offered data in two variants  using slightly different parameter
settings  in our analyses we use data for one variant  mips  exclusively  except in the case
of the satellite hardnumeric problems in which we used the data from the other variant
 mips plain   lpg submitted data in three versions  one based on earliest plan produced 
one based on best plan produced over a longer time span and a third which represented
a compromise between speed and quality  in fact  since all of the results for the version
optimised for quality were generated within a few minutes at most  we chose to use this data
exclusively in the analyses that follow  this should be borne in mind when reviewing the
results for comparative speed performance of the planners  the performance of lpg relies on
certain parameter settings  in most cases  the parameters used for lpg were automatically
set  but in a few cases some parameters were set by hand  in their paper  appearing in
this issue  gerevini  saetti and serena        give new results of an experiment testing
their planner with all parameters set automatically  in general they observe no significant
difference in the performance of lpg with respect to the data provided for the competition 
the three hand coded planners that competed represent two alternative approaches to
planning  forward state space search using control rules to prune bad choices and promote
good choices  and hierarchical task network  htn  planning 
there were     problems available to the fully automated planners and mips was the
only planner to attempt all of them  there were     problems available to the hand coded
planners and shop  was the only planner to attempt all of these  solving almost all of them
and solving the most problems overall  tlplan and talplanner were the only planners
that solved all problems attempted  not all planners attempted all problems they were
equipped to handle  in particular  sapa did not attempt strips problems  although it is
capable of solving them 
although the planning competitions have been a great source of data from the stateof the art planners and an encouragement and catalyst for progress in the field  they are
also lively and exciting competition events  this means that there must be winners  the

fithe  rd international planning competition

choice of winners is left to the organisers and must be treated with caution  in summarising
the results at the aips conference in toulouse  we presented a table of results in the form
shown in figure    together with a selection of graphs showing relative performance of
planners in terms of speed and quality of plans in several of the problem sets  it was hard
to synthesise a comprehensive view in the short time between final data collection and the
presentation  a matter of a couple of days  during the conference   so our initial assessments
were based on a rather crude evaluation of the evidence  we chose to award a prize to lpg as
the best performer of the fully automated planners  it solved the most problems of all fullyautomated planners  showing excellent performance in the time tracks  we also awarded a
prize to mips which solved the second most problems and had the widest coverage of all
the fully automated planners  it is clear that ff produced exceptional performance in the
numeric level problems and could well have been judged worthy of a prize for that  we chose
to acknowledge the great difficulty for newcomers to the competition in building a system
that is sufficiently robust to compete  especially when there is no team of programmers and
researchers to support the effort  for this reason we awarded a prize to vhpop as best
newcomer  with its creditable performance in both strips and simpletime problems 
turning to the hand coded planners  we awarded a prize for best performance to tlplan 
which tackled almost all of the problems available  solved all of those it attempted and
produced plans of very high quality with dramatic speed  we also rewarded shop  for the
fact that it attempted every problem and produced more plans than any other planner 
the quality of its plans was consistently good and its performance highly competitive 
talplanner also performed outstandingly  often producing the highest quality plans and
doing so tremendously efficiently  but its coverage was restricted to the strips and time
tracks  in selecting prize winners we chose to emphasise breadth of coverage  particularly
in the new challenges of handling numeric and temporal planning problems  competitions
demand a degree of spectacle in the selection of winners  but the more measured evaluation
of planners takes time  in this paper we present various analyses of the data collected during
the competition and leave it to the community to judge the final rankings of the planners 
    additional challenges
the hardnumeric and complex problems used in the competition do not easily fit into
the analysis conducted across the other results  these problems raise interesting special
challenges for the planners  we now discuss some of these challenges  presenting data below 
each of these challenges was explored in only one or two problem sets  so generalisations
about the performance of the planners based on the data collected are inappropriate  we do
not  therefore  perform a statistical analysis of these data  but  instead  present the relevant
data in simple graphical form 
      the hardnumeric satellite problems
the hardnumeric satellite problem instances contained logical goals that are almost all
trivial  for example  in most cases the problems involved simply ensuring that each of the
satellites target a specific observation site at the end of the plan  however  the plan metric
used to evaluate the plans was far more informative  the plans were evaluated according
to the data collected by the satellites during their execution  simply satisfying the explicit

figure    plan quality for the satellite hardnumeric problems  high values are better
quality plans  quality is the amount of data collected 

goals would generate a correct plan  but a worthless one in terms of the plan metric  of the
fully automated planners  only mips and ff tackled these problems  tlplan and shop 
were the hand coded planners that attempted these problems  it is instructive to compare
the qualities of the plans produced by all four of these planners on this problem set  figure  
shows that the quality of the plans produced by the hand coded planners is significantly
higher than the quality of the plans generated by fully automated planners  indeed  ff
generates plans that satisfy only the logical goals and minimise the plan size required to
achieve that  so do not lead to any data collection  with some careful adjustments  mips
has been able to generate plans that collect some data  but this is clearly a rather limited
result  the closeness of the results generated by tlplan and shop  suggest that they are
both solving the data collection problem at a level close to optimal  or are applying similar
heuristic approaches to the problem and generating similar locally optimal solutions  this
domain very clearly highlights an advantage of hand coded planners in their exploitation of
the knowledge that their human domain engineer can bring to bear 
      the complex satellite domain
in addition to the hardnumeric satellite domain  a complex satellite domain was also
considered  the complexity in this domain arises from the fact that it combines temporal
actions  with durations dependent on the parameters of the action  with the management
of numerically measured resources  in this case  the data store available for acquired data  
the problem has a quality that is similar to a knapsack problem  with data having to be
packed into the limited stores of appropriate satellites  this is combined with the temporal
optimisation problem  which involves ensuring that the satellites are efficiently deployed

moving between targets and capturing data according to their capabilities  their current
aspects and their available store  as can be seen from figure    the planners  fullyautomated and hand coded  produced plans of quite widely varying quality  lower values
are better  here  since quality is measured by makespan   in general  tlplan produced
the best quality plans  although lpg also produced some high quality plans for the smaller
problems  as can be seen in problems            and     particularly  the fully automated
planners occasionally produced plans with quality diverging very significantly from optimal
 we do not actually know what the optimal values are for these problems  but we can
obviously consider the best value produced as an upper bound on the optimal value  
      the settlers domain
the settlers domain is based on resource management computer games  in which resources
must be accumulated and used to construct new resource centres  with new specialised
production and capabilities  an interesting problem that this domain highlights is that
the pddl    family of languages does not offer a convenient way to name objects that are
created during execution of a plan  in the version used for the competition  we overcame
this problem by having a selection of names available at the outset that are not initially
committed to any role  when an object is constructed  an unallocated name is used to
name it  assigning to the name the properties of the new object and marking the name
as used  an important problem that this approach creates for most current planners is
that the initial grounding of actions involves creating all possible ways in which the names
could be assigned to objects and then used in various roles within the plan  this leads to
a significant explosion in the size of the domain encoding  it is interesting to observe that
  

filong   fox

only   of the    problems were solved by any  fully automated  planner  and that only ff
solved more than one problem  it is clear that this domain remains a challenge to planning
technology  but also to the future development of pddl    in which it will be necessary to
review the way in which object construction is modelled 

   analysis of competition performance
one of the important roles of a competition is to identify the state of the art in the field 
in terms of a variety of measures  and to attempt to answer broad questions about the
landscape of the research area  of course  a competition cannot have the last word about
the state of the art  there might be state of the art planning systems that are prevented 
for whatever reason  from taking part in the competition  however  the competition does
provide some useful insights into the capabilities of modern planning systems 
planning performance can be measured in terms of the speed of solution of the problems
and the number and quality of the solutions found  other metrics might also be identified 
there are different planning architectures and heuristic evaluation functions as well as
different kinds of domains and problems  the state of the art is represented by specific
exemplars of these architectures and heuristic functions and it is interesting to explore the
suitability of different architectures for use on different domains  the scaling behaviour of
particular approaches  the comparative performance of different planning systems  etc  we
address some of these issues in the following sections 
we perform three collections of analyses to ascertain comparative performance based on
consideration of raw speed and quality data  the extent to which domain influenced planner
behaviour and the scaling behaviour of the planners  the first collection is a comparison
between the planners based on their raw competition performance  we analyse the data
from the point of view of a consumer interested in ranking the planners according to speed
and plan quality  these experiments are aimed at answering coarse level questions of the
form  which planner should i buy  in asking questions such as this we are trying to arrive at
a general basis for comparison  of course  our investigation of this question is constrained
by the metrics used in the competition  furthermore  the trade off one makes between time
and quality depends on the context in which a planner might be deployed  therefore  we
cannot combine the judgements of relative speed and relative plan quality performance to
determine unequivocally which planner to buy  we take as a basic assumption that potential
users of domain independent planning technology are interested primarily in broad coverage
with good behaviour across a wide variety of domains  rather than in restricted coverage
with spectacular behaviour in just a few domains  our raw performance analyses are
based mainly on the wilcoxon rank sum matched pairs test  see appendix c   as explained
below  an advantage of this test is that it is non parametric  meaning that it does not rely
on assumptions about the shapes or properties of the underlying population distributions 
it is also robust to outliers 
the second collection of experiments is concerned with identifying whether there were
domains that were significantly easier  or harder   we perform these experiments at each
of the levels of problems used in the competition to determine whether there is agreement
amongst the planners about the difficulty of the problems  in part  this assists us in going
on to explore scalability issues but it also allows us to determine whether the problem
  

fithe  rd international planning competition

set presented at the competition contained interesting challenges  our third collection of
experiments compares the way in which planners scale on problem sets in which they agree
about problem difficulty 
    raw performance analysis
we perform pairwise comparisons between planners to ascertain whether any consistent
pattern can be identified in their relative speed and plan quality  we focus first on comparing
the fully automated planners and  separately  the hand coded planners  we then perform an
additional set of analyses to try to determine the raw performance benefit obtained from the
use of hand coded control knowledge  to do this  we perform the wilcoxon test on pairs
crossing the boundary between the fully automated and hand coded planner groupings 
where the conclusion is that the improvement obtained is significant  all we can say is that
control rules yield an improvement in performance  we cannot account for the price  in
terms of effort to encode the rules  that must be paid to obtain this improvement  the
understanding of what is involved in writing useful control knowledge is still anecdotal and
it remains an important challenge to the community to quantify this more precisely  one
important consequence of the use of hand crafted control knowledge is that to speak of
planner performance blurs the distinction between the planning system itself and the
control rules that have been produced to support its performance in each domain  where
a planner performs well it is impossible to separate the contributions from the planning
system  the architecture of that system  and the extent that this contributes to the ease
of expressing good control rules  and the sophistication of the control rules that have been
used  we do not attempt to distinguish planner from control rules in the analysis that
follows  but at least one competitor observed that results would have been significantly
worse had there been less time to prepare  while  given more time  results could have
been improved by concentrating on optimisation of plan metrics rather than simply on
makespans  this observation helps to highlight the fact that  for planners exploiting handcoded control knowledge  the competition format should be seen as a highly constrained
basis for evaluation of performance 
to summarise  we now present the hypotheses we are exploring in this section 
null hypothesis  there is no basis for any pairwise distinction between
the performances of planners in terms of either time taken to plan or in quality
 according to the specified problem metrics  of plans produced 
alternative hypothesis  the planners can be partially ordered in terms
of their time performances and  separately  their quality performances 
    analytic framework
we perform pairwise comparisons  between planners in the fully automated and hand coded
groups  on the problems in each of the main four problem levels used in the competition  we
do not include analyses of the complex and hardnumeric tracks because these resulted
in too few data points for meaningful statistical conclusions to be drawn  we perform
wilcoxon rank sum matched pairs tests to identify whether the number of times one planner
performed better than the other indicates a significant difference in performance between the
  

filong   fox

two  having performed pairwise comparisons between the performances in each of the tracks
we use the results to construct partial orderings on the speed and quality performances of
the planners in these tracks  we use       as the significance level because we wish to
extrapolate from collections of pairwise comparisons to infer confidence  at the p       
level  in the transitive relationships between the planners  in the strips track  which was
the largest  we perform    pairwise comparisons so that a confidence level of               
was required in the transitive picture  we use a confidence level of        resulting in a
slightly conservative analysis 
we use sufficiently large samples that the t distribution  used by the wilcoxon test 
is approximately normal  we therefore quote z values to indicate the significance in the
differences between the mean performances of the paired planners  we do not compare all
pairs of planners  in some cases the superiority of a planner over another is so clear from
examination of the raw data that statistical testing is obviated 
the wilcoxon test tells us when one planner performs consistently better than another
and whether this consistency is statistically significant  it does not tell us how much better
one planner is than another  it could be that there is very little difference in performance 
perhaps the discrepancy can be accounted for by mere implementation differences  the
consistency with which the difference occurs determines whether there is a statistically
significant discrepancy between the performances of the planners  one planner can perform
consistently better than another even though the other wins some of the time  for example 
in a comparison between a and b  planner a might win more frequently than b because it
is faster at solving a subset of problems in the set even though it is much slower at solving
another subset of the problems  provided the subset won by b is sufficiently large the
greater number of wins due to a will not emerge as significant  for example  in a set of   
problems ranked according to the differences in performance  if the first   problems in the
ranking are won by a and the last   by b  a will obtain a score of    and b a score of    
in this case no significant difference emerges regardless of the magnitude of the difference
between a and b in the last three problems  see appendix c   the rank sum approach has
the benefit of allowing large numbers of small wins to outweigh small numbers of large wins 
this is desirable because a large win in a few problems is not an indication of overall better
performance  we are interested in trying to measure the consistency of domain independent
behaviour and therefore in comparing the consistency of performance across domains given
that planners perform differently within domains 
the size of the win need not indicate the complexity of the underlying problem so
this does not allow us to make judgements about scalability  essentially the test reveals
consistent patterns in performance across a range of problems  we consider this to be of
interest because knowing that one planner is significantly consistently better than another
helps us make an objective judgement about which of the two planners is performing better
across a varied problem set  if there is variability in the performances so that no consistent
pattern emerges  it is very hard  perhaps impossible  to make this judgement objectively 
in a few cases  comparison using the wilcoxon test does not lead to any statistically
significant conclusions  but the proportion of wins by one of the planners is higher than is
consistent with the null hypothesis of equal performance  this can be tested using a z test
for a proportion  see appendix c   where this test yields a significant result we report it 
  

fithe  rd international planning competition

as described below  this test is less informative than the wilcoxon test as it does not take
into account how the wins are distributed through the problem set 
in performing pairwise comparisons we must deal with cases where a planner did not
solve a problem  we assign infinitely bad speed to the planner in these cases  ensuring that
maximum possible benefit is given to planners solving problems  even very slowly  this
methodology is valid because the wilcoxon test is based on rank so the effect is simply to
push the unsolved cases to the extreme of the ranking  in the case of quality we perform
an initial collection of tests using infinitely bad quality for the unsolved problems  it
is somewhat difficult to decide what it means to compare a true quality result with the
infinitely bad quality assigned when a planner produced no solution  our conclusion is that
this comparison may not be informative enough  so in addition we perform the wilcoxon
test on just those cases where both planners produced a plan  we refer to these cases as
double hits 
    results of analysis
the results of performing the wilcoxon tests  in order to compare speed performance between fully automated planners  are shown in figure    the results of similar tests to
compare plan quality are presented in figures   and    the double hits data are presented
in figure    the corresponding tests for the hand coded planners are shown in figures  
and   
the tables have rows corresponding to the four problem levels for which the competition
gathered sufficient data for analysis  these are  strips  numeric  simpletime and time 
there are so many results for the fully automated planners on strips domains that they are
split over two rows  creating five rows in these tables  in the comparisons of plan quality we
report the strips results using sequential plan length and concurrent plan length separately 
the data in the rows are interpreted in the following way  each cell  representing a pair of
planners being compared  presents the z value and corresponding p value identified from
the wilcoxon statistical table  the order of the planners names in the title of the cell is
significant  the first planner named is the one favoured by the comparison  underneath
the cell is an entry indicating the size of the sample used  the sample consists of all
problems for which at least one of the planners being compared produced a solution  this
results in there being different sample sizes for different comparisons  if the p value is no
greater than       then the difference in the mean performances obtained by the competing
planners is statistically significant and it can be concluded that the planner in that column is
significantly out performing its competitor  if the p value is greater than       the difference
is not significant  in terms of the transitive view in which we are interested  and the null
hypothesis that the planners are performing roughly equally cannot be rejected  we indicate
the absence of significance at the p         level by the use of a bold font 
the wilcoxon test tells us when there is a significant difference in mean behaviour but
it does not identify the planner producing the greater proportion of wins in cases where the
mean behaviour is insignificantly different  therefore  when the wilcoxon tests reports that
there is no significant difference between a pair of planners we also report the z value of
the proportion  see appendix c   if significant  to provide this missing information  where

filong   fox

we do this the z value of the proportion  and its p value  appear in brackets following the
wilcoxon result 
    interpretation
our results show that the null hypothesis can be rejected  therefore  we adopt the alternative hypothesis and here discuss the resulting partial orders inferred from the data 
the data presented in figures   to   can be interpreted in terms of partial orderings on
the speed and quality performances of the fully automated and hand coded planners at each
of the four problem levels  this can be done  at each level  simply by putting an ordering
between pairs of planners from a to b when the wilcoxon value for that pair is reported
in the sub column associated with a and is significant at the       level  the results are
shown in figures   to     in each of these figures sub graphs associated with each of the
four problem levels are identified  the presence of an arrow in a graph indicates that a
statistically significant ordering exists  the absence of an arrow from a to b indicates that
no statistically significant relationship between a and b was found at the corresponding
problem level and therefore that no transitive ordering can depend on such a relationship 
      partial orderings based on speed
figure   describes the speed comparisons that can be made between the fully automated
planners according to the wilcoxon test  it can be observed that ff is significantly consistently faster than the other fully automated planners at the strips and numeric levels  the
significance of each of the arrows in the figure is sufficient to support transitive reasoning  
indeed  at the strips and numeric levels there is an interesting linear ordering between ff 
lpg  mips and vhpop  three of which were the prize winners amongst the fully automated
planners  which is maintained between lpg  mips and vhpop at the simpletime level  despite the observation that simplanner was faster  in a significant proportion of the strips
problems than mips  there is no significant wilcoxon relationship between them so that
the four prize winners comprise a spine of performance around which the other planners
competing at these levels are clustered  the relationship breaks down at the time level because only lpg  mips  sapa and tp  participated  in this data set it can be seen that mips
and sapa are indistinguishable  with respect to the wilcoxon test  but lpg is significantly
consistently faster than both 
for comparing the hand coded planners the competition used a collection of small problems and a collection of large problems at each problem level  the large problems were
beyond the capabilities of any of the fully automated planners  interestingly  the handcoded planners behaved differently in the small and large problem collections  this is
most marked in figure     at the strips level  where the performances of tlplan and
talplanner are inverted in the small and large problem sets  in the small simpletime
and time problems tlplan is consistently faster than either talplanner or shop   with
talplanner and shop  being statistically indistinguishable in these data sets  tlplan is
also consistently faster than talplanner  which is in turn consistently faster than shop  
in the large time problems

      partial orderings based on quality
the construction of the partial order on quality performance at the strips level for the
fully automated planners is shown in figure     to interpret the figures depicting quality
performance it should be noted that  at all problem levels except strips  specific quality
metrics were provided and plan quality must be measured in terms of these metrics  at the
strips level no such metrics were provided and quality is a measure of plan length  either
sequential or concurrent  in the figures we have labelled the arrows in the strips graphs
to denote whether the relationship exists in terms of sequential or concurrent ordering  or
both  where the ordering is for both sequential and concurrent quality the arrow is left
unlabelled  it can be observed that two planners might be ordered in one direction for
sequential length and in the other for concurrent length 
as indicated above  comparison of quality performance is made difficult if one of the
two planners being compared solved many more problems than the other  this problem only
arises for the fully automated planners because the hand coded planners failed to solve so
few problems that the proportion of unsolved problems did not affect our tests   using an
infinite quality measure for unsolved problems the wilcoxon test concludes that the planner
solving the most problems has overall better quality  in other words  if one is interested
in overall solution quality one should choose the planner that solves the most problems even
if  in some cases  it produces worse quality plans than its competitor  however  we also
want to understand the relationship between the two planners in the double hits case  we
notice that consideration of just these problems sometimes inverts the relationship detected
by the first test  for example  in figure    it can be observed that  at the simpletime
level  vhpop consistently produced better quality plans than tp  across the whole problem
set but  when only double hits are considered  tp  produced consistently better plans than
vhpop  this suggests that tp  is solving problems with higher quality solutions  but that
the price it pays in search to find these solutions is so high that it solves a much smaller
set of problems than other planners  such as vhpop  we depict these results using dotted
arrows in the graphs  finally  it can arise that the wilcoxon test detects no significant
relationship between two planners  but that the difference in the proportion of problems
solved by the two planners is significant  we indicate the resulting weaker relationship using
a dashed arrow 
figure    shows that lpg emerges as the fully automated planner consistently producing
the highest quality plans at all problem levels  the relationship between ff and mips is
more complex because  whilst ff produced plans of better sequential quality than mips 
mips produced better quality concurrent plans than ff when considering only double hits 
the reason for this apparent discrepancy is that mips post processes sequential plans into
partially ordered plans exploiting some of the available concurrency in the problem  which
ff does not exploit  however  it fails to solve a larger subset of problems than ff  giving
ff the advantage in quality overall 
in the strips problems simplanner solves more problems than stella and hence is
seen to be performing at a consistently higher sequential plan quality level  when double
hits are considered stella outperforms simplanner in concurrent plan quality  also  when
double hits are considered  it can be seen that vhpop consistently outperforms stella for

sequential plan quality and simplanner in all cases  interestingly  vhpop and stella have
no wilcoxon or proportion test relationship when all problems are considered 
mips outperforms vhpop and tpsys in the simpletime problems  with vhpop consistently better than tp   when only double hits are considered tp  outperforms vhpop
demonstrating that tp  produces better quality solutions for those problems that it solves 
given the available data it seems that tp  and tpsys are not performing significantly differently  but it may be that the data set is too small to draw this conclusion with confidence 
in the time data set there is no significant consistent pattern in the relative performances
of sapa and mips  lpg consistently produces better quality plans 
as with the fully automated planners we find that the speed comparisons that can be
observed do not hold when the planners are compared in terms of quality  figure    shows
the quality comparisons we performed on the three competing hand coded planners  it
shows that  in the small strips problems tlplan consistently outperformed shop  in terms
of sequential plan quality  in the small problems talplanner produces shorter makespan
plans than both tlplan and shop  and shop  produces shorter makespan plans than
tlplan  tlplan produces sequential strips plans and does not use any post processing
step to introduce parallelism  as a result it is certain to be outperformed in a makespan
comparison with planners capable of producing parallel plans 
no significant relationships emerged in the numeric problems  talplanner did not
compete in the numeric problems  no significant wilcoxon result was established 
in the simpletime problems  both small and large  the quality performances of tlplan
and talplanner are indistinguishable  and both are consistently better than shop   in
the time problems tlplan emerges as consistently better than talplanner and shop  
      cross boundary partial orderings
we performed a final collection of comparisons to try to better understand what advantages
can be obtained from the use of hand coded rather than fully automated planners  in terms
of speed and quality  we compare the best performing fully automated planner with the
best performing hand coded planner in both categories  ff with tlplan for speed  at all
levels  and lpg with talplanner at the strips level  shop  at the numeric level and with
tlplan at the remaining problem levels  for quality 
the tables in figures    and    show the results of the tests  figure    summarises the
conclusions  it can be observed that tlplan is consistently faster than ff at all problem
levels in which they both participated  demonstrating that the control knowledge being
exploited by tlplan is giving it a real speed advantage  it remains to be seen exactly why
this should be the case  given that for several strips domains the control knowledge that is
usually described as having been encoded appears to prune no additional states over those
already pruned when an ff style heuristic measure is used  the reason for this added value
is an interesting question for the community to consider in trying to evaluate the advantages
and disadvantages of the hand coded approach 
it can also be observed that talplanner produces consistently better concurrent plans
than lpg at the strips level  again  this result needs to be explained by an in depth
analysis of the control information being exploited by talplanner  at the simpletime
level lpg produces plans that are consistently better quality than those of tlplan

figure     table of results of comparisons of plan quality between fully automated and
hand coded planners 

it is interesting to observe that hand coding control information does not appear to lead
to any consistent improvement in plan quality across the data sets  it does seem to lead
to a speed advantage which must indicate that  in general  control rules provide a basis
for more efficient pruning than weak general heuristic measures  the wilcoxon test does
not measure the extent of the speed advantage obtained  nor does it measure the extent of
the quality advantage obtained from using a fully automated planner in preference  these
trade offs need further close analysis  but it is interesting to see that there was not in fact a
uniform advantage obtained by the hand coded planners  at least on the smaller problems
that formed the common foundation for testing  of course  the development of hand coded
control knowledge can prioritise different aspects of the solutions generated and it is possible
that further development of control rules might support the construction of more heavily
optimised plans 

   tests for magnitude
to complement the wilcoxon tests we perform some additional analyses to identify whether 
given two planners being compared  the magnitude of the difference in performance between
the two planners is statistically significant  we perform paired t tests  see appendix c 
using a subset of pairs of planners  we focus our attention on those pairs for which consistent significant differences were identified  because we consider it not to be meaningful to
compare magnitude results for planners where no consistent domination is exhibited  we
also restrict our attention to the planners that were  according to the wilcoxon tests  the
  

fithe  rd international planning competition

most impressive performers at each of the competition levels  we perform separate tests
for speed and quality 
when investigating the magnitude of differences in performances it is not meaningful
to include problems which were not solved by one of the planners being compared  using
infinite time or quality measures would result in a magnitude value that would grossly
distort the true picture  for the magnitude tests we therefore consider only double hits 
the price we pay for this is that we give undesirable emphasis to the smaller and easier
problems since these are the ones most frequently solved by both planners  this should be
borne in mind when interpreting the data 
the hypotheses being considered in this section are 
null hypothesis  there is no consistent magnitude difference in the performances between planners 
alternative hypothesis  planners that demonstrate significant differences in consistency of performance also demonstrate corresponding magnitudes
in the differences between their performances 
    analytic framework
the t tests are performed using the normalised performances of the two planners  they
find the magnitude of difference between the performances of two planners  p  and p    on a
collection of problem instances  for example  given a collection of n problems  we find the
pairs of results p ri and p ri obtained for instances i     to i   n  in each case we normalise
these values by dividing each of them by the mean of the pair  this process establishes
a range of performances between   and    with   standing for equal performance  the
t test results in a t value representing the difference in the mean normalised performances
of the two planners  we perform   tailed tests at p        because we are interested in
the individual results rather than in extrapolated partial orderings based on magnitude 
we want to consider the magnitude information as it is relevant to individual consistency
results 
    results of analysis
the tables in figures    to    are organised as follows  tables in figures        and   
contain the speed results found for the fully automated  hand coded and mixed pairs respectively  tables in figures        and    contain the quality results for the same three
groups  in each table there is a row for each of the five competition levels  although empty
rows have been omitted   the columns represent the pairs of planners being compared 
in each cell five pieces of data are reported  the mean normalised performance for each
planner  the t value computed and the degrees of freedom used  which is derived from the
number of double hits at that level  and the resulting p value  a positive t value means that
the magnitude difference is in favour of the planner identified second in the cell  a negative
t value is in favour of the planner identified first  where the resulting t value indicates a
difference in magnitude that is not significant at the p      level we use a bold font  in
both speed and quality tests  an average performance smaller than   is favourable for a
planner  the interpretation of the value is that it represents the average proportion of the

planner in the pair being considered  means that the first planner is  on average  twice as
fast as the second 
    interpretation
the results demonstrate that the null hypothesis can be rejected in almost all pairwisecomparisons of planners for which the wilcoxon test shows a significant consistent performance difference  there are some cases in which the null hypothesis cannot be rejected 
implying that the consistent performance difference in a pair of planners does not translate
into a statistical significance in their mean relative performances

as shown in tables    to     a reassuring consistency emerged with the results of the
wilcoxon tests  that is  where significant consistency differences are identified between two
planners using the wilcoxon test  the t test for magnitude generally reveals a significant
magnitude difference as well 

   dependence of performance on domain
we consider it important to quantify the difficulty of the problems used in the competition
because this provides the basis for a deeper understanding of relative planner performance 
to explore this we investigate whether any of the domains that were used were uniformly
considered easy  or hard  amongst the fully automated and hand coded planners  we also
investigate whether  as might be expected to be the case  the strips problems were generally
considered to be easier than the problems at the numeric and temporal levels  these
two questions lead to two related investigations based on bootstrapping techniques  our
analyses show that different planners experienced different domains and levels as difficult 
within both the fully automated and the hand coded categories 
in the first competition  in       it was reported  long        that no planner solved
any problem with more than about        ground actions and that        ground actions
marked a limit beyond which planner performance was markedly unreliable  a ground
action is formed by replacing action schema parameters with objects of the correct types
selected from those in a problem instance  any static preconditions  preconditions whose
truth can be ascertained entirely from the initial state  are used to filter the ground
actions  so that only those that are plausibly applicable are counted  relevant ground
actions are found by applying a reachability analysis from the initial state and a regression
analysis from the goals in order to identify the subset of ground actions that could actually
play any useful role in the plan  it seems plausible that the number of ground actions could
offer a guide to the difficulty of problems  in fact  a brief survey of the largest problems
in the third competition  in figure     reveals that action counts can vary widely across
domains  it is encouraging to observe that the size of problems that can be solved with
reasonable reliability  at least in some domains  has grown significantly  despite the fact that
it is still typical for planners to ground the action set prior to planning  it is also of interest
to observe that the size of problems measured by action counts is not a strong indication
of difficulty  problems from the rovers and satellite domains were amongst those found
harder by many of the planners  despite having small action counts 
to summarise  the hypotheses being explored in this section are 
null hypothesis  the domains used in the competition were equally challenging to all planners at all levels 
alternative hypothesis  domain level combinations can be distinguished
in terms of relative difficulty posed to different planners 
for ease of comparison with the results presented in sections   and   we observe that 
in this section  we are specifically concerned with a cross domain analysis and with whether
the planners agreed on which of the domain level combinations were hard

    analytic framework
in order to explore the two questions  we used the planners to discover how hard the domains
and levels were  for each planner  domain and problem level we plot the number of problem
instances left to solve against time in milliseconds  this results in a curve  the area under
which can be taken to be a measure of the difficulty experienced by the planner in solving
problems in the given domain at the given problem level  in order to keep the area under
the curve finite we use a cut off time of thirty minutes  this extended cut off time  fifteen
minutes was used in the competition  results in a higher penalty being paid by a planner
that fails to solve problems 
in the experiment used to address the first question  the null hypothesis is that the
planner finds all problems at a specific level equally difficult across all domains  to test this
we constructed  using a bootstrapping technique  ten thousand samples of twenty values
from the collection of all timings obtained from domains at the appropriate level  the values
were selected at random from the performances of planners competing in the domains  one
value for each of a collection of randomly selected problems  for example  if problem one
was chosen from driverlog  problem two from depots  problem three from rovers  problem
four from depots  etc   then the value associated with problem one would be that produced
for that problem by a planner selected at random from those that competed in driverlog 
similarly  the value associated with problem two would be chosen from a planner that
competed in depots  and so on  for each collection of    values we plotted the number
of problem instances left to solve against time  as above  this resulted in a sampling
distribution of level specific areas  using these bootstrap samples we check whether the
area calculated for the particular planner domain level combination lies at the extremes of
this distribution  or not  if it lies in the first      of the distribution we reject the null
hypothesis on the grounds that the planner found problems at that level  in that domain 
to be significantly easy  if it lies in the top      of the distribution we reject the null
hypothesis and conclude that those problems were significantly hard for that planner 
in testing the relative hardness of problem levels within a domain  the second question  
we perform similar experiments in which  for each planner  the bootstrapped samples were
obtained by sampling timings from all problem levels within all domains  this resulted in a
new sampling distribution of the level independent area statistic  the null hypothesis  that
the domain level combination is not an indicator of difficulty  is tested by seeing whether

the areas computed for planner domain level combinations are extreme with respect to the
new sampling distribution 
    results of analysis
figures    to    report the results of the two experiments described above  figures   
and    describe the level specific and level independent comparisons we made using the
fully automated planners and the hand coded planners respectively  the table for the handcoded planners is further divided into two parts  the first five rows correspond to the small
problems  the latter five rows to the large problems  the performance of the hand coded
planners on the large problems was measured using bootstrapped samples taken from the
large problem collection 
the tables are organised as follows  the rows correspond to domains  as labelled  and
the columns to the levels considered and the number of planners used  the number of
planners varies between columns because different planners participated at the different
domain levels  for example  more planners participated at the strips level than at any of
the others  when planners produced too little data to justify statistical analysis they were
not included in the tests  thus  of the eleven fully automated planners in the competition
seven produced enough data for analysis in these experiments 
the cells of the tables contain two integer values separated by a diagonal  the value
on the left of the diagonal indicates the number of planners that found the problems in
the corresponding domain and level significantly easy  the value on the right indicates the
number that found those problems significantly hard  thus  it can be seen in figure   
that of the six fully automated planners that participated at the strips level of the depots
domain  one found the problems easy and three found them hard  for the other two
planners the areas calculated using the method explained above were not found to be
sufficiently extreme for rejection of the null hypothesis  broadly speaking  we discuss the
interpretation of the data in detail below  the four left hand columns tell us whether the
problems in a particular domain and level were easy or hard relative to other problems at
that level  the four right hand columns tell us whether they were easy or hard relative to all
other problems  in addition  the rows allow us to compare domains for relative difficulty 
for example  none of the planners found zenotravel to be hard at any level relative to other
problems at the same level  whilst depots and rovers were found to be hard by at least one
competitor at all levels

figure     comparisons of performance between domains using hand coded planners 
the level independent tests are reported in exactly the same way in the right hand halves
of figures     for the fully automated comparison  and     for the hand coded comparison  
these tables tell us whether the problems in a particular domain and level are easy or hard
relative to problems from other domains irrespective of level 
the data presented in figures    and    show which planners found which domain level
combinations easy or hard as discussed with reference to the tables in figures    and    
this information might contribute to an understanding about which planning approaches
are likely to be suited to what kinds of problems  although further analysis would be needed
to pursue this question 
the tables are organised as follows  there is a row for each of the individual planners 
indicating which domain level combinations were found to be easy or hard for the corresponding planner  associated with the categorization of a combination as easy or hard is
the p value indicating the statistical significance of this finding  we have presented only the
findings that were significant at the    level  because this is a two tailed test  we had no
a priori knowledge to help us to determine whether a problem would be easy or hard  the
critical value at the easy end is        at the hard end the critical value is        figure   
shows our findings for the fully automated planners  figure    shows the same information
with respect to the hand coded planners 
    interpretation
the results allow us to reject the null hypothesis in some cases  but not in others  we are
able to determine significant differences in the relative hardness of domains as determined by
specific planners  but there is also evidence of lack of consistency between the judgements of
different planners  for example  there are some domain level combinations that are found
hard by certain planners and not by others 
the tables in figures    and    allow us to determine which domains presented the
most interesting challenges to the planners participating in the competition  although it is
difficult to draw firm conclusions from data that is really only indicative  some interesting
patterns do emerge  for example  the level specific data in figure    shows that none of the
fully automated planners found zenotravel problems  at any levels  to be significantly hard
by comparison with problems drawn from other domains at the same level  the satellite

problems used only for the hand coded planners

strips problems were significantly easy  by comparison with other strips problems  for the
majority of the participating planners  and not hard for any of them  on the other hand
the satellite numeric problems were found to be challenging relative to other numeric
problems  figure    shows that the hand coded planners found zenotravel problems easy
at all levels  by comparison with problems at similar levels  and this remains true for the
large problem instances  depots problems were also easy for the hand coded planners 
when we consider the level independent picture in the right hand halves of figures   
and    we can observe that zenotravel emerges as significantly easy for the fully automated
planners  across all levels  by comparison with other problems irrespective of level  this
pattern is broken by only one full automated planner  lpg  finding these problems hard
at the time problem level  the satellite domain is similarly easy for the fully automated
planners  at all levels except numeric  it can be noted that the number of planners finding
the strips problems easy in the level independent comparisons is surprisingly high  the
interpretation is that the problems in the population as a whole are much harder  so that
the performance on strips problems is pushed to the extremes of the performance on all
problems  the hand coded planners found the depots and zenotravel problems to be
uniformly easy at all levels 
considering both the fully automated and the hand coded planners  the driverlog 
rovers and satellite domains present the most varied picture  suggesting that the problems
in these domains presented the greatest challenges overall  all of the hand coded planners
found the simpletime rovers problems significantly hard relative to other simpletime
problems  but only one found these problems amongst the hardest that they had to solve
overall  interestingly  the perceived difficulty of the small rovers problems does not persist
into the large problems 
an interesting comparison can be made between the results of the analysis for strips
domains and the work of hoffmann      b  analysing the topologies of strips and adl
versions of the common planning benchmark domains  hoffmann examines the behaviour
of the h  function  measuring relaxed distances between states in the state spaces for these
problems  in order to determine whether the function offers a reliable guide to navigate
through the state space in search of plans  according to hoffmanns analysis  the strips
versions of depots  driverlog and rovers have local minima in the function and can have
arbitrarily wide plateaus  sequences of states with equal values under h     these features
can make problem instances in these domains hard for planners relying on h   or approximations of it  to guide their search  this includes most of the fully automated planners
in the competition  however  interestingly  several of the fully automated planners found
one or more of these three domains to be easy at the strips level  although in a few cases
they were found to be hard   as hoffmann points out  the potential hardness of a domain
does not mean that all collections of problem instances from that domain are hard  our
observations seem to suggest that the competition collections posed instances that tended
towards the easy end of the spectrum  this was unintentional and demonstrates that it
can be difficult to obtain a good spread of challenges  particularly when generating problems automatically  satellite and zenotravel domains have  in contrast  constant bounded
plateaus and therefore the h  function is a reliable guide in navigating the state space
for these domains  interestingly  in our analysis all fully automated planners found these
domains either easy or neither easy nor hard at the strips level

   scaling issues
section   addressed the issue of relative difficulty of problems without considering the question of whether planners agree about the difficulty of specific problems  the results of
that section allow us to conclude that there is no overall consensus about which of the
competition domains and levels were found hard  but it does not allow us to determine
which planners agreed or disagreed on particular domains and levels  in order to look at
the relative scaling behaviour of planners we need to identify the extent of such agreement 
this is because to examine scaling behaviour it is necessary to have a scale that measures
performance in a way that is meaningful to both planners in a comparison  the analysis
described in this section therefore seeks to establish statistical evidence of such agreement 
in order to evaluate scaling behaviour we first explore whether the competing planners
agree on what makes a problem  within a particular domain and level  hard  although it
might seem straightforward to ensure that a problem set consists of increasingly difficult
problems  for example  by generating instances of increasing size  in fact it is not straightforward to achieve this  it appears that problem size and difficulty are not strongly correlated 
whether size is taken as a measure of the number of objects  the number of relations or even
the number of characters in a problem description  although a coarse relationship can be
observed  very large instances take more time to parse and to ground  small instances
can sometimes present more difficult challenges than large instances  this indicates that
factors other than size appear to be important in determining whether planners can solve
individual instances 
in summary  the hypotheses explored in this section are 
null hypothesis  the planners differ in their judgements about which
individual problem instances are hard within a given domain level combination 
alternative hypothesis  the planners demonstrate significant agreement
about the relative difficulties of the problem instances within any given domain level combination 
in this section we are specifically concerned with a within domain level analysis and
with whether planners agree on the relative difficulty of problem instances within a given
domain level combination 
    analytic framework
as discussed in section    we use the planners themselves as judges to determine how
difficult individual problems were  given that most of the competing planners proceeded
by first grounding the problem instance and then by searching the problem space using some
variation on the theme of a relaxed distance estimate  there seems little reason to believe
that the planners would strongly diverge  if a particular instance  or family of instances 
proved difficult for one planner it might be expected that this same collection would be
challenging for all the competitors  to avoid being distracted by the impact of hand coded
control rules we separate the judgements of the fully automated planners from those of the
hand coded planners  for each domain level combination the hypothesis is that planners

figure     f values for the multiple judgments rank correlation tests 

tend to agree about the relative difficulties of the problems presented within that domain
and level 
to explore the extent to which agreement exists we perform rank correlation tests for
agreement in multiple judgements  kanji         we refer to this test as an mrc   in our
experiment the judges are the planners and the subjects are the problem instances  we
perform a distinct mrc for each domain level combination  showing in each case how the
planners ranked the instances in that domain and level  we therefore perform    mrcs for
the fully automated planners  there were    distinct domain level pairs in which the fullyautomated planners competed      for the hand coded planners on the small problems  the
hand coded planners did not compete in the freecell strips or settlers numeric domains 
and    for the hand coded planners on the large problems  amongst which there were no
satellite hardnumeric instances   the results of these tests are shown in figure     in
each test the n planners rank the k problem instances in order of time taken to solve 
unsolved problems create no difficulties as they are pushed to the top end of the ranking 
the mrc determines whether the independent rankings made by the n planners agree  the
test statistic follows the f distribution with  k     k n      degrees of freedom determining
whether the critical value is exceeded 
    results of analysis
the cells in figure    report the f values obtained  and the degrees of freedom used   in
almost all cases the critical value was exceeded and the null hypothesis of non agreement
could be rejected for at least the      level  in just a few cases  those reported in bold
  

fithe  rd international planning competition

font  the critical value was not exceeded and no statistical evidence was therefore found
of agreement between the planners about the difficulty of instances in the corresponding
domain and level  it is interesting to note that the problematic cases are all within the
numeric level  for both fully automated and hand coded planners  furthermore  the case
that comes closest to the critical boundary  the small depots numeric problems  in the
hand coded table  with an f value of       is also within the numeric level 
    interpretation
the results support rejection of the null hypothesis in almost all cases  we can therefore
adopt the alternative hypothesis  observing that there are many cases in which planners do
agree on the relative difficulties of problem instances within a given domain level combination 
during the competition we observed that talplanner is at a disadvantage with respect
to the other hand coded planners  in terms of comparative speed  when running on small
problems  this is probably because of the java virtual machine start up time which becomes
significant relative to actual solution time on small instances  we see the effects of this startup time in the tables  note that  in those domain level combinations in which talplanner
competed  strips  simpletime and time  we see a low level of agreement amongst the
hand coded planners on the small problems  except in the case of the rover domain  
this is not because talplanner disagrees with the other planners about the ranking of
the actual problems  but because the problems are small enough that the variability in
setup time throws noise into the ranking and obscures the true picture of relative problem
difficulty  with the set of large problems we see that this anomaly is removed  the
problems are sufficiently challenging that the java startup time becomes insignificant  and
a high level of agreement over ranking is obtained  interestingly  the hand coded planners
show a consistently high level of agreement about the ranking of rovers problems  the fact
that this does not emerge in the fully automated set may be due to the larger number of
judges in the fully automated category 

   relative scaling behaviours
the mrcs described in section   demonstrate that the planners do agree  as expected 
about the relative difficulty of problem instances within most domain level combinations 
in these cases it is possible to go on to explore the domain and level specific scaling behaviour
of the planners  and we go on to investigate that in this section  we cannot explore the
scaling behaviour of the planners across domains because  as we discussed in section    there
does not seem to be much across the board agreement concerning the relative hardness of
the domains so we would be unlikely to see agreement in multiple judgments across the
domain boundaries 
the ideal basis on which to explore scaling behaviour would be to have a collection
of problems with a canonical scaling of difficulty and then to compare the performance of
planners as they scaled on progressively harder problems within this collection  unfortunately  many factors contribute to making problems hard and these do not affect planners
uniformly  as a result  there is no canonical measurement of problem difficulty in many domains  instead  we must determine the relative difficulty of problems by using the planners
  

filong   fox

themselves as judges  this means that we can only consider the relative scaling behaviours
of planners when the planners agree on the underlying ordering of the difficulty of problems 
thus  we begin by identifying appropriate sets of problems  those on which a given pair
of planners agree about the relative hardness of problems according to our analysis in section    and then proceed to compare the way that each of the planners in the pair scales
as the problems increase in difficulty  the first stage of the analysis considers only the order
that the two planners place on the problems within a set  while the second stage examines
how the performance varies between the two planners as they progress from problem to
problem 
the hypotheses explored in this section are 
null hypothesis  where planners agree about the difficulty of problems
for a given domain level combination  they exhibit the same scaling behaviour 
alternative hypothesis  where planners agree about the difficulty of
problems for a given domain level combination  they demonstrate different scaling behaviours  where the better scaling performance can be identified from the
data set 
this section is concerned with the question of scaling behaviour within problem sets from
specific domain level combinations in which there is already determined to be agreement 
as identified in section   
    analytic framework
in order to test the different scaling properties of the planners we make pairwise comparisons
of performance using only those domains where both planners agreed about the difficulty
of the problems  that is  we use a domain in a comparison if both planners found it hard 
both found it easy or neither found it hard or easy 
to rank the problems in order of difficulty we use the results obtained from the bootstrapping experiment described in section    our rankings are level dependent  so we looked
at scaling within the four problem levels and recorded the results separately  we do not
attempt to combine these results into a single overall conclusion about scaling  we recognize that different planners scale better at some problem levels than at others  and that no
single planner can therefore emerge as scaling best overall 
we only compare two planners if they agreed about difficulty in at least two domains 
this gives us  in each case where a comparison is made  a data set of more than    points 
where the planners did not agree in at least two domains we conclude that there is insufficient agreement between them about what constitutes problem difficulty for it to be
possible to measure their relative scaling behaviours in a meaningful way 
to perform a comparison between two planners we rank the problems in the data set
in order of agreed difficulty and then rank the differences between the performances of the
planners on these problems  we then explore whether the ranking of the differences is correlated with the ranking of the problems according to their difficulty  we use ranks because
we cannot make assumptions about the shapes of the underlying problem distributions or
the functions that truly describe the performances of the planners being compared  so our
results are robust with respect to these factors

faster p  scales better than p    a negative correlation means that p  scales better than
p    a zero  or near zero  correlation means that the scaling behaviour of the two planners

    interpretation
in almost all cases in which a comparison could be performed  a significant difference in
scaling behaviour was found  supporting rejection of the null hypothesis 
because we used only those domains where there was agreement about the relative
difficulty of the problems it is not necessary to restrict our conclusions to be domaindependent  however  we had only a restricted collection of data points at our disposal
so we must be careful how we generalise this picture  on the basis of our analyses we
believe we can make some tentative judgements about how planners are scaling in pairwise
comparisons within the four competition levels 
for the fully automated planners it can be observed informally that there is a high degree of consistency between the scaling behaviours of particular planners across the problem
levels in which they competed  although we cannot draw overall conclusions from the data
set with a high level of confidence we can observe that ff exhibits the best scaling behaviour
in the levels at which it competed and lpg exhibits the best scaling behaviour at the temporal levels  it should be remembered that we did not perform single domain comparisons 
although these might be interesting from the point of view of exploring domain specific scaling behaviour and might produce some interesting results  we felt that these results would
be interesting curiosities rather than anything that could support general conclusions 
the hand coded planners also show a high degree of cross level consistency  it can be
observed informally that tlplan scales much better than shop  across all levels  whereas it
scales only marginally better than talplanner in the strips domains and not significantly
in any other level  talplanner scales better than shop  at all levels in which they both
competed  it can be seen that shop  is not scaling well relative to its competitors  although
it should be remembered that the quality of plans produced by shop  is superior in some
domains 
formally the tables allow us to draw specific conclusions about the relative scaling
behaviours of specific pairs of planners  within specific problem levels  at the      level 

   conclusions
the  rd international planning competition focussed on the issue of temporal planning
and numeric resource handling  the competition was structured around two categories 
  

fithe  rd international planning competition

fully automated and hand coded planning systems  and four main problem levels  strips 
numeric  simpletime and time  there were eight domains  one of which was intended
for the hand coded planners only  the um translog domain   and two solely for the
fully automated planners  the freecell and settlers domains   fourteen competitors took
part  eleven in the fully automated track and three in the hand coded track  the domain
description language used was pddl     an extension of the pddl standard designed for
modelling temporal and resource intensive domains  pddl    is described in another paper
in this issue  fox   long        
we collected a data set of some five and a half thousand data points distributed over
the domains and levels  an initial plotting of these points  in terms of the relative time
and quality performances of the planners in the different domains  revealed a number of
interesting patterns  these suggest some characteristics of the relative performances of the
competitors within the competition domains  these patterns were presented and discussed
at the aips conference with which the final competition events were co located  however 
other patterns  such as those indicating relative performances across domains and those
showing the perceived difficulty of the competition domain level combinations  were invisible in the data presented in this way  this paper presents the results of some detailed
statistical analyses of the competition data  aimed at identifying some of these deeper patterns 
this paper explores three experimental themes  the first theme is aimed at answering
the question  which planner should i buy  this question is concerned with which planner
emerges as the strongest overall performer  rather than which produced the best results
in a particular domain level combination  and it can be asked from the point of view of
both speed and quality criteria  to answer it we performed comparisons  based on the
wilcoxon rank sum matched pairs test  enabling the construction of partial orders on the
competing planners in terms of their time and quality performances in the four levels of
the competition  from these partial orders it can be concluded that  if a potential user
is interested in good behaviour across a broad range of temporal and numeric problems
then lpg  amongst the fully automated planners  and tlplan  amongst the hand coded
planners  are the best choices  of course  if more specialised coverage is required and speed
of solution is paramount then other choices might be made 
the second theme considers the dependence of planner performance on domain structure  we were interested in exploring the extent to which the competing planners agree
about which domain level combinations were hard and which were easy  the analysis we
performed in addressing the first of these issues is a statistical complement to the theoretical
analysis of domain topologies being carried out by hoffmann      b   we considered the
competition domains at all four levels used in the competition  whilst hoffmann considers
only the strips subset of the competition domains  he also considers adl domains  but we
did not use any of these in the competition   it is interesting to note that our findings were
broadly consistent with his conclusions 
the third theme considered the scaling behaviour of the competing planners  we considered two related issues  the extent to which the competing planners agreed on the relative
difficulty of the problem instances within domain level combinations and the extent to
which the planners scaled similarly in domain level combinations where there was agreement  our intentions in pursuing the first issue were to provide an objective scale that
  

filong   fox

would support our efforts to investigate the relative scaling behaviours of the planners  because we found relatively little agreement over the perceived difficulty of problems within
domain level combinations we were able to perform only a restricted comparison of relative
scaling behaviour  however  we consider the results we obtained to make an interesting
contribution to a deeper comparison of planner performances than is available from the raw
domain specific data 
there are many other questions that it would be interesting to be able to answer 
amongst these are questions about the extent to which hand coding of domain knowledge
really benefits a planner and the amount  and value  of effort involved in encoding such
knowledge  this is a pressing question for the community and one that the competition
series might be well suited to try to answer  however  in order to pursue these in future
competitions it will be necessary to carefully design controlled experiments aimed at exploring the precise hypotheses  we have been restricted in this paper to the post hoc analysis
of the competition data  and this has clearly restricted the kinds of questions we have been
able to ask and answer  however  we hope that both the results and the methodologies
presented here will be of interest to the planning community and that they will help to
encourage further scientific evaluation of performance in the field

fithe  rd international planning competition

appendix a  problem domains
a   the first international planning competition
the first competition used the following domains 
 logistics a transportation problem involving aircraft and trucks  with trucks constrained to movement within cities and aircraft constrained to movement between
 inter city  airports  this domain allows considerable parallelism 
 mystery a transportation domain with vehicles having limited capacity and consuming limited stocks of fuel 
 mprime a variant of the mystery domain in which it is also possible to pipe fuel
between locations in order to allow vehicles to have different movement options 
 grid a problem in which a single robot moves between locations on a grid shaped
map  locations may be locked and there are keys that must be collected to gain access
to these locations  the objectives of the problem instances involve transporting the
keys to particular locations 
 gripper a simple domain  originally designed to demonstrate the limitations of
graphplan  in which a collection of identical balls must be transported by a robot
with two grippers from one room to an adjacent room 
 movie a simple domain intended to explore use of conditional effects  a collection
of snacks must be assembled prior to rewinding a video and then watching the movie 
 assembly a complex adl domain with a challenging use of quantified and conditional
effects 
a   the second international planning competition
the second competition introduced several new domains 
 blocks the classic blocks world problem  encoded without an explicit reference to a
gripper  this domain has significant goal interaction 
 job schedule a problem involving the machining of parts  this problem exercises
the adl features involving conditional and quantified effects  although it is less complex than the assembly domain 
 freecell this is the classic solitaire card game that is widely available as a computer
game  the encoding as a strips domain represents a larger problem than most
previous benchmarks and includes the awkward addition of an encoded set of integers 
 miconics elevator this domain was inspired by the problem of planning an efficient call sequence for an elevator car travelling between floors of a large building 
there were several variants  with the most complex including numeric preconditions
as well as purely logical constraints  an adl version offered complex preconditions
involving several different connectives and a strips version offered a relatively simple
transportation problem

in addition  the logistics domain was reused to provide some calibration of performance
in comparison with the first competition 
a   the third international planning competition
a     the depots domain
the domain consists of actions to load and unload trucks  using hoists that are available at
fixed locations  the loads are all crates that can be stacked and unstacked onto a fixed set
of pallets at the locations  the trucks do not hold crates in a particular order  so they can
act like a table in the blocks domain  allowing crates to be reordered 
this domain was devised with the foremost intention of testing strips planners  the
second competition had demonstrated that the logistics domain was no longer a serious
challenge  and that  for planners using hand coded controls  the blocks domain was also
solved  for fully automated planners the blocks domain still represents a challenge  although the second competition showed that some planners can solve quite large problems
 up to twenty blocks  with reasonably efficient plans within a few minutes  however  performance can vary widely and there are problems in this range that can prove unsolvable
for these planners  we wanted to see whether the performance that had been achieved in
these domains could be successfully brought together in one domain  we were interested
to see for fully automated planners  where the interaction between the problems creates an
additional family of choice points in addition to those that appear in the transportation and
the block tower construction sub problems  we were also interested to see this for handcoded planners where the rules for each of the sub problems are obviously well understood 
but it is not obvious whether the rules can be combined into a single collection without any
problems of interaction 
the metric version of the domain adds weight attributes to the crates and weight capacities to the trucks  in addition  trucks consume fuel in their travels and the plans must
minimise fuel use  fuel use is constant and not dependent on the locations  fuel is also consumed in lifting crates  so there is a tradeoff to be considered when crates must be restacked
at a location  either a truck can be brought in to act as a table or more complex lifting
and stacking can be performed using the locally available pallets as transfer space 
the temporal versions allow for concurrent activities of the trucks and the hoists  at all
locations   the full temporal variant makes the time for driving dependent on the truck and
the distance between the locations  and makes the time to load or unload a crate dependent
on the weight of the crate and the power of the hoist  the objective in both is to minimise
make span  the overall duration of the plan  
a     the driverlog domain
this domain has drivers that can walk between locations and trucks that can drive between
locations  walking requires traversal of different paths from those used for driving  and
there is always one intermediate location on a footpath between two road junctions  the
trucks can be loaded or unloaded with packages  with or without a driver present  and
the objective is to transport packages between locations  ending up with a subset of the
packages  the trucks and the drivers at specified destinations 
  

fithe  rd international planning competition

this domain was produced to explore the power of strips solutions to transportation
problems when the transportation involves a sub problem of acquiring a driver  the problem
is one that offers significant opportunity for concurrency in the use of drivers and vehicles 
so we were also interested to see how the temporal variants were handled 
the metric variant of the domain adds costs for walking and driving and problem instances required that the planner optimise some linear combination of the total walking
cost and the total driving cost 
the full temporal variant makes time spent driving or walking between locations dependent on the path being traversed  but other durations are only dependent on the actions
 as with the simple temporal version   in both of these variants the plan quality depends
on the make span 
an additional variant  the hard numeric variant  complicates the cost of driving by
making it dependent on the load being carried  each additional package added to a truck
increases the fuel consumption rate of the truck by its current value  making the consumption increase as a quadratic function of the load 
a     the zeno travel domain
this domain has actions to embark and disembark passengers onto aircraft that can fly
at two alternative speeds between locations  the strips variant is rather uninteresting
because the two speeds do not offer meaningful alternatives  in the metric variant the
planes consume fuel at different rates according to the speed of travel  two alternatives 
and distances between locations vary  problem instances require plans to minimise some
linear combination of time and fuel use 
the temporal versions are closer to the original zeno problem  they involve durations
for the different means of travel and different levels of fuel consumption  in contrast to
the original zeno problem the fuel consumption is not described by a continuous function 
but by discrete step functions applied at the end points of durative actions  the fact that
the fuel in an aircraft cannot be affected by multiple different concurrent actions and its
value is not relevant to satisfying the precondition of any actions that could begin during
the continuous consumption or replenishment of fuel means a discrete model of fuel use is
sufficient  demanding less expressive power of the planners that use the model 
a     the satellite domain
the satellite domain was developed following discussions with david e  smith and jeremy
franks at nasa ames research center  it is intended to be a first model of the satellite
observation scheduling problem  the full problem involves using one or more satellites to
make observations  collecting data and downlinking the data to a ground station  the
satellites are equipped with different  possibly overlapping  collections of instruments  each
with different characteristics in terms of appropriate calibration targets  data productions 
energy consumption and requirements for warming up and cooling down  the satellites
can be pointed at different targets by slewing them between different attitudes  there
can be constraints on which targets are accessible to different satellites due to occlusion
and slewing capabilities  instruments generate data that must be stored on the satellite
and subsequently downlinked when a window of communication opportunity opens with a
  

filong   fox

ground station  communication windows are fixed  data takes time to downlink and it
could be impossible to downlink an entire satellite store in a given time frame  so downlinks
must be scheduled around the storage capacity  the production of data by observations and
the opportunities to downlink data as they arise  in the real problem there are additional
difficulties such as the management of energy and the use of solar power and the maintenance of operational temperatures during periods in shadow  in order to make the problem
accessible to the planners in the competition  given the time scales for encoding the domain 
writing a problem generator and testing competing planners  several important features of
the real problem are simplified  perhaps most important of these is that in the real problem
targets are only visible during particular time windows  although the elimination of the
problem of downlinking data is also a significant simplification  representing the windows
of opportunity is possible in pddl     but not entirely straight forward and this remains an
area in which there is need for development  management of power and temperature were
also simplified away 
the strips version of the problem involves deciding on the most efficient covering of the
observations given the satellite capabilities  this is an interesting combinatorial problem if
the satellites are assumed to be free to operate concurrently  in a graphplan style parallel
activity   but otherwise the problem offers few interesting choice points  the strips version
was based on an earlier satellite domain contributed by patrik haslum 
the metric version of the problem introduces data capacities into the satellites and fuel
use in slewing between targets  the plans are expected to minimize fuel use in obtaining
the data  this problem combines a constrained bin packing problem  getting the data into
the limited stores of the satellites  subject to the constraints that only certain satellites are
equipped to obtain certain data  with a kind of route planning problem  finding fuel efficient
paths between targets while also considering the combined costs of the fuel consumption by
all of the satellites  
the temporal versions introduce duration and make concurrency important  the full
temporal problem includes different slew times between different pairs of targets  these
problems both involve minimising make span times for the data acquisition  a complex
version of the domain combines the temporal and metric features so that planners are
required to manage the problem of storing different sized data blocks in limited capacity
satellite data stores 
a further variant of the satellite domain  called the hardnumeric version  represents
an important departure from traditional planning problems  the logical goals describing
the intended final state are trivial  either empty or a few simple final positions for the
satellites   but the metric by which the plans are declared to be evaluated is the quantity
of data collected  the problem is interesting because a null  or nearly null  plan will solve
all the instances  but the quality of these plans will be zero  to produce a good plan it is
necessary to ensure that the satellites are used to collect data and this  in turn  requires
that the planner constructs reasonable data collection goals  this is a hard problem for
most current planners  particularly the fully automated planning systems  nevertheless 
it is a realistic demand for many problems that a planner might be required to face  it is
not uncommon for the specific final state to be less important than the effects of the actions
carried out in reaching it 
  

fithe  rd international planning competition

a     the rovers domain
the rovers domain was constructed as a simplified representation of the problem that
confronts the nasa mars exploration rover missions launched in       the mars science
laboratory mission planned for      and other similar missions that are expected as part of
the esa aurora project  the strips version of the problem involves planning for several
rovers  equipped with different  but possibly overlapping  sets of equipment to traverse a
planet surface  the rovers must travel between waypoints gathering data and transmitting
it back to a lander  the traversal is complicated by the fact that certain rovers are restricted
to travelling over certain terrain types and this makes particular routes impassable to some
of the rovers  data transmission is also constrained by the visibility of the lander from the
waypoints 
the metric version of the domain introduces an energy cost associated with actions and
an action allowing rovers to recharge  provided they are in the sun  the problems sought
solutions that minimised numbers of recharges  so the use of energy was required to be as
efficient as possible 
in the metric temporal variant the domain involves both energy and time management 
although the instances require planners to optimise total duration  this demand implies
the need for efficient energy use  since recharging is an action that consumes a considerable
amount of time and  in our model  requires the recharging rover to remain in one place
during the period of recharging  the opportunity for careful division of labour between the
rovers makes both temporal variants complex and interesting problems 
a     the settlers domain
this domain exists only as a metric problem  the problem is inspired by the multitude of
computer games that involve managing resources  accumulating raw resources and slowly
combining them into more and more advanced processing plants and other structures to
achieve more sophisticated objectives  the problem was proposed by patrik haslum  an
interesting difficulty that the problem presents is that it is a problem that involves constructing new objects out of resources  this is not easily represented in pddl     in fact 
the only way to capture the domain in pddl    is to name the objects that could be constructed and to give them an attribute indicating whether or not they have actually been
constructed  this leads to a very cumbersome encoding and  moreover  represents a particular problem for planners that ground actions prior to planning  since a multitude of
potential objects must be considered in the process  leading to a huge collection of actions 
many of these actions are uninterestingly different  since the specific choice of names for
objects that are created in solving an instance is clearly irrelevant  but each alternative is
constructed and considered in the planning process 
a     the um translog   domain
the um translog    wu   nau        domain was used only for the hand coded planners
and only an incomplete set of results was collected due to time constraints at the conclusion
of the testing period  this domain is a significant challenge because of its size and should be
seen as a useful benchmark problem for fully automated planners because of the challenges
in both grounding and searching a domain with so many action schemas

appendix b  the competitors
b   the fully automated planners
there were eleven competitors in this category  representing at least four distinct planning paradigms  forward search  model checking  local search and partial order planning  
fully automated planners accept the pddl    specifications of domain  initial state and
goal and compute solutions solely on the basis of these specifications  no additional control
knowledge or guidance is supplied  fully automated planners therefore depend on sophisticated search control heuristics and the efficient storage of alternative search branches  a
popular current approach to search control is to make use of variants of the relaxed plan
idea originally proposed by mcdermott        and subsequently exploited by bonet and
geffner        and hoffmann        
ixtet  laborie   ghallab        entered as a fully automated planner  but in retrospect
it might have been better classified as a hand coded planner  the ability to hand code
domain representations might have alleviated some of the problems that arose in making
the competition domains accessible to ixtet  ixtet does not currently accept domains or
problems in pddl format  so it was necessary to translate the competition domains into
its own representation language  no automatic translator between pddl and the ixtet
input language yet exists and it is not clear that such a translation can be automated 
furthermore  the plan representation of ixtet is more general than that insisted upon
for use in the competition but this was not an advantage given the need to automate the
plan validation process  in fact  several plans produced by ixtet could not be validated 
the combination of these difficulties made it impossible to offer any real insights into the
performance of ixtet on the competition domains  nevertheless  we were pleased that an
attempt was made to enter ixtet  it is important that the competition should not cause
a fracture between the members of the research community who are interested in entering
and those who have long established alternative planning technology that cannot be easily
reengineered to meet the assumptions underlying the competition 
b     ff
ff has been an extremely successful and influential planner since       hoffmann   nebel 
       it is based on forward state space search using relaxed plans to give heuristic guidance
in its choice between possible steps through the space  hoffmann extended the original ff
system  hoffmann      a  to include a treatment of metric domains by relaxing the metric
dimensions of the problem as well as the logical dimensions 
b     ixtet
ixtet  laborie   ghallab        is well known for having been one of the first planners to
reason about time and resource intensive domains  the version that participated in parts
of the competition is a reimplementation of the original system described by ghallab and
laruelle  ghallab   laruelle         as mentioned above  ixtet experienced a number of
difficulties in the competition making it difficult to evaluate its performance  however  seen
in the broader context of planning research and application ixtet has made many important
contributions to the development of temporal and resource intensive planning approaches
  

fithe  rd international planning competition

and  with its powerful plan representation language  is suited to certain applications for
which the simplified plan representation used in the competition is inadequate 
b     lpg
lpg  gerevini et al         is based on a local search strategy applied to plan graphs  blum
  furst         the approach has been generalised to accommodate both metric and
temporal structure  making it a powerful and flexible planner  the use of local search
allows the planner to be configured to trade off time and plan quality  indeed  the planner
exhibits any time behaviour in the sense that plans can be reported as they are found and 
if the search is allowed to run longer  better quality plans might be discovered 
b     mips
mips  edelkamp        uses a variety of techniques  but at the core is a model checker
based on ordered binary decision diagrams  obdds   which is used to generate reachable
states  the planner uses a powerful technique to compress state representations in order
to make the obdds more compact  exhaustive search of the state space is impractical in
large problems and mips uses a heuristic evaluation function based on relaxed plans in order
to restrict the space of explored states  mips tackles concurrency in temporal planning by
lifting partial orders from the totally ordered plans that are produced by its forward search 
mips has also been extended to manage metric quantities  also using a relaxation heuristic
to predict the behaviours of metric quantities 
b     sapa
sapa  do   kambhampati        is a forward search planner using a relaxed temporal
plan heuristic  based on the use of a relaxed tgp style  smith   weld        plan graph 
to guide its search  the heuristic is supplemented with a heuristic estimate of resource
usage allowing the planner to handle metric quantities  temporal structure is managed
using delayed effects  so that  when a durative action is executed  its end effects are queued
in an event queue  pending application when time is advanced to the point at which they
are triggered  the focus of sapa development has been in the management of metric and
temporal structure  sapa did not attempt to compete in strips or simpletime problems 
but performed well in the more complex problems 
b     semsyn
semsyn  parker        is a graphplan based planner  with extensions to handle metric and
adl features  in general  graphplan based approaches have  with the exception of lpg 
proven unequal to the challenge of scaling to meet the latest sets of benchmark problems 
this suggests that the search strategy of graphplan must be abandoned if large problems
are to be solved  but that the underlying plan graph structure need not be a source of
scaling problems  in fact ff  vhpop  sapa and lpg all use plan graph structures in the
planning process  
  

filong   fox

b     simplanner
simplanner  onainda  sapena  sebastia    marzal        is a forward search planner
using a relaxed plan heuristic  the heuristic evaluation uses separate relaxed plans for each
of the top level goals  combining them to identify a useful first action to apply from the
current state  this variant on the idea of relaxed plans appears to represent a reinforcement
of the notion of helpful actions developed in ff  where actions that are selected in the first
layer of a relaxed graphplan style plan are favoured as appropriate candidates for the next
step in a plan 
b     stella
stella  sebastia  onainda    marzal        uses a forward heuristic search architecture 
but with the modification that plans are built using landmarks  porteous  sebastia   
hoffmann         the idea is to identify key states in the path of a plan before planning
begins and then to use these as stepping stones to progress from the initial state to the
goal state 
b     tp 
tp   haslum   geffner        is a development of the hsp  bonet et al         planning
approach  which was one of the first of the current generation of rather successful heuristic
state space search planners based on relaxed plan heuristics  tp  extends the use of the
heuristic to manage temporal plan structure  the planner is intended to find optimal
plans  although  for minor technical reasons  some of the plans it produces are slightly suboptimal   by using an admissible heuristic  and this requires a far greater search effort than
in planners constructing plans that are merely heuristically good 
b      tpsys
tpsys  garrido  onainda    barber        garrido  fox    long        is a temporal
planner based on graphplan  there are technical differences between tpsys and tgp  smith
  weld         but the central use of a temporal plan graph is similar  using the graph
to represent the passage of time  with actions having associated durations  as with other
graphplan based approaches  the search machinery appears to scale badly 
b      vhpop
partial order planners have suffered a period of being unfashionable  supplanted by graphplan and  more recently  relaxed plan based heuristic state space search planners  vhpop  younes   simmons        represents an interesting indication that partial order
planning is far from defunct  in particular  the partial order framework offers a powerful way to handle temporal constraints  in vhpop a simple temporal network is used to
manage the temporal constraints between the end points of durative actions and this allows
the planner to successfully treat concurrency and other features of temporal plan structure 
within the framework of a partial order planner  vhpop makes use of plan graph distance
estimates to guide its search

b   the hand coded planners
there were three entrants in the category of planners requiring hand coded control knowledge  as in the      competition the teams competing with these planners were allowed
time to reformulate domain descriptions to include domain specific control knowledge  as
the results show  control knowledge can dramatically improve planner performance  however  it is difficult to assess the cost effectiveness of hand coding control knowledge  fahiem
bacchus        observed the need to quantify the time and effort required to identify and
encode useful control knowledge in order to be better able to judge the trade off between
the fully automated and hand coded approaches  however  it is very difficult to measure
the effort involved  in principle it should be possible to bound the time allowed for domain
reformulation  but then differences in team sizes and in the experience of team members
become very important in comparing what has been achieved by different participants  the
third competition  like those before it  did not explore these factors  so it is impossible to
make judgements about the relative effectiveness of the solutions to these problems offered
by each of the hand coded planning systems  this remains a very important open issue for
future competitions to address 
b     shop 
shop   nau  au  ilghami  kuter  murdoch  wu    yaman        is a hierarchical task
network  htn  planner  like most other htn planners  shop  allows tasks and subtasks
to be partially ordered  thus plans may interleave subtasks from different tasks during
expansion of tasks  however  unlike most other htn planners  shop  generates the steps
of each plan in the same order that those steps will later be executed and it can therefore
maintain a representation of the current state at each stage in the planning process  this
makes it much easier to incorporate substantial expressive power into the htns used by
shop   for example  they might include axioms  mixed symbolic and numeric computation 
or even calls to external programs 
b     talplanner
the most successful of the hand coded planners in       talplanner  kvarnstrom  
magnusson        uses a temporal action logic as a language for describing planning domains
and uses control rules that guide the planner in making intelligent choices while constructing
plans in a forward search  an idea originally developed in tlplan  the rules can act to
prune away search branches that are predicted  by the human encoding the rules  to lead
to no solutions  using this idea  it is possible to arrive at a collection of rules that  by
examination of a given state  can guide the planner to choose actions so effectively that
virtually no search is required at all 
b     tlplan
tlplan  bacchus   kabanza        also uses a temporal logic language to support the
construction of control rules to guide plan search  tlplan preceded talplanner in its
use of this idea  tlplan adopts a slightly different approach to the management of tem  

filong   fox

poral structure than talplanner  and is also capable of handling metric quantities  the
extensions of tlplan that allow it to handle time are described by bacchus and ady

appendix c  statistical techniques
the analysis conducted in this paper makes use of several standard statistical tests  these
are the wilcoxon matched pairs rank sum test  the proportion test  the matched pairs t test 
spearmans rank correlation test and the rank correlation test for agreement in multiple
judgements  for the benefit of readers who are unfamiliar with these tests  we briefly
summarise them here  this appendix was constructed using gopal k  kanjis     statistical
tests        
c   the proportion test
this test is also known as the binomial distribution test  the test is used to consider the
proportion of a sample for which a particular qualitative observation has been made  for
example  the proportion of rolls of a die that have come up    the test examines how far
from the expected proportion is the observed proportion  given an assumed probability for
the observation  in its use in this paper  we adopt a null hypothesis that two planners
should win with equal likelihood and test the proportion of observed wins for one planner
against this hypothesis  if the deviation of observed proportion from expected proportion
is sufficiently high  then the null hypothesis can be rejected 
c   the t test
the t test is a parametric test  it is founded on an assumption that the underlying population from which the samples are drawn is nearly normally distributed  it is reasonably
robust to failures in this assumption  but should be treated with caution as the true distribution deviates from normal  the test considers means of two samples and tests the
null hypothesis that the two samples are drawn from populations with the same mean 
variants are available according to what is known about variance in the underlying populations  the t test is a more conservative version of the z test  which relies on the effect
confirmed by the central limit theorem that  for large samples  the sampling ditribution
of the mean is normal  the t test can be applied with smaller samples  compensating for
the distortion of the distribution that this creates  in this paper  we use a variant of the
t test in which observations are drawn in matched pairs  each element of a pair is a test
result conducted under close to identical circumstances  but for a different test subject  in
this case  a different planner  
for n pairs of observations  where di is the difference for pair i and d is the mean
difference  the variance  s  of the differences is given by 
 

s  

n
x
 di  d  
i  

n 

if x  and x  are the means of the samples from each of the two populations  then the
statistic is 
x   x 

t 
s  n
with n    degrees of freedom

c   the wilcoxon matched pairs rank sum test
the use of ranks releases statistical tests from the parametric assumptions about underlying
distributions by replacing actual observed values with their rank within the ordered set of
observed values  the wilcoxon matched pairs test is analogous to the matched pairs t test 
but uses the sum of the ranks of the values associated with each of the two test subjects 
the pairs are ordered according to the absolute values of their differences and then the sum
of the ranks of the positive values is compared with the sum of the ranks of the negative
values  if the two subjects exhibit no particular pattern in their relative behaviours then
the positive and negative values should be distributed roughly evenly through the ranks and
thus the rank sums should be approximately equal  a distortion between the rank sums
indicates that one or other subject has a consistently superior performance over the other 
the test is defined as follows  given a collection of n pairs of data items  the differences
between the pairs are found and ranked according to absolute magnitude  the sum of the
ranks is then formed for the negative and positive differences separately  t is the smaller
of these two rank sums  for sufficiently large samples the following value is approximately
normally distributed 
n n          t
p
n n       n        
c   spearmans rank correlation test
this is a test for correlation between a sequence of pairs of values  using ranks eliminates
the sensitivity of the correlation test to the function linking the pairs of values  in particular 
the standard correlation test is used to find linear relations between test pairs  but the rank
correlation test is not restricted in this way 
given n pairs of observations   xi   yi    the xi values are assigned a rank value and 
separately  the yi values are assigned a rank  for each pair  xi   yi    the corresponding
difference  di between the xi and yi ranks is found  the value r is 
r 

n
x

d i

i  

for large samples the test statistic is then 
z 

 r  n n     

n n      n   

which is approximately normally distributed 
c   rank correlation test for agreement in multiple judgements
this tests the significance of the correlation between n series of rank numbers  assigned by
n judges to k subjects  the n judges give rank numbers to the k subjects and we compute 
s 

nk k
