abstract
more than fifty years of research in molecular biology have demonstrated that the ability of
small and large molecules to interact with one another and propagate the cellular processes in the
living cell lies in the ability of these molecules to assume and switch between specific structures
under physiological conditions  elucidating biomolecular structure and dynamics at equilibrium
is therefore fundamental to furthering our understanding of biological function  molecular mechanisms in the cell  our own biology  disease  and disease treatments  by now  there is a wealth
of methods designed to elucidate biomolecular structure and dynamics contributed from diverse
scientific communities  in this survey  we focus on recent methods contributed from the robotics
community that promise to address outstanding challenges regarding the disparate length and time
scales that characterize dynamic molecular processes in the cell  in particular  we survey roboticsinspired methods designed to obtain efficient representations of structure spaces of molecules in isolation or in assemblies for the purpose of characterizing equilibrium structure and dynamics  while
an exhaustive review is an impossible endeavor  this survey balances the description of important
algorithmic contributions with a critical discussion of outstanding computational challenges  the
objective is to spur further research to address outstanding challenges in modeling equilibrium
biomolecular structure and dynamics 

   introduction
the way in which the chain of amino acid units in a protein molecule is coiled and folded in space
has been worked out for the first time  the protein is myoglobin  the molecule of which contains
      atoms  this is how john kendrew began his feature article in scientific american in      
reporting what was the first atomistic model of a protein structure  obtained via x ray crystallography  kendrew  dickerson  strandberg  hart  davies  phillips    shore         this model is drawn
in various graphical representations in figure    for the pioneering work on resolving structures of
globular proteins  kendrew and perutz were awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in       this was
the very same year watson  crick  and wilkins shared the nobel prize in physiology or medicine
for using x ray crystallography data to determine the helical structure of dna 
   for the purpose of this survey  we will distinguish between structure and conformation  structure will refer to a
specific placement of the atoms that comprise a biomolecule in r    the concept of conformation is defined in

the ability to visualize structures of biomolecules in atomistic detail was a shot in the arm to
molecular biology and marked the beginning of a revolution in molecular structural biology  a race
soon ensued across wet laboratories to determine three dimensional   d  structures assumed by proteins and other biomolecules under physiological conditions  since those early days  the set of protein structures resolved in the wet laboratory  beginning with myoglobin and lysozyme  kendrew

further pioneering work by anfinsen  which earned him the nobel prize in chemistry in      
demonstrated that the ability of a protein to carry out its biological function is dependent on its
ability to fold onto a specific  d structure reversibly  anfinsen         the anfinsen experiments
led to the view that a folded structure corresponds to the global minimum of an underlying energy
surface  they also showed that the information needed for a protein to assume its  d  biologicallyactive structure is largely encoded in its amino acid sequence  since then  any study of biomolecular
function has to consider the role of both sequence and structure  fersht        
figure   a   which shows the surface of the biologically active structure of the myoglobin protein  exposes a central cavity that allows binding of the heme group to myoglobin  figure   b 
traces the amino acid chain that makes up myoglobin and additionally draws the heavy atoms constituting each amino acid in this protein  these simple images illustrate two important points  first 
that structure plays a central role in function  specifically  complementary geometric and physicochemical features of  d structures of molecules are key to stable molecular interactions   boehr  
wright         second  that the ability of the amino acid chain to fold onto itself makes protein
structures complex  understanding how and what biologically active structure a biomolecule assumes in the cell is key not only to elucidating molecular mechanisms in the healthy and diseased
cell  but also determining how to address the abnormal role of a biomolecule in such mechanisms
in order to treat disease  in particular  research has shown that many abnormalities involve proteins with aberrant biological function  soto        uversky        fernandez medarde   santos

dynamic personality of biomolecules is not taken into account  jenzler wildman   kern        
while x ray models of biomolecular structures seem to suggest rigid molecules with atoms frozen
in space  an increasing number of wet laboratory  theoretical  and computational studies have shown
that biomolecules are systems of particles in perpetual motion  indeed  feynman taught early about
the jiggling and wiggling of atoms  feynman  leighton    sands         cooper and others later
posited that the inherent dynamics of biomolecules could be explained under a general  theoretical
treatment of molecules as thermodynamic systems striving towards their equilibrium  lowest freeenergy state  cooper         thus  the inherent dynamics of biomolecules could be explained
using fundamental physics principles  a statistical mechanics formulation also revealed the inherent
uncertainty at any given time about the particular state of a molecule  cooper        
the dynamics of molecular systems was investigated around the same time the first experimental
models of protein structures were emerging  in       verlet simulated the dynamics of argon and
demonstrated that such simulations were able to reproduce equilibrium properties  verlet        
application of the verlet algorithm for simulating protein dynamics would have to wait for one
more decade  in       mccammon and karplus reported on a     picosecond long trajectory showing in vacuum  atomistic fluctuations of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor around its folded 
active structure  the latter had already been obtained via wet laboratory techniques   mccammon

gelin    karplus         advancements in wet laboratory techniques  which had spewed about
a dozen models of biologically active protein structures by the late   s  facilitated a revolution in
computational structural biology  the pioneering algorithmic work of verlet  karplus  mccammon 
levitt  warshel  and lifson  for which karplus  levitt  and warshel shared the      nobel prize
in chemistry  provided the earliest frameworks for computational treatments of biomolecules as a
means to investigate equilibrium structure and dynamics  fersht        
since those early days  advances in wet laboratory techniques have proceeded hand in hand with
advancements in computational techniques  often feeding off each other  the advent of nmr for
structure determination provided evidence of the ability of biomolecules to fluctuate between different structures even at equilibrium  kay               figure   c  shows  in addition to the x ray
structure of myoglobin and its bound heme group  twelve models obtained via nmr  showcasing
the intrinsic flexibility of this important biomolecule and its molecular partner in the cell  nowadays  wet laboratory techniques  such as nmr and cryo electron microscopy  cryo em  can resolve equilibrium structures and quantify equilibrium dynamics  for example  nmr has been used
to identify well populated intermediate structures along a transition  aden   wolf watz        
hybrid techniques that combine nmr relaxation measurements with x ray models derived from
room temperature crystallographic  single molecule spectroscopy techniques that tune optical radiation to observe one molecule  and others can now elucidate fast and slow dynamic processes lasting

in principle  a full account of the equilibrium dynamics of a biomolecule requires a comprehensive characterization of both the structure space available to the biomolecule at equilibrium as well
as the underlying energy surface that governs accessibility of structures and transitions between
structures at equilibrium  this remains challenging to do via md and mc based frameworks  and
algorithmic enhancements of the classic md and mc frameworks essentially aim to enhance their
sampling of the structure space of a biomolecule  a review of state of the art enhancements can be
found in the work of maximova et al         
in this survey paper  we focus instead on emerging contributions from the robotics community
on how to enhance sampling with complementary algorithmic strategies  specifically  we review
robotics inspired methods designed to model structural excursions of a biomolecule at equilibrium
by building conceptually over techniques designed originally for robot motion planning  these
methods have now reached a crucial stage  they have been shown applicable to characterization of
diverse molecular mechanisms in computational structural biology  such as protein ligand binding 
folding and unfolding of peptides  proteins  and rna molecules  and transitions of small peptides
and large proteins between thermodynamically stable and semi stable structural states  as this survey shows  these methods are capable of addressing challenging computational issues posed in each
of these application settings  but they have yet to be widely adopted by the computational biology
community at large  for various reasons  some of which are discussed in this survey  these methods
are seen as providing an efficient but less detailed and less accurate characterization of biomolecular equilibrium structure and dynamics  this survey provides a critical review of robotics inspired
methods and lays out outstanding issues that need to be addressed for these methods to be considered reliable tools and be widely adopted for modeling biomolecular structure and dynamics

geometry is provided in section    section   then introduces the main classes of problems in
biomolecular modeling addressed with robotics inspired methods  summarizes the robot motion
planning frameworks over which such methods build  and concludes with a brief description of
challenges faced by robotics inspired methods in the context of biomolecular modeling  section

of several prospects for future research 

   background
the structural excursions that regulate the recognition events in which a biomolecule participates in
the cell can be understood via a theoretical treatment of biomolecules as thermodynamic systems
hopping between energetic states  these hops are fundamentally the result of concerted motions
of the atoms that make up a biomolecule  in any physical system  constitutive particles are in a
state of perpetual motion  fuelled by thermal excitation  all the while subjecting one another to
physical forces  cooper         these forces cumulatively drive a molecular system toward lowerenergy states  while thermal excitations kick them off locally optimal states  providing sufficient
randomness to allow the entire system undergo a biased exploration of its structure space 
in the following we first summarize current knowledge on atomic forces and biomolecular energy functions that are employed in computational treatments of biomolecular structure and dynamics  the rest of this section provides details on biomolecular geometry  showing how biomolecules
can be treated mechanistically as modular systems composed of numerous  heterogeneous components for the purpose of characterizing their equilibrium structure and dynamics in silico 
    biomolecular energetics  molecular mechanics
the physical interactions among the particles that make up a molecular system can in principle be
measured via quantum mechanics  qm  methods  qm methods can carry out detailed and accurate
electronic structure calculations but are currently limited in their applicability to molecular systems
composed of no more than a few hundred atoms  khaliullin  vandevondele    hutter         instead  molecular mechanics  mm  methods are now the methods of choice to evaluate structures
of macromolecules  such as proteins  rna  dna  and other large molecular systems comprised of
several molecules 
though it was long known that atoms in a molecule subject one another to physical forces  such
as coulomb forces and others  it was the work of levitt and warshel in the lifson laboratory at the
weizmann institute of science that propelled the design of consistent  now known as mm  energy
functions for molecules  lifson argued that it should be possible to come up with a small number of
consistent  transferable parameters that do not depend on the local environment of an atom and allow
analyzing the energetics of small crystalline molecules  lifson   warshel         kendrew realized
that such consistent energy functions could be used to conduct energetic evaluations on different
placements  that is  structures  of the atoms comprising proteins and nucleic acids  levitt and
lifson operationalized this realization to conduct energy refinements of protein structures  levitt

mm energy functions have now become more detailed and accurate  but they are still estimates
of the true potential energy of a molecule  summing up the possible  physical interactions between
atoms in a molecule  research on designing mm energy functions is active  and there are now many
different functions offered from different computational chemistry labs across the world  these
functions largely follow a common functional form  and categorize pairwise atomic interactions
into local and non local interactions  it should be noted that more accurate energy functions are
available that consider n particle interactions  but these are more computationally expensive and
not widely adopted  clementi         local interactions concern modeling forces due to bonds 
bond angles  and the periodicity of dihedral torsion angles  non local interactions are divided into
electrostatic  measured through the coulomb potential  and van der waals  measured through the
lennard jones  lj  potential  interactions  these different types of interactions are typically
linearly combined together  each with its own weight  to associate a potential energy value with a
particular placement of atoms in a given molecular structure

can be found in the work of ponder and case         other functions  known as knowledge based

examples of knowledge based functions 
whether physics based or knowledge based  or hybrid   all current molecular energy functions
are models and  as such  they contain inherent errors that need to be taken into account when modeling biomolecular structure and dynamics  hornak et al          in addition  in all such functions  despite the specific functional form  the most computationally expensive terms are the lj
and coulomb terms due to the summation over pairs of atoms  these terms are also the ones that
are most sensitive to small atomic motions  in particular  the      functional form of the lj term
provides great complexity and non linearity to the energy surface that one can associate with the
structure space of a biomolecule  it is quite common to reduce the total energy of a structure by
a few hundred calories solely due to improvements in the lj term from imperceptible changes in
atomic positions  moreover  small atomic displacements can lower the value of one term while
increasing that of another in the energy function  from an optimization point of view  the terms that
are linearly combined in an energy function are essentially conflicting optimization objectives  in
computational biology  this issue is known as frustration and results in rugged or rough energy
surfaces  that is  rich in local minima   in the broader ai community  such surfaces would be referred to as multi modal  while true biomolecular energy surfaces are not overly rugged  known

    the biomolecular energy surface
equilibrium biomolecular dynamics can be visualized as structural excursions on the energy surface  the picture that emerges for proteins is that of a funnel like  multidimensional energy surface  onuchic et al         dill   chan         projecting the surface onto few coordinates that
capture relevant features of the different structures would allow summarizing and thus visualizing
the energy surface in terms of a landscape  onuchic   wolynes        
the energy landscape shown in two different camera views in figure   illustrates protein energy
landscapes expected to be reconstructed in silico  horizontal cross sections of the landscape every
de units apart correspond to the different energetic states  the cross sections go down in width as
energy decreases  there are fewer options to place atoms in a molecule as potential energy gets lower
without incurring energetic costs greater than de  the width of a cross section  or the structural
diversity of an energetic state  is captured in the notion of entropy  thermodynamically stable states
are those with low free energy f   measured as f   hei  t  s  where hei is the average potential
energy over structures grouped together in the state  t is temperature  and s is entropy 
the first visual illustration  proposed by dill and chan         highlighted the main features
expected of true protein energy landscapes  a single  deep and wide basin corresponding to the
thermodynamically stable state and few other shallower  narrower basins corresponding to metastable states serving as possible kinetic traps  the landscape shown in figure   a  is a synthetic
one that is closer to the landscapes corresponding to existing mm energy functions  the landscape
is not smooth but rather rich in local minima  in other words  the landscape is highly rugged or
rough  a different camera view in figure   b  emphasizes the presence of multiple  similarly deep
and wide basins among which current energy functions cannot further distinguish for the purpose of
predicting the most stable state via energetic based arguments  given the inherent errors  structurefunction arguments cannot depend on small energetic differences 
the energy landscape view was instrumental in linking molecular structure  dynamics  and function  viewing proteins and other biomolecules in terms of their energy landscapes gave rise to better
understanding folding and binding as diffusion like processes and not as a series of sequential  deterministic events  under the new  landscape view  baldwin         biomolecules can reach their most
stable state at equilibrium by tumbling down the energy landscape along multiple routes  bryngelson   wolynes        bryngelson  onuchic  socci    wolynes        onuchic   wolynes        
in light of the new view  the intermediate  meta stable states in which proteins would sometimes be
found in the wet laboratory before transitioning to their most stable state correspond to other wide
basins in the landscape  an illustration of this is provided in figure   b  
the new view inspired a new understanding of dynamic molecular processes  known as conformational selection or population shift  ma  kumar  tsai    nussinov        tsai  ma    nussinov 
    b  tsai  kumar  ma    nussinov      a   conformational selection refers to the idea that all
states of an unbound molecular unit are present and accessible by the bound unit  for many unbound uncomplexed biomolecules  there may be many semi stable states at equilibrium  the proximity of a ligand or another molecular partner shifts the equilibrium  and thus the probability distri

the principle of conformational selection allows employing analysis of energy landscapes of
unbound molecules to identify structural states of interest for complexation events  the latter can
be found among the meta stable and stable states of the uncomplexed molecule and can thus be
identified via modeling and simulation of the uncomplexed molecule 
    computing structures and structural transitions
the two main problems that can be addressed in silico to elucidate biomolecular equilibrium structure and dynamics concern  i  computing the ensemble of structures constituting the stable and
meta stable states relevant for biological function and  ii  computing the detailed structural transitions between such structures  the first problem is amenable to stochastic optimization  as it fundamentally involves locating deep and wide basins minima in a nonlinear and multimodal energy
surface  the second problem entails elucidating the different routes employed by a biomolecule as it
switches between two structures  this survey focuses primarily on the second problem  that of computing structural transitions in bound and unbound biomolecules  specifically  the survey reviews
methods that employ robotics analogies to address this problem  while  in principle  roboticsinspired methods can also provide information on the structure space available to a biomolecule at
equilibrium  other  more powerful stochastic optimization algorithms now exist for this purpose  we
refer interested readers to the review by shehu         which surveys state of the art evolutionary
algorithms  eas  capable of extracting efficient  discrete representations of protein energy surfaces 
at a minimum  all algorithms aiming to model biomolecular structures are comprised of three
functional units   i  a way to represent model a biomolecular structure   ii  a way to modify such
models in order to obtain new structures   iii  and a way to evaluate the energetics of such structures 
the existing mm energy functions summarized above in the context of biomolecular energetics
provide a way to evaluate models of biomolecular structures explored in silico  the functional units
 i  and  iii  are related  as the model chosen for a protein structure determines to a great extent
what moves or perturbation operators can be designed to efficiently and effectively explore the
structure space  below  we summarize models that are now popular among the different algorithms
employed to model equilibrium structures and dynamics of biomolecules  details regarding the
moves or perturbation operators designed to interface with such models are provided later in this
survey when reviewing robotics inspired methods

covalent bonds link atoms together in a molecule  in protein molecules  atoms are organized into
amino acids  which come in twenty different types in nature  all amino acids contain a common
core of heavy atoms that make up its backbone and a unique set of heavy atoms that make up its
side chain  hydrogen light atoms are found both in the backbone and side chain groups   the twenty
naturally occurring amino acids only differ in their side chain  figure   a  shows the n  ca  c  and

figure   a  illustrates that side chains dangle off the backbone of a polypeptide chain  treating
a protein molecule as a model where atoms are represented as balls and bonds between them as
sticks exposes interesting questions regarding how to perform deformations of the model without
breaking covalent bonds  this question is in essence what structure modeling researchers have
to answer when defining variables to represent a molecule so as to be able to capture its intrinsic
flexibility at equilibrium 
      c artesian c oordinate  based m odels
in the most intuitive model of a molecular structure  each cartesian coordinate of each atom is
selected as a variable  the cartesian coordinate based model is the preferred one by md algorithms  which move individual atoms in a molecule according to the cumulative force that sums
up interactions of an atom with all others in a molecule  however  this model is not ideal  first 
it is redundant  demanding  n variables for a molecule of n atoms  in small peptide and drug
molecules  the number of atoms may be in the dozens  but even in small proteins  the number of
atoms can easily surpass a hundred  as a result  the variable space has hundreds of dimensions 
many strategies have been offered to reduce the number of variables by essentially removing
certain atoms from modeling  for example  side chain atoms are the first to be sacrificed in protein
structure modeling  since it has been demonstrated that the main features of equilibrium protein
structures are captured by the backbone  rose  fleming  banavar    maritan         once such
reduced structures are modeled  side chains can be modeled via side chain packing algorithms  in
other studies focusing on modeling molecular interactions  only atoms that comprise the interaction
site are explicitly modeled  these decisions effectively result in reduced models  and thus fewer dimensions of the selected variable space   ranging from ca traces  where only the central ca atom
is modeled in each amino acid  to backbone models  where only the backbone chain is tracked in

energy functions designed to interface with these models  clementi        
representing a molecular structure in terms of the cartesian coordinates of all  or a subset of 
the constitutive atoms is appealing  as any new instantiation in the variable space can be readily
evaluated in terms of its energetics  we recall that the central lj and electrostatic coulomb terms
in the energy functions that are now widely adopted in biomolecular structure and dynamics modeling operate over  d coordinates of atoms  however  the cartesian coordinate based model is both
redundant and ineffective  first  the model results in an excessive number of variables  which poses
great challenges for any sampling based method aimed at probing the structure space one sample at
a time  second  it is ineffective  as it does not encode in it any of the explicit and implicit geometric
constraints present in molecular structures 
many efforts in the computational biophysics community target the reduction of coordinates 
the resulting models are referred to as coarse grained models or representations  the first such
model  employed in an mc simulation of the folding of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor 
represented each amino acid residue with one pseudo atom  levitt   warshel         work on
coarse grained and multiscale models  in the latter  different parts of the structure are represented

      e ncoding variable d ependencies in c artesian c oordinate  based m odels
outside of the realm of modeling chemical reaction processes  such as bond formation and breaking 
when modeling biomolecular equilibrium structures and dynamics  other application setups require
preserving certain structural features that can be formulated as local and non local constraints  some
constraints  such as keeping bonded atoms at a distance no more than the ideal equilibrium length of
their bond  are known as explicit  local constraints  they are trivially extracted from specification of
the chemical composition of a molecule  as they involve neighboring atoms  equilibrium conditions
place additional  implicit constraints on biomolecular structures  the need to preserve favorable
lennard jones interactions  for instance  places  non local long range  constraints over non bonded
atoms  such long range constraints cannot be effectively captured by a model where there is a
variable for each cartesian coordinate of each atom  any perturbation operator that interfaces with
such a model and modifies such variables has no information on invalid or energetically unfavorable
assignments to subsets of variables  as variable dependencies are not captured in the model  an
external energy model is crucial here in the form of an energy function to evaluate the results of the
perturbation operator and detect variable instantiations resulting in violations 
the cartesian coordinate based model can encode variable dependencies  the latter can be
extracted via several techniques  including multivariate analysis techniques that analyze known
equilibrium structures of a biomolecule to identify subsets of atoms that exhibit simultaneous displacements  that is  move in concert  the essential premise of such techniques is that such known
structures are good examples of solutions or near solutions of the energy function  and that analysis
of such examples will expose variable dependencies  these dependencies can then be employed
to design reduced cartesian coordinate based models that readily encode in them the energetic
constraints satisfied by the provided examples  solution or near solution structures  and effective
perturbation operators that readily yield new near solution instantiations in the reduced variable
space  clausen   shehu        
multivariate analysis techniques to obtain collective variables the sub field of statistical
techniques for the identification of collective motions  which are also referred to as collective coordinates or collective variables is rich  and a review is not the subject of our survey  instead  we point

    internal coordinate  and angular based models
the internal coordinate model has been offered as an effective alternative to the cartesian coordinatebased model  burgess   scheraga         in the internal coordinate model  the only variables
selected are bond lengths  angles between two consecutive bonds  and torsion or dihedral angles
between three consecutive bonds  figure   b  provides an illustration  this model allows for fast
forward kinematics  as changes to cartesian coordinates as a result of changes to the values of these
variables can be efficiently calculated via accumulation of rigid body transformations  craig       
zhang   kavraki      a  
internal coordinate based models are now the norm in non md based molecular structure modeling  an additional simplification is made for equilibrium protein structures  analysis of deposited
equilibrium structures of proteins reveals that bond lengths and bond angles are constrained to characteristic values  engh   huber         this is a consequence of the energetic constraints placed
on structures at equilibrium and is exploited to idealize protein geometry in modeling by effectively
removing bond lengths and bond angles from the list of variables in the model  this leaves only
dihedral angles defined over three consecutive bonds as variables     backbone angles and at
most four dihedral side chain angles per amino acid  as shown in figure   a   and is computationally appealing  as the number of dihedral angles for a polypeptide chain of n atoms is on average
 n    abayagan  totrov    kuznetsov         it is worth noting that bond lengths and bond angles do change even at equilibrium  but at a faster pace than other motions  employing idealized
geometry allows devoting computation to obtaining the slower fluctuations first  once structures
representative of a molecules equilibrium dynamics are obtained  deviations of bond lengths and
bond angles can be introduced and studied via more detailed models

several assumptions about which variables participate in the process of interest  and we highlight
such assumptions and their implications later in this survey 
biomolecular structure versus biomolecular conformation in light of the various models that
can be employed to represent biomolecular structure  a distinction needs to be made between the
terms structure and conformation  the term structure is meant to refer to the specification of the
cartesian coordinates of the atoms that comprise a molecule  even if not all atoms are explicitly
modeled  as in a backbone or reduced structure   the term conformation is meant to be more general and refer to the specification of the values of variables selected in the model of a structure  that
is  a conformation is a particular instantiation in the employed variable space  for instance  a conformation is the instantiation of angles if an angular based model is employed  and forward kinematics
allows obtaining the structure encoded by such a conformation  it is worth noting that the terms
conformation and structure are often used interchangeably and in a slight abuse of terminology
in biomolecular modeling literature  for instance  many algorithms that explicitly modify structures via cartesian coordinate based models are referred to as conformational search algorithms 
of course  when such models are employed  a structure can be extracted trivially from a conformation  in this survey  the distinction made above will be observed when referring to structures and
conformations 
in the specific domain of robotics inspired methods  the term  molecular  conformation is equivalent to  robot  configuration  however  in keeping with the broader computational biology literature  we will employ the term conformation when referring to macromolecules  such as proteins 
rna  and dna  reserving the term configuration for small molecules  also referred to as ligands 
that bind to macromolecules  in addition  while the term variable is often referred to as parameter in the broader computational biology and biophysics literature and degree of freedom  dof  in
robotics and ai literature  we will employ the more general  non domain specific term of variable
and variable space  that is  a  molecular  conformation is an instantiation in the space of selected
variables  depending on the number of variables selected to model the molecule under investigation  the variable space may be high dimensional  mapping a conformation to its corresponding
structure allows associating a structure space to the employed variable space  moreover  energy
functions allow associating an energy surface to the structure space  and interesting observations
regarding stable and semi stable structural states and excursions among such states can be made by
analyzing the structure space and low dimensional projections embeddings of its underlying energy
surface  hence the energy landscape

   summary of biomolecular modeling problems and robot motion planning
frameworks
we introduce the main classes of problems in biomolecular modeling that are addressed with
robotics inspired methods  the robot motion planning frameworks over which these methods build
are summarized next  the section concludes with a summary of challenges faced by algorithmic realizations of such frameworks for modeling biomolecular structure and dynamics  these challenges
are a preview of important design decisions that are detailed in section   in the context of reviewing
representative methods 
    representative problems in biomolecular modeling
two main classes of molecular mechanisms are studied by robotics inspired methods  those that
involve more than one molecule associating complexating with or disassociating from one another 
and those that involve a dynamic  uncomplexated molecule  as application setups  both concern
informing our understanding of dynamic events involving dynamic molecules 
in the first application setup  robotics inspired methods aim to model and understand proteinligand binding events  provided unbound structures of the protein receptor and a small ligand
molecule  the objective is to elucidate how the ligand approaches and then binds the protein receptor  in a related problem  the reverse process is addressed  the ligand is bound to the receptor 
and the goal is to determine motions of the ligand and the protein receptor that allow disassociation 
modeling protein ligand binding is important not only for a general understanding of our biology
but also for computation aided drug discovery  while other molecular recognition events such as
protein protein  protein dna  protein rna  and protein membrane binding conceptually fall in the
same category as protein ligand binding  they are more challenging due to the higher number of
variables needed to model the association or complexation event and are currently beyond the domain of applicability of robotics inspired methods 
the second application setup concerns modeling and understanding the dynamics of molecules 
almost exclusively  the focus of robotics inspired techniques in this category are uncomplexed protein and rna molecules  the goal is to elucidate the structural deformations or motions that allow
a protein or an rna molecule to transition between two structural states of interest  these states
can be the unfolded and folded state  in which case the goal is to highlight folding and unfolding
paths  or they can both be stable or semi stable structures employed by the molecule to recognize
and lock onto different molecules  in which case the goal is to formulate hypothesis regarding the
impact of structure in molecular recognitions in the healthy and diseased cell 
figures     illustrates these problems  in figure    a robotics inspired method can highlight how
the ligand approaches the protein receptor  as well as where it binds onto the receptor and into what
configuration  the variables of interest need at a minimum to include the translational and rotational
variables of the ligand  as well as internal coordinates to capture the potential structural flexibility
of the ligand  the receptor can be considered frozen in  d space  a more accurate setup would
also consider internal coordinates of the receptor in order to model its possible structural flexibility
upon ligand binding  however  the resulting number of variables would be too large  a roboticsinspired method can not only elucidate the bound ligand configuration and its bound placement
relative to the receptor  but also the possible routes of successive configurations and placements
that the ligand may follow to approach the binding site s   in addition  as figure   a  illustrates 
a robotics inspired method can show the possible routes of successive structures employed by a

elucidate the step by step process of how a ligand approaches a protein molecule  where it binds  and with
what configuration 

protein to fold  thus shedding light into the process of protein folding and unfolding  similar setups
consider rna molecules  figure   b  illustrates that often robotics inspired methods are employed
to reveal not only folding or unfolding routes of a protein  but also structural transitions between any
two structures of interest  knowledge of the most probable routes that carry out the transition allows
understanding at a structural level the mechanism by which a biomolecule regulates its biological
activity in the cell

analogies between molecular chains and robot chains allow putting together efficient algorithms for
rapid exploration of molecular structure spaces and modeling of excursions of molecules on such
spaces  manocha   zhu        singh et al         apaydin et al         amato et al         apaydin

the objective in robot motion planning is to obtain paths that take a robot from a given  start
configuration to a given  goal configuration  the robot motion planning problem bears mechanistic
analogies to the problem of computing conformations along a transition trajectory of a biomolecule 
in both problems  the driving objective is to uncover what of the underlying  molecular  conformation or  robot  configuration space is employed in motions of an articulated system from a start to a
goal conformation or configuration  analogies between molecular bonds and robot links and molecular atoms and robot joints help to draw from techniques that perform fast kinematics for kinematic

the variables selected to represent a molecular conformation  rapidly update cartesian coordinates
of the corresponding structure  zhang   kavraki      b   in the inverse kinematics setting  these

observation  originally made for robot configuration spaces  is that solution containing regions of
a high dimensional and non linear variable space can only be found by heuristic rather than exact
approaches  stochastic  or sampling based techniques can construct the distribution of constraintsatisfying instantiations in a two stage manner  an initial distribution is first constructed via sampling of the unconstrained variable space  instantiations are then evaluated through external  energetic  models capable of capturing inter variable dependencies and penalizing violations of constraints  violating samples are either removed or down weighted so the initial  uninformed distribution gradually converges to that containing solutions  the second observation is that transitions of
a system between two given solutions can be modeled via discrete  kinetic models that essentially
embed solutions in graph like structures amenable to rapid  shortest  or lowest cost path queries 
provided that lengths or other cost metrics can be associated with a given series of configurations in
a path  methods that embed solutions in a tree are referred to as tree based methods  and those that
embed solutions in a graph are referred to as roadmap based methods 
    the motion planning framework  tree  and roadmap based methods
in the context of molecular modeling  tree based methods grow a tree in conformation space from
a given  start to a given  goal conformation representing the structures bridged by the sought transition  the tree is incrementally extended  with every iteration adding a new conformation node and
a new branch to the tree  depending on whether the tree is pulled towards configurations sampled
at random over the configuration space or pushed from leaves towards new regions of the configuration space  the method is known as rapidly random exploring tree  rrt   lavalle   kuffner 
       or expansive spaces tree  est   hsu  kindel  latombe    rock         accordingly  it is
important to note here that the sampling and connectivity go hand in hand  as every sampled conformation is added to the growing tree  the growth of the tree is biased so the goal conformation
can be reached in a reasonable computational time  as a result  tree based methods are efficient but
limited in their sampling  they are known as single query methods  as they can only answer one
start to goal query at a time  that is  only one path of consecutive conformations that connect the
start to the goal can be extracted  running them multiple times to sample an ensemble of conformation paths for the same query results in an ensemble with high inter path correlations due to the
biasing of the conformation tree

roadmap based methods adapt the probabilistic road map  prm  framework
 kavraki  svestka  latombe    overmars         rather than grow a tree in conformation space 
these methods detach the sampling of conformations from the connectivity model that encodes
neighborhood relationships among conformations in the conformation space  typically  a sampling
stage first provides a discrete representation of the conformation space of interest  with conformations satisfying explicit or implicit geometric and energetic constraints  and then a roadmap building
stage embeds the sampled conformations in a graph roadmap by connecting each one to its nearest neighbors  roadmap based methods can provide richer information regarding a dynamic event 
as multiple paths may exist in the roadmap connecting two structures of interest  moreover  these
methods support multiple queries  as in principle the same graph can be used to extract paths connecting different given structures  these structures can be specified as conformations and connected
to nearest neighbors in the graph  and then the graph can be queried for optimal paths  in practice 
it is difficult to obtain broad and dense sampling of sufficient regions in the conformation space of
a molecule so as to elucidate diverse excursions between structures of interest 
below we provide further detail on tree based and roadmap based methods in robotics to familiarize the reader with the diverse design decisions employed and even adapted by robotics inspired
methods for biomolecular modeling 
      n on   hierarchical t ree  based robot m otion p lanning m ethods
tree based methods can be categorized broadly based on the strategies employed to select the vertex
from which to expand the tree  non hierarchical strategies consider all the vertices as possible
candidates  hierarchical strategies place the tree vertices at a bottom layer and introduce additional
high level layers that group similar vertices together  proceeding from the top to the bottom layer
during the selection process 
rrt is one of the most widely used non hierarchical tree based motion planning methods  in
rrt  lavalle   kuffner         at each iteration  the tree is expanded towards a randomly sampled
configuration qrand   the nearest vertex  qnear   in the tree to qrand is determined according to a distance metric  a local planner attempts to connect qnear to qrand   often the local planner interpolates
over the underlying variables to generate intermediate configurations  in the basic version of rrt 
the iteration stops after one interpolation step  in the connect version  the expansion continues until
qrand is reached or the interpolation results in an invalid configuration  e g   collision with obstacles 
this process of sampling a configuration and expanding from the nearest neighbor in the tree is repeated until the goal is reached  figure   shows such a tree  by using random sampling and nearest
neighbors  rrt exhibits a voronoi bias which enables the expansion of the tree toward unexplored
regions  to also bias the search towards the goal  qrand is often selected with probability b  often set
to       as the goal configuration and with probability    b uniformly at random 
over the years  different rrt variants have been developed in order to improve the exploration 
the adaptive dynamic domain rrt  addrrt   jaillet  yershova  lavalle    simeon        associates a sampling radius with each tree vertex and dynamically adjusts the radius based on the
success of the local planner  the reachability guided rrt  rgrrt   shkolnik  walter    tedrake 
      relies on the notion of reachable sets to increase the likelihood of successful tree expansions  the obstacle based rrt  obrrt   rodriguez  tang  lien    amato      b  increases
sampling near obstacles  pcarrt  dalibard   laumond        relies on pca  and the selective
retraction based rrt  srrrt   lee  kwon  zhang    yoon        uses bridge sampling and se

figure    the tree built by rrt is shown here on a simplistic environment 

lective retraction in order to facilitate expansions inside narrow passages  the utility guided rrt
 ugrrt   burns   brock        associates a utility measure with each vertex and uses it to promote expansions that increase the utility  rrt blossom  kalisiak   van de panne        creates
a flood fill behavior to locally explore the area surrounding each vertex  machine learning has also
been used to derive a distance metric that captures the cost to go in order to improve the exploration
in rrt  palmieri   arras         the reachable volume rrt  rvrrt   mcmahon  thomas   
amato        relies on the notion of reachable volumes in order to restrict sampling to feasible
regions and improve the performance of rrt on highly constrained problems  the abstractionguided rrt  frrt   kiesel  burns    ruml        uses a  search on a grid based decomposition
to bias rrt sampling towards low cost regions  rrt   karaman   frazzoli        rewires the
branches in rrt to find optimal solutions with respect to a given cost function 
est  hsu et al         takes a different approach from rrt by pushing the frontier of the
tree towards unexplored areas  instead of relying on expansions from the nearest neighbor  est
maintains a probability distribution over the tree vertices  at each iteration  a vertex v is selected
with probability inversely proportional to the density of a small neighborhood around v  this allows
est to push the tree towards less explored regions of the configuration space 
      h ierarchical t ree  based m otion p lanning m ethods
hierarchical tree based methods rely on a scheme which first selects a region and then a vertex from
which to expand the tree  regions are often defined based on a decomposition of a low dimensional
projection of the configuration space  the rationale is that  by grouping similar vertices  better
selections can be made at the region level to effectively guide the tree exploration  for instance 
the single query  bidirectional  lazy collision checking  sbl  method  sanchez   latombe       
pushes the tree toward sparse regions by using a grid based decomposition and uniform probability distributions to select non empty grid cells  the kinodynamic planning by interior exterior cell
exploration   kpiece  method  sucan   kavraki        relies on a multi level grid decomposition constructed over user defined or random linear projections  the synergistic combination of
layers of planning  syclop  method  plaku  kavraki    vardi        uses discrete search over a
   

fis hehu   p laku

low dimensional triangular or grid decomposition to guide the tree exploration along short region
paths to the goal  the guided sampling tree  gust  method  plaku        partitions the motion
tree into equivalence classes and relies on multi objective criteria based on shortest path distances 
selection penalties  and progress made to determine equivalence classes which could result in rapid
expansions toward the goal 
the path directed subdivision tree  pdst  method  ladd   kavraki              relies on
a grid subdivision of the configuration space  each cell in the decomposition keeps track of the
tree branches that fall into it  initially  the tree has only the root vertex and there is only one cell
corresponding to the minimum and maximum values for each variable  at each iteration  a tree
branch is selected for expansion  the cell c that contains the selected tree branch is divided into
two cells  c  and c    along the largest dimension  the tree branches in c are also split according
to the boundaries between c  and c    this ensures the invariant that a tree branch is contained
entirely in one cell  the selected tree branch b is expanded by picking a configuration q along b and
using propagation to add a new branch starting at q  propagation is problem dependent and could
correspond to moving in a random direction 
the propagation continues until a collision is found or a maximum number of steps is reached 
the branch is split when it exits the cell boundaries  a key component of the pdst is the weighting
scheme associated with each cell based on its volume  number of branches  and number of previous
selections  when selecting a tree branch  in order to increase the coverage  priority is given to cells
that have large volumes but have not been well explored  after each iteration  the selected cell
c is penalized in order to ensure that other cells will eventually be selected for expansion  this is
necessary to avoid oversampling and guarantee probabilistic completeness  ladd   kavraki        
pdst has also been combined with artificial potential fields in order to expand the tree from the
region with the lowest potential  bekris   kavraki        
    roadmap based robot motion planning methods
the introduction of prm  kavraki et al         shifted the focus from complete to probabilisticallycomplete motion planning algorithms  which guarantee to find a solution  when it exists  with probability approaching one as time tends to infinity  while complete algorithms were limited to simple
problems with    variables  prm made it possible to efficiently solve high dimensional problems  the underlying idea in prm is to construct a roadmap which captures the connectivity
of the  obstacle  free configuration space  the roadmap is populated by generating a number of
collision free configurations  each configuration is generated by sampling values for the variables
uniformly at random  the configuration is discarded  if it results in collision  otherwise  it is added
to the roadmap  to capture the connectivity  neighboring roadmap configurations are connected
with collision free paths  figure   provides an illustration of a roadmap created by prm  a common approach is to compute for each roadmap configuration its k nearest neighbors according to a
distance metric  a path between two configurations is often obtained by linear interpolation  if the
path is collision free  it is added as an edge to the roadmap graph  a path from a given start to a
goal configuration is found by first connecting the start and the goal configurations to the roadmap
and then searching the roadmap graph  a  is often used to efficiently compute the shortest roadmap
path  additional sampling may be required when the initial roadmap does not contain a path from
the start to the goal

    biomolecular modeling challenges for tree  and roadmap based methods
both tree  and roadmap based methods experience the curse of dimensionality in several ways  a
central issue concerns the breadth of sampling in possibly high dimensional and complex variable
spaces  in particular  in the context of biomolecular modeling  the decision of which variables to
represent is key  as it determines the dimensionality and complexity of the variable conformation
space  this decision is tightly tied with the application setting or the class of biomolecular systems
considered  as reviewed in section    while in many adaptations the selected variables are all or a
subset of the backbone dihedral angles  han   amato        amato et al         song   amato

tandem from a priori compiled databases of good moves  shehu   olson        molloy et al  
      molloy   shehu         or whether diverse perturbation sampling operators are employed
that make use of different sets of variables  gipson  moll    kavraki        molloy   shehu        
the dimensionality and size of the variable space remains a key challenge for tree  and roadmapbased treatments of biomolecules 
the choice of variables is key to the design of effective sampling or perturbation operators for
generating conformations that satisfy a set of desired geometric and or energetic constraints for the
biomolecular modeling problem at hand  samples obtained uniformly at random have very low
probability of being low energy or in the region of interest for a sought structural transition  in
particular  for long protein chains with hundreds or more backbone dihedral angles  a conformation
sampled at random is highly unlikely to be physically realistic 
biased sampling techniques can be used to remedy this issue  amato et al         song  
amato         but it is hard to know a priori which perturbation operators will be effective  recent work recognizes this issue and addresses it by offering diverse sampling operators on possibly
diverse sets of variables  raveh et al         gipson et al         molloy   shehu         in particular  the work of molloy and shehu        implements a probabilistic scheme that selects among a
rich menu of operators making use of angular or cartesian variables 
it is worth noting that sampling operators may generate samples not in a vacuum but by incremental modifications of existing samples  while earlier generations of tree  and roadmapbased methods typically obtained new conformations by sampling values over the selected variables  singh et al          recent methods generate samples in neighborhoods of existing parent
samples  shehu   olson        molloy   shehu        maximova et al          hence  the often
used term perturbation operator   this later strategy has a higher chance of yielding physicallyrealistic conformations  as perturbation operators that perturb a selected sample to obtain a new one
tend to preserve some good structural features in the new sample while introducing enough change
to explore new regions of the variable space  olson  hashmi  molloy    shehu         in the context
of perturbation operators  selection schemes are critical to control sampling  a recent phenomenon
in robotics inspired methods has been the recognition that selection schemes  which are central to
hierarchical tree based robot motion planning  as reviewed above   can also be employed in both
tree  and roadmap based methods to steer biomolecular sampling to regions of interest  shehu  
olson        molloy   shehu        maximova et al         
an additional challenge with ensuring high sampling capability is that biomolecules have underlying complex energy surfaces that encode energetic constraints  therefore  the criterion for
accepting a sampled conformation and adding it to the vertex list of the tree or roadmap needs to either rely on an a priori set energy threshold or be probabilistic in nature  the latter setting provides
a balance between obtaining low energy conformations while allowing a particular algorithm to go
over high energy barriers as needed to sample more of the conformation space  jaillet et al        
      molloy   shehu        devaurs et al         molloy   shehu        
both roadmap  and tree based methods rely on local planners or local deformation techniques
to connect neighboring conformations  in tree based methods that push the tree out in the variable
space by generating child conformations from selected parent conformations via perturbation operators  the child becomes a neighbor of the selected parent  the neighborhood function does not rely
on the notion of a distance in the variable space but is instead tied to the parent child relationship 
in other methods  a sampled conformation needs to be connected to one or more nearest neighbors  nearest neighbor calculations need specification of a distance function between conforma

tions  which is non trivial in high dimensional spaces  most adaptations employ least root meansquared deviation  lrmsd   which is a modification of euclidean distance after differences due to
rigid body motions have been removed through optimal superimposition of the protein conformations under comparison  mclachlan         lrmsd is carried out over cartesian coordinate based
instantiations  other distance functions use l  or related variants defined over dihedral angles 
it is generally challenging to find computationally efficient and dynamics integrating local planners for biomolecular conformations  if conformations q  and q  are nearby in variable or structure
space  the local path that is encoded with an edge in the tree or roadmap should encode the process
of diffusion  the local path should provide evidence of the diffusion of the biomolecule from q  to
q  in the presence of thermal vibrations  it is not readily obvious how to use dynamics to steer a
biomolecule from q  to q    while in principle md simulations can be employed in search of such
paths  there is no guarantee that these simulations will reach q    while biased md simulations can
be employed to reach q    such simulations modify the energy surface and do not model the actual
dynamics  ma   karplus         moreover  any corrections to biased md simulations to model the
actual dynamics prove computationally expensive  ovchinnikov   karplus        in the context of
robotics inspired methods that evaluate thousands of edges 
as a result  the majority of robotics inspired methods for biomolecular modeling employ local
planners that carry out linear interpolations over the variables of the conformations that need to be
connected via a tree branch or roadmap edge  such planners produce unrealistic conformations  and
significant time can be spent correcting geometry and other ensuing energetic violations via energy
minimization  recent work proposes complex  local planners that are not based on interpolation
but are instead re formulations of the motion computation problem  that is  the local planners themselves are tree  or roadmap based methods  molloy   shehu         the latter idea is borrowed
from the similarly challenging setting of motion planning for manipulators  where linear interpolation is also not effective  nielsen   kavraki         when making use of complex local planners 
a prioritized path sampling scheme is needed to prioritize the application of these computationallydemanding planners on the most promising paths in order to control computational cost  nielsen

early adaptations of the rrt algorithm for biomolecules focused on modeling the equilibrium dynamics of protein loops  cortes et al         and protein ligand interactions  cortes et al         
for instance  the method presented in the work of cortes et al         proceeds in two stages to
model large amplitude structural changes in a protein loop at equilibrium  the first stage obtains an
ensemble of collision free conformations of a loop in a protein structure  this is achieved through
the random loop generator rrt  rlg rrt  algorithm  which effectively samples the loop conformation space that satisfies kinematic closure constraints  the loop is divided into an active and a
passive part  the passive part is selected to contain   variables  whereas the active part contains the
rest of the angular variables selected to represent a loop conformation  the rlg rrt algorithm
   

fic omputational t reatments of b iomolecules by robotics  i nspired m ethods

directly samples values for the variables in the active part via a scheme that increases the probability
of obtaining a conformation that satisfies loop closure  once the active part of a loop conformation
has been obtained  an exact  r inverse kinematics technique is applied to solve for the passive variables under the loop closure constraints  closed loop conformations are added to the tree if they
are collision free  the tree is run for a fixed amount of time  and a goal region is defined around
the given goal conformation in order to extract many paths from one execution of the rlg rrt
algorithm  conformations in extracted paths are then subjected to short energetic minimizations in
order to elucidate energetically feasible  large amplitude motions of the loop under investigation 
analysis of extracted loop motions in the work of cortes et al         reveals that results are
comparable with classic molecular modeling methods while obtained with a performance gain of
several orders of magnitude  the work of cortes et al         demonstrates the efficacy of the twostage approach for studying the activity regulating mobility of the    residue long loop   in the
amylosucrase enzyme from neisseria polysaccharea 
ideas similar to rlg rrt are employed in the looptk  toolkit  algorithm  yao et al        
to explore the closed  collision free conformations of flexible loops ranging in length for   to   
amino acids  the algorithm relies on an interplay of sampling and deformation to obtain loops that
satisfy the kinematic closure constraints and are collision free  the sampling procedure focuses on
obtaining geometrically diverse  closed loops  the deformation procedure is based on earlier related
work on loop modeling  lotan  van den bedem  deacon    latombe        van den bedem  lotan 
latombe    deacon         the procedure makes use of the null space technique to explore the
self motion manifold  the constrained  closure space  around a closed loop to resolve steric clashes
while not violating the closure constraints  looptk is shown to efficiently handle long loops up
to    amino acids and even generate biologically interesting  calcium binding conformations  the
toolkit is available at https   simtk org home looptk 
the time demands of rrt rlg on problems with hundreds of variables are addressed by cortes
et al         by proposing the manhattan like rrt  ml rrt  algorithm to efficiently compute
paths for a small protein bound ligand to exit the protein active site  ml rrt borrows ideas from
mechanical disassembly and divides the variables into two groups  active and passive  in particular 
the variables that model the internal and rigid body motions of the ligand are designated as active 
and the subspace of these active variables is sampled as in the rlg rrt algorithm  the variables
that model the internal motions of amino acids on the protein receptors active site are designated
as passive  and they are slightly perturbed if they hinder motions of the ligand  this decoupling
proves effective  as it allows for possible ensuing collisions between the ligand and the protein to be
addressed in a domino like scheme  as illustrated in figure   
ml rrt has been shown to efficiently model motions of small ligands  side chains  loops  and
backbone  cortes  le  lehl    simeon        barbe et al          the work of cortes et al        
subjects paths extracted from executions of the ml rrt algorithm to a randomized path smoothing
post processing technique  the technique is carried out in the composite space of all the parameters
resulting in simultaneous motions of the ligand and the protein in the final path  the work of barbe
et al         subjects loop conformations in paths extracted from ml rrt to minimization of an
mm energy function so as to reveal critical  physically realistic intermediate conformations and
bottlenecks along the open to closed loop motion of the burkholderia cepacia lipase lid domain 
adaptations of robot motion planning frameworks to model loop structures and motions represent only a fraction of diverse methods designed for loop modeling  interested readers are referred
to a survey in the work of shehu and kavraki

is employed to obtain the most energetically favored path among all those computed  a schematic
of the method proposed by enosh et al  and a visualization of the most energetically favored path
obtained on the ksca protein are shown in figure   
another extension of the rrt based algorithm in the work of enosh et al         is presented
by raveh et al          the more efficient pathrover algorithm is proposed for modeling structural
transitions on many proteins  pathrover achieves its computational efficiency in two main ways 
first  its application on many proteins is made possible by restricting the number of dihedral angles
used as variables  three strategies are used to identify a subset of dihedral angles to define the
variable space  careful inspection of structures  relevant literature  computational tools for detecting
hinge regions like nma  and comparison of structural changes in alternative  native or homologue 
structures  in particular  the flexprot alignment algorithm  shatsky  nussinov    wolfson       
is used to compare start and goal structures and reveal structurally different regions  variables are
manually restricted to dihedral angles in such regions  second  pathrover limits the exploration to

regions of the space consistent with available wet laboratory data  branch termination criteria are
employed to stop the tree from being pulled towards regions that do not improve agreement with
wet laboratory data  the integration of wet laboratory data aims to circumvent known inaccuracies
of modern biomolecular energy functions 
the rrt based algorithms summarized above demonstrate the utility of rrt for modeling
structural transitions in proteins  in particular  the pathrover algorithm utilized several schemes
to reduce the number of variables in order to make the problem of modeling structural transitions
tractable  raveh et al          the work of haspel et al         continued in this spirit via clever 
reduced representations of large proteins  in contrast  work in the simeon and cortes labs credited
with introducing rrt based algorithms to biomolecular modeling focused instead on techniques to
enhance sampling  the transition rrt  t rrt  algorithm proposed by jaillet et al         was
shown particularly effective in this regard 
t rrt and its bi  and multi tree variants have been recently proposed to explore and obtain comprehensive maps of energy landscapes of small peptides  such as dialanine and met enkephalin  jaillet et al         devaurs et al          the main modification to the baseline rrt algorithm in
t rrt concerns the introduction in the acceptance criterion of a state transition test based on the
metropolis criterion  new conformations are added to the tree if they pass the transition test  hence
the name  t rrt   the goal in t rrt is to steer the tree towards exploration of low energy regions
in order to map energy minima in the potential energy surface while relaxing the transition test as
needed to cross energy barriers that may trap the exploration to a particular local minimum 
the dynamic modification of the state transition test makes use of a reactive temperature scheme 
in the metropolis criterion  an effective temperature effectively controls the height of energy barriers that can be crossed by two consecutive conformations  in t rrt  this temperature is increased
when the number of attempts to pull the tree towards low energy regions reaches a user specified
threshold  that is  the number of failures to grow the tree is taken as an indication of the presence of
an energy barrier  and the effective temperature is increased in order to relax the state transition test 
as soon as a successful edge is added to the tree  the temperature is then lowered by a pre specified
factor in order to resume the overall bias of pulling the tree towards local minima  the effect of
this reactive temperature scheme is that the search is balanced between unexplored regions and lowenergy regions of the variable space  application of t rrt in the work of jaillet et al         shows
that the algorithm can map the entire known energy landscape of the dialanine peptide when run in
an exploration mode  another setting  where t rrt is used to obtain paths that connect discovered
minima  also shows that recovered transitions between known stable states of dialanine are in strong
agreement with transitions known from experiment and affirmed in other simulation studies 
further work addresses the issue of limited sampling when the goal is to obtain accurate representations of energy landscapes of longer peptides  such as met enkephalin  devaurs et al         
the t rrt algorithm is used by devaurs et al  only to reveal conformation paths connecting
already identified meta stable states  these states are identified by an ea known as basin hopping  bh   which has been shown to effectively sample local minima of the energy surfaces of
biomolecules  olson et al          in the work of devaurs et al   bh operates over dihedral angles
and provides a sample based  discrete representation of the energy surface of a peptide  the local
minima are clustered to reveal wide basins corresponding to meta stable states 
a variant of the t rrt algorithm  referred to as multi t rrt  is also proposed by devaurs et al 
to connect all identified states  the algorithm builds n single trees  each rooted at a conformation
representative of a unique meta stable state  the algorithm proceeds in iterations  at each iteration

figure     in this figure  reproduced from the work of devaurs et al          the graph obtained from a single
run of multi t rrt with cycles is projected over key dihedral angles in the top panel  the algorithm is seeded
with four meta stable states of the met enkephalin peptide  drawn as pink triangles  squares  or circles  the
states capture the unfolded state  the folded state  and two intermediates  shown in the bottom panel   costs
of various paths are shown in the table on the bottom panel  this figure is reproduced with permission of ieee

randomly selecting one of the n trees for expansion with a conformation q  the conformation
nearest to q in any of the other n    trees is identified  and if it is within an extension step size 
q merges two trees  iterations continue until all trees are merged in a graph  the graph is queried
for minimum cost paths connecting any states of interest  the identified meta stable states and the
minimum cost paths connecting these states are found to be comparable to those reported by other
studies that employ more computationally demanding exploration strategies  devaurs et al         
a representative result of the information that can be extracted from this combination of bh and
multi t rrt is shown in figure    
one limitation of readily applying t rrt and its variants to obtain similar  detailed characterization for proteins rather than short peptides is the dimensionality of the conformation space  in the
work of jaillet et al          this space has few dimensions due to the limited number of dihedral
angles in small peptides  such as dialanine and met enkephalin  detail  while desired and possible
on characterizations of short peptides  needs to be sacrificed in order to model large scale structural transitions in proteins  nma rrt  kirillova et al          pdst  haspel et al          and
sprint  molloy   shehu        present three different algorithms that make use of representations
of reduced detail to model large scale structural transitions in proteins 
normal mode analysis  nma  is used to obtain larger scale moves  low frequency modes revealed by the nma on a conformation   kirillova et al          these moves are then employed to
generate new conformations in the rrt framework  the nma rrt algorithm proposed by kirillova et al         essentially conducts the rrt search over a low dimensional variable space of
   

fis hehu   p laku

the low frequency modes  since the normal modes provided by the nma on a conformation only
allow to get out of the local minimum represented by a conformation  nma needs to be repeated
regularly during the rrt search in order to explore the breadth of the conformation space  this can
be computationally demanding  and application of nma rrt is limited to extraction of minimumcost paths connecting two conformations of interest rather than a comprehensive map of the energy
landscape and its connectivity in proteins  the work of kirillova et al  shows that precious information can be extracted regarding structural transitions in proteins  such as adenylate kinase  even
when focusing on motions largely driven by normal modes  a complementary study of minimal
energy paths in adenylate kinase via nma  maragakis   karplus        shows that the modes are
sufficient to capture the structural transition between the open and closed structures in this protein  all known wet lab structures are found to be within    aof these mode based minimal energy
pathways  maragakis   karplus        
a recent extension of nma rrt aims to reduce the computational demands of the algorithm 
the extension employs a further reduced representation of a protein chain based on tripeptides and
employs nma on conformations of such reduced representations  the reactive temperature scheme
in t rrt is employed to broaden sampling and capture large scale motions connecting significantly
different structural states in large proteins of several hundred amino acids  al bluwi et al         
employing reduced representations has expanded the applicability of tree based algorithms for
treating large biomolecules  the pdst algorithm is adapted by haspel et al         to model a
transition between two structures of interest in large proteins of more than     amino acids  the
assumption is made that secondary structures do not unfold in the sought transition  which is largely
valid when modeling domain motions in proteins  under this assumption  only backbone dihedral
angles on loops connecting secondary structures are selected as variables 
in the work of haspel et al          a bias scheme is used on     of the iterations to steer
the tree towards the goal conformation  the bias scheme employs a euclidean distance between
feature vector representations of conformations in the tree  given a conformation  its corresponding
feature vector contains euclidean distances between centers of mass of its secondary structure units 
conformations are evaluated through a detailed coarse grained energy function that combines terms
from the energy function used in the work of shehu et al         and the amber ff   energy function 
if a sampled conformation is evaluated to have energy above a set threshold of     kcal mol more
of the energy of the start conformation  the conformation is subjected to    steps of steepest descent
and retained only if its energy decreases below this threshold  this is a rather coarse energetic
constraint  but paths collected from     runs of the algorithm not only reach the goal conformation
in less time than methods based on simulated annealing  but also reveal credible motions consistent
with experimental data on large  well characterized proteins such as groel  haspel et al         
the sprint algorithm proposed by molloy and shehu        uses a complementary approach to
simplifying the search space explored for paths connecting given structures of medium size proteins 
sprint addresses the issue of sampling in high dimensional variable spaces by employing a popular
idea from de novo structure prediction  the fragment replacement technique is used to divide a
protein chain into bundles of consecutive dihedral angles  and values for a bundle or fragment are
sampled from an a priori constructed database of fragment configurations on known  native protein
structures  the fragment replacement technique is used to expand the tree at every iteration 
while the work of molloy and shehu        adapts the est framework via this expansion
procedure to model structural transitions in small  and medium size proteins  the fragment monte
carlo tree exploration  feltr  algorithm proposed by shehu and olson        uses related con   

fic omputational t reatments of b iomolecules by robotics  i nspired m ethods

cepts to sample the space of near native protein conformations for the purpose of de novo structure
prediction in small proteins 
in both sprint and feltr  a state transition test is used to steer the tree towards low energy conformations over time  that is  a probabilistic  metropolis like criterion is used to determine whether
a child conformation should be added to the tree  while in feltr  shehu   olson        a fixed
scaling parameter  analogous to a fixed effective temperature  is used in the metropolis like criterion  sprint  molloy   shehu        integrates a reactive temperature scheme in order to allow
the tree to go over high energy regions when no low energy routes can be found and thus expand
exploration capability  the reactive temperature scheme in sprint is slightly different from that in
t rrt  jaillet et al          while in t rrt the effective temperature is increased or decreased by
fixed amounts  sprint moves temperature along a proportional cooling scheme often employed in
simulated annealing monte carlo methods  shehu et al          upon failures to expand the tree 
temperature moves up to the next value in the cooling scheme  upon successes  temperature goes
down to the next value in this scheme 
both feltr and sprint operationalize on the idea that it is easier to push rather than pull
the tree in conformation space when good moves are available or compiled a priori to generate
energetically feasible child conformations from selected parent conformations in the tree  while
in the work of molloy and shehu        the tree is rooted at a given start conformation and the
goal is to get within a tolerance region of the given goal conformation  in the work of shehu and
olson        the tree is rooted at an extended conformation  and the termination criterion is a compromise between a desired number of low energy conformations and running time 
a central idea in both sprint and feltr is that the growth of the tree can be controlled via a
selection mechanism  at each iteration  a conformation in the tree is selected for expansion  the
selection penalizes the tree from growing towards regions of the conformation space that have been
oversampled  thus resulting in enhanced sampling of the conformation space  two discretization
layers are employed  in feltr  the first layer maps conformations in the tree on a  d grid whose
cells are energy levels of width   kcal mol  in sprint  the first layer maps conformations on a  d
grid based on their lrmsd from the goal conformation  the second layer in both algorithms maps
conformations over a geometric projection  the second layer is a  d grid  where conformations are
associated with   shape based global coordinates  shehu   olson        
the selection mechanism uses both discretization layers  first  it selects an energy level according to a probability distribution function  the latter is defined over weights associated with energy
levels according to some weighting function  different weighting functions are analyzed for how
strong a global energetic bias needs to be in order to reproduce the native structure  molloy et al  
       once an energy level is selected  cells of the geometric projection grid that belong to conformations in the selected energy level are analyzed  a second weighting function over cells of the grid
biases against selecting a cell that has been selected many times before and or already has many conformations in it  once a cell is selected  any conformation in it is selected for expansion uniformly
at random  since conformations in a cell are energetically  and geometrically indistinguishable 
extensions of feltr have explored both the effect of different weighting functions over the
discretization layers and the employment of different projection coordinates  molloy et al        
olson et al          different coarse grained energy functions that are considered state of the art
in de novo structure prediction  including the rosetta suite of energy functions  are employed in
the framework and directly compared for how they steer the search towards near native conformations  molloy et al          molloy and shehu        also investigate the impact of different
   

fis hehu   p laku

projection schemes and selection mechanisms on both the diversity and energetic profiles of sprintextracted paths in the context of computing structural transitions 
applications of sprint on different start and goal structure pairs of the calmodulin and adenylate
kinase proteins show that the algorithm is able to find paths that reach the goal conformation  molloy
  shehu         soft global biasing schemes are found to provide the right compromise between
tree depth  that is  lower energies  and diversity of paths  that is  geometrically diverse conformations   detailed energetic and structural analysis on computed paths for two hallmark proteins 
such as calmodulin and adenylate kinase  reveals that sprint yields accurate characterizations of
structural transitions in these proteins  energetic profiles of extracted paths indicate the presence
of high energy regions that need to be crossed on specific transitions in calmodulin  in agreement
with wet laboratory characterizations  analysis on adenylate kinase shows that known intermediate
structures of this protein are present in the the conformation paths computed by sprint  molloy

    roadmap based methods for modeling equilibrium biomolecular structure and
dynamics
roadmap based methods have been employed to model protein ligand binding  singh et al         
protein and rna folding and unfolding  song   amato        chiang et al         chiang  hsu   
c          and protein structural transitions  molloy   shehu        maximova et al         
      m odeling p rotein  l igand b inding
the adaptation of the roadmap based motion planning framework for protein ligand binding by
singh et al         is the first occurrence of robotics inspired treatments of biomolecular structure
and dynamics  the adaptation was simplistic but provided key design issues that were then replicated and extended by many robotics researchers  one of the key simplifications is that the protein
receptor is kept rigid  and the only variables of interest are those allowing to model rigid body
motions of the ligand around the receptor and internal motions of the ligand  small ligands are
considered  so that the     p variables to allow modeling of such motions do not go above a dozen 
sampling proceeds uniformly at random over the     p variables  but ligand configurations added
to the roadmap pass a geometric and energetic criterion  the geometric criterion ensures that ligand
configurations are within some predefined distance of the center of mass of the receptor 
the energetic criterion is probabilistic  two dynamically updated thresholds  emin and emax
values  corresponding to minimum and maximum energy values over sampled configurations  are
recorded  ligand configurations with energy higher than emax are rejected  other configurations
are retained with probability  emax  e q    emax  emin    the energy function incorporates
both terms to evaluate the internal energy of a ligand configuration as well as terms evaluating
interactions between a ligand configuration and the rigid protein receptor 
retained ligand configurations are embedded in a nearest neighbor graph  using lrmsd to measure the distance between two ligand configurations and a user set parameter  k  for the number of
nearest neighbors  a simple local planner interpolating over all p     variables of two neighboring
configurations is used to estimate the feasibility of q  q   and q    q edges by generating consecutive configurations  consecutive configurations qi are generated by the linear interpolation planner
to connect q and q   until the distance between two consecutive configurations in the generated series is no higher than  a  the q  q   and q    q edges are added to the roadmap only if all qi
   

fic omputational t reatments of b iomolecules by robotics  i nspired m ethods

configurations have energies below emax   weights are added to retained edges as follows

where
p  qi  qi      

e ei   ei    kb t  
 e ei   ei    kb t     e ei  ei    kb t    

in the above equations  qi    qi   qi   are three consecutive configurations with corresponding
energies ei    ei   ei     kb is the boltzmann constant  and t is the effective temperature  the
weight of a path qstart
qgoal   which connects a start configuration to a goal configuration  is
then the sum of the weights of the edges in it  the weight of a path initiated at an unbound configuration and terminating in a bound configuration estimates the association rate  the cost of the
ligand approaching and binding to the protein receptor   the weight of the reverse path estimates
the disassociation rate  the cost of the ligand leaving the binding site and diffusing in space  
the resulting roadmap represents a distribution of energetically credible paths of the ligand approaching and then binding the receptor  in the work of singh et al          the bound configuration
of the ligand in the p   variable space is presumed not to be known  and rmsd based clustering of
sampled lowest energy ligand configurations is employed to reveal a few likely bound candidates 
analysis reveals that the true bound configuration is indeed present in the top populated clusters 
however  many false positives are reported  as well  weights of paths terminating in and initiated
from the lowest energy ligand configurations are analyzed in order to determine what other characteristics can be used to discriminate between true and false positives  paths terminating at the true 
bound configurations are found to have high association rates  the reverse paths are found to have
high disassociation rates  this important result elucidates that effective binders are not only those
that allow the ligand to reach the lowest interaction energy but also trap it at the binding site via
high energy barriers

singh et al         provided a much needed template and has served as the foundation for many
robotics inspired treatments of biomolecules  in particular  a suite of roadmap based algorithms
and extensions were designed in the amato lab to model unfolding of small proteins  a review
of roadmap based methods to study molecular motions in the amato lab is available in the work
of tapia et al          whereas a review of roadmap based methods for the specific protein folding
problem is presented in the work of moll  schwartz  and kavraki         a seminal contribution in
this category is the probabilistic conformation roadmap  pcr  algorithm  apaydin et al         
which builds upon the template presented by singh et al         to study protein folding 
pcr addresses a complex application domain  as the number of variables needed to model the
intrinsic flexibility of protein chains can easily reach     or more  in pcr and other extensions that
followed  most notably in the amato lab  the variables employed are all or a subset of the backbone
dihedral angles of a protein chain  amato et al         song   amato        tang et al        
thomas et al               tapia et al         tang et al         tapia et al          in such variable
spaces  uniform random sampling is ineffective and likely to result in conformations with severe
internal collisions  for this reason  work in the amato lab on pcr based algorithms has gradually
   

fis hehu   p laku

shifted to sampling strategies based on incremental perturbations of a given native folded conformation until memory of the folded conformation has been lost  specifically  backbone dihedral angles
of the folded conformation are perturbed by small amounts by use of a gaussian distribution until
a minimum number of conformations is obtained for each category    to      in     increments 
of the percentage of native contacts  the lower the number of native contacts is in a conformation 
the more likely that conformation is to belong to the unfolded state  while the acceptance criterion
for sampled conformations is as in the work of singh et al          the energy function is different 
as it measures the internal energy of a protein chain  the function contains terms favoring hydrogen
bonds  disulfide bonds  and hydrophobic interactions 
the sampled conformations that pass the energetic acceptance criterion are embedded in a
nearest neighbor graph  with the number of nearest neighbor conformation k specified by the user 
in contrast to the original pcr algorithm  directed  u  v  edges in the graph are weighted based on
e u e v 

the boltzmann related metropolis criterionas in  p u v    e kb t   where e    is the energy of a
conformation  kb is the boltzmann constant  and t is an a priori set temperature determining the
height of energy barriers crossed by an edge  in this early formulation of edge weights  no reactive
temperature schemes are employed as in the later tree  and roadmap based algorithms for structural
transitions  instead  t is a user controlled parameter that determines to a great extent the ability of
the algorithm to navigate the underlying energy surface 
in the works of song and amato        and thomas et al          all n best paths that end at the
folded conformation and start at conformations with   native contacts are extracted and analyzed 
analysis of such paths has shown that  despite several design decisions intended to simplify the
protein folding problem  pcr based algorithms can predict the order of secondary structure formation  agreement with wet laboratory data has validated the general usage of pcr based algorithms
to provide a coarse grained treatment of folding and unfolding pathways for protein chains  other
works by amato and collaborators also show the applicability of pcr based algorithms to study
rna folding and unfolding  tapia et al         tang et al         tapia et al          
the sampling strategy of incremental perturbations is effective on protein chains of no more than
   amino acids  song   amato        but scales poorly on longer chains  thomas et al         
ensuing work improves sampling for protein chains up to     amino acids by further reducing the
number of variables modeled to represent conformations  thomas et al          specifically  rigidity analysis is employed to detect least constrained regions in a given structure  the dihedral angles
belonging to such regions are selected more often for perturbation in the sampling stage  this modification is shown effective in revealing subtle folding differences between protein g and two of its
sequence variants  in particular  the modification is also shown to be promising for capturing other
dynamic events in proteins beyond folding to study large scale conformational changes involved
in structural transitions of the calmodulin protein  related ideas have been employed by other researchers to compute temperature dependent optimal folding paths in peptides and proteins  yang
et al         li et al          the maxflux prm algorithm proposed by yang et al         to
study structural transitions in the dialanine peptide and folding of a  hairpin is then shown by li
et al         to be capable of predicting folding pathways of the engrailed homeodomain protein 
further work in the amato lab has focused on exploiting the conformation roadmap to extract
quantities summarizing folding kinetics in protein and rna molecules  tapia et al         introduce
two new analysis techniques  the map based master equation  mme  and map based mc  mmc 
technique  this work shows that treating the roadmap as a map of the folding landscape can be
   

fic omputational t reatments of b iomolecules by robotics  i nspired m ethods

exploited to estimate kinetic metrics that are typically only extracted from md simulation studies 
metropolis mc simulations can be conducted over the roadmap  moving between roadmap vertices
observing the edge probabilities in the roadmap  different statistics can then be calculated over the
mmc walks  including folding rates and population kinetics  tang et al         show that statistics
summarizing rna folding predict well the same relative gene expression rate for wild type ms

the idea that reliable statistics can be extracted from molecular conformation roadmaps was presented earlier by latombe and colleagues  apaydin et al          the stochastic roadmap simulation  srs  framework is formalized in relation to a key analogy between a roadmap and a markov
state model  msm   the concept of a stochastic roadmap with probabilistic edges was presented
earlier  song   amato         but the analogy with an msm went missing till the      formalization by latombe and colleagues  apaydin et al          the latter laid bare the analogies between a stochastic roadmap and what would later be referred to as a point based msm  in such an
msm  states of the msm are the single conformation vertices of the stochastic roadmap  and the
probabilistically weighted edges connecting vertices in the roadmap are the state to state transitions
in the msm  the analogy brought to focus that a stochastic roadmap better encodes the stochastic nature of biomolecular motions  and the analogy with an msm could even be used to extract
interesting summary statistics regarding physics driven stochastic processes 
in addition to recognizing that biased random walks can be carried out over the roadmap and
employed to extract statistics of interest  tapia et al          the srs msm analogy highlights that
effective  algebra based techniques from  markov chain  transition state theory can be employed to
extract average statistics without launching a single simulation  or random walk over the roadmap  
folding rates  pfold values   values  and other estimates of kinetics  such as transition rates  can be
obtained without needing to perform many random walks but by in order propagation of transition
probabilities  the analogy between a stochastic roadmap and a point based msm is shown to result
in correctly predicted pfold values on small proteins modeled at the secondary structure level with
    variables  apaydin  brutlag  hsu    latombe        apaydin et al          further work
demonstrated that the transition state ensemble  the set of conformations with pfold        folding
rates  and  values could be predicted on    different proteins but at a fraction of the computational
time that would be needed by a framework launching numerous mc simulations  chiang  apaydin 
brutlag  hsu    latombe        chiang et al          
while the srs msm analogy permits interesting mathematics  practical issues such as how to
ensure that the transition matrix is not prohibitive in size to allow solving of linear algebra equations
have to be addressed on a case by case basis  the formalization presented by apaydin et al        
did not discuss practical design decisions such as how to group conformations into states and how
to estimate transition probabilities between two sub ensembles  but rather on the mathematics that
would be possible by the analogy between a stochastic roadmap and an msm  analogies with cellbased msms  where states are homogeneous sub ensembles of conformations rather than single
conformations need addressing practical issues regarding how to organize conformations into states
and how to associate transition probabilities between states 
   

fis hehu   p laku

since the seminal work of apaydin et al          analogies between srs and cell based msms
have been largely limited  partly due to the lack of clear objectives in design decisions that are
general in their ability to transform a roadmap into an msm of manageable size  for instance  the
fundamental assumption was that if conformations were obtained via an md simulation at some
temperature t   then the probability of an edge representing a transition from a vertex u to a vertex v
could be measured via the boltzmann related metropolis criterion e e v e u    kb t     this realization allowed apaydin  latombe  and colleagues to see the clear connection between the stochastic  probabilistic  roadmap of structures and a point based msm  with vertices seen as states of the
msm and edges between vertices in the roadmap as transitions between states in the msm  however  practical considerations as to how to convert these single conformation vertex probabilities
into state state transition probabilities were not discussed 
the issue of how to associate probabilities in the first place to conformations sampled via other
non md algorithms was also not discussed  two groups of researchers have started operationalizing
on the seminal ideas presented by apaydin et al          work by latombe and colleagues has focused either on point based msms or on summarizing and uncovering the md simulated dynamics
of synthetic and small peptides via cell based msms  chiang et al                complementary work in the shehu lab has focused on non md approaches and extracting average statistics
to model and compare transitions in healthy and aberrant forms of disease participating  small  to

chiang et al         offer a novel representation of states not as individual conformations  apaydin et al         singhal  snow    pande        or even disjoint regions of conformation space
 ozkan  dill    bahar        chodera  singhal  pande  dill    swope         as in cell based
msms  but instead as overlapping probabilistic distributions over the conformation space  this
distribution relies on the key recognition that a single conformation does not contain enough information to be uniquely mapped to a state and leads to the presence of hidden states in what is
referred to as a markov dynamics model  mdm  rather than an msm  chiang et al          in
the mdm  emission probabilities of hidden states measure the probability with which a conformation belongs to a state  both transition and emission probabilities are estimated over trajectories of
conformations obtained from many md simulation trajectories  a principled criterion based on the
ability of a model to predict long timescale kinetics allows discriminating between possible mdms
and selecting an optimal one  the mdm embedded over conformations obtained from md trajectories simulating folding of the fast folding villin headpiece subdomain  hp    nlenle  is shown
in figure     the mdm presents a highly interpretable discrete kinetic model of the folding of this
small sub domain  built over more than     md trajectories  each  s long  figure    shows that
a few states                and     are the most frequently visited states that significantly influence
the long term dynamics 
molloy et al         present strategies to embed conformations sampled via a non md method
in a cell based msm  the ability to formulate a cell based msm relies on dense sampling of the
conformation space of interest  the latter provides significantly challenging to do in the md setting
or even in the robotics inspired setting  instead  complementary work in the shehu lab on eas is
used to obtain a rich ensemble of local minima conformations in healthy and variant sequences of
a given protein  clausen   shehu        clausen et al          these conformations are organized
into states via a simple lrmsd based clustering scheme  a nearest neighbor graph is then imposed
over the states  but an additional lrmsd constraint is imposed so as to connect only nearby states
via an edge  the assumption is made that transitions are possible between nearby states  and prob

figure     in this figure  reproduced from the work of chiang et al           a  shows the msm connecting
twenty identified states of the villin headpiece peptide  the size of each node in the msm is proportional to
the probability of the corresponding state in the stationary distribution  the width of each edge is proportional
to the transition probability between corresponding states  states with probability        in the stationary
distribution  self transitions  and edges with transition probability         are not drawn to avoid cluttering 
the initial conformations are most likely to belong to state     and the native conformation is most likely
to belong to state      b  representative conformations are shown from states                and     the
residues forming the important helix   in the villin headpiece peptide are drawn in red   c  the most likely state
transition sequences from states    to    are shown here  this figure is reproduced under the bioinformatics

abilities of such transitions can be estimated via a boltzmann like probability  the latter makes use
of the concept of the energy of a state  several schemes are employed to determine the energy of a
state  ranging from the minimum to the average value over energies of conformations grouped in a
state

figure     this figure is reproduced from the work of molloy et al          panel  a  shows two wet laboratory
structures representative of the on and off structural states of the h ras catalytic domain  h ras switches
between these two states to regulate its biological activity in the cell  the loop regions where the change is
localized are shown in red and blue  the reactant  gtp  and product  gdp  are also drawn where they bind

the result of this process is a stochastic roadmap that can be used to answer lowest cost path

as the average number of edges in a transition  via the analogy of the stochastic roadmap with an
msm  a path smoothing algorithm based on the conjugate peak refinement technique  fischer  
karplus        provides more detail with state state paths and improves their energetic profile  the
average statistics  while not direct measurements of transition rates due to the lack of timescale information from non md methods  allow conducting comparisons between wildtype  wt  and variant  mutated  sequences of proteins of interest  in the work of molloy et al          such statistics
are employed to obtain a structural explanation for the role of specific mutations on the biological
activity in two proteins implicated in human disorders  figure    showcases some representative
results from application of the srs based approach in the work of molloy et al  to the wt and

comparison of the energy landscapes  costs of the minimum cost paths  energy profiles of these
paths  and the expected number in edges over all paths in each h ras sequence in figure    provides a structural explanation for the impact of the q  l mutation on the biological activity of this
enzyme  the mutation introduces an energy barrier between the on and off states  and this barrier
increases both the cost of the minimum cost path and the number of expected edges in transition
paths  taken together  these results suggest that the q  l mutation  while preserving the stability
of the on and off states  cannot form the transition state mimic  in agreement with wet laboratory

sampling remains a key issue in adaptations of roadmap based methods for biomolecular modeling 
while generally the focus of robotics inspired methods has been on demonstrating their ability to
reproduce experimental knowledge qualitatively or even quantitatively on specific systems under
investigation  their general applicability has been largely sacrificed  for instance  the roadmapbased methods applied to model the discrete secondary structure formation events in protein folding
and unfolding are largely not applicable to model folding or other transition events in proteins
more than     amino acids where the states sought to the bridged by the transition may be farther
than   a away from each other  strategies to reduce the number of variables so as to control
the dimensionality of the variable space have important ramifications  for instance  rigidity based
techniques base their conclusions of where the most flexible regions are on analysis of a specific
structure  nma techniques suffer from a similar issue  and regular application of nma on sampled
conformations adds to the computational time demands of an algorithm  other techniques that make
assumptions on which regions do or do not participate in a particular transition event rule out the
possibility of potentially complex  cooperative events  others that bundle variables together and
obtain values for them from pre compiled databases make similar assumptions on what types of
structural changes facilitate a transition 
sampling will remain a challenge  but two complementary directions are being explored  the
first direction values broad applicability over specific improvements  molloy and shehu       
propose that the community needs a benchmark testing dataset and a baseline approach against
which specific improvements and extensions can be evaluated  in particular  this work ignores
system specific insights into which variable and which sampling schemes can be more effective
over others but instead compiles a broad set of variables and sampling perturbation operators that
can be selected via a probabilistic scheme  different schemes can be employed at different stages
of a roadmap based method based on the distance of the conformations that need to be connected
and the size of the biomolecule under investigation  a general baseline implementation shows
comparable performance to system specific methods and promises that further improvements can
guarantee a baseline performance over a broad set of biomolecules and problem instances  related
ideas building on the concept of a move selector are presented by gipson et al         
the second direction sacrifices broad applicability in the interest of improving the predictive
capability of roadmap based methods to the point that reliable hypotheses can be formulated to further guide wet laboratory experimentation  maximova et al         recognize that roadmap based
methods do not have to operate in a de novo setting but instead exploit the rich set of wet laboratory

figure     this figure is reproduced from the work of maximova et al          the left panel shows a
schematic that summarizes all paths within a small energetic threshold of the minimum cost path connecting
structure pairs of interest in calmodulin  analysis of these paths reveals that known  wet laboratory structures
mediate transitions of interest  the pdb ids of these mediating structures are shown along each of the paths

structures to determine the variable space of interest  in particular  the soprim algorithm proposed
by maximova et al  subjects wet laboratory structures of different sequences of a protein to a statistical multivariate analysis to determine variables that represent collective motions of atoms  sampling
focuses on this space of variables and a multiscaling technique converts samples to all atom structures that are local minima of the amber ff  sb energy function  the samples are embedded in a
roadmap  and distance constraints ensure that edges are only placed between neighboring samples 
edges are weighted based on the concept of minimum cost  recording only energetic increases 
in an additional contrast to existing roadmap based treatments  the work of maximova et al 
       yields not only the minimum cost path connecting a given start to a given goal structure  but
allows extracting additional paths with similar costs  the concept of tours is employed  based on
related work in robotics  the tours allow to investigate specific hypotheses regarding the participation of known meta stable structures in a transition  a set of such structures can be specified  and
all minimum cost tours that consider all subsets and orders of such structures are reported  analysis
of tours with costs no higher than a specific threshold over the minimum cost path reveals precious
information regarding important function regulation transitions in several proteins  including ras
and calmodulin  a summary result is shown in figure    
figure    extracts several energetically credible paths representing the various  equiprobable
routes of transitions of calmodulin from its open  unbound state  represented by structure with pdb
id  cll  to two different  closed peptide and protein bound states  represented by structures with
pdb id  f y and  nwd   the schematic summary of these paths in figure    highlights that
these open to closed transitions in calmodulin may not make use of the calcium bound structure
 pdb id  cfd   indeed  paths that go through this structure have higher energetic cost  a different
intermediate structure emerges from the analysis of paths  this structure  under pdb id  k e 
also binds calcium but is slightly different for that under pdb id  cfd  the succession of structures shown in    makes clear that the domain collapse  re arrangement  and partial unfolding of
the helix that links the n  and c terminal domains in calmodulin are gradual  as captured in various structures in the nmr ensemble with pdb id  k e  this result is in good agreement with

the wet laboratory study in the work of gsponer  christodoulou  cavalli  bui  richter  dobson 
and vendruscolo         which  in addition to contributing the nmr entry under pdb id  k e to
the protein data bank  also concludes that correlated motions within the  k e ca     cam state
direct the structural fluctuations toward complex like substates  gsponer et al          while the
wet laboratory study by gsponer et al         was restricted to mlck binding of cam  the results
obtained by the soprim algorithm  maximova et al         suggest that the same mechanism observed by gsponer et al         prepares cam for binding to other peptides  the c terminal domain
of petunia glutamate decarboxylase in  nwd and the iq domain in  f y   the work of maximova et al         points to a general mechanism for the apo to closed complexed dynamics of
calmodulin  where correlated motions within the calcium bound state direct the fluctuations and
population shift of this protein to its peptide bound states 

   outstanding challenges and directions of research
robotics inspired methods are becoming more powerful and diverse in their algorithmic strategies
and the problems they address in biomolecular modeling  while this survey has focused on treeand roadmap based methods for modeling protein ligand binding  protein de novo structure prediction  protein and rna folding and unfolding  structural transitions in peptides and proteins  and
energy landscape mapping  other methods are building on related ideas to efficiently map ligand
migration channel networks in dynamic proteins  lin   song        na   song        or even
model antibody aggregation processes  hoard  jacobson  manavi    tapia         while we have
attempted to provide a broad and deep survey of robotics inspired methods for biomolecular modeling  an exhaustive survey is not possible  this particular sub domain at the interface of robotics and
computational structural biology is rapidly progressing  as demonstrated by the increasing number
of adaptations and applications showcased in this survey over earlier  related reviews of roboticsinspired methods  al bluwi et al         gipson  hsu  kavraki    latombe         as this survey
showcases  several algorithmic challenges remain  below we provide a partial list of these challenges and prospects for future research 
    problem specific versus general treatments
there is a pressing need in the community for benchmarks  while work has been largely driven by
specific biological systems and problems of interest  such data driven research has often resulted
in specific design decisions that are not easily transferable to other systems and other problems 
for instance  key decisions on how to reduce dimensionality of the variable space and design compliant sampling strategies and perturbation operators on a specific problem instance may not be
applicable to another problem  a realization of the need for baseline  general treatments and benchmarks is leading researchers towards non specific treatments to establish benchmarks and baseline
performance  better sharing of problem instances  metrics  and algorithms with known baseline
performance will also be key to allow researchers to build on existing work and expedite progress 
    sampling
there is a growing realization that sampling will remain a central issue  despite clever reduced representations and sampling strategies  while the community of researchers adapting robot motion planning treatments for biomolecular modeling has been successful at integrating important knowledge

about biomolecules in model selection  sampling strategies  and energetic evaluations  this community has largely remained isolated from complementary work in ai on stochastic optimization of
continuous  non linear variable spaces  in particular  there is a growing body of work in the evolutionary computation community on optimization of complex fitness landscapes  some ideas from
this community have successfully been employed in de novo structure prediction  shehu        and
mapping of protein energy landscapes  clausen   shehu        clausen et al         sapin  carr 
de jong    shehu         these ideas are also beginning to be incorporated in robotics inspired
treatments of biomolecular dynamics  molloy et al          better awareness and integration of
effective practices of other communities dealing with similarly challenging high dimensional problems is likely to address issues in sampling and lead to more powerful robotics inspired treatments 
in this context  we see great opportunity for ai researchers to make contributions in sampling based
treatments of biomolecular dynamics 
    decorrelations of paths
in particular  applications of tree  and roadmap based methods for modeling structural transitions
of biomolecules  path correlation is an issue  path correlations can potentially skew any statistics
of interest and even yield to incorrect conclusions about a structural transition  the culprit in treebased methods is the bias that is applied to steer the conformation tree to the goal conformation 
even multiple executions of a tree based method are likely to result in similar paths  to some
extent  this source of path correlations can be addressed  for instance  molloy and shehu       
makes use of an additional projection layer to steer the tree towards under sampled regions of the
conformation space  this is shown to improve path diversity  yet another culprit that is shared by
tree  and roadmap based methods is density of sampling  for instance  undersampling of specific
regions may lead to the conclusion that the region is not energetically favorable for the biomolecule
at hand  further investigation is needed to quantify and reduce path correlations in robotics inspired
methods  this direction is also ripe for cross fertilization of ideas from different sub communities
in ai 
    injection of dynamics
a common criticism of robotics inspired methods is that they are essentially geometric treatments
of biomolecules  while to some extent geometric treatments are accepted in modeling biomolecular structure  they are seen as inadequate in modeling biomolecular dynamics  modeling dynamics
is largely seen as exclusive to md simulation frameworks  in a somewhat colloquial and simplistic characterization of robotics inspired methods  biomolecular dynamics has nothing to do with
robot motion planning  this characterization can be overcome by pointing out that the superficial
analogies are only used to inspire robotics researchers  but the deeper analogies that are exploited
and shown to have an impact are those on selection of models  variables  fast forward and inverse
kinematics  and effective sampling strategies  it is worth noting that the latter are not exclusively
the domain of robotics inspired researchers  on the contrary  issues of effective variable selection
or representation  variation operators  employment of such operators in sampling strategies  and
others are of broad interest to ai researchers working on optimization problems as part of modeling
abstract  mechanical  or biological systems 
at various places  this survey has highlighted that robotics inspired methods are capable not
only of reproducing wet laboratory knowledge and data but also of providing novel findings to direct
   

fic omputational t reatments of b iomolecules by robotics  i nspired m ethods

further experimentation in wet laboratories  still  a valid criticism of robotics inspired methods
is that edges in trees or roadmaps do not provide a detailed view of the diffusion between the
two conformations they connect  while the survey points out in section   several challenges with
integrating md trajectories in robotics inspired framework  it is important that the community think
of ways to do so effectively  injection of ideas from the ai community at large may prove beneficial
here  a growing body of work in computational biophysics is pointing to effective frameworks of
biomolecular dynamics that integrate thousands or more short md trajectories in msms to capture
biomolecular dynamics  cross fertiziliation of ideas from the ai and biophysics communities is
likely to prove fruitful in explicitly integrating md in robotics inspired methods 
    beyond path computations  roadmaps and msms
as this survey highlights in section    msms have become very popular in computational biophysics literature to organize and extract statistics from many  independent md simulations of
biomolecular folding or other structural transitions  jayachandran  vishal    pande        chodera

chiang et al          and molloy et al         provide an important first step in the integration of
msms in the analysis of conformation spaces probed via robotics inspired algorithms  while chiang et al         and molloy et al         address some of the issues on to convert roadmaps into
msms  many others remain  including definition of structural states  possible undersampling of specific states  feedback mechanisms to address undersampling  and rigorous calculation of transition
probabilities  some of these issues are also contended with in the computational biophysics community  and initial treatments have emerged  singhal et al         singhal   pande        prinz  wu 
sarich  keller  senne  held  chodera  schutte    noe      b  malmstrom et al         da  sheong 
silva    huang         we see a great opportunity here for ai researchers  particularly those with
expertise in machine learning  to coordinate efforts with computational biophysicists  such efforts
will undoubtedly lead to richer and more powerful computational treatments of biomolecular dynamics 
    cross fertilization of ideas
as this survey shows  work in modeling biomolecular structure and dynamics is highly interdisciplinary  and great progress is achieved when ideas from different communities are combined and
integrated in computational treatments  there is a rich set of scientific questions that can be formulated to understand the role of biomolecular structure and dynamics in human biology and health 
these questions often result in exceptionally challenging computational problems that necessitate
sophisticated algorithmic treatments  treatments that add to the current knowledge of biomolecular
systems in chemistry  physics  and biophysics are likely to advance not only our modeling capabilities but also make important  general contributions to ai research
