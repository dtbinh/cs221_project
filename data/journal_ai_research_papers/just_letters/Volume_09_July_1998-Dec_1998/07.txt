abstract

a class of interval based temporal languages for uniformly representing and reasoning
about actions and plans is presented  actions are represented by describing what is true
while the action itself is occurring  and plans are constructed by temporally relating actions
and world states  the temporal languages are members of the family of description logics 
which are characterized by high expressivity combined with good computational properties 
the subsumption problem for a class of temporal description logics is investigated and
sound and complete decision procedures are given  the basic language tl f is considered
first  it is the composition of a temporal logic tl   able to express interval temporal
networks   together with the non temporal logic f   a feature description logic  it is
proven that subsumption in this language is an np complete problem  then it is shown
how to reason with the more expressive languages tlu  fu and tl alcf   the former
adds disjunction both at the temporal and non temporal sides of the language  the latter
extends the non temporal side with set valued features  i e   roles  and a propositionally
complete language 

   introduction
the representation of temporal knowledge has received considerable attention in the artificial intelligence community in an attempt to extend existing knowledge representation
systems to deal with actions and change  at the same time  many logic based formalisms
were developed and analyzed by logicians and philosophers for the same purposes  in this
class of logical formalisms  properties such as expressive power and computability have been
studied as regards typical problems involving events and actions 
this paper analyzes from a theoretical point of view the logical and computational
properties of a knowledge representation system that allows us to deal with time  actions
and plans in a uniform way  the most common approaches to model actions are based
on the notion of state change   e g   the formal models based on the original situation
calculus  mccarthy   hayes        sandewall   shoham        or the strips like planning
systems  fikes   nilsson        lifschitz          in which actions are generally considered
instantaneous and defined as functions from one state to another by means of pre  and
post conditions  here  an explicit notion of time is introduced in the modeling language
and actions are defined as occurring over time intervals  following the allen proposal  allen

       in this formalism an action is represented by describing the time course of the
world while the action occurs  concurrent or overlapping actions are allowed  effects of
overlapping actions can be different from the sum of their individual effects  effects may
not directly follow the action but more complex temporal relations may hold  for instance 
consider the motion of a pointer on a screen driven by a mouse  the pointer moves because
of the movement of the device on the pad   there is a cause effect relation   but the two
events are contemporary  in the common sense notion of the word 
a class of interval temporal logics is studied based on description logics and inspired by
the works of schmiedel        and of weida and litman         in this class of formalisms
a state describes a collection of properties of the world holding at a certain time  actions are
represented through temporal constraints on world states  which pertain to the action itself 
plans are built by temporally relating actions and states  to represent the temporal dimension classical description logics are extended with temporal constructors  thus a uniform
representation for states  actions and plans is provided  furthermore  the distinction made
by description logics between the terminological and assertional aspects of the knowledge
allows us to describe actions and plans both at an abstract level  action plan types  and
at an instance level  individual actions and plans   in this environment  the subsumption
calculus is the main inference tool for managing collections of action and plan types  action
and plan types can be organized in a subsumption based taxonomy  which plays the role
of an action plan library to be used for the tasks known in the literature as plan retrieval
and individual plan recognition  kautz         a refinement of the plan recognition notion is proposed  by splitting it into the different tasks of plan description classification  
involving a plan type   and specific plan recognition with respect to a plan description  
involving an individual plan  according to the latter reasoning task  the system is able to
recognize which type of action plan has taken place at a certain time interval  given a set
of observations of the world 
advantages of using description logics are their high expressivity combined with desirable computational properties   such as decidability  soundness and completeness of deduction procedures  buchheit  donini    schaerf        schaerf        donini  lenzerini 
nardi    schaerf        donini  lenzerini  nardi    nutt         the main purpose of this
work is to investigate a class of decidable temporal description logics  and to provide complete algorithms for computing subsumption  to this aim  we start with tl f   a language
being the composition of a temporal logic tl   able to express interval temporal networks  
together with the non temporal description logic f   a feature description logic  smolka 
       it turns out that subsumption for tl f is an np complete problem  then  we show
how to reason with more expressive languages  tlu  fu   which adds disjunction both at
the temporal and non temporal sides of the language  and tl alcf   which extends the
non temporal side with set valued features  i e   roles  and a propositionally complete description logic  hollunder   nutt         in both cases we show that reasoning is decidable
and we supply sound and complete procedures for computing subsumption 
the paper is organized as follows  after introducing the main features of description
logics in section    section   organizes the intuitions underlying our proposal  the technical
bases are introduced by briey overviewing the temporal extensions of description logics
relevant for this approach   together with the inter relationships with the interval temporal

   description logics

description logics  are formalisms designed for a logical reconstruction of representation tools such as frames  semantic networks  object oriented and semantic data models
  see  calvanese  lenzerini    nardi        for a survey  nowadays  description logics
are also considered the most important unifying formalism for the many object centered
representation languages used in areas other than knowledge representation  important
characteristics of description logics are high expressivity together with decidability  which
guarantee the existence of reasoning algorithms that always terminate with the correct
answers 
this section gives a brief introduction to a basic description logic  which will serve as
the basic representation language for our proposal  as for the formal apparatus  the formalism introduced by  schmidt schau   smolka        and further elaborated by  donini 
hollunder  lenzerini  spaccamela  nardi    nutt        donini et al               buchheit
et al         de giacomo   lenzerini              is followed  in this way  description
logics are considered as a structured fragment of predicate logic  alc  schmidt schau  
smolka        is the minimal description logic including full negation and disjunction  
i e   propositional calculus  and it is a notational variant of the propositional modal logic
k m   halpern   moses        schild        
the basic types of a description logic are concepts  roles  features  and individuals  a
concept is a description gathering the common properties among a collection of individuals 
from a logical point of view it is a unary predicate ranging over the domain of individu   description logics have been also called frame based description languages  term subsumption languages  terminological logics  taxonomic logics  concept languages or kl one like languages

als  properties are represented either by means of roles   which are interpreted as binary
relations associating to individuals of a given class values for that property   or by means
of features   which are interpreted as functions associating to individuals of a given class
a single value for that property  the language alcf   extending alc with features  i e  
functional roles  is considered  by the syntax rules of figure    alcf concepts  denoted by
the letters c and d  are built out of atomic concepts  denoted by the letter a   atomic roles
 denoted by the letter p    and atomic features  denoted by the letter f    the syntax rules
are expressed following the tradition of description logics  baader  burckert  heinsohn 
hollunder  muller  nebel  nutt    profitlich        
the meaning of concept expressions is defined as sets of individuals  as for unary predicates  and the meaning of roles as sets of pairs of individuals  as for binary predicates 
formally  an interpretation is a pair i    i   i   consisting of a set i of individuals  the
domain of i   and a function i  the interpretation function of i   mapping every concept
to a subset of i   every role to a subset of i  i   every feature to a partial function
from i to i   and every individual into a different element of i   i e   ai    bi if a    b
 unique name assumption    such that the equations of the left column in figure   are
satisfied 
the alcf semantics identifies concept expressions as fragments of first order predicate
logic  since the interpretation i assigns to every atomic concept  role or feature a unary or
binary  functional  relation over i   respectively  one can think of atomic concepts  roles
and features as unary and binary  functional  predicates  this can be seen as follows  an
atomic concept a  an atomic role p   and an atomic feature f   are mapped respectively to
the open formulas fa      p  ff  fi    and ff  ff  fi   with ff satisfying the functionality axiom
 y  z ff  x  y    ff  x  z    y   z   i e   ff is a functional relation 
the rightmost column of figure   gives the transformational semantics of alcf expressions in terms of fol well formed formul  while the left column gives the standard
extensional semantics  as far as the transformational semantics is concerned  a concept c  
a role p and a path p correspond to the fol open formulae fc      fp  ff  fi    and fp  ff  fi

respectively  it is worth noting that the extensional semantics of the left column gives also
an interpretation for the formulas of the right column so that the following proposition
holds

then the transformational semantics of figure   maps c into a logically equivalent first

a terminology or tbox is a finite set of terminological axioms  for an atomic concept a 
called defined
concept  and a  possibly complex  concept c   a terminological axiom is of the
 
form a   c   an atomic concept not appearing on the left hand side of any terminological
axiom is called a primitive concept  acyclic simple tboxes only are considered  a defined
concept may appear at most once as the left hand side of an axiom  and no terminological
cycles are allowed  i e   no defined concept may occur   neither directly nor indirectly  
within its own definition  nebel         an interpretation i satisfies a    c if and only if
ai   c i  
as an example  consider the unary relation  i e   a concept  denoting the class of happy
fathers  defined using the atomic predicates man  doctor  rich  famous  concepts  and
child  friend  roles  
 
happyfather   man u   child    u  child  doctor u  friend  rich t famous  
i e   the men whose children are doctors having some rich or famous friend 
an abox is a finite set of assertional axioms  i e  predications on individual objects  let
o be the alphabet of symbols denoting individuals  an assertion is an axiom of the form
c  a   r a  b  or p a  b   where a and b denote individuals in o  c  a  is satisfied by an
interpretation i iff ai   c i   p  a  b  is satisfied by i iff  ai   bi     p i   and p a  b  is satisfied
by i iff pi  ai     bi

a knowledge base is a finite set  of terminological and assertional axioms  an interpretation i is a model of a knowledge base  iff every axiom of  is satisfied by i    logically
implies a v c  written  j  a v c   if ai  c i for every model of   we say that a is
subsumed by c in   the reasoning problem of checking whether a is subsumed by c in
 is called subsumption checking   logically implies c  a   written  j  c  a   if ai   c i
for every model of   we say that a is an instance of c in   the reasoning problem of
checking whether a is an instance of c in  is called instance recognition 
an acyclic simple tbox can be transformed into an expanded tbox having the same
models  where no defined concept makes use in its definition of any other defined concept 
in this way  the interpretation of a defined concept in an expanded tbox does not depend
on any other defined concept  it is easy to see that a is subsumed by c in an acyclic simple
tbox  if and only if the expansion of a with respect to  is subsumed by the expansion of
c with respect to  in the empty tbox  the expansion procedure recursively substitutes
every defined concept occurring in a definition with its defining expression  such a procedure
may generate a tbox exponential in size  but it has been proved  nebel        that it works
in polynomial time under reasonable restrictions  the following interchangeably refers either
to reasoning with respect to a tbox or to reasoning involving expanded concepts with an
empty tbox  in particular  while devising the subsumption calculus for the logics considered
here  it is always assumed that all defined concepts have been expanded 

   towards a temporal description logics
schmiedel        proposed to extend description logics with an interval based temporal
logic  the temporal variant of the description logic is equipped with a model theoretic
semantics  the underlying description logic is flenr   donini et al          it differs
from alcf in that it does not contain the   and   concepts  it does not have neither
negation nor disjunction  and it has cardinality restrictions and conjunction over roles 
the new temporal term forming operators are the temporal qualifier at  the existential and
universal temporal quantifiers sometime and alltime  the qualifier operator specifies the
time at which a concept holds  the temporal quantifiers introduce the temporal variables
constrained by means of temporal relationships based on allen s interval algebra extended
with metric constraints to deal with durations  absolute times  and granularities of intervals 
to give an example of this temporal description logic  the concept of mortal can be defined
by 
 
mortal   livingbeing u  sometime x   after x now   at x   livingbeing   
with the meaning of a livingbeing at the reference interval now  who will not be alive
at an interval x sometime after the reference interval now  schmiedel does not propose
any algorithm for computing subsumption  but gives some preliminary hints  actually 
schmiedel s logic is argued to be undecidable  bettini         sacrificing the main benefit
of description logics  the possibility of having decidable inference techniques 
schmiedel s temporal description logic  when closed under complementation  contains
as a proper fragment the temporal logic hs proposed by halpern and shoham        
the logic hs is a propositional modal logic which extends propositional logic with modal
formul of the kind hri  and  r     where r is a basic allen s temporal relation and hi
   

fia temporal description logic for reasoning about actions and plans

and    are the possibility and necessity modal operators  for example  the modal formula
livingbeing   hafteri  livingbeing corresponds to the abovementioned mortal concept 
unfortunately  the hs logic is shown to be undecidable  at least for most interesting classes
of temporal structures   one gets decidability only in very restricted cases  such as when
the set of temporal models considered is a finite collection of structures  each consisting of
a finite set of natural numbers    halpern   shoham       
weida and litman              propose t rex  a loose hybrid integration between
description logics and constraint networks  plans are defined as collections of steps together
with temporal constraints between their duration  each step is associated with an action
type  represented by a generic concept in k rep   a non temporal description logic  thus
a plan is seen as a plan network  a temporal constraint network whose nodes  corresponding
to time intervals  are labeled with action types and are associated with the steps of the plan
itself  as an example of plan in t rex they show the plan of preparing spaghetti marinara 
 

defplan assemble spaghetti marinara
  step  boil spaghetti 
 step  make marinara 
 step  put together sm  
  step   before meets  step  
 step   before meets  step    

this is a plan composed by three actions  i e   boiling spaghetti  preparing marinara sauce 
and assembling all things at the end  temporal constraints between the steps establish
the temporal order in doing the corresponding actions  a structural plan subsumption
algorithm is defined  characterized in terms of graph matching  and based on two separate
notions of subsumption  pure terminological subsumption between action types labeling
the nodes  and pure temporal subsumption between interval relationships labeling the arcs 
the plan library is used to guide plan recognition  weida        in a way similar to that
proposed by kautz         even if this work has strong motivations  no formal semantics
is provided for the language and the reasoning problems 
starting from the assumption that an action has a duration in time  our proposal considers an interval based modal temporal logic   in the spirit of halpern and shoham       
  and reduces the expressivity of  schmiedel        in the direction of  weida   litman 
       while schmiedel s work lacks computational machinery  and halpern and shoham s
logic is undecidable  here an expressive decidable logic is obtained  providing sound and
complete reasoning algorithms  differently from t rex which uses two different languages
to represent actions and plans   a non temporal description logic for describing actions
and a second language to compose plans by adding temporal information   here an extension of a description logic is chosen in which time operators are available directly as term
constructors  this view implies an integration of a temporal domain in the semantic structure where terms themselves are interpreted  giving the formal way both for a well founded
notion of subsumption and for proving soundness and completeness of the corresponding
procedure  as an example of the formalism  the plan for preparing spaghetti marinara
introduced above is represented as follows

    y z w   y  before  meets  w  z  before  meets  w  
 boil spaghetti y u
make marinara z u
put together sm w 

assemble spaghetti marinara  

moreover  it is possible to build temporal structured actions   as opposed to the atomic
actions proposed in t rex   describing how the world state changes because of the occurrence of an action  in fact  our language allows for feature representation in order to relate
actions to states of the world  see section       this kind of expressivity is not captured
by t rex  since it uses a non temporal description logic to represent actions  the main
application of t rex is plan recognition  according to the ideas of kautz        a closed
world assumption  cwa   weida        is made  assuming that the plan library is complete and an observed plan will be fully accounted for by a single plan  cwa is not relied
on here  following the open world semantics characterizing description logics  weaker 
but monotonic  deductions are allowed in the plan recognition process  however  their procedures for recognizing a necessary  optional or impossible individual plan with respect to
a plan description is still applicable  if the plan library is given a closed world semantics 

   the feature temporal language tl f
the feature temporal language tl f is the basic logic considered here  this language is
composed of the temporal logic tl   able to express interval temporal networks   and the
non temporal feature description logic f   note that  each logic of the family of temporal
description logics introduced in this paper is identified by a composed string in which
the first part refers to the temporal part of the language while the other one refers to the
non temporal part 

    syntax
basic types of the language are concepts   individuals  temporal variables and intervals 
concepts can describe entities of the world  states and events  temporal variables denote
intervals bound by temporal constraints  by means of which abstract temporal patterns in
the form of constraint networks are expressed  concepts  resp  individuals  can be specified
to hold at a certain temporal variable  resp  interval   in this way  action types  resp 
individual actions  can be represented in a uniform way by temporally related concepts
 resp  individuals  
for the basic temporal interval relations the allen notation  allen         figure    is

figure    syntax rules for the interval description logic tl f
      a clarifying example

let us now informally see the intended meaning of the terms of the language tl f  for the
formal details see section       concept expressions are interpreted over pairs of temporal
intervals and individuals hi  ai  meaning that the individual a is in the extension of the concept at the interval i  if a concept is intended to describe an action  then its interpretation
can be seen as the set of individual actions of that type occurring at some interval 
within a concept expression  the special     variable denotes the current interval of
evaluation  in the case of actions  it is thought that it refers to the temporal interval
at which the action itself occurs  the temporal existential quantifier introduces interval
variables  related to each other and possibly to the   variable in a way defined by the set of
temporal constraints  to evaluate a concept at an interval x   different from the current one 
it is necessary to temporally qualify it at x   written c  x   in this way  every occurrence of

meaning of a concept with a temporal existential quantification can be understood with the

and actions occurring in the world with respect to the occurrence of the action itself  the
temporal constraints  x m    and    m y  state that the interval denoted by x should meet
the interval denoted by     the occurrence interval of the action type basic stack   and
that   should meet y  the parametric feature  block plays the role of formal parameter of
the action  mapping any individual action of type basic stack to the block to be stacked 
independently from time  please note that  whereas the existence and identity of the  block
of the action is time invariant  it can be qualified differently in different intervals of time 
e g   the  block is necessarily ontable only during the interval denoted by x 
let us comment now on the introduction of explicit temporal variables  the absence of
explicit temporal variables would weaken the temporal structure of a concept since arbitrary
relationships between more than two intervals could not be represented anymore  for
example  having only implicit intervals it is not possible to describe the situation in which
two concept expressions  say c and d  hold at two meeting intervals  say x  y  with the first
interval starting and the second finishing the reference interval  i e   the temporal pattern
 x meets y  x starts    y finishes    cannot be represented   more precisely  it is not possible
to represent temporal relations between more than two intervals if they are not derivable by
the temporal propagation of the constraints imposed on pairs of variables  while explicit
variables go against the general thrust of description logics  the gained expressive power
together with the observation that the variables are limited only to the temporal part of
the language are the main motivations for using them  however  it is easy to drop them by
limiting the temporal expressiveness as proposed by bettini         see also section    
an assertion of the type basic stack i  a  states that the individual a is an action of
the type basic stack occurred at the interval i  moreover  the same assertion implies that
a is related to a  block   say b  which is of type ontable at some interval j   meeting i  and
of type onblock at another interval l  met by i 
   since any concept is implicitly temporally qualified at the special   variable  it is not necessary to
explicitly qualify concepts at

an individual action is an object in the conceptual domain associated with the relevant
properties   or states   of the world affected by the individual action itself via a bunch of
features  moreover  temporal relations constrain time intervals imposing an ordering in the
change of the states of the world 

    semantics

in this section  a tarski style extensional semantics for the tl f language is given  and a
formal definition of the subsumption and recognition reasoning tasks is devised 
assume a linear  unbounded  and dense temporal structure t    p       where p is
a set of time points and   is a strict partial order on p   in such a structure  given an
interval x and a temporal relation r  it is always possible to find an interval y such that
 x  r  y    the assumption of linear time   which means that for any two points t  and
t  such that t   t  the set of points ft j t   t  t  g is totally ordered   fits the intuition
about the nature of time  so that the pair  t    t    can be thought as the closed interval of
points between t  and  t    the interval set of a structure t is defined as the set t   of all
closed intervals  u  v    fx   p j u  x  v  u    vg in t  
a primitive interpretation i    ht     i   i i consists of a set t    the interval set of
the selected temporal structure t    a set i  the domain of i    and a function i  the
primitive interpretation function of i   which gives a meaning to atomic concepts  features
and parametric features

atomic parametric features are interpreted as partial functions  they differ from atomic
features for being independent from time 
in order to give a meaning to temporal expressions present in generic concept expressions  figure   defines the temporal interpretation function  the temporal interpretation

figure    the interpretation function 
of a temporal constraint network is a set of variable assignments that satisfy the temporal
constraints  a variable assignment is a function v   x    t   associating an interval value to
a temporal variable  a temporal constraint network is consistent if it admits a non empty
interpretation  the notation  hx  tciefx    t   x    t      g   used to interpret concept expressions 
denotes the subset of hx  tcie where the variable xi is mapped to the interval value ti  
it is now possible to interpret generic concept expressions  consider the equations
introduced in figure    an interpretation function iv  t h  based on a variable assignment
v   an interval t and a set of constraints h   fx     t        g over the assignments of inner
variables  extends the primitive interpretation function in such a way that the equations
of figure   are satisfied  intuitively  the interpretation of a concept cvi  t h is the set of
entities of the domain that are of type c at the time interval t  with the assignment for the
free temporal variables in c given by v   see  c  x  iv  t h   and with the constraints for
the assignment of variables in the scope of the outermost temporal quantifiers given by h 
note that  h interprets the variable renaming due to the temporal substitutive qualifier  
see  c  y   x  iv  t h   and it takes effect during the choice of a variable assignment  as the
equation for    x   tc  c  iv  t h shows 
in absence of free variables in the concept expression   with the exception of    for
notational simplification the natural interpretation function cti   being equivalent to the
interpretation function cvi  t h with any v such that v       t and h     is introduced  the
set of interpretations fcvi  t hg obtained by varying i   v   t with a fixed h is maximal wrt set
inclusion if h      i e   the set of natural interpretations includes any set of interpretations
with a fixed h  in fact  since h represents a constraint in the assignment of variables  the
unconstrained set is the larger one  note that  for feature interpretation only the natural
one is used since it is not admitted to temporally qualify them

a concept c is subsumed by a concept d  c v d  if cti  dti for every interpretation i
and every interval t  an interpretation i is a model for a concept c if cti      for some t 
if a concept has a model  then it is satisfiable  otherwise it is unsatisfiable 
each tl f concept expression is always satisfiable  with the proviso that the temporal
constraints introduced by the existential quantifiers are consistent  this latter condition
can be easily checked during the reduction of the concept into a normal form when the
minimal temporal network  see section     definition      is computed 
it is interesting to note that only the relations s  f  mi are really necessary  because it is
possible to express any temporal relationship between two distinct intervals using only these
three relations and their transpositions si  fi  m  halpern   shoham         the following

to assign a meaning to abox axioms  the temporal interpretation function e is extended
to temporal intervals so that ie is an element of t   for each i   ot   the semantics of

be an instance of a concept c at the interval i if  j  c  i  a  
now we are able to give a semantic definition for the reasoning task we already called
specific plan recognition with respect to a plan description  this is an inference service that
computes if an individual action plan is an instance of an action plan type at a certain
interval  i e   the task known as instance recognition in the description logic community 
given a knowledge base   an interval i  an individual a and a concept c   the instance

   action and plan representation  two examples
an action description represents how the world state may evolve in relation with the possible
occurrence of the action itself  a plan is a complex action  it is described by means of
temporally related world states and simpler actions  the following introduces examples of
action and plan representations from two well known domains  the cooking domain  kautz

the applicability of our framework 

    the cooking domain
let us introduce the plan boil spaghetti 
 
boil spaghetti    x  x b      make spaghetti x u boil 
figure   shows the temporal dependencies of the intervals in which the concept boil spaghetti holds  the definition employs the   interval to denote the occurrence time of the
plan itself  in this way  it is possible to describe how different actions or states of the world
concurring to the definition of the plan are related to it  this is why the variable   is
explicitly present in the definition of boil spaghetti  instead of a generic variable  the
boil action should take place at the same time of the plan itself  while make spaghetti
occurs before it 
the definition of a plan can be reused within the definition of other plans by exploiting
the full compositionality of the language  the plan defined above boil spaghetti is used
in the definition of assemble spaghetti marinara 
 
assemble spaghetti marinara     y z w   y b w  z b w

in this case  precise temporal relations between the nodes of two corresponding temporal
constraint networks are asserted  e g   the action put together sm takes place strictly after
the boil action  figure     observe that the occurrence interval of the plan assemble spaghetti marinara does not appear in the figure because it is not temporally related with
any other interval 
a plan subsuming assemble spaghetti marinara is the more general plan defined below  prepare spaghetti  supposing that the action make sauce subsumes make marinara 
this means that among all the individual actions of the type prepare spaghetti there are

however  note that boil spaghetti does not subsume prepare spaghetti  even if it is a
conjunct in the definition of the latter  this could be better explained observing how the
definition of prepare spaghetti plan is expanded 
 
prepare spaghetti      x y z    x b y     make spaghetti x u boil y u
make sauce z  
then  the boil action occurs at the interval y   which can be different from the occurring
time of prepare spaghetti   as the effect of binding boil spaghetti to the temporal variable y  on the contrary  in the definition of boil spaghetti the boil action takes place necessarily at the same time  subsumption between prepare spaghetti and boil spaghetti
fails since different temporal relations between the actions describing the two plans and the
plans themselves are specified  in particular  observe that the boil spaghetti plan denotes
a narrower class than the plan expression
  x y   x b y    make spaghetti x u boil y 
which subsumes both prepare spaghetti and boil spaghetti itself 

    the blocks world domain

as a further example of the expressive power of the temporal language  it is now shown
how to represent the stack action in the blocks world  in a more detailed way than the
previous simple basic stack action used as a clarifying example  thus a stacking action
involves two blocks  which should be both clear at the beginning  the central part of the
action consists of grasping one block  at the end  the blocks are one on top of another  and
the bottom one is no longer clear  figure     
our representation borrows from the rat description logic  heinsohn  kudenko  nebel 
  profitlich        the intuition of representing action parameters by means of partial
functions mapping from the action itself to the involved action parameter  see section     in
the language  these functions are called parametric features  for example  the action stack
has the parameters  object  and  object   representing in some sense the objects that are
involved in the action independently from time  so  in the assertion   object  a  block a   
block a denotes the first object involved in the action a at any interval  on the other hand 
an assertion involving a  non parametric  feature  e g    on i  block a  block b    does not
imply anything about the truth value at intervals other than i 
the concept expression  which defines the stack action  makes use of temporal qualified
concept expressions  including feature selections and agreements  the expression   object   
clear block  x means that the second parameter of the action should be a clear block
   

fia temporal description logic for reasoning about actions and plans

at the interval denoted by x  while   object   on    object   y indicates that at the
interval y the object on which  object  is placed is  object   the formal definition of the
action stack is 
 
stack     x y z v w   x fi    y mi    z mi    v o    w f    w mi v   
   object    clear block  x u   object   on    object   y u
  object    clear block  v u   object    holding block  w u
  object    clear block  z  
the above defined concept does not state which properties are the prerequisites for the
stacking action or which properties must be true whenever the action succeeds  what this
action intuitively states is that  object  will be on  object  in a situation where both
objects are clear at the start of the action  note that the world states described at the
intervals denoted by v  w  z are the result of an action of grasping a previously clear block 
 
grasp     x w z    x o    w f    w mi x  z mi    
   object    clear block  x u   object    holding block  w u
  object    clear block  z  
the stack action can be redefined by making use of the grasp action 
 
stack     x y u v    x fi    y mi    u f    v o    
   object    clear block  x u   object   on    object   y u
 grasp x  v  u 
the temporal substitutive qualifier  grasp x  v  renames within the defined grasp action
the variable x to v and it is a way of making coreference between two temporal variables 
while the temporal constraints peculiar to the renamed variable x are inherited by the
substituting interval v  furthermore  the effect of temporally qualifying the grasping action
at u is that the   variable associated to the grasping action   referring to the occurrence
time of the action itself   is bound to the interval denoted by u  because of this binding on
the occurrence time of the grasping action  the   variable in the grasping action and the  
variable in the stacking action denote different time intervals  so that the grasping action
occurs at an interval finishing the occurrence time of the stacking action 
now it is shown how from a series of outside observations action recognition can be
performed   i e   the task called specific plan recognition with respect to a plan description 
the following abox describes a situation in which blocks can be clear  grasped and or on
each other  and in which a generic individual action a is taking place at time interval ia
having the blocks block a and block b as its parameters 

 object  a  block a    object  a  block b  
o i    ia    clear block i    block a   fi i    ia    clear block i    block b  
mi i    i     f  i    ia    holding block i    block a  
mi i    ia    clear block i    block a   mi i    ia    on i    block a  block b 
the system deduces that  in the context of a knowledge base  composed by the above
abox and the definition of the stack concept in the tbox  the individual action a is of
type stack at the time interval ia   i e    j  stack ia   a

   the calculus for tl f
this section presents a calculus for deciding subsumption between temporal concepts in the
description logic tl f   the calculus is based on the idea of separating the inference on
the temporal part from the inference on the description logic part  this is achieved by first
looking for a normal form of concepts  concept subsumption in the temporal language is
then reduced to concept subsumption between non temporal concepts and to subsumption
between temporal constraint networks

every tl f concept expression can be reduced to an equivalent existential concept of the
form    x   tc   q  u q   x  u       u qn xn    where each q is a non temporal concept  i e   it
is an element of the language f   a concept in existential form can be seen as a conceptual
temporal constraint network  i e   a labeled directed graph hx  tc  q x i where arcs are

labeled with a set of arbitrary temporal relationships   representing their disjunction  
nodes are labeled with non temporal concepts and  for each node x   the temporal relation

variables or substitutive qualifiers  in the following the natural interpretation function  see

for y the disjunctive concept expression  qz  t       t qzp   should be conjunctively added to

proposition      equivalence of cef  every concept in existential form can be reduced into an equivalent completed existential concept 

both the covering and the parameter introduction steps can be computed independently
after the   collapsing step and then conjoining the resulting concept expressions  observe
that  to obtain a completed existential concept  the steps of the normalization procedure
require linear time with the exception of the computation of the transitive closure of the
temporal relations  and the covering step  both these steps involve np complete temporal
constraint problems  van beek   cohen         however  it is possible to devise reasonable
subsets of allen s algebra for which the problem is polynomial  renz   nebel         the
most relevant properties of a concept in cef is that all the admissible interval temporal
relations are explicit and the concept expression in each node is no more refinable without
changing the overall concept meaning  this is stated by the following proposition

hx  tc   q u c   x iit    hx  tc  q x iit   for some interval t 

proof  the proposition states that the information in each node of the cef is independent
from the information in the other nodes  in fact  hx  tc   q u c   x iit   hx  tc  q x iit if
the concept expression in one node implies new information in some other node  two cases

i  covered nodes  both the    collapsing  rule and the  covering  rule provide to restrict a
covered node with the most specific f concept expression  indeed  the    collapsing  rule
provides collapsing two contemporary nodes conjoining the concept expressions of each of
them  on the other hand  the  covering  rule adds to the covered node the most specific
f concept expression that subsumes the disjunctive concept expression that is implicitly
true at the covered node  note that  thanks to the  closure  rule  all the possible equal
temporal relations are made explicit  so these two normalization rules cover all the possible
cases of temporal interactions between nodes 
ii  no coincident nodes  every time invariant information should spread over all the nodes 
both parametric features and the   concept have a time invariant semantics  the only timeinvariant concept expressions are     g           gn       g           gn    f           fm   with
n  m     or an arbitrary conjunction of these terms  the  parameter introduction  rule
captures all the possible syntactical cases of completion concerning time invariant concept
expressions  by induction on the syntax  it can be proven that adding to a node any other
concept expression changes the overall interpretation 
 
the last normalization procedure eliminates nodes with redundant information  this
final normalization step ends up with the concept in the essential graph form  that will be
the normal form used for checking concept subsumption 
definition      essential graph  the subgraph of the cef of a conceptual temporal constraint network t   hx  tc  q x i obtained by deleting the nodes labeled only with timeinvariant concept expressions   with the exception of the   node   is called essential graph
of t    ess t   
proposition      equivalence of essential graph  every concept in completed existential form can be reduced in linear time into an equivalent essential graph form 

theorem       equivalence of normal form  every concept expression can be reduced

into an equivalent essential graph form  if a polynomial fragment of allen s algebra is
adopted  the reduction takes polynomial time 
as an example  the normal form is shown   i e   the essential graph   of the previously
introduced stack action  see section      
 
stack     x y v w z   x fi    y mi    z mi    w f    v o    y mi x  z mi x  w f x 
 v  o  d  s  x  z     s  si  y  w m y  v b y  w m z   v b z   w mi v  
   object    clear block u  object       x u
  object  on    object   y u
  object    clear block u  object       v u
  object    hold block u  object       w u
  object    clear block u  object       z

in this example  the essential graph is also the cef of stack since there are no redundant
nodes 

    computing subsumption

a concept subsumes another one just in case every possible instance of the second is also an
instance of the first  for every time interval  thanks to the normal form  concept subsumption in the temporal language is reduced to concept subsumption between non temporal
concepts and to subsumption between temporal constraint networks  a similar general procedure was first presented in  weida   litman         where the language for non temporal
concepts is less expressive   it does not include features or parametric features 
to compute subsumption between non temporal concepts   which may possibly include
lcs concepts   we refer to  cohen  borgida    hirsh         in the following  we will write
 wf   for subsumption between non temporal f concepts taking into account lcs concepts 
definition       variable mapping  a variable mapping m is a total function m  
x      x   such that m         we write m x   to intend fm x   j x   x g  and m tc 
to intend f m x    r  m y    j  x  r  y     tcg 

definition       temporal constraint subsumption  a temporal constraint  x   r   y  
is said to subsume a temporal constraint  x   r   y    under a generic variable mapping m 
written  x   r   y    wm  x   r    y     if m x      x    m y      y  and  r   e   r   e
for every temporal interpretation e  
proposition       tc subsumption algorithm   x   r   y   wm  x   r   y   if and
only if m x      x    m y      y  and the disjuncts in r  are a superset of the disjuncts
in r   

proof  follows from the observation that the    temporal relations are mutually disjoint
and their union covers the whole interval pairs space 
 

definition       temporal constraint network subsumption  a temporal constraint
network hx     tc  i subsumes a temporal constraint network hx     tc  i under a variable mapping m   x      x     written hx     tc  i wm hx     tc  i  if hm x      m tc   ie  hx     tc  ie
for every temporal interpretation e  
proposition       tcn subsumption algorithm  hx    tc  i wm hx     tc i iff  after
computing the temporal transitive closure  there exists a variable mapping m   x      x  
such that for all x i   y j   x   exist x m   y n   x   which satisfy  x i  r i j   y j   wm
 x m  r m n   y n   

proof       since from definition       x i  r i j   y j   wm  x m  r m n   y n   implies that
 r i j  e   r m n  e for every e   then  from the definition of interpretation of a temporal
constraint network  it is easy to see that each assignment of variables v in the interpretation
of hx     tc  i is also an assignment in the interpretation of hm x      m tc   i 
     suppose that one is not able to find such a mapping  then  by hypothesis  for each
possible variable mapping there exists some i  j such that r i j is not a superset of r m n  
   

fia temporal description logic for reasoning about actions and plans

since  by assumption  the temporal constraint networks are minimal  the temporal relation
r m n cannot be further restricted  so  for each variable mapping and each temporal interpretation e   we can build an assignment v  such that hv   x m    v   x n  i    r m n  e while
hv   x i    v   x j  i     r i j  e   now  we can extend the assignment v  in such a way that
v     hx    tc  i e while v      hm x      m tc  i e   this contradicts the assumption that
 
hx    tc  i wm hx    tc  i 

definition       s mapping  an s mapping from a conceptual temporal constraint network hx     tc    q x   i to a conceptual temporal constraint network hx     tc    q x   i is a
variable mapping s   x      x   such that the non temporal concept labeling each node
in x   subsumes the non temporal concept labeling the corresponding node in s  x      and
hx    tc  i ws hx    tc i 
the algorithm for checking subsumption between temporal concept expressions reduces the
subsumer and the subsumee in essential graph form  then it looks for an s mapping between the essential graphs by exhaustive search  to prove the completeness of the overall
subsumption procedure it will be showed that the introduction of lcs s preserves the subsumption  a model theoretic characterization of the lcs will be given for showing this
property  let s start to build an herbrand model for an f concept  let c   x  denote the
first order formula corresponding to a concept c  see proposition       while the functionality of features can be expressed with a set of formul f   by syntax induction it easy to
show that c    x  is an existentially quantified formula with one free variable  moreover  the
matrices of such formula is a conjunction of positive predicates  f   fc    x g is logically
equivalent
to f   fc     x g where the functionality axioms allow to map every subformula
v
  
y  y ff  x  y  into   y ff  x  y   then c  x  is such that all the existential quantifiers in
c    x   which come from the first order conversion of features  are replaced by    quantifiers 
now  f   fc      a g   where a is a constant substituting the free variable x and c      a  is
obtained by skolemizing the    quantified variables   is a set of definite horn clauses 

definition       herbrand model  let c be an f concept expression  then we define
its minimal herbrand model hc as the minimal herbrand model of the above mentioned
set of definite horn clauses f   fc      a g 
lemma       f concept subsumption  let c  d be f concept expressions  and hc   hd
their minimal herbrand models obtained by skolemizing the first order set f  fc      a   d     a g 
then  c v d iff hd  hc  
proof  c v d iff f   fc    x g j  d   x   iff f   fc     x g j  d    x   where c    and d  
are obtained by applying the functionality axioms to the set fc    x   d   x g  i e   uni 

fying the variables in the functional predicates  and then replacing all the existential
quantifiers by    quantifiers  now  c      x  and d     x  are obtained by skolemizing the
   quantified variables in the following way  let c    x      y           yn x  y            yn  and let
d    x      y            yk   z            zm  x  y            yk   z            zm    with    k  n  then skolemize
the formula       y            yn   z            zm  x  y            yn      x  y            yk   z            zm    and
let    x  indicate its skolemized form  then  c      x       x  and d     x       x   now 
since every existential quantification in c     x   d    x  was of type     then the thesis is true

we are now able to give a model theoretic characterization of the lcs that will be crucial
to prove the subsumption preserving property 
lemma       lcs model property  let q           qn be f concept expressions  and hq   
        hqn their minimal herbrand models obtained by skolemizing the first order set f  
fq      a           q   n  a g  then  q   lcsfq            qn g iff hq   hq            hqn  
proof  first of all  let show that hq is the minimal herbrand model of a concept q in
the language f   every hqi can be seen as a rooted directed acyclic graph where nodes
are labelled with  possible empty  set of atomic concepts and arcs with atomic features
while equality constraints between nodes correspond to features agreement  whithout loss
of generality let us consider the case where hq   hq    hq    it is sucient to show
that hq is a rooted directed acyclic graph  let a be the root of hq    hq    then will be
proved by induction that if fi  ai     ai     hq  where fi is the first order translation of a
feature  ai     ai are obtained as a result of the skolemization process  and a    a  then
ff   a  a             fi  ai    ai  g  hq  the case i     is trivial  let i      now  fi  ai     ai   
hq iff fi ai     ai     hq    hq    but ai   is uniquely defined by the skolem function
ffi    where  the function symbols ffi are newly generated for each feature fi by the
skolemization process   then  fi  ai     ai     hq    hq  iff fi  ai     ffi    ai      hq    hq 
iff fi    ai     ffi    ai      hq    hq    then the thesis is true by induction 
let us now prove the     direction  suppose by absurd that there is an f concept c
such that  q  v c   q  v c   c   q  then  q  v c iff hc  hq    and q  v c   iff
hc  hq    but then hc  hq    hq    i e   hc  hq  then q v c which contradicts the
hypothesis 
the     direction can be proved with analogous considerations

the following theorem provides a sound and complete procedure to compute subsumption  the completeness proof takes into account that the temporal structure is dense and
unbounded  this allows us to introduce any new node to a conceptual temporal constraint
network without changing its meaning  remember that  for each of these redundant nodes 
time invariant information holds 
theorem       tl f concept subsumption  a concept c  subsumes a concept c  iff
there exists an s mapping from the essential graph of c  to the essential graph of c   
   

fia temporal description logic for reasoning about actions and plans

proof  let t    hx     tc    q x   i be the essential graph of c    and t    hx     tc    q x   i
be the essential graph of c   
      soundness   follows from the fact that the essential graph form is logically equivalent to the starting concept  and from the soundness of the procedures for computing
both the tcn subsumption  proposition       and the subsumption between non temporal
concepts  cohen et al         
      completeness   suppose that such an s mapping does not exist  two main cases
can be distinguished 
i  there is not a mapping m such that hx     tc  i wm hx     tc  i  by adding redundant
nodes to t    an equivalent conceptual temporal constraint network t    hx     tc    q x   i
may be obtained  let us consider such an extended network
in a way that there exists a


variable mapping m such that hx     tc  i wm hx     tc  i  now  for all possible m   there
is a node x i   x   such that m  x i     x j with x j    x     now  q i  wf q j   since x j
cannot coincide with other nodes in x   neither can have a covering otherwise the hypothesis
that the mapping m does not exist would be contradicted  then from proposition     q j
is in a time invariant node  whereas q i is not since t  is an essential graph  then  although
the construction of m allows for the existence of a unique v   for both networks  follows
from proposition        it is possible to build an instance of t  that is not an instance of t   
ii  for each possible mapping m such that hx     tc  i wm hx     tc  i there will be always
two nodes x i and x j such that m x i     x j and q i  wf q j   now  the concept expression q j cannot be refined  looking for a subsumption relationship with q i   by adding
to it an f concept since from proposition     this would change the overall interpretation 
on the other hand  the lcs introduction   which would substitute the more specific concept disjunction implicitly presents because of a node covering   is a subsumption invariant
concept substitution  as showed by lemma      
both cases contradict the assumption that t  subsumes t   
 
      complexity of subsumption

now it is shown that checking subsumption between tl f concept expressions in the essential graph form is an np complete problem  therefore  a polynomial reduction from the
np complete problem of deciding whether a graph contains an isomorphic subgraph is presented  it is then shown that the subsumption computation  as proposed in theorem      
can be done by a non deterministic algorithm that takes polynomial time in the size of the
concepts involved  first of all let us consider the complexity of computing subsumption
between non temporal concepts 

lemma       f subsumpion complexity  let c  d be f concept expressions that can
contain lcs s  then  checking whether c vf d takes polynomial time 
proof  see  cohen et al         
 
here the problem of subgraph isomorphism is briey recalled  given two graphs  g   
 v    e    and g     v    e     g  contains a subgraph isomorphic to g  if there exists a
   since subsumption is computed with respect to a fixed evaluation time  v maps the different occurrences
of   to the same interval  this justifies the choice that m

and fvi   vj g   e   this transformation allows us to prove that the problem of subgraph
isomorphism can be reduced to the subsumption of temporal concepts 
proposition      given two graphs g  and g   g  contains a subgraph isomorphic to g 
iff c  w c    where c  and c  are the corresponding temporal concepts expressions 
proof  a temporal network with edges labeled only with the  before   after  relation is always
consistent  minimal and non directed   gerevini   schubert         then  each temporal
concept is in the essential graph form  now the proof easily follows since  every time g  is
an isomorphic subgraph of g  the one to one function f is also an s mapping from c  to
c    and it is true that c  w c    on the other hand  the s mapping that gives rise to the
subsumption is also the one to one isomorphism from g  to g   
 

theorem       np hardness  concept subsumption between tl f concept expressions
in normal form is an np hard problem 

proof  follows from proposition      and the reduction being clearly polynomial 
now the np completeness is proven 

 

theorem       np completeness  concept subsumption between tl f concept expressions in normal form is an np complete problem 

proof  to prove np completeness it is necessary to show that the proposed calculus can
be solved by a nondeterministic algorithm that takes polynomial time  now  given two
temporal concepts  t  and t    in their essential graph form  let j x   j  n  and j x   j  n   
then  to check whether t  w t    the algorithm guesses one of the n n  variable mapping
from t  to t  and verifies whether it is an s mapping  too  this last step can be done in
deterministic polynomial time since  given a mapping m  it is possible to determine whether
hx    tc  i wm hx    tc i by checking at most n  n         edges looking for subsumption
between the corresponding temporal relations  solved by a set inclusion procedure   while
the n  non temporal concept subsumptions can be computed in polynomial time 
 

   extending the propositional part of the language

the propositional part of the temporal language can be extended to have a more powerful 
but still decidable  description logic  it is possible either to add full disjunction  both at
the temporal and non temporal levels  tlu  fu    or to have a propositionally complete
language at the non temporal level only  tl alcf   
please note that in these languages it is not possible to express full negation  and
in particular the negation of the existential temporal quantifier  this is crucial  and it
   if  vi  b  a  vj   then  vj  b  a  vi    too

normal form

in computing subsumption  a normal form for concepts is needed  the normalization procedure is similar to that reported in section      let us start by reducing each concept
expression into an equivalent disjunctive concept of the form

where gi are conjunctions of concepts of the form qik  xik   and each q does not contain
neither temporal information  nor disjunctions  i e   it is an element of the language f  
proposition      equivalence of disjunctive form  every concept c can be reduced
into an equivalent disjunctive form  df c    by exhaustively applying the set of rewrite rules
of figure    in addition to the rules introduced in figure    
it is now possible to compute the completed disjunctive normal form  cdnf c    each disjunct of such normal form has some interesting properties  which are crucial for the proof
of the theorem     on concept subsumption  temporal constraints are always explicit  i e  
any two intervals are related by a basic temporal relation  there is no disjunction  either

subsumption

the theorem     reduces subsumption between cdnf concepts into subsumption of disjunction free concepts  such that the results of theorem      can be applied  the following
theorem gives a terminating  sound  and complete subsumption calculus for tlu  fu  
theorem      tlu  fu concept subsumption  let c   c  t    t cm and d   d  t
   t dn be tlu  fu concepts in cdnf  then  c v d if and only if  i j   ci v dj  
proof  since it is easy to show that c  t       t cn v d iff  i ci v d we need only to prove the
restricted thesis  ci v d  t  t dn iff ci v d            ci v dn   every concept expression in
cdnf corresponds to an existential quantified formula with two free variables  moreover 
the matrices of such formul are conjunctions of positive predicates  let us denote the
formula corresponding to a concept c as c    t  x   now  the restricted thesis holds iff it is
true that f   fci     a  b g j  d      a  b    d      a  b   now  let hb the minimal herbrand model
of f  fci     a  b g  then  f  fci     a  b g j  d      a  b    d      a  b  iff hb j  d      a  b    d      a  b  
since we are talking of a single model  d      a  b    d      a  b  is valid in hb if and only if either
d      a  b  or d      a  b  is valid in hb   this proves the theorem  
 
   the proof of this theorem comes from an idea of werner nutt 

   

fia temporal description logic for reasoning about actions and plans

as a consequence of the theorems           the following complexity result holds 

theorem      tlu  fu subsumption complexity  concept subsumption between tlu  fu
concept expressions in normal form is an np complete problem 

    a propositionally complete language  tl alcf
tl alcf uses the propositionally complete description logic alcf  hollunder   nutt 
      for non temporal concepts by changing the syntax rules for tl f in the following
way 

e  f   fu j   j  e j p   q j p  j  p  e j  p  e  alcf  

the interpretation functions are extended to take into account roles 
p i  t    i  i
pti   p t  i  i j  a  b  ha  bi   p t   ht  a  bi   p i
as seen in section    alcf adds to f full negation   thus introducing disagreement  p   q 
and undefinedness  p    for features  and role quantification   p  e   p  e   
as an example of the expressive power gained  let us refine the description of the world
states involved in the stack action  see section       suppose that a block is described by
saying that it has lateral sides  role  and bottom  and top sides  features   then  the
property of being clear could be represented as follows 
 
clear block   block u  lateral side clear u top side   has above  
which says that  in order to be clear  each lateral side has to be clear and nothing has
to be over the top side  now  the situation in which a block involved in a stack action is
on top of another one is reformulated with the following concept expression 
  object  top side  has above    object

      the calculus for tl alcf

this section presents a calculus for deciding subsumption between temporal concepts in
the description logic tl alcf   again  the calculus is based on the idea of separating the
inference on the temporal part from the inference on the description logic part   valcf    
and adopting standard procedures developed in the two areas

independence  is now true for tl alcf concepts in cef  observe that  to obtain a cef
concept  the steps of the normalization procedure require the computation of the transitive
closure of the temporal relations   which is an np complete problem  van beek   cohen          and the computation of alcf subsumption   which is a pspace complete
problem  hollunder   nutt        
before the presentation of the last normalization phase  which will eliminate redundant
nodes  it is now possible to check whether a concept expression is satisfiable 
proposition      concept satisfiability  a tl alcf concept in cef  hx  tc  q x i 
is satisfiable  with the proviso that the temporal constraints are satisfiable  if and only if the
non temporal concepts labeling each node in x are satisfiable  checking satisfiability of a
tl alcf concept in cef is a pspace complete problem 
proof  is a direct consequence of the node independence established by proposition     
which is true also for tl alcf concepts in cef 
 
the normalization procedure now goes on by rewriting unsatisfiable concepts to   and
then computing the essential graph form for satisfiable concepts  this last phase is more
   

fiartale   franconi

complex than for the other temporal languages considered in this paper essentially because
alcf can express the   concept by means of a concept expression  e g       a t  a  
from this consideration it follows that in tl alcf a redundant node can be derived from
a complex concept expression  e g   both a t a  and  g   a t  g    a are redundant nodes  
the key idea is that all the time invariant information is present in the   node thanks to
the cef  thus it is needed only to extract this information from the   node by computing
the disjunctive normal form of q    applying the   translation  and then testing whether
q    valcf qi  for a given node xi

temporal constraint network t   hx  tc  q x i obtained by deleting the nodes xi such that
q    valcf qi   with the exception of the   node   is called essential graph of t    ess t   

proposition       equivalence of essential graph  every cef concept can be reduced
into an equivalent essential graph form  and  obviously  every concept can be reduced into
an equivalent essential graph form  
subsumption

the overall normalization procedure reduces the subsumption problem in tl alcf to the
subsumption between alcf concepts 

theorem       tl alcf concept subsumption  a concept c  subsumes a concept
c  if and only if there exists an s mapping from the essential graph of c  to the essential
graph of c   

the above theorem gives a sound and complete algorithm for computing subsumption between tl alcf concepts  the proof is the same as the one for theorem        the subsumption problem is now pspace hard  since satisfiability and subsumption for alcf
concepts were proven to be pspace complete  hollunder   nutt        

   extending the expressivity for states
the following suggests how to extend the basic language to cope with important issues in
the representation of states   i  homogeneity allows us to consider properties of the world  
peculiar to states   which remain true in each subinterval of the interval in which they hold 
 ii  persistence guarantees that a state holding as an effect of an action continues to hold
unless there is no evidence of its falsity at some time  an approach to the frame problem is
then presented  showing a possible solution to one of the most  in famous problems in ai
literature  the following subsections shall be interested more in semantically characterizing
actions and states than on computational properties  the extensions proposed now to the
temporal languages are for having a full edged description logic for time and action 

    homogeneity

in the temporal literature homogeneity characterizes the temporal behavior of world states 
when a state holds over an interval of time t  it also holds over subintervals of t  thus  if

figure     temporal dependencies in the definition of the simple stack action 
a block is on the table for a whole day  one can conclude that it is also on the table in the
morning  on the other hand  actions are not necessarily homogeneous  in the linguistic
literature a difference is made between activity and performance verbs  the distinction
comes out in the fact that activity verbs do have sub events that are denoted by the same
verb  whereas performance verbs do not  generally  activity verbs represent ongoing events 
for example to eat and to run  and can be described as homogeneous predicates  whereas
performance verbs represent events with a well defined granularity in time  such as to prepare
spaghetti  performance verbs are an example of anti homogeneous events  if they occur over
an interval of time t  then they do not occur over a subinterval of t  as they would not yet
be completed 
the language is extended by introducing the homogeneity operator 

c  d   rc

 homogeneous concept 

the semantics of homogeneous concepts is easily given in terms of the semantics of the
temporal universal quantifier  rc   x  x     s  d  f       c  x  this means that rc
is an homogeneous concept if and only if when it holds at an interval it remains true at
each subinterval  in particular   x universally qualifies the temporal variable x  while the
temporal constraint  x     s  d  f      imposes that x is a generic interval contained in   
moreover  it is always true that rc v c   i e   rc is a more specific concept than c  
let us consider as an example a more accurate definition of the basic stack action
 see section        
 
simple stack     x y   x m      m y       block   rontable  x u
  block   ronblock  y 
figure    shows the temporal dependencies of the intervals in which the simple stack
holds  the difference with the basic stack action is the use of the homogeneity operator 
in fact  since the predicates ontable and onblock denote states  their homogeneity should
be explicitly declared  the assertion simple stack i  a  says that a is an individual action
of type simple stack occurred at interval i  moreover  the same assertion implies that a
is related to a  block  say b  which is of type ontable at some interval j   meeting i   and
at all intervals included in j   while it is of type onblock at another interval l   met by i  
and at all intervals included in l 
simple stack i  a      b   block a  b     j  l  m j  i    m i  l   
      l      s  d  f      j         s  d  f    l  l

dependencies are depicted in figure    
 
instant stack     z y     f z     m y       block   rontable  z u
  block   ronblock  y 
subsumption holds because the class of intervals   obtained by homogeneity of the state
ontable as defined in the simple stack action   including x and all its subintervals is a
subset of the class of intervals over which the block is known to be on the table  according
to the definition of instant stack   this latter class includes all the subintervals of z  
if the instant stack action had been defined without the r operator  then it would not
specialize any more the simple stack action  in fact  according to such a weaker definition
of instant stack  specifying that the object is on the table at z does not imply that the
object is on the table at subintervals of z   in particular  it is not possible to deduce any
more that the object is on the table at x and its subintervals  as specified in the definition of
simple stack action  moreover  the weak instant stack action type would not specialize
the weak simple stack action type   i e   basic stack   too  thus  homogeneity helps
us to define states and actions in a more accurate way  such that important inferences are
captured 
as seen above  the definition of homogeneity makes use of universal temporal quantification  remember that subsumption in a propositionally complete description logic
with both existential and universal temporal quantification is undecidable and it is still an
open problem if it becomes decidable in absence of negation  bettini         the homogeneity operator is a restricted form of universal quantification  an even more restricted
form interests us here  where the concept c in rc does not contain any other temporal
operator  called simple homogeneous concept   the expressiveness of the resulting logic is
enough  for example  to correctly represent the homogeneous nature of states  in  artale 
bettini    franconi        an algorithm to compute subsumption in tl f augmented with
the homogeneity operator is proposed  even if a formal proof is still not available  good
arguments are discussed to conjecture its completeness  this would also prove decidability
of this logic and of the corresponding modal logics 

    persistence
this section shows how our framework can be successfully extended in a general way to
cope with inertial properties  in the basic temporal language  a property holding  say  as
a post condition of an action at a certain interval  is not guaranteed to hold anymore at
other included or subsequent intervals  this is the reason why we propose an extended

as a motivation for introducing the possibility of representing persistent properties in the
language  this section considers how to solve the frame problem  and in particular the
famous example of the yale turkey shooting scenario  sandewall        allen   ferguson 
       formerly known as the yale shooting problem 
an inertia operator      is introduced here  intuitively    c is currently true if it was
true at a preceding interval   say i   and there is no evidence of the falsity of c at any
interval between the current one and i  thus  the property of an individual of being of type
c persists over time  unless a contradiction arises 
the formalization of the inertia operator makes use of the epistemic operator k  donini 
lenzerini  nardi  schaerf    nutt         in which kc denotes the set of individuals known
to be instances of the concept c    

definition      inertia    c  j  a  iff
 i  start i   start j     c  i  a   
 h  start h   end i    end h   end j      k c  h  a  
where start and end are two functions giving respectively the starting and the ending point
of an interval   conditions on endpoints are simpler and more readable than their equivalents
on interval relations   k c  h  a  means that it is not known that a is not of type c at
interval h  furthermore  the following relation holds   a  j   c  j  a      c  j  a   i e     c
subsumes c   the above definition can be captured by a temporal language equipped with
the epistemic operator   k   and the homogeneity operator   r

is still loaded at j  by inertia   iv  since the gun is not unloaded at j    the target fred must
be dead 
since the inertia operator is useful to describe the behavior of properties  which are
characterized as homogeneous concepts  a simple way of representing persistence in the
context of homogeneous concepts is proposed 
proposition     let p be a property   i e   p    rp   is an homogeneous concept   and
 a knowledge base such that   j  p  j  a     p  j  a  is true in    i e    j    p  j  a   
if and only if two intervals i  k exist such that   j   start i   start j     p  i  a   and
   fs i  k   f  j  k   p  k  a g is satisfiable 
proof  the entailment test verifies the first part of the definition of inertia  while the
satisfiability test verifies that  between the interval at which the system knows that the
individual a belongs to p   i   and the interval at which p  a  is deduced by inertia   j
  does not exist an interval h at which the system knows that p  a  is false  indeed  such
interval h would be related to the interval k by the relation in and since it is supposed
that p is homogeneous  the knowledge base with  p  h  a    p  k  a    in h  k  would be
inconsistent 
 
the deduction p  j  a      p  j  a  can be obtained as a particular case of the above stated

baader and laux        integrate modal operators for time and belief in a terminological
system looking for an adequate semantics for the resulting combined language  the major
point in this paper is the possibility of using modal operators not only inside concept

shows the notion of happy father  where different modalities interact 
 bel john  happy father     married to  woman u  bel john pretty  u
hfuturei child graduate 
in this case  it is john s belief that a happy father is someone married to a woman believed
to be pretty by john  and whose children will be graduates sometime in the future  the
semantics has a kripke style  each modal operator is interpreted as an accessibility relation
on a set of possible worlds  while the domain of objects is split into  possible  different
domain objects  each one depending on a given world  this latter choice captures the case of 
different definitions for the same concept   such as  bel john  a   b   and  bel peter  a  
c     since the two formul are evaluated in different worlds  the main restriction is that
all the modal operators do not satisfy any specific axioms for belief or time  on the other

description logic to represent both the world states and atomic actions  a second formalism
is added to compose actions in plans and to reason about simple temporal relationships  no
explicit temporal constraints can be expressed in the language  rat actions are defined by
the change of the world state they cause  and they are instantaneous as in the strips like
systems  while plans are linear sequences of actions  the most important service offered
by rat is the simulated execution of part of a plan  checking if a given plan is feasible
and  if so  computing the global pre  and post conditions  the feasibility test is similar
to the usual consistency check for a concept description  they temporally project the preand post conditions of individual actions composing the plan  respectively backward and
forward  if this does not lead to an inconsistent initial  final or intermediate state  the plan
is feasible and the global pre  and post conditions are determined as a side effect

fact  processes become uents  with instantaneous events   start fluent  and finish fluent 
  which respectively make true or false the corresponding uent  and with persistence
assumptions that make the uent true during the interval  for example  in a blocks world
the picking up process is treated as a uent with start picking up x   and finish pickingup x   instantaneous actions that enable or falsify the picking up uent 

    conclusions
the main objective of this paper was the design of a class of logical formalisms for uniformly representing time  actions and plans  according to this framework  an action has a
duration in time  it can have parameters  which are the ties with the temporal evolution
of the world  and it is possibly associated over time with other actions  a model theoretic
semantics including both a temporal and an object domain was developed  for giving both
a meaning to the language formul and a well founded definition of the various reasoning
services  allowing us to prove soundness and completeness of the corresponding algorithms 
the peculiar computational properties of this logic make it an effective representation and
reasoning tool for plan recognition purposes  an action taxonomy based on subsumption
can be set up  and it can play the role of a plan library for plan retrieval tasks 
this paper contributes to exploration of the decidable realm of interval based temporal
extensions of description logics  it presented complete procedures for subsumption reasoning with tl f   tlu  fu and tl alcf   in addition  the subsumption problem for
tl f was proven an np complete problem  the subsumption procedures are based on
an interpretation preserving transformation that operates a separation between the temporal and the non temporal parts of the formalism  thus  the calculus can adopt distinct
standard procedures developed in the description logics community and in the temporal
constraints community  to obtain decidable languages the key idea was to restrict the temporal expressivity by eliminating the universal quantification on temporal variables  while
a propositionally complete description logic with both existential and universal temporal
quantification is undecidable  it is still an open problem if it becomes decidable in absence
of negation  with the introduction of the homogeneity operator investigation of the impact
of a restricted form of temporal universal quantification in the language tl f was begun 
several extensions were proposed to the basic temporal language  with the possibility
to specify homogeneous predicates the temporal behavior of world states can be described
in a more natural way  while the introduction of the non monotonic inertial operator gives
rise to some forms of temporal prediction  another extension   not considered in this paper
  deals with the possibility of relating an action to more elementary actions  decomposing

first author wishes to acknowledge also ladseb cnr of padova and the university of
firenze for having supported part of his work  some of the work carried on for this paper
was done while the second author was working at itc irst  trento  this work owes a lot to
our colleagues claudio bettini and alfonso gerevini  for having introduced us many years
ago to the temporal maze  special thanks to achille c  varzi  for taking time to review the
technical details of the paper and for his insightful comments on the philosophy of events 
and to fausto giunchiglia  for useful discussions and feedback  thanks to paolo bresciani

earlier drafts of the paper  werner nutt and luciano serafini helped us to have a deeper
insight into logic  we would also like to thank carsten lutz for the helpful discussions we
had with him about temporal representations  many anonymous referees checked out many
errors of previous versions of the paper  all the errors of the paper are  of course  our own
