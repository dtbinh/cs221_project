abstract
although manipulation bribery extensively studied weighted voting  almost work done election control weighted voting 
unfortunate  since weighted voting appears many important natural settings 
paper  study complexity controlling outcome weighted elections
adding deleting voters  obtain polynomial time algorithms  np completeness results  many np complete cases  approximation algorithms  particular  scoring rules completely characterize complexity weighted voter control  work
shows quite important cases  either polynomial time exact algorithms
polynomial time approximation algorithms exist

examples given ones weightings created individuals
forming blocks  occur even highly political contexts 
example  us house representatives  issues  for example  water rights farm
subsidies  states delegation tends vote block parochial interests
states constituents companies  pressure lobbyists state delegations abstain
given vote effect  give take issues failing quorum  control
deleting voters attack 
however  many voting cases weights inherent standalone individual voters  many cases control attacks may well occur 
example  consider us corporate elections  these  vote stockholder weighted
number shares  natural way frame control problems
setting case adding deleting candidates  example  regarding running
spot company officer director  even voter control come play here 
example  actor sending mailings toor phoning speaking tovoters
convince abstain voting  encourage voters vote election 
 the bound additions deletions model counts number voters  rather
weights  quite reasonable setting  regardless weight  given
targeted voter addressed by  example  mailing visit phone call  although
reality one admittedly might focus resources biggest stockholders  
many weighted control examples presented  let us finish
extremely high stakes example  us electoral college  works
majority rule among electors  electors state usually vote block 
since system lets whoever greatest popular vote given state select every
elector state  note  two fifty states different policies   thus issue
of  example  whether someone ralph nader run 
withdraw name consideration particular time  sweeping
effect nation  effect weighted control adding deleting candidates

giving detailed proof  let us informally give sense proofs idea 
let z candidate allegedly gap gbw added  maxd id voters

clearly gap point time gbw frozen  assumed
gap cant exist case  proof argues relatively   maxd id
voters added gbw  i e    maxd id    them  approve z  equivalently 
least       maxd id approve z   arrive contradiction 
latter argument subtle one  involving asking candidates  call y  gap
