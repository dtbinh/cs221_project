abstract
although manipulation and bribery have been extensively studied under weighted voting  there has been almost no work done on election control under weighted voting  this
is unfortunate  since weighted voting appears in many important natural settings  in this
paper  we study the complexity of controlling the outcome of weighted elections through
adding and deleting voters  we obtain polynomial time algorithms  np completeness results  and for many np complete cases  approximation algorithms  in particular  for scoring rules we completely characterize the complexity of weighted voter control  our work
shows that for quite a few important cases  either polynomial time exact algorithms or
polynomial time approximation algorithms exist 

   introduction
in many real world election systems the voters come with weights  examples range from
stockholder elections weighted by shares  to the us electoral college  to the often used example of the nassau county board of supervisors  to  in effect  any parliamentary system
in which the parties typically vote as blocks  to swedens system of wealth weighted voting
instituted in       and no longer used  where the wealthiest members of the rural communities received as many as       votes and in    percent of the districts the weighted
votes of just three voters could be decisive  congleton         furthermore  there are
many important voting applications within multiagent systems  e g   in recommender systems  ghosh  mundhe  hernandez    sen        lu   boutilier         planning  ephrati
  rosenschein         and web search  dwork  kumar  naor    sivakumar         in these
applications  it is quite natural for the voters  i e   agents  to be weighted  e g   by the
amount of trust we put in them or by the power of the resources they possess  
so it is not surprising that in the study of manipulative attacks on elections  weighted
voting has been given great attention  for bribery and manipulation  two of the three most
studied types of manipulative attacks on elections  study of the case of weighted voters
has been extensively conducted  yet for the remaining one of the three most studied types

of attacks on elections  so called control attacks  almost no attention has been given to
the case of weighted voting  to the best of our knowledge  the only time this issue has
been previously raised is in two m s  ph d  theses  russell        lin         this lack of
attention is troubling  since the key types of control attacks  such as adding and deleting
voters  certainly do occur in many weighted elections  as a coda to this section  we will
give some examples 
we study the complexity in weighted elections of arguably the most important types
of controladding and deleting votersfor various election systems  we focus on scoring
rules  families of scoring rules  condorcet consistent rules  and weakcondorcet consistent
rules  control by deleting  adding  voters asks whether in a given election a given candidate
can be made to win by deleting  adding  at most a certain number of the voters  at most
a certain number of the members of the pool of potential additional voters   these control
types model issues that are found in many electoral settings  ranging from human to electronic  they are  abstractions of  issues often faced by people seeking to steer an election 
such as experts doing campaign management  and deciding for example which k people to
offer rides to the polls  adding and deleting voters also can occur in multiagent systems 
for example  if agents are entities over the internet  then one can attempt a denial of service
attack on some of them to prevent their votes from arriving on time  on the other hand 
adding voters pertains to simply encouraging some agents to vote  multiplying the existing
agents  or performing false name attacks  for false name attacks in related settings  see  for
example  wagman   conitzer        waggoner  xia    conitzer        aziz  bachrach 
elkind    paterson        
control was introduced  without weights  in      in the seminal paper by bartholdi 
tovey  and trick         control has been the subject of much attention since  that attention  and the present paper  are part of the line of work  started by bartholdi  tovey 
and trick              and bartholdi and orlin         that seeks to determine for which
types of manipulative attacks on elections the attackers task requires just polynomial time
computation  for a more detailed discussion of this line of work  we refer the reader to the
related work section at the end of the paper and to the surveys of faliszewski  hemaspaandra  hemaspaandra  and rothe         faliszewski  hemaspaandra  and hemaspaandra
        and brandt  conitzer  and endriss        
our main results are as follows  see section   for tables summarizing our results   first 
in section     we provide a detailed study of the complexity of voter control under scoring
protocols  for the case of fixed numbers of candidates  we show that both constructive
control by adding voters and constructive control by deleting voters are in p for t approval
 and so this also covers plurality and t   veto    and are np complete otherwise  it is interesting to compare this result to an analogous theorem regarding weighted coalitional
manipulation  there are cases where the complexities of voter control and manipulation
are the same  e g   for plurality or for borda  but there are also cases where voter control
is easier  t approval for t     for elections with more than t candidates   is it ever possible that weighted voter control is harder than weighted voting manipulation  we show
that weighted voter control is np hard for condorcet consistent rules with at least three
candidates  and so clearly is also np hard for weakcondorcet consistent rules with at least
   if the number of candidates is fixed  then t veto can be expressed as  m  t  approval  where m is the
number of candidates  if the number of candidates is unbounded  then t veto is not t   approval

three candidates   since weighted coalitional manipulation for the   candidate llull system
is in p  faliszewski  hemaspaandra    schnoor         together with the fact that llull is
weakcondorcet consistent  this implies that there is a setting where weighted voter control
is harder than weighted coalitional manipulation 
in sections     and     we focus on the complexity of weighted voter control under
t approval and t veto  for the case of unbounded numbers of candidates  at the start of
section      we will explain why these are the most interesting cases  in section     we
resolve six problems left open by lin         we establish the complexity of weighted
control by adding voters for   approval    veto  and   approval  and of weighted control
by deleting voters for   approval    veto  and   veto  in section      we give polynomialtime approximation algorithms for weighted voter control under t approval and t veto  our
algorithms seek to minimize the number of voters that are added or deleted 
we believe that the complexity of weighted voter control  and more generally the complexity of attacks on weighted elections  is an important and interesting research direction
that deserves much further study  in particular  our research suggests that it is worthwhile
to seek approximation algorithms for weighted elections problems and that doing so can
lead to interesting algorithms 

   motivation for studying control in weighted elections
in the introduction  we noted the importance of weights in many electoral settings and
described the natural importance ofand gave pointers to the extensive line of work
studyingcontrol attacks in many  unweighted  settings  we also stated that control attacks can naturally be expected to occur even in many weighted election settings 
in the present section  we give some examples motivating the study of weighted electoral
control 
let us consider an academic department that has as its salient issue in a particular
term the question of what course to add to its b s  majors requirements  suppose the
department is highly polarized on this issue by research area  i e   all the faculty in a given
research area will vote as a block  either because they all agree  or because by tradition
they meet before the actual faculty meetings to  within their group  reach a group position
that they will all support   and suppose that for each group there are days times where
the entire group would be unlikely to attend  e g   because that time is the time of the
major yearly research conference in that area  the department chair  knowing that he or
she has the power to schedule when faculty meetings are held  and what the agenda is at
each meeting  might well model his or her task as a weighted control by deleting voters
problem  in which the voters are the groups  each groups weight is the number of faculty
members in the groups  and the deletion limit is one 
in fact  more generally  individual voters may blur into a collection of weighted votes in
settings where the voter set partitions into groups that will express identical preferences  as
another example of this sort  at one of the authors schools  members of the faculty senate
are chosen by the election system known as single transferable vote  however  it is not
unheard of for departmental leaders to send out a friendly suggestion to the departments
members regarding for whom to vote  if one assumes that the departments vote as blocks 
and one is trying to decide which candidates to add to the election  or convince not to
   

fifaliszewski  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra

run in the election  in order to make a given candidate win  or not win   one in effect is
studying weighted constructive control by adding candidates  weighted constructive control
by deleting candidates  weighted destructive control by adding candidates  or weighted
destructive control by deleting candidates 
the examples just given were ones where the weightings are created by individuals
forming themselves into blocks  and that can occur even in highly political contexts  for
example  in the us house of representatives  on issues  for example  water rights or farm
subsidies  on which a states delegation tends to vote as a block in the parochial interests of
its states constituents or companies  pressure by lobbyists on state delegations to abstain
from a given vote is in effect  give or take issues of failing to have a quorum  a control by
deleting voters attack 
however  there are also many voting cases where the weights are inherent in the standalone individual voters  and in many of these cases control attacks may well occur  for
example  consider us corporate elections  in these  the vote of each stockholder is weighted
by his or her number of shares  the most natural way to frame control problems in this
setting is the case of adding and deleting candidates  for example  regarding who is running
for a spot as a company officer or director  but even voter control can come into play here 
for example  through some actor sending mailings toor phoning and speaking tovoters
to convince them to abstain from voting  or to encourage voters to vote in this election 
 the bound on additions deletions model that counts number of voters  rather than their
weights  is quite reasonable in this setting  because regardless of his or her weight  a given
targeted voter can be addressed by  for example  a mailing visit phone call  although in
reality one admittedly might focus more resources on the biggest stockholders  
there are many other weighted control examples we have not presented  let us finish
with what is an extremely high stakes example  in the us electoral college  which works
by majority rule among the electors  the electors from each state usually vote as a block 
since the system lets whoever has the greatest popular vote in the given state select every
elector from that state  note  two of the fifty states have different policies   thus the issue
of  for example  whether someone such as ralph nader does or does not run  or does or does
not withdraw his name from consideration at some particular time  can have a sweeping
effect on the nation  in what is in effect a weighted control by adding deleting candidates
scenario 
we have now given a number of examples  some for voter control and some for candidate
control  of settings where weighted control may occur  the examples we have given vary
in their naturalness  and for both weighted and unweighted control there certainly are
points on which the models dont capture all the nuances of the real world  for example 
some electoral partitioning problems have geographic contiguity constraints  groups that
are modeled as voting as blocks may in fact have defectors  and internet denial of service
attacks may not have the freedom to suppress each vote independently but rather may
have to suppress all or none of the votes coming over a given line provider  see  e g   chen 
faliszewski  niedermeier    talmon         nonetheless  our belief is that the importance of
weighted elections and the importance of control attacks should not remain forever separate 
we feel that control attacks are sufficiently natural in many weighted settingsvarying
from academic departments to companies stockholders to nationsthat studying weighted
control is worth undertaking  we also feel that  although this is not the subject of the
   

fiweighted electoral control

present paper  it will be important for experimental studies to be undertaken to see the
extent to which heuristic approaches can circumvent worst case hardness results regarding
weighted control  see rothe   schend        for an assessment of this type of approach in
other settings  although see also hemaspaandra   williams        for a discussion of some
limitations of heuristic attacks  

   preliminaries
we assume that the reader is familiar with the basic notions of computational complexity
theory and the theory of algorithms  below we provide relevant definitions and conventions
regarding elections  election rules  and control in elections  we also review some npcomplete problems that we use in our reductions 
    elections
we take an election to be a pair e    c  v    where c is a set of candidates and v is a
collection of voters  each voter has a preference order over the set c  a preference order
is a total  linear order that ranks the candidates from the most preferred one to the least
preferred one  for example  if c    a  b  c  and some voter likes a best  then b  and then
c  then his or her preference order is a   b   c  in weighted elections  each voter v also
has a positive integer weight  v   a voter of weight  v  is treated by the election system
as  v  unweighted voters  given two collections of voters  v and w   we write v   w to
denote their concatenation 
    election rules
an election rule  or voting rule  is a function r that given an election e    c  v   returns
a subset r e   c  namely those candidates that are said to win the election 
an m candidate scoring rule is defined through a nonincreasing vector                 m  
of nonnegative integers  for each voter v  each candidate c receives pos v c  points  where
pos v  c  is the position of c in vs preference order  the candidates with the maximum
total score are the winners  given an election e and a voting rule r that assigns scores to
the candidates  we write score e  c  to denote cs total score in e under r  the voting rule
used will always be clear from context  many election rules are defined through families of
scoring rules  with one scoring vector for each possible number of candidates  for example 
   plurality rule uses vectors of the form                   
   t approval uses vectors              m    where i     for each i              t   and i    
for i   t  by t veto we mean the system that for m candidates uses the  mt  approval
scoring vector  for m candidate t approval and t veto systems we will often treat each
vote as a     m dimensional approval vector that indicates which candidates receive
points from the vote  naturally  such a vector contains exactly t ones for t approval
and exactly t zeroes for t veto  
   we emphasize that such a view of t approval and t veto is correct in settings where the set of candidates
remains fixed  if the set of candidates were to change  e g   as in control by adding deleting candidates  
then we would have to use the standard  preference order based definition 

   

fifaliszewski  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra

   bordas rule uses vectors of the form  m     m                 where m is the number of
candidates 
given an election e    c  v    a candidate c is a condorcet winner  weak condorcet
winner  if for every other candidate d  c  c  it holds that more than half  at least half  of
the voters prefer c to d  note that it is possible that there is no condorcet winner in a given
election  and it is even possible that there is no weak condorcet winner in a given election 
let condorcet denote the election system whose winner set is exactly the set of condorcet
winners  and let weakcondorcet denote the election system whose winner set is exactly the
set of weak condorcet winners  we say that a rule r is condorcet consistent if whenever
there is a condorcet winner he or she is the sole winner elected under r  analogously  a rule
is weakcondorcet consistent if it elects exactly the weak condorcet winners whenever they
exist  every weakcondorcet consistent system is condorcet consistent  but the converse
does not always hold 
there are many condorcet consistent rules  we will briefly touch upon the copeland
family of rules and the maximin rule  for a given election e    c  v   and two distinct
candidates c  d  c  we let ne  c  d  be the number of voters that prefer c to d  let  be a
rational number          under copeland the score of candidate c  c is defined as 
k d  c   c    ne  c  d    ne  d  c  k   k d  c   c    ne  c  d    ne  d  c  k 
and under maximin the score of candidate c  c is defined as mindc c  ne  c  d   the
candidates with the highest score are winners  llull is another name for copeland    clearly 
llull and maximin are weakcondorcet consistent 
    electoral control
we focus on constructive control by adding deleting voters in weighted elections  however 
there are also other standard types of control studied in the literature  e g   control by
adding deleting candidates and various forms of partitioning of candidates and voters  we
point the reader to section   for a discussion of related work  
definition      let r be a voting rule  in both weighted constructive control by adding
voters under rule r  r wccav  and weighted constructive control by deleting voters under
rule r  r wccdv   our input contains a set of candidates c  a collection of weighted
voters v  sometimes referred to as the registered voters  with preferences over c  a preferred
candidate p  c  and a nonnegative integer k  in r wccav we also have an additional
collection w of weighted voters  sometimes referred to as the unregistered voters  with
preferences over c  in these problems we ask the following questions 
   r wccav  is there a subcollection w   of w   of at most k voters  such that p 
r c  v  w     
   r wccdv  is there a subcollection v   of v   of at most k voters  such that p 
r c  v v     
although in this paper we focus primarily on constructive control  section     makes
some comments about the so called destructive variants of control problems  given a voting rule r  weighted destructive control by adding voters under rule r  r wdcav  and
   

fiweighted electoral control

weighted destructive control by deleting voters under rule r  r wdcdv  are defined analogously to their constructive variants  with the only difference being that the goal is to
ensure that the distinguished candidate p is not a winner  we mention in passing that
throughout this paper we use what is known as the nonunique winner model  a k a  the
cowinner model   i e   the goal is to make p be  or prevent p from being  an element of the
winner set  we consider the nonunique winner model to be a cleaner and more natural
model than the so called unique winner model  in which p must be made or kept from being
a one and only winner of the election  as that model more strongly blurs tie breaking issues
with control issues 
note that in the above definitions the parameter k defines the number of voters that can
be added deleted  and not the total weight of the voters that can be added deleted  this is
a standard approach when modeling strategic behavior in weighted elections  for example 
in the study of r weighted bribery  faliszewski  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra        
bribing each weighted voter has unit cost regardless of the voters weight  and in the study
of weighted manipulation in nearly single peaked societies  faliszewski  hemaspaandra 
  hemaspaandra         the mavericity of a society depends on the number of so called
mavericks rather than their total weight  as to what k might be in practice  k is reflecting
the ability of the chair to add delete voters  and so k in practice would reflect how many
voters the chair is viewed as having the resources to lure in or pressure out 
we will consider approximation algorithms for wccav and wccdv under t approval
and t veto  when doing so  we will assume that input instances do not contain the integer
k  rather  the goal is simply to find  when success is possible at all  as small as possible a
collection of voters to add delete such that p is a winner of the resulting election   just as
mentioned in the previous paragraph  we again are counting the number of added deleted
voters  not the total weight of the added deleted voters   for a positive integer h  an
h approximation algorithm for wccav wccdv is an algorithm that  when success is
possible at all  always finds a solution that adds deletes at most h times as many voters as an
optimal action does  the notion of an f    approximation algorithm for wccav wccdv
is defined analogously  where the argument to f is some variable related to the problem
or instance  and the meaning of o f     approximation algorithms will be similarly clear
from context  it is natural to worry about how the above seemingly incomplete definitions
interact with the possibility that success might be impossible regardless of how many votes
one adds deletes  however  for t approval wccdv and t veto wccdv  and indeed  for
any scoring rule   it is always possible to ensure that p is a winner  for example by deleting
all the voters  recall that we are in the nonunique winner model   for t approval wccav
and t veto wccav  it is possible to ensure ps victory through adding voters if and only if
p is a winner after we add all the unregistered voters that approve of p  these observations
make it particularly easy to discuss and study approximation algorithms for t approval and
for t veto  because we can always easily check whether there is some solution  for voting
rules that dont have this easy checking property  such an analysis might be much more
complicated  the reader may wish to compare our work with brelsford et al s attempt
at framing a general election problem approximation framework  brelsford  faliszewski 
hemaspaandra  schnoor    schnoor        
in this paper we do not consider candidate control cases  such as weighted constructive control by adding candidates and weighted constructive control by deleting candidates 
   

fifaliszewski  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra

wccac and wccdc   the reason is that for a bounded number of candidates  when
winner determination in the given weighted election system is in p it holds that both wccac and wccdc are in p by brute force search  on the other hand  if the number of
candidates is not bounded then candidate control is already np hard for plurality  and
t approval and t veto  in both the constructive setting and the destructive setting  even
without weights  bartholdi et al         hemaspaandra  hemaspaandra    rothe       
elkind  faliszewski    slinko        lin         furthermore  many results for candidate
control under condorcet consistent rules can be claimed in the weighted setting  for example  for the maximin rule and for the copeland family of rules  hardness results translate
immediately  and it is straightforward to see that the existing polynomial time algorithms
for the unweighted cases also work for the weighted cases  faliszewski  hemaspaandra   
hemaspaandra        
    weighted coalitional manipulation
one of our goals is to compare the complexity of weighted voter control with the complexity
of weighted coalitional manipulation  wcm   wcm is similar to wccav in that we also
add voters  but it differs in that  a  we have to add exactly a given number of voters  and
 b  we can pick the preference orders of the added voters  it is quite interesting to see how
the differences in these problems definitions affect their complexities 
definition      let r be a voting rule  in r wcm we are given a weighted election  c  v   
a preferred candidate p  c  and a sequence k            kn of positive integers  we ask whether
it is possible to construct a collection w    w            wn   of n voters such that for each i 
   i  n   wi     ki   and p is a winner of the r election  c  v  w    the voters in w
are called manipulators 
    computational complexity
in our np hardness proofs we use reductions from the following np complete problems 
definition      an instance of partition consists of a sequence  k            kt   of
ppositive
integers whose sum is even  we ask whether there is a set i              t  such that ii ki  
  pt
i   ki  
 
in the proof of theorem     we will use the following restricted version of partition 
where we have greater control over the numbers involved in the problem 
definition      an instance of partition   consists of a sequence  k            kt   of positive
integers  whose sum is p
even  such that  a  t is an even number  and  b  for each ki      i  t 
 
it holds that ki  t   tj   kj   we ask whether there is a set i              t  of cardinality
p
t
  pt
ii ki    
i   ki  
  such that
showing the np completeness of this problem is a standard exercise   in particular  the
np completeness of a variant of this problem is established as lemma     in faliszewski
et al         the same approach can be used to show the np completeness of partition    
our remaining hardness proofs are based on reductions from a restricted version of the wellknown exact cover by   sets problem  this restricted version is still np complete  garey
  johnson        
   

fiweighted electoral control

definition      an instance of x c   consists of a set b    b            b t   and a family
s    s            sn   of   element subsets of b such that every element of b occurs in at least
one and in at most three sets in s  we ask whether s contains an exact cover for b  i e  
whether there exist t sets in s whose union is b 
our choice to use x c  as the basis of some of our reductions  and the particular way
we use it  will allow us to achieve something beyond simply showing that a given weighted
control result is np complete  we will indeed be able to show that certain weighted control
results for important election systems remain np complete even when the allowed set of
weights is highly restricted  e g   in some cases  the allowed weight set can be        or
        our cases of this sort appear within the proof of theorem      and are highlighted
in the paragraph immediately preceding that theorem 

   results
we now present our results  in section     we focus on fixed numbers of candidates in
scoring protocols  weakcondorcet consistent rules  and condorcet consistent rules  then in
sections     and     we consider case of an unbounded number of candidates  for t approval
and t veto 
    bounded numbers of candidates
it is well known that weighted manipulation of scoring protocols is always hard  unless the
scoring protocol is in effect plurality or triviality  hemaspaandra   hemaspaandra        
in contrast  weighted voter control is easy for m candidate t approval 
theorem      for all m and t  wccav and wccdv for m candidate t approval are
in p 
proof  let  c  v  w  p  k  be an instance of wccav for m candidate t approval  we can
assume that we add only voters who approve of p  we can also assume that we add
the heaviest voters with a particular set of approvals  i e   if we add   voters approving
p  c            ct    we can assume
 that we added the   heaviest voters approving p  c            ct   
m 
since there are only t  which is a constantdifferent sets of approvals to consider 
it suffices to try all sequences of nonnegative integers k            k m   whose sum is at most
t 
k  and for each such sequence to check whether adding the heaviest ki voters of the ith
approval collection makes p a winner 
for each fixed m and t  it is clear that this algorithm  although brute force in nature 
runs in time polynomial in the input size   the actions the algorithm uses are relatively
innocuous  in fact  for example  we use sorting to group together votes within w that have
identical sets of approvals  and to sort each of those in descending order of voter weight 
and the number of sequences of nonnegative integers k            k m   whose sum is at most
t 

m 
k is easily bounded by  k       t      and this for fixed m and t is polynomial in the input
size despite the fact that k is input in binary  because we may without loss of generality
m 
assume that k  kw k  we mention in passing that the  k       t    bound is often wildly
loose  in particular  the exact number of sequences of nonnegative integers k            k m  
t

 k   
 m 
t   
  so summing that from k   equals   to k   equals k
m 
  t    
gives the number of sequences we will face  
the same approach and argument work for wccdv  here  we delete only voters that
do not approve of p  and again we delete the heaviest voters for each approval collection 
again  with m and t fixed  the running time is easily seen to be polynomial 

whose sum is exactly k   is

one might think that the argument above works for any scoring protocol  but this is
not the case  for example  consider the   candidate borda instance where v consists of one
weight   voter b   p   a and w consists of a weight   and a weight   voter with preference
order a   p   b  then adding the weight   voter makes p a winner  but adding the weight  
voter does not  and  in fact  we have the following result  
theorem      wccav and wccdv for borda are np complete  this result holds even
when restricted to a fixed number m    of candidates 
proof  we start by considering the case of adding voters  we reduce from partition  given
a sequence k            kt of positive integers that sum to  k  construct an election with one
registered voter of weight k voting b   p   a        and t unregistered voters with weights
k            kt voting a   p   b        set the addition limit to t  with m candidates  the
 initial  score of b is k m      the score of p is k m      and the score of a is k m     
thus  for p to become a winner  bs score  relative to p  needs to go down by at least k 
while as score  relative to p  should not go up by more than k  it follows that k            kt
has a partition if and only if p can be made a winner 
we use the same construction for the deleting voters case  now  all voters are registered
and the deletion limit is t  since we cant delete all voters and since our goal is to make p
a winner  we cannot delete the one voter voting b   p   a       since then a would be the
unique winner   the rest of the argument is identical to the case of adding voters 
interestingly  it is possible to extend the above proof to work for all scoring protocols
other than t approval  the main idea stays the same  but the technical details are more
involved   and so  regarding the complexity of wccav and wccdv for scoring protocols
with a fixed number of candidates  the cases of theorem     are the only p cases  assuming
p    np  
theorem      for each scoring protocol              m    if there exists an i      i   m  such
that     i   m   then wccav and wccdv for              m   are np complete 
proof  let                 m   be a scoring protocol such that there is an i such that     i  
m   let  be the third largest value in the set              m    we will show that wccav
and wccdv are np complete for scoring protocol                 m                   m    
while formally we have defined scoring protocols to contain only nonnegative values  using
 simplifies our construction and does not affect the correctness of the proof  to further
simplify notation  given some candidates x            x    by f  x    i    x    i            x    i   
we mean a fixed preference order that ensures  under   that each xj      j     is ranked
   an analogue of this theorem in the model in which we are bounding the total weight of votes that can
be added deleted was obtained by russell        

   

fiweighted electoral control

at a position that gives ij points   the candidates not mentioned in the f         notation are
ranked arbitrarily   we let         and   be the three highest values in the set              m   
clearly                      note that   might be different from     and   might
be different from     for example  if                           then               and
       but               and        
we give a reduction from partition to  wccav  the membership of  wccav in np
is clear   let  k            kt   be an instance of partition  i e   a sequence of positive integers that
sum to  k  we form an election e    c  v   where c    p  a  b  c            cm   and where the
collection v contains the following three groups of voters  for the wccav part of the proof
below  we set t      for the wccdv part of the proof we will use the same construction
but with a larger value of t   
   a group of t voters  each with weight k and preference order f  b       a       p      
   a group of t voters  each with weight k and preference order f  p       b       a      
   for each ci  c  there are   collections of  t voters  one collection for each permutation  x  y  z  of  p  a  b   the voters in each collection have weight k and preference
order f  x       y       z       ci   m   
let m be the number of points that each of a  b  and p receive from the third group
of voters  each of these candidates receives the same number of points from these voters  
for each ci  c and each x   p  a  b   x receives at least  t k  points more than ci from
the voters in the third group  in each vote in the third group  x receives at least as many
points as ci   and there are two collections of  t voters where x receives       points and
ci receives m    points   thus it holds that our candidates have the following scores 
   p has m   t k  points 
   a has m   t k  points 
   b has m   t k         points  and
   each candidate ci  c has at most m   t k  points  each ci  c receives at most
m   t k  points from the third group of voters and at most  t k  points from
the first two groups of voters  
as a result  b is the unique winner  there are t unregistered voters with weights
t k            t kt   each with preference order f    a       p       b       we set the addition limit to be t  it is clear that irrespective of which voters are added  none of the
candidates in  c            cm   becomes a winner 
if there is a subcollection of  k            kt   that sums to k  then adding corresponding
unregistered voters to the election ensures that all three of p  a  and b are winners  each
with score m   t k           on the other hand  assume that there are unregistered voters
of total weight t l  whose addition to the election ensures that p is among the winners  after
adding these voters to the election  p has m  t k   t l  points  a has m  t l   t k 
points  and b has m   t k    t k  points  for p to have score at least as high as b  we
must have that l  k  however  for a not to have score higher than p  it must be the case
   

fifaliszewski  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra

that l  k  recall that          this means that l   k  thus it is possible to ensure
that p is a winner of the election by adding at most t unregistered voters if and only if there
is a subcollection of  k            kt   that sums to k  and  completing the proof  we note that
the reduction can be carried out in polynomial time 
let us now move on to the case of wccdv  we will use the same construction  but
with the following modifications 
   our reduction is now from partition    thus without loss of generality we can assume
 
that t is an even number and that for each i     i  t  it holds that ki    t
 k 
l
m
 
   we set t    t  t       
     the reasons for this choice of t will become apparent
 
in the course of the proof  intuitively it is convenient to think of t as of a large value
that  nonetheless  is polynomially bounded with respect to t  
   we include the unregistered voters as the fourth group of voters 
   we set the deletion limit to  t  
including the fourth group of voters  candidates have the following scores  p has m  
t k     t k  points  a has m   t k     t k  points  b has m   t k         points 
and each candidate ci  c has at most m points 
by the same reasoning as in the wccav case  we see that if there is a size   t subcollection of k            kt that sums to k  then deleting the corresponding voters ensures that
p is among the winners  together with a and b   we may imagine that we first remove all
the voters from the fourth group and then add back those  t of them  whose weights sum
to t k  we now show that if there is a way to delete up to  t voters to ensure that p is
among the winners  then the deleted voters must come from the fourth group  must have
total weight k  and there must be exactly  t of them  for the sake of contradiction  let us
assume that it is possible to ensure ps victory by deleting up to  t voters  of whom fewer
than  t come from the fourth group  let s be the number of deleted voters from the fourth
group  s    t   and let x be a real number such that xt k is their total weight  we have
that xt k is at most  see below for explanation regarding the first inequality

  t k    t k

that is  we have    x    t
  to see why the first inequality holds  recall that the
 
lowest weight of a voter from the fourth group is at least   t
 t k  because we reduce from
 
partition    thus the highest total weight of s voters from the fourth group is  at most  the
total weight of the fourth group voters   t k  less the weight of the lightest t  s voters
ts
  t k   
from this group  which is at least   t
prior to deleting any voters  a has t k        points more than p  after deleting
the s voters from the fourth group  this difference decreases to t k    x          if we
additionally delete up to  t voters from the first three groups of voters  each with weight k 
then the difference between the scores of a and p decreases  at most  to the following value
 note that in each deleted vote both a and p are ranked at positions where they receive

the final inequality follows by our choice of t   the above calculation shows that if there
is a way to ensure ps victory by deleting up to  t voters then it requires deleting exactly
t
  voters from the fourth group  the same reasoning as in the case of wccav shows that
these  t deleted voters must correspond to a size   t subcollection of  k            kt   that sums
to k 
as a side comment  we mention that wdcav and wdcdv for scoring protocols  that
is  the destructive variants of wccav and wccdv  have simple polynomial time algorithms  it suffices to loop through all candidates c  c    p  and greedily add delete voters
to boost the score of c relative to p as much as possible 
theorem      for each scoring protocol                 m     wdcav and  wdcdv
are in p 
combining theorems     and      we obtain the following corollary  which we contrast with an analogous result for wcm  hemaspaandra   hemaspaandra         we also
mention in passing the recent attainment of a dichotomy result for voter control under
so called pure scoring rules  for unweighted elections and an unbounded number of candidates  hemaspaandra  hemaspaandra    schnoor        
corollary      for each scoring protocol              m   the problems wccav and wccdv
are np complete if k             m  k    and are in p otherwise 
theorem      hemaspaandra   hemaspaandra         for each scoring protocol
             m    m     wcm is np complete if     m and is in p otherwise 
we see that for scoring protocols with a fixed number m of candidates  either wcm
is harder than wccav and wccdv  for the case of t approval with    t   m   or
the complexity of wcm  wccav  and wccdv is the same  p membership for plurality
and triviality  and np completeness for the remaining cases   one may wonder which
property of wcm is responsible for the fact that for t approval     t  m  wcm is
harder than wccav and wccdc  speaking very informally  the answer is that wcm
intimately involves the instantiation of the values of the  initially unspecified  votes of the
manipulators  and in this particular setting that is  in effect  requiring them to solve a
partition problem  on the other hand  in wccav and wccdv the preference orders of
all the voters are fixed in the input  and the chair chooses only which votes to add  this  for
example  facilitated the polynomial time algorithm in the proof of theorem     
there are  nonetheless  voting rules for which wcm is easier than wccav and
wccdv  this happens  for example  if on the one hand in wccav and wccdv under the particular rule the chair has to balance out differing votes in a way that makes
these problems hard  yet on the other hand for wcm under the particular rule we can
show that if there is any successful manipulation then there is one in which all the manipulators cast identical votes  theorem      corollary      and their proofs present exactly
such a case 
   

fifaliszewski  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra

theorem      for every weakcondorcet consistent election system and for every
condorcet consistent election system  wccav and wccdv are np hard  this result holds
even when restricted to a fixed number m    of candidates 
proof  to show that wccav is np hard  we reduce from partition  given a sequence
k            kt of positive integers that sum to  k  construct an election with two registered
voters  one voter with weight   voting p   a   b      and one voter with weight  k voting
b   p   a        and t unregistered voters with weights  k             kt voting a   p   b       
set the addition limit to t  suppose we add unregistered voters to the election with a total
vote weight equal to  l 
 if l   k  then b is the condorcet winner  and thus the unique winner of the election 
 if l   k  then a is the condorcet winner  and thus the unique winner of the election 
 if l   k  then p is the condorcet winner  and thus the unique winner of the election 
the wccdv case uses the same construction  now  all voters are registered and the
deletion limit is t  since we can delete at most t of our t     voters  and since our goal is
to make p a winner  we cant delete the sole voter voting b   p   a  since then a would be
the condorcet winner  the rest of the argument is similar to the adding voters case 
recall from section   that condorcet denotes the election system whose winner set is
exactly the set of condorcet winners  and weakcondorcet denotes the election system whose
winner set is exactly the set of weak condorcet winners 
corollary      for condorcet and weakcondorcet  wcm is in p and wccav and
wccdv are np complete  this result holds even when restricted to a fixed number m   
of candidates 
proof  it is immediate that wcm for condorcet and weakcondorcet are in p  to see if we
have a yes instance of wcm  it suffices to check whether letting all the manipulators rank
p  the preferred candidate  first and ranking all the remaining candidates in some arbitrary
order ensures ps victory  np completeness of wccav and wccdv follows directly from
theorem     
condorcet and weakcondorcet do not always have winners  for those who prefer their
voting systems to always have at least one winner  we note that wcm for   candidate llull
is in p  faliszewski et al         
corollary      for   candidate llull  wcm is in p and wccav and wccdv are npcomplete 
the main results of this section are also presented in table   of section   
   

fiweighted electoral control

    t approval and t veto with an unbounded number of candidates
let us now look at the cases of t approval and t veto rules  for an unbounded number of
candidates  the reason we focus on these is that these are the most interesting families of
scoring protocols whose complexity has not already been resolved in the previous section 
the reason we say that is that theorem     shows that whenever we have at least three
distinct values in a scoring vector  we have np completeness  so any scoring protocol family
that  for some number of candidates  has three distinct values in its scoring vector is nphard for wccav and wccdv  thus the really interesting cases are indeed t approval and
t veto 
our starting point here is the work of lin         which showed that for t     wccav
for t approval and wccdv for t veto are np complete  and that for t     wccdv
for t approval and wccav for t veto are np complete  these results hold even for the
unweighted case  it is also known that the remaining unweighted cases are in p  bartholdi
et al         lin        and that wccav and wccdv for plurality and veto are in p  lin 
       in this section  we look at and solve the remaining open cases  wccav for  approval    approval  and   veto  and wccdv for   approval    veto  and   veto  we
start by showing that   approval wccav is in p  we point out that our proof techniques
 especially the polynomial time algorithms for   approval wccav and for   veto wccdv 
are quite different from those of lin        
theorem       wccav for   approval is in p 
proof  we claim that algorithm   solves   approval wccav in polynomial time   in this
algorithm and the proof of correctness  whenever we speak of the r heaviest voters in voter
set x  we mean the min r  kxk  heaviest voters in x  
we note that we will add only voters that approve of p  thus we delete from w all the
voters who do not approve of p 
let us consider the repeat until loop in algorithm    if we reject in the first iteration of
this loop  in the first forall loop  then  clearly  there is no solution for the given instance 
furthermore  we claim that if there is a solution to the input instance  then after the second
forall loop it is still possible to find it  to see this  consider some candidate c  c   p 
and some number                k      if the sum of the weights of k    heaviest voters in
w that do not approve of c is less than sc  that is  is less than the difference between the
score of c and the score of p in the original election   then we certainly need to add at least
k        voters who do not approve of c  however  since altogether we can add at most k
voters  this means that we can add at most      voters who do approve of c  in effect  we
can safely delete from w all but      heaviest voters who approve of c  as in the proof of
theorem      if we decide to add some r voters approving  p  c   we may assume that we
add the r heaviest voters approving  p  c   thus keeping only the      heaviest voters that
approve of  p  c  is a correct strategy  
so  if we reject in the first iteration of the repeat until loop  then certainly there is no
solution for the input instance  and if we do not  then we start the second iteration with
an instance that has a solution if and only if the original one had  thus  by induction  we
never reject incorrectly in the repeat until loop  if we get through the repeat until without
rejecting  and we have fewer than k voters left in w   then adding all of w is the best we
can do  since all voters in w approve p

if the sum of the weights of the k    heaviest voters in w that do not approve of c is

delete from w all voters approving c except for the      heaviest such voters 
   we need to add at least k        voters that do not approve of c  and so we
can add at most      voters approving c 
until no more changes 
if kw k  k then accept    we can make p a winner by adding the k heaviest voters from
w 
if kw k   k then
if adding all of w will make p a winner then accept else reject

on the other hand  if we get through the repeat until loop  and we have at least k voters
left in w   then adding the k heaviest voters from w will make p a winner  why  let c be a
candidate in c  p   let r be the number of voters from w that are added and that approve
of c  since we made it through the repeat until  we know that  the sum of the weights of
the k heaviest voters in w that do not approve of c  is at least sc  because we did not reject
in the first forall loop   we will show that after adding the voters  score c   score p     
which implies that p is a winner  if r      score c   score p    sc    the sum of the weights
of the k heaviest voters in w       if r      then  the sum of the weights of the k  r
heaviest voters in w that do not approve of c  is at least sc  for otherwise we would have at
most r    voters approving c left in w due to the if statement in the second forall loop  
and so score c   score p    sc    the sum of the weights of the k  r heaviest voters in w
that do not approve of c     
theorem       wccdv for   veto is in p 
instead of proving this theorem directly  we show a more general relation between the
complexity of t approval t veto wccav and wccdv 
theorem       for each fixed t  it holds that t veto wccdv  t approval wccdv 
polynomial time many one reduces to t approval wccav  t veto wccav  
proof  we first give a reduction from t veto wccdv to t approval wccav  the idea is
that deleting a t veto vote v from t veto election  c  v   is equivalent  in terms of net effect
on the scores  to adding a t approval vote v   to this election  where v   approves exactly of
   

fiweighted electoral control

the t candidates that v disapproves of  the problem with this approach is that we are to
reduce t veto wccdv to t approval  wccav and thus we have to show how to implement
t veto scores with t approval votes 
let  c  v  p  k  be an instance of t veto wccdv  where v    v            vn    let m   kck 
let max be the highest weight of a vote in v   we set d to be a set of up to t    new
candidates  such that kck   kdk is a multiple of t  we set v  to be a collection of kck kdk
t
t approval votes  where each vote has weight max and each candidate in c  d is approved
 t   mt 
in exactly one of the votes  for each vote vi in v we create a set ci    c i           ci
 
of candidates and we create a collection of voters vi    vi            vimt    each voter vij  
   j  m  t  has weight  vi   and approves of the jth candidate approved by v and of
 j   t    
j t  
the t    candidates ci
          ci
 
s
 
 
 
we form an election e    c   v    where c     cd ni   ci and v     v   v      vn  
for each candidate c  let sc be cs t veto score in  c  v    we see that cs t approval score in
e   is max   sc  every candidate from c receives a single approval from one weight max
voter from v  and for each voter vi in v and for each candidate c that vi approves of  there
is a unique voter in vi that has the same weight as vi and that approves of c   furthermore 
each candidate c  c   c has t approval score at most max in e    each candidate in c   c
is approved by exactly one voter in v   and each voter in v   has weight at most max   
we form an instance  c     v     w  p  k  of t approval wccav  where w    w            wn   
and for each i     i  n   wi      vi    and wi approves exactly of those candidates
that vi disapproves of  adding voter wi to t approval election  c     v     has the same net
effect on the scores of the candidates in c as does deleting vi from t veto election  c  v   
 the role of the candidates in d is to pad the election so that it is easy to use t approval
votesthose in v  to ensure that the candidates in c have at least as many points as the
other candidates  irrespective of which voters we add   this completes the reduction 
let us now give a reduction from t approval wccdv to t veto wccav  the idea is
the same as in the previous reduction and the main difficulty of the proof is to show how to
implement t approval scores with t veto votes   in particular  the role of the candidates in
d is  again  to provide a convenient way of padding the election and implementing the scores
of the other candidates  however  this time the construction is more involved because of the
nature of t veto  as opposed to the case of t approval  under t veto if we add a candidate
to the election then the total number of candidates approved per vote increases 
let  c  v  p  k  be an instance of t approval wccdv  where v    v            vn    let
m   kck and let max be the highest weight of a vote in v   we set d to be a set of
candidates such that t  kdk   t    and kck   kdk   s  t for some integer s  s   
 note that for our setting to not be trivial it must be the case that m   t   we set v 
to be a collection of  n s      t veto  votes  over candidate set c  d   each with weight
max   each candidate from c is approved in all these votes whereas each candidate from
d is disapproved in at least half of them  since t  kdk   t     it is easy to construct
   the reader may wonder why we do not simply use the previous argument by applying it to  m  t  veto
and  m  t  approval  the reason is that given an instance of  m  t  veto wccdv  with m candidates
and n voters   our reduction would output an instance of  m  t  approval wccav with more than m
candidates  thus it would not be correct to interpret this instance as a t veto wccav instance

such votes     for each vote vi in v   we create a collection vi of  s     votes satisfying the
following requirements   a  each candidate approved in vi is also approved in each of the
votes in vi   and  b  each candidate not approved in vi   is approved in exactly  s     votes
in vi    such votes are easy to construct  we always place the top t candidates from vi in
the top t positions of the vote  for the remaining positions  in the first vote we place the
candidates in some arbitrary  easily computable order  and in each following vote we shift
these candidates cyclically by t positions with respect to the previous vote   each vote in
vi has weight  vi   
we form an election e      c     v      where c     c  d and v     v    v         vn   for
 
each candidate c  let sc be cs

at least s    voters from each group vi      i  n  additionally  for every voter vi that
approves of c  there is the  s    th voter in group vi that approves of c   furthermore 
each candidate from d has t veto score at most  n s    max in e    each of them gets at
most  n s    max points from the voters in v  and at most  s    max points from each
vi      i  n  
we form an instance  c     v     w  p  k  of t veto wccav  where w    w            wn    and
for each i     i  n   wi      vi    and wi disapproves of exactly those candidates that vi
approves of  adding voter wi to t veto election  c     v     has the same net effect on the scores
of candidates in c as deleting voter vi from t approval election  c  v   has  furthermore 
since each candidate in d has at least nmax fewer points than each candidate in c  the
fact that adding wi increases scores of candidates in d does not affect the correctness of
our reduction 
all other remaining cases  wccdv for   approval  wccav for   approval  wccav
for   veto  and wccdv for   veto  are np complete  interestingly  in contrast to many
other np complete weighted election problems  we need only a very limited set of weights
to make the reductions work  namely  due to the choice of reducing from x c  and due
to the particular reductions we build  the proof of the following theorem establishes  the
details of why are given within the proof  that  a  for every pair of integers    a   b  it
holds that wccdv for   approval and wccav for   veto are np complete even when the
legal set of weights is restricted to be  a  b   and  b  wccdv for   approval and wccav
for   veto are np complete even when the legal set of weights is restricted to be        
theorem       wccav for   veto and   approval and wccdv for   approval and   veto
are np complete 
proof  membership in np is immediate  so it suffices to prove np hardness  we will first
give the proof for wccdv for   approval  by theorem      this also immediately gives
the result for wccav for   veto  we will reduce from x c  from definition      let
b    b         b t   and let s    s         sn   be a family of   element subsets of b such that
every element of b occurs in at least one and in at most three sets in s  we construct the

used for padding   for    j   t  let  j be the number of sets in s that contain bj   by
assumption  for each j     j   t  we have that     j     v consists of the following

note that score si        score s i        score bj        score p       and score dj      
we set k   n    t and we claim that s contains an exact cover if and only if p can become
a winner after deleting at most n    t voters 
    delete the  n  t  weight   voters corresponding to the sets not in the cover and
delete the  t weight   voters corresponding to the sets in the cover  then the score of p
does not change  the score of each si decreases by    the score of each s i decreases by at
least    and the score of each bj decreases by    so  p is a winner 
    we need to delete  t voters to decrease the score of every bj candidate by     note
that there is no reason to delete the voters with preference orders of the form bj   dj     
    j   t   it suffices to decrease the score of each bj by one and  since we also need to
decrease the scores of candidates si and s i     i  n   it is always better to delete voters
with preference orders of the form si   bj      and s i   bj         after deleting these  t
voters  there are at most t values of i     i  n  such that the score of si and the score of
s i are at most    for each i  obtaining the score at most   for candidates si and s i takes at
least   unique voters of the  t deleted ones  
if there are exactly t values of i     i  n  such that the score of si and the score of s i
are at most    then these t values of i correspond to a cover   why is this so  we consider
a situation where we have already deleted the  t voters with preference orders of the forms
si   bj      and s i   bj        where bj  si   if  after deleting these voters  for some i the
scores of both si and s i decreased to    we must have deleted exactly the three voters that
correspond to members of si   thus  if after deleting voters corresponding to  t members
of b we ensured that there are t values i such that the scores of si and s i decreased to   
then it must be the case that these values of i correspond to a cover   if there are less than
t values of i     i  n  such that the score of si and the score of s i are at most    then the
remaining voters that are deleted  and there are at most n  t of them  need to decrease
the score of si and or s i for more than n  t values of i     i  n  but that is not possible 
since there is no voter that approves of both si or s i and sj or s j for i    j 
note that this construction uses only weights   and    in fact  we can establish npcompleteness for wccdv for   approval for every set of allowed weights of size at least
two  note that if the set of weights has size one  the problem is in p  since this is in essence
the unweighted case resolved by lin         since the reductions of theorem      do not
change the set of voter weights  we have the same result for wccav for   veto

so  suppose our weight set contains w  and w    w    w       we modify the construction above as follows  we keep the same set of candidates and we change the voters as

  j is never negative  note that score si     w    w    score s i     w   w    score bj      w   
score p    max  w    w     and score dj    max  w    w     the same argument as above
shows that s contains an exact cover if and only if p can become a winner after deleting at
most n    t voters 
we now turn to the proof for wccdv for   veto  our construction will use only weights
  and    since the reductions of theorem      do not change the set of voter weights  weights
  and   also suffice to get np completeness for wccav for   approval  given the instance
of x c  described above  we construct the following instance  c  v  p  k  of wccdv for
  veto  we set c    p   b   si      i  n    r  d  d     d and d  are dummy candidates

it is more convenient to count the number of vetoes for each candidate than to count the
number of approvals  note that vetoes si      n    vetoes bj      n    vetoes r     n t 
vetoes p     n  and vetoes d    vetoes d      n  we claim that s contains an exact cover
if and only if p can become a winner  i e   have a lowest number of vetoes  after deleting at
most n    t voters 
    delete the  n  t  weight   voters corresponding to the sets not in the cover and
delete the  t weight   voters that veto p and that correspond to the sets in the cover  then
vetoes si     vetoes bj     vetoes r    vetoes p     n and vetoes d    vetoes d      n  so 
p is a winner 
    we can assume that we delete only voters that veto p  suppose we delete k  weight  voters and k  weight   voters  k   k   n  t  after this deletion  vetoes p     nk   k   
vetoes r     n   t   k    and vetoes bj     n      in order for p to be a winner  we need
vetoes p   vetoes r   this implies that k    t  we also need vetoes p   vetoes bj

since vetoes p   vetoes bj     n  k    k     n        n   n    t  k      k    n     
 n t k     it follows that k   nt   to see that this is the case  note that if we require
that vetoes p   vetoes bj      and we know that vetoes p   vetoes bj     n   t   k     
then we must require that  n t k        this expression is equivalent to k   nt     
since k    n  and t are integers  it must be the case that k   n  t   so we delete  t weight  
votes and n  t weight   votes  and after deleting these voters vetoes p     n  in order for
p to be a winner  we can delete at most one veto for each bj and at most three vetoes for
each si   this implies that the set of deleted weight   voters corresponds to a cover 
    approximation and greedy algorithms
when problems are computationally difficult  such as being np complete  it is natural to wonder whether good polynomial time approximation algorithms exist  so  motivated by the np completeness results discussed earlier in this paper for most cases of
wccav wccdv for t approval and t veto  this section studies greedy and other approximation algorithms for those problems   recall that wccav is np complete for t approval 
t     and for t veto  t     and wccdv is np complete for t approval  t     and for
t veto  t      first  we will establish a connection to the weighted multicover problem 
and we will use it to obtain approximation results  then we will obtain an approximation
algorithm that will work by direct action on our problem  table   in section   summarizes
our results on approximation algorithms for t approval t veto wccav wccdv 
before we undertake this  let us address in more detail the issue  valuably raised by a
referee  of why one might want to build approximation algorithms for control problems 
and who might use such algorithms  and whether it is unwise to obtain such algorithms if
the people using them might not be the good guys  as mentioned above  seeking good
polynomial time approximation algorithms is one standard approach when exact solutions
are known to be intractable  e g   np complete  such algorithms will allow a campaign
strategist to  faced with the intractability of computing the optimal number of votes to add
or delete to achieve victory for his or her candidate  at least be able to quickly find an action
that is guaranteed to be within a particular multiplicative factor of the optimal action  one
might expect that our desire to get such approximations would hit a wall regarding the
potential impossibility of exerting control in certain instances  but as we discussed in the
electoral control subpart of section    that worry does not hold for the particular problems
for which we will obtain approximation algorithms  finally  as to the worry that people
 chairs  who employ approximation algorithms may not be the good guys  we have
the following somewhat multilayered reply  first  good and evil are highly contextual 
whether a strategists attempts to help his or her candidate win are good or evil is very
much in the eye of the beholder  some may decry such attempts as part of the brutal nature
of politics  others may view such attempts  as long as no illegal actions are taken  as a
valid and indeed valuable part of the spirited  vibrant playing field of democracy  second 
in some settings  control may be simply modeling an optimization problem  and so wellapproximating control isnt even about candidates  but is simply about efficiency  third 
even if one views approximating control as helping evil doers  using that as a reason not to
learn which control problems can be approximated and how well they can be approximated
makes no more sense than sticking ones head in the sand and hoping that cryptosystems
   

fifaliszewski  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra

cant be broken  since evil doers may well try to build approximation algorithms  or break
cryptosystems  the natural way of thwarting them is for the field to richly explore what
approximations and vulnerabilities exist  so that those who choose what election system
to use for a given problem can choose one that is not weak with respect to having good
approximations under whatever attacks they most fear 
      a weighted multicover approach
let us first consider the extent to which known algorithms for the set cover family of
problems apply to our setting  specifically  we will use the following multicover problem 
definition       an instance of weighted multicover  wmc  consists of a set b  
 b            bm    a sequence r    r            rm   of nonnegative integers  covering requirements   a
collection s    s            sn   of subsets of b  and a sequence                 n   of positive integers  weights of the sets in s   the goal is to find
p a minimum cardinality set i              n 
i   or to declare that no such set exists 
such that for each bj  b it holds that rj 
iibj si

that is  given a wmc instance we seek a smallest collection of subsets from s that
satisfies the covering requirements of the elements of b  keeping in mind that a set of
weight  covers each of its elements  times   wmc is an extension of set cover with unit
costs  we will not define here the problem known as covering integer programming  see
kolliopoulos   young         which for short is written as cip  however  that problem
will be quite important to us here  the reason is that we observe that wmc is a special
case of cip  with multiplicity constraints but  without packing constraints  footnote  
below is in effect describing how to embed our problem in that problem  an approximation
algorithm of kolliopoulos and young for cip  with multiplicity constraints but  without
packing constraints  applied to the special case of wmc  gives the following result  
theorem       kolliopoulos   young         there is a polynomial time algorithm that
when given an instance of wmc in which each set contains at most t elements gives an
o log t  approximation 
for t approval both wccav and wccdv naturally translate to equivalent wmc
instances  we consider wccav first  let  c  v  w  p  k  be an instance of t approval   the paper of kolliopoulos and young        does not directly speak of the wmc problem  but seeing
that their results indeed apply to wmc is an easy  if tedious  exercise  for those readers who would like
to verify that theorem      holds  in this footnote we describe exactly where in the paper of kolliopoulos
and young one finds the relevant result and which parameters one should use  we warn the reader that
this footnote makes direct references to parts of that paper and so will only make sense if that paper is
simultaneously in hand  this footnote is merely a guide to understanding the particular way we draw
on that papers important work  providing a full fledged survey of  or even a real discussion of  the cip
problem is beyond the needs and scope of this paper 
theorem      follows from the sentenceon page     of the work of kolliopoulos and young
      starting our second algorithm finds a solution  which itself follows from their theorem    
keeping in mind that we have none of their so called packing constraints  and so we may take it that
what they call  is one and the matrix and vector they call b and b wont be a factor here  their vector
a corresponds to our rj s  the element in the jth row and ith column of their matrix a will for us be set
to i if si contains bj and   otherwise  we set their cost vector c to be a vector of all  s  we set their
multiplicity vector d to be a vector of all  s  their vector x corresponds to the characteristic function of
our i  and their  will be theorem     s bound t on the number of elements of b contained in any si

wccav  where w    w            wn   is the collection of voters that we may add  we assume
without loss of generality that each voter in w ranks p among its top t candidates  i e  
approves of p  
we form an instance  b  r  s    of wmc as follows  we set b   c   p   for each
c  b  we set its covering requirement to be rc   score  c v    c    score  c v    p   where
i j  def max    ij   for each vote w  w   let sw be the set of candidates that w does not
approve of  by our assumption regarding each voter ranking p among its top t candidates 
no sw contains p  we set s    sw            swn   and we set      w              wn     it is easy
to see that a set i              n  is a solution to this instance of wmc  that is  i satisfies all
covering requirements  if and only if adding the voters  wi   i  i  to the election  c  v  
ensures that p is a winner  the reason for this is the following  if we add voter wi to the
election then for each candidate c  swi   the difference between the score of c and the score
of p decreases by  wi    and for each candidate c   swi this difference does not change  the
covering requirements are set to guarantee that ps score will match or exceed the scores of
all candidates in the election 
we stress that in the above construction we did not assume t to be a constant  indeed 
the construction applies to t veto just as well as to t approval  so using theorem      we
obtain the following result 
theorem       there is a polynomial time o log m  approximation algorithm for tapproval wccav  there is a polynomial time algorithm that when given an instance of
t veto wccav  t  n  gives an o log t  approximation 
proof  it suffices to use the reduction of t approval t veto to wmc and apply the algorithm
from theorem       for the case of t approval  the reduction guarantees that each set in
the wmc instance contains at most m elements  for the case of t veto  each of these sets
contains at most t elements 
we can obtain analogous results for the case of t approval t veto and wccdv  one can
either provide a direct reduction from these problems to wmc or notice that the reductions
given in the proof of theorem      maintain approximation properties 
theorem       there is a polynomial time algorithm that when given an instance of tapproval wccdv  t  n  gives an o log t  approximation  there is a polynomial time
o log m  approximation algorithm for t veto wccdv 
      a direct approach
using algorithms for wmc  we were able to obtain relatively strong algorithms for
wccav wccdv under t approval and t veto  however  with this approach we did not
find approximation algorithms for t approval wccav and t veto wccdv whose approximation ratios depend only on t  and not  for example  on kck  i e   m  or on kv k   in the
following we will seek direct algorithms for these problems 
we now show that a very simple greedy approach yields a polynomial time tapproximation algorithm for t approval wccav and t veto wccdv   recall that this
means that in cases when making p win is possible  the number of voters our algorithm
adds deletes to reach victory is never more than t times that of the optimal set of additions deletions

let gbw  greedy by weight  define the following very simple algorithm for wccav 
 the votes are the weighted t approval vectors induced by the preferences of the voters  
 pre discard all unregistered votes that do not approve of the preferred candidate p  order
the  remaining  unregistered votes from heaviest to lightest  breaking ties in voter weights
in some simple  transparent way  for concreteness  let us say by lexicographic order on the
votes representations   gbw goes through the unregistered votes in that order  and as it
reaches each vote it adds the vote exactly if the vote disapproves of at least one candidate
whose score  i e   total weight of approvals  is currently strictly greater than that of p  it
stops successfully when p has become a winner and unsuccessfully if before that happens
the algorithm runs out of votes to consider  the following result says that gbw is a tapproximation algorithm for t approval wccav  and also for t veto wccdv  using the
obvious analogue of gbw for t veto wccdv  which we will also call gbw  
theorem       let t     the polynomial time greedy algorithm gbw is a tapproximation algorithm for t approval wccav and t veto wccdv  and there are instances in which gbws approximation factor on each of these problems is no better than t 
we prove theorem     s upper and lower bound parts separately  through the following
two lemmas from which the theorem immediately follows 
lemma       let t     there are instances on which the polynomial time greedy algorithm gbw has an approximation factor on t approval wccav no better than t  there
are instances on which the polynomial time greedy algorithm gbw has an approximation
factor on t veto wccdv no better than t 
lemma       let t     the polynomial time greedy algorithm gbw is a t approximation
algorithm for t approval wccav and t veto wccdv 
the proof of our lower bound claim  lemma       consists of a somewhat detailed pair
of constructions  and is of less interest than the upper bound part of theorem       namely
lemma       we thus defer to the appendix the proof of lemma      
proof of lemma       let us now prove the two claims that gbw is a t approximation
algorithm  we will prove the result for t     and wccav  but it will be immediately clear
that our proof straightforwardly generalizes to all greater t  and the wccdv case follows
using theorem      
clearly gbw is a polynomial time algorithm  consider a given input instance of tapproval wccav  with preferred candidate p  without loss of generality  assume all unregistered voters approve of p  we will say a candidate has a gap  under the current
set of registered voters and whatever unregistered voters have already been added  if that
candidate has strictly more weight of approvals than p does  for each candidate d who has
   for completeness and clarity  we describe what we mean by gbw for t veto wccdv  order all votes
that do not approve of p from heaviest to lightest  breaking ties in voter weights in some simple  transparent way  for concreteness  let us say by lexicographic order on the votes representations   gbw
goes through these votes in that order  and as it reaches each vote it removes the vote exactly if the
vote approves of at least one candidate whose score  i e   total weight of approvals  is currently strictly
greater than that of p  it stops successfully when p has become a winner and unsuccessfully if before
that happens the algorithm runs out of such votes to consider 

   

fiweighted electoral control

a gap  d    p  define id to be the minimum number of unregistered voters one has to add to
remove ds gap  that is  if one went from heaviest to lightest among the unregistered voters 
adding in turn each that disapproved of d  id is the number of voters one would add before d
no longer had a gap  if for any candidate d it holds that no integer realizes id   then control is
impossible using the unregistered voter set  clearly  any successful addition of voters must
add at least maxd id voters  the max throughout this proof is over all candidates initially
having a gap  
let us henceforth assume that control is possible in the input case  we will show that
after having added at most    maxd id voters gbw will have made p a winner  and so gbw
is a   approximation algorithm 
before giving the detailed proof  let us very informally give a sense of the proofs idea 
let z be some candidate who allegedly has a gap after gbw has just added  maxd id voters 
and freeze the action of gbw at that point  our proof argues that if relatively many of the
   maxd id voters added by gbw  i e   at least maxd id of them  do not approve of z  then z
clearly will not have a gap at the point in time when gbw was frozen  and so the assumed
gap cant exist in this case  our proof further argues that if relatively few of the    maxd id
voters added by gbw  i e   at most  maxd id    of them  do not approve of z  equivalently 
at least        maxd id of them do approve of z   then we also arrive at a contradiction 
the latter argument is a more subtle one  involving asking which candidates  call it y  gap
caused the very last added vote to be added  and if needed drilling down an extra level with
a related few many argument now focused on y  to show that gbw must at some point
have acted in a way that violates its definition  thus also yielding a contradiction  since
the few and many cases above cover all possible cases  our proof will have achieved its
goal  we provide now the formal analysis that carries out this argument line 
so  suppose that after    maxd id additions some candidate  z  still has a gap  as
discussed above we will perform a case analysis to in each case arrive at a contradiction 
case    in at least maxd id of the first  maxd id votes added by gbw  z is not approved  
since for the last one of these to be added z must still have had a gap before the addition 
each earlier vote considered that disapproved z had a gap for z when it was considered
and so would have been added when reached  so  keeping in mind that iz  maxd id   we
in fact must have added the iz heaviest voters disapproving of z  and so contrary to the
assumption  z no longer has a gap after these additions 
case    case   does not hold   so z is approved in at least        maxd id of the added
votes  what made the final one of the added votes  call it v     eligible for addition  it must
be that some candidate  say y  still had a gap just before v   was added 
case  a  y is disapproved in at least maxd id of the    maxd id votes added before v   that
approved z   then  since until ys gap was removed no unregistered voters disapproving of
y would be excluded by gbw  ys iy heaviest voters will have been added  so contrary to
case  s assumption  y does not have a gap when we get to adding vote v    
case  b  case   holds but case  a does not   then y is approved in at least     maxd id
of the    maxd id votes before v   that gbw added that approve z  so we have     maxd id
votes added approving of exactly z and y  but then who made the last of those     maxd id
votes  call it v      eligible to be added  it must hold that some candidate w had a gap up
through v      but at the moment before adding v    we would have added maxd id  iw votes
approving exactly z and y and so disapproving w  and since w allegedly still had a gap  we
   

fifaliszewski  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra

while doing so under gbw would have in fact added the iw heaviest voters disapproving
of w  and so ws gap would have been removed before v      so contrary to our assumption w
was not the gap that made v    eligible 
one might naturally wonder how gbw performs on t veto wccav and t approvalwccdv  by an argument far easier than that used in the above proof of lemma       in
both of these cases gbw provides a t approximation algorithm 
theorem       gbw is a t approximation algorithm for t veto wccav  gbw is a tapproximation algorithm for t approval wccdv 
proof  consider t veto wccav  let p be the preferred candidate  for each candidate d
with an initial positive gap relative to the preferred candidate p  i e   a surplus over p in
total weight of approvals   let id be as defined in the proof of lemma        recall that id
is the number of votes we would need to add to remove the surplus of d over p if we took
the unregistered votes  discarded all that didnt simultaneously approve p and disapprove
d  and then
p added those one at a time from heaviest to lightest until the gap was removed  
clearly 
id   where the sum is taken over those candidates with an initial surplus relative
to p  is an upper bound on the number of votes added by gbw  this is true since gbw
works by adding extra votes from heaviest to lightest  restricted to those vetoing a candidate
who at that point has a positive gap relative to p  so under gbw each gap will be closed by
the largest weight votes that address it  on the other hand  in any overall optimal solution
id is a lower bound on the smallest number of votes from that solutions added vote set
that would suffice to remove ds positive gap  since it takes id even if we use the heaviest
votes addressing the gap   in the overall optimal solution each added vote narrows at most
t gaps  so gbws solution uses at worst t times as many added votes as does the optimal
solution 
the claim for t approval wccdv follows by theorem      
this result replaces a flawed claim in the conference version of this paper  faliszewski 
hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra        that gbw and some of its cousins do not provide
o    approximations for these problems   of course  having a t approximation for these two
problems  namely  t veto wccav and t approval wccdv  is not wildly exciting  since for
these problems the multicover based approach from earlier in this section showed that for
some function f  t   with f  t    o log t   we even have f  t  approximation algorithms for
these problems  however  if the constant of the big oh of that other algorithm is large 
it is possible that for sufficiently small values of t the above approach may give a better
approximation  also  we feel that it is interesting to learn about the behavior of explicit
heuristics  especially attractive approaches such as greedy algorithms 
it is natural to ask whether similar greedy algorithms work well for other scoring rules 
e g   for bordas rule  unfortunately  for families of scoring rules other than t approval and
t veto the analysis  if at all possible  would likely have to be significantly different than
ours  the main reason for this is thatas discussed in the electoral control subpart of
   note that here we treat t as a constant and  so  a t approximation algorithm provides  indeed  is  an
o    approximate one  the reason that is true is that  technically speaking  the wccav and wccdv
problems are defined separately for each voting rule  for example    approval wccav is a different
problem than  say      approval wccav 

   

fiweighted electoral control

section  for t approval and t veto it is always easy to verify whether there exists some
solution  although  perhaps  one that is very far from being optimal   for other scoring
rules  e g   for borda  it is not at all clear whether this is possible  and we conjecture that 
indeed  it is np complete to do so   however  it might be an interesting research direction
to evaluate the effectiveness of such greedy algorithms empirically  we point the reader to
the work of rothe   schend        for a recent survey covering experimental studies of the
complexity of control in elections  

   related work
the study of the complexity of  unweighted  electoral control was initiated
by bartholdi  tovey  and trick         who considered constructive control by
adding deleting partitioning candidates voters under the plurality rule and under the condorcet rule  that is  the rule that chooses condorcet winner whenever there is one  and has
no winners otherwise   the various types of control model at least some of the flavor of
actions that occur in the real world  such as voter suppression and targeted get out the vote
drives  see the survey of faliszewski et al         for more examples and discussions   a
major motivation for the study of control was to obtain complexity barrier results  that is 
results that show that detecting opportunities for various control attacks is computationally
difficult  in particular  bartholdi  tovey  and trick focused on np hardness as the measure
of computational difficulty 
this research direction was continued by hemaspaandra  hemaspaandra  and
rothe         who were the first to study destructive control attacks on elections  since
then  many authors have studied electoral control in many varied settings and under many
different rules  we refer the reader to the survey of faliszewski et al          some recent
research  not covered in that survey  includes complexity of control results for the t approval
family of rules  lin         for bucklins rule  and for fallback  its extension for truncated
votes  erdelyi  fellows  rothe    schend      a   for maximin  faliszewski et al         
for range voting  menton         and for schultzes rule and the ranked pairs rule  parkes
  xia        menton   singh        hemaspaandra  lavaee    menton         in the
present paper  we compare control and manipulation  the recent paper of fitzsimmons 
hemaspaandra  and hemaspaandra        studies settings in which both control and manipulation are occurring  researchers have  in the quite different setting of electing members
to fill a fixed size  multimember panel  defined variants of control that have coexisting constructive and destructive aspects  meir  procaccia  rosenschein    zohar         there is
also work analyzing counting variants of control  wojtas   faliszewski         where the
goal is not only to decide if a given control attack is possible  but also to count the number
of ways in which this attack can be carried out 
the complexity barrier research line turned out to be very successful  for most voting
rules that were considered  a significant number of control attacks are np hard  indeed 
it is even possible to construct an artificial election system resistant to all types of control
attacks  hemaspaandra  hemaspaandra    rothe         however  there are also a number
of results that suggest that in practice the complexity barrier might not be as strong as one
might at first think  for example  faliszewski  hemaspaandra  hemaspaandra  and rothe
       and brandt  brill  hemaspaandra  and hemaspaandra        have shown that if the
   

fifaliszewski  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra

votes are restricted to being single peaked  then many control problems that are known to
be np complete become polynomial time solvable  indeed  this often holds even if elections
are just nearly single peaked  faliszewski et al          as many real world elections seem
to be  see  e g   the discussion in gehrlein   lepelley        ch      similarly  some initial
experimental results of erdelyi  fellows  rothe  and schend      b  suggest that  at least
under certain distributions and settings  some np hard control problems can be solved in
practice on many instances  as part of a different line of research  xia        has studied
the asymptotic behavior of the number of voters that have to be added to deleted from a
randomly constructed election in a successful control action 
there are a number of other problems involving changing the structure of elections 
these problems include candidate cloning  where it is possible to replace a given candidate
c with a number of its clones  elkind et al         elkind  faliszewski    slinko         or the
possible winner problem when new alternatives join  where some additional  not yet ranked
candidates can be introduced  chevaleyre  lang  maudet  monnot    xia        xia  lang 
  monnot         this last problem is also related to the possible winner problem with
truncated ballots  baumeister  faliszewski  lang    rothe      a  
the only papers that directly raise the issue of weighted control are  to the best of
our knowledge  the theses of russell        and lin         however  we also mention the
papers of baumeister  roos  rothe  schend  and xia      b   and of perek  faliszewski 
pini  and rossi         where the authors  in effect  consider problems of affecting the result
of an election through picking the weights of the voters   the paper of perek et al  motivates
its study differently  but in effect studies a constrained variant of choosing voter weights  
their problems are similar to  though different from  simultaneous  multimode  addition
and deletion of voters  faliszewski et al         
this paper has given f    approximation results for weighted election control problems  elkind and faliszewski        have given a   approximation algorithm for a weighted 
bribery related case 

   conclusions
we have studied voter control under a number of voting rules  including scoring protocols 
families of scoring protocols  and the  weak condorcet consistent rules  we have shown
that the complexity of voter control can be quite different from the complexity of weighted
coalitional manipulation  there are natural voting rules for which weighted coalitional manipulation is easy but weighted voter control is hard  and there are natural rules where the
opposite is the case  furthermore  we have shown that for weighted voter control under
t approval and t veto  there are good  natural approximation algorithms  our results for
voter control in weighted elections are summarized in tables       and

table    approximation ratios of our algorithms for wccav and wccdv under tapproval and t veto 

appendix a  additional details related to section    
we present here the deferred proof of lemma      and some other details related to section     
proof of lemma       our goal is to show that gbw sometimes really does use fully t
times the optimal number of added deleted votes  for the cases in question  examples are
 somewhat detailed but  not hard to construct  and the lower bound even holds for t     
though in section     we obtained an exact solution by a different approach  however  one
does have to be careful to set the gap pattern created by the unregistered voters to be
a realizable one  for our t approval wccav construction  this will be easy to do directly 
for our t veto wccdv construction  we will establish realizability through a small tool
which we hope may prove useful elsewherethat lets one set up certain patterns of gaps 
we state the tool below as tool a   
fix any t                    we will now construct an instance of t approval wccav on
which gbw uses t times as many additions as the optimal strategy  our construction
will have  t candidates  the preferred candidate p  candidates a            at   and candidates
d            dt    now  suppose that under the votes of the registered voters  the gaps are as
follows  for each candidate ai   the total weight of approvals of ai exceeds the total weight
of approvals of p by exactly  t  and for each candidate di   the total weight of approvals
of di equals the total weight of approvals of p  this can easily be realized  namely by our
registered voter set being one weight  t voter who approves of each ai  
our set of unregistered voters will be as follows  there will be one unregistered voter 
call it nice  of weight  t  who approves of p and each of the t    candidates di   and
disapproves of each of the t candidates ai   for each j     j  t  we will have a single
unregistered voter  call it j   of weight  t  who approves of p and of each ai other than aj  
and disapproves of aj and all the di s 
note that gbw will add all t voters i   but ideal would be to add the single voter called
nice  since doing so suffices to make p a winner  so for each t    we have constructed
a setting where gbw for t approval wccav takes t times more than the optimal number
of added votes 
it also holds that for each t     we can similarly construct a setting where gbw for
t veto wccdv takes t times more than the optimal number of deleted votes  and can prove
that setting to be realizable  in fact  we can do so by following something of the flavor of
   

fiweighted electoral control

the above scheme  except with a slightly different vote set that adjusts it to handle the case
of deleting voters  and with more care regarding realizability  here is the construction  fix
any t                    our candidate set will again be the preferred candidate p  candidates
a            at   and candidates d            dt    let us specify the voter set  we will put into our
voter set a collection of weight   votes such that the gaps in total approval weight relative
to d  created by those votes are as follows  each of d  through dt  have the same total
approval weight as d    the total approval weight of p exceeds that of d  by  t     t  and
the total approval weight of each ai exceeds that of d  by  t   
as tool a   below  we will observe that for  t candidate t approval voting  any gap
pattern where the gaps are all multiples of t can be realized  since in the current proof
we are using  t candidate t veto  and that is the same as  t candidate t approval  tool a  
applies here  in particular  tool a   easily builds a set of weight   votes realizing precisely
our desired set of gaps   the exact number of weight   votes used in this construction is
not important  however  from the gaps mentioned above and the vote set size mentioned
in the tool  the precise number is easily seen to be   t       t  t    t      
we are not yet done building our voter set  we will also have in our voter set one
voter  call it nice  of weight  t  who approves of exactly all t of the ai s  and for each j 
   j  t  we will have one voter of weight  t who approves of exactly aj and all t    of
the di s 
under the entire set of votes created abovethe votes from the tool combined with
nice and the other t votes just mentionedit is easy to see that d  is a candidate having
the least total approval weight  and it is tied in total approval weight with each other di  
the total approval weight of p exceeds that of d  by  t  and each ai exceeds d  in total
approval weight by  t 
however  in light of the pattern of votes and weights we have here  it is clear that gbw
 in its version for t veto  will delete the t weight  t voters   note that the votes added by
tool a   are all weight   votes  and so are highly unattractive to gbw   but ideal would
be to delete the single voter called nice  since doing so suffices to make p a winner  so for
each t    we have constructed a realizable setting where gbw for t veto wccdv takes t
times more than the optimal number of deleted votes 
within the above proof  we referred to and used a small tool that can build certain
patterns of vote weight gaps in certain approval elections  it would be an overreach to
claim that this is a mcgarvey like tool  since this is a different setting than  and is a far less
flexible result than  the famous theorem of mcgarvey         however  it in a small way is
a tool that perhaps might be useful elsewhere  and so we state and prove this modest tool 
tool a    let t     let n            n t  be any list of nonnegative integers each divisible by t 
then there exists a collection of t approval votes  over  t candidates  such that under those
votes  relative to the candidate getting the fewest approvals  the list of gaps in number of
approvals between that candidate and the otherp t    candidates is precisely  n            n t    
furthermore  this can be done with   t      ni   t unweighted  i e   weight    votes  it
alternatively can be done with   t      weighted votes  or even   t    k i   ni      k
weighted votes  
proof  consider an election with  t candidates  where the votes cast are t approval votes 
consider the collection of  t    votes  each of weight one  in which the votes all approve
   

fifaliszewski  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra

of a particular candidate  for this example  let that one be the first candidate   and the
remaining t    approvals cyclically rotate around the other candidates  so the t approval
votes  viewed as bit vectors  are these     t   t        t   t              t  t         t  t          
   t   t    note that the first candidate is approved in all  t    of those votes  and each
other candidate is approved in exactly t    of those votes  so this collection of votes sets
a gap of t in favor of the first candidate  between the total approval weight of the first
candidate and that of each other candidate and the difference in total approval weight
between each other pair of candidates is zero 
given a gap pattern as stated in the tool  where each gap above the least approved
candidate  call that candidate c  is a multiple of t  we can simply use the approach of the
above paragraph repeatedly  to boost each other candidate  d  one at a time to whatever
multiple of t it is supposed to exceed c by in total approval weight   in this  d will play the
role the first candidate did in the previous paragraph   if ds surplus relative to c is kt
and we wish to use only weight   votes  we can do this for d with k  t     weight   votes 
otherwise  we can do this for d with  t    weight k votes  so the total number of votes
used is as given in the statement of this tool 
this appendix is not seeking to provide a comprehensive study of which gap collections
are realizable under t approval voting  nor is it seeking to find the smallest number of voters
needed to realize realizable gap collection  that is an interesting direction for study  but
is not our goal here  however  we mention that there clearly exist some gap collections
that cannot be realized  for example  the then there exists claim of tool a   is not even
always true if one removes the assumption of divisibility by t  an example showing this is
the following  consider a   candidate setting where votes will be   approval votes  and we
desire a gap list relative to the least approved candidate of            i e   each of the other
candidates has one more approval than does the least approved candidate  clearly  the
total number of approvals of any set of votes achieving this is  b      where b is whatever
number of approvals the least approved candidate happens to get under the vote set one is
trying  and so the total number of approvals is odd  however  any vote set of   approval
votes has an even total number of approvals  so this gap collection cannot be realized
