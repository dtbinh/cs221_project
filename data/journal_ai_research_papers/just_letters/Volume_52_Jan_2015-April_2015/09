   introduction
karttunen imagined text interpreting system designed keep track individuals  is 
events  objects  etc   mentioned text and  individual  record whatever said
 karttunen        p        used term discourse referent describe abstract individuals 
discourse referents easily mapped specific entities world  proper
names  others indeterminate sense compatible many different real world
entities  indefinites train  either case  discourse referents enter anaphoric
relations discourse  even know exactly real world object train picks
heard train distance         nonetheless refer subsequent pronouns
ascribe properties        loud horn  
discourse referents enjoy repeat appearances discourse  lead long lives
appear wide variety discourse contexts  whereas others never escape birthplaces 
dying one mention  central question paper factors influence
lifespan discourse referent  focus noun phrases  direct identifiers
discourse referents english  specifically  seek predict whether given discourse

pattern karttunen saw semantic scope anaphoric potential intimately related  given mention participate anaphoric relationships within scope 
outside it  broadly speaking  familiar quantificational binding logical languages
 cresswell        variable scope control structures programming languages  muskens 
van benthem    visser         thus  indefinite text level scope free reign  whereas one

john wants catch fish    see here 

   

sandy claims jesse bought bicycle    green frame 

negation  pattern makes intuitive sense  bills abilities regarding kite construction
involve specific kite  hence first sentence     automatically establish
right sort discourse referent  similarly  wanting catch fish guarantee salience  or
even existence  fish  sandy might unreliable source bicycle status
outside semantic scope claim 
       cohere indefinite interpreted outside scope relevant semantic
operator  relative preferences surface inverse scope harder characterize
negation  influenced complex ways semantics pragmatics
attitude predicate  reliability source information  nature conversational issues goals  example  speaker     regards sandy reliable source
regarding jesses bike buying  bicycle likely attain text level scope by product
jesse bought bicycle becoming text level commitment  karttunen        discusses patterns  observing that  many contexts  pragmatic pressures encourage embedded content become
elevated text level way  de marneffe  manning  potts        study newspaper data

majority news like   arguably result pragmatic factors 
far restricted attention anaphoric links indefinite establishes new
discourse referent pronoun refers it  observations carry directly links indefinites definite noun phrases  linguistic theories treat roughly pronouns additional
descriptive content  for discussion  see work elbourne         mention patterns tend
quite different  though  discourse referents established definites named entities

   conclusion
factors determine fate given discourse referent  nature  its internal morphosyntax  nurture  the broader syntactic semantic environments mentions   lifespan
model  section    suggests nature  nurture  interactions important  model
validates existing linguistic generalizations discourse anaphora  section     provides new
insights previous engineering efforts similar direction  section     show
linguistically motivated features bring improvement top surface features  section     demonstrating automatic language processing rely machine learning big data 
lifespan model performs well right  achieving     accuracy predicting whether
given mention singleton coreferent  alone could ramifications tracking topics 
identifying protagonists  discourse coherence  paper  demonstrated benefits
lifespan model coreference resolution  incorporated lifespan model two
different coreference resolution systems showed yields improvements practical
statistical significance cases  section    
stepping back  hope provided compelling illustration efforts theoretical
linguistics nlp complement other  developing models assessing
scientific engineering contexts
