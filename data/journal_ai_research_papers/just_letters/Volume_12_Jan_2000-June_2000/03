large number potential strategy choices state dialogue 
example  consider one choice faced elvis  email voice interactive system 
spoken dialogue system supports access user s email phone  elvis provides
verbal summaries user s email folders  many ways summarize folder
 sparck jones               summary could consist simple statement

decision theoretic planning applied problem choosing among dialogue
strategies  associating utility u strategy  action  choice positing
spoken dialogue systems adhere maximum expected utility principle
 keeney   raiffa        russell   norvig        

maximum expected utility principle  optimal action one maximizes expected utility outcome states 

thus  elvis act optimally choosing strategy state si maximizes u  si

 walker         argued lack performance function assigning utility
final state dialogue critical methodological limitation  seemed
three main possibilities simple reward function  user satisfaction  task completion 
measure user effort elapsed time dialogue number
user turns  appeared simple reward functions fail
