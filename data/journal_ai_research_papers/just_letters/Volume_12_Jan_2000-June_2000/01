    distributive property lc lc disjunctive labeled constraints
operations distributive  i e   distributes   non disjunctive metric tcn 
property hold disjunctive metric constraints  dechter  meiri pearl        show
following example  given disjunctive metric constraints 
a                   
have 

b            

c                    

 a  b c                      

 a b   a c              

thus  clearly  a  b c   a b   a c   however  distributive property holds
operations lc lc labeled tcn 
theorem    using labeled constraints i l sets  lc distributes lc 
proof  lets consider labeled constraints lc   lc j lc k   thus 
 lc lc lc j   lc  lc lc lc k  
expressed  according definition operation lc  as 
 lecp lc   lecq lc j   lc  lecp lc lecq     lc  lecrlc   lecs lc k   lc  lecr lc lecs     
lecp lc   lecq lc j   lecrlc   lecs lc k  lc  lecp lc lecq   lc lc  lecr lc lecs    
which  according definition lc  expressed as 
lecp lc   lecq lc j   lecrlc   lecs lc k  lc  lecp lc lecq   lc  lecr lc lecs    

 e  

expression  lecp lecr elemental constraints same labeled constraint lc  
however  set union label sets associated pair elemental constraints  input
derived  labeled constraint i l set  definition     is  lecp lecr   labelp   labelr 
i l set  thus  lecp lecr  label set associated  lecp lc lecq   lc  lecr lc lecs   i lset  consequence   lecp lc lecq   lc  lecr lc lecs   rejected operation lc  is 
lecp lc   lecq lc j   lecrlc   lecs lc k   lecplecr  lc  lecp lc lecq   lc  lecr lc lecs        
thus  expression  e   results 
lecp lc   lecq lc j   lecslc k  lc   lecp lc lecq   lc  lecp lc lecs     
expression  lc clearly distributes lc elemental constraints  i e   non disjunctive
constraints   therefore 
lecp lc   lecq lc j   lecslc k  lc   lecp lc  lecq lc lecs       
lecp lc   lc  lecp lc  lecqlc j   lecs lc k   lc  lecq lc lecs       lc lc  lc j lc lc k   
is  lc distributes lc labeled constraints
