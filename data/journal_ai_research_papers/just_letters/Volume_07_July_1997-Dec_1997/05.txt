abstract

a fundamental goal of research in molecular biology is to understand protein structure 
protein crystallography is currently the most successful method for determining the threedimensional   d  conformation of a protein  yet it remains labor intensive and relies on an

of protein structure determination is formulated as an exercise in scene analysis  a computational methodology is presented in which a  d image of a protein is segmented into a
graph of critical points  bayesian and certainty factor approaches are described and used
to analyze critical point graphs and identify meaningful substructures  such as ff helices
and fi  sheets  results of applying the methodologies to protein images at low and medium
resolution are reported  the research is related to approaches to representation  segmentation and classification in vision  as well as to top down approaches to protein structure

   introduction
crystallography plays a major role in current efforts to characterize and understand molecular structures and molecular recognition processes  the information derived from crystallographic studies provides a precise and detailed depiction of a molecular scene  an essential
starting point for unraveling the complex rules of structural organization and molecular
interactions in biological systems  however  only a small fraction of the currently known
proteins have been fully characterized 
the determination of molecular structures from x ray diffraction data belongs to the
general class of image reconstruction exercises from incomplete and or noisy data  research
in artificial intelligence and machine vision has long been concerned with such problems 
similar to the concept of visual scene analysis  molecular scene analysis is concerned with
the processes of reconstruction  classification and understanding of complex images  such

analyses rely on the ability to segment a representation of a molecule into its meaningful
parts  and on the availability of a priori information  in the form of rules or structural
templates  for interpreting the partitioned image 
a crystal consists of a regular  periodic   d arrangement of identical building blocks 
termed the unit cell  a crystal structure is defined by the disposition of atoms and molecules
within this fundamental repeating unit  a given structure can be solved by interpreting an
electron density image of its unit cell content  generated   using a fourier transform   from
the amplitudes and phases of experimentally derived diffraction data  an electron density
map is a  d array of real values that estimate the electron density at given locations in the
unit cell  this information gives access to the structure of a protein    unfortunately  only
the diffraction amplitudes can be measured directly from a crystallographic experiment  the
necessary phase information for constructing the electron density image must be obtained
by other means    this is the classic phase problem of crystallography 
in contrast to small molecules  up to     or so independent  non hydrogen atoms   the
determination of protein structures  which often contain in excess of      atoms  remains a
complex task hindered by the phase problem  the initial electron density images obtained
from crystallographic data for these macromolecules are typically incomplete and noisy  the
interpretation of a protein image generally involves mental pattern recognition procedures
where the image is segmented into features  which are then compared with anticipated
structural motifs  once a feature is identified  this partial structure information can be
used to improve the phase estimates resulting in a refined  and eventually higher resolution 
image of the molecule  despite recent advances in tools for molecular graphics and modeling 
this iterative approach to image reconstruction is still a time consuming process requiring
substantial expert intervention  in particular  it depends on an individual s recall of existing
structural patterns and on their ability to recognize the presence of these motifs in a noisy
and complex  d image representation 
the goal of the research described in this paper is to facilitate the image reconstruction processes for protein crystals  towards this goal  techniques from artificial intelligence 
machine vision and crystallography are integrated in a computational approach for the interpretation of protein images  crucial to this process is the ability to locate and identify
meaningful features of a protein structure at multiple levels of resolution  this requires a
simplified representation of a protein structure  one that preserves relevant shape  connectivity and distance information  in the proposed approach  molecular scenes are represented
as  d annotated graphs  which correspond to a trace of the main and side chains of the
protein structure  the methodology has been applied to ideal and experimental electron
density maps at medium resolution  for such images  the nodes of the graph correspond
to amino acid residues and the edges correspond to bond interactions  initial experiments
using low resolution electron density maps demonstrate that the image can be segmented
into protein and solvent regions  at medium resolution the protein region can be further
segmented into main and side chains and into individual residues along the main chain 
   strictly speaking  the diffraction experiment provides information on the ensemble average over all of
the unit cells 
   current solutions to the phase problem for macromolecules rely on gathering extensive experimental
data and on considerable input from experts during the image interpretation process

furthermore  the derived graph representation of the protein can be analyzed to determine
secondary structure motifs within the protein 
the paper presents a brief overview of protein structure and the problem of analyzing
a molecular scene  the processes of protein segmentation and secondary structure identification are described  along with experimental results  related and ongoing research issues
are also presented 

   protein structure

a fundamental goal of research in molecular biology is to understand protein structure and
function  in particular  structure information is essential for medicine and drug design  in
this section we review some of the concepts involved in protein structure  these concepts will
be used later in describing our computational approach to protein structure determination 
a protein is often characterized as a linear list of amino acids called the primary structure  or sequence  for the protein  all of the naturally occurring amino acids have a similar
backbone structure  consisting of a central carbon atom  cff    an amino group  nh    and
a carboxyl group  cooh    they are distinguished from one another by their varying side
chains that are connected to the cff atom  figure   illustrates alternative representations
for the amino acid alanine  where figure   c  displays its side chain consisting of a carbon
and three hydrogen atoms  associated with the side chain of an amino acid are properties
such as hydrophobicity  dislikes water   polarity  size and charge

adjacent amino acids in the primary structure for a protein are linked together by
peptide bonds to form a polypeptide main chain  or backbone  from which the various side
chains project  see figure     the carboxyl group of one amino acid joins with the amino
group of another to eliminate a water molecule  h  o  and form the peptide bond 
a secondary structure of a protein refers to a local arrangement of a polypeptide subchain
that takes on a regular  d conformation  there are two commonly recurring classes of
secondary structure  the ff helix and the fi  sheet  an ff helix occurs as a corkscrew shaped
conformation  where amino acids are packed tightly together  fi  sheets consist of linear
strands  termed fi  strands  of amino acids running parallel or antiparallel to one another
 see figure     these secondary structure motifs are generally linked together by less

figure    proteins are built by joining together amino acids using peptide bonds 
regular structures  termed loops or turns  as will be discussed later in the paper  the
characterization of a subsequence of amino acids as an ff helix or fi  sheet can be determined
by a geometric analysis of the distance and angle relations among local subsequences of
amino acids 
the global conformation of a protein is referred to as its tertiary structure  the way in
which proteins adopt a particular folding pattern depends upon the intramolecular interactions that occur among the various amino acid residues  as well as upon the interaction of
the molecule with solvent  water   two types of intramolecular interactions are often referred to in order to describe the secondary or tertiary structure of a protein  the first type
is a hydrogen bond  which results from the sharing of a hydrogen atom between residues 
ff helices and fi  sheets can both be described in terms of regular and specific hydrogen bond
networks  figure   illustrates a portion of a fi  sheet in which hydrogen bond interactions
link together parallel fi  strands  additional stability to the  d structure of a protein is
provided by disulfide bridges  this second type of interaction is a result of a chemical bond
occurring between two sulfur atoms carried by cysteine amino acid residues  these bonds
are energetically stronger than hydrogen bonds and contribute to stability under extreme
conditions  temperature  acidity  etc   
molecular biology is concerned with understanding the biological processes of macromolecules in terms of their chemical structure and physical properties  crucial to achieving
this goal is the ability to determine how a protein folds into a  d structure given its known
sequence of amino acids  despite recent efforts to predict the  d structure of a protein from
its sequence  the folding problem remains a fundamental challenge for modern science  since
the  d structure of a protein cannot as yet be predicted from sequence information alone 
the experimental techniques of x ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance currently provide the only realistic routes for structure determination  in the remainder of the
paper we focus on a computational approach for the analysis of protein images generated
from crystallographic data

   scene analysis
research in machine vision has long been concerned with the problems involved in automatic image interpretation  marr        defines computational vision as  the process of
discovering what is present in the world  and where it is   similar to visual scene analysis  molecular scene analysis is concerned with the processes of reconstruction  classification
and understanding of complex images  this section presents the problem of molecular scene
analysis in the context of related research in machine vision and medical imaging 
early vision systems generally include a set of processes that determine physical properties of  d surfaces from  d arrays  these input arrays contain pixel values that denote
properties such as light intensity  considerable research has been carried out on extracting
 d information from one or more  d images  a review of the application of stereo vision
to sets of  d images can be found in  faugeras         the principles of stereo vision
have also been applied to moving images  zhang   faugeras         range data provides
explicit depth information about visible surfaces in the form of a  d array  depth map  
depending on the application  both surface or and volume fitting techniques are applied
to these images  a more complete review of vision techniques can be found elsewhere  e g  
 arman   aggarwal        besl   jain        jain   flynn         
similar to the crystallography problem  medical imaging techniques require genuine
 d data  magnetic resonance imaging  mri  provides detailed high resolution information
about tissue density  emission computed tomography  ect   which includes positron emission tomography  pet  and single photon emission computed tomography  spect   gives
noisy  low resolution information about metabolic activity  x ray computed tomography
 ct  and ultrasound also provide  d density data  these methods can be used to obtain a
series of  d images  slices  which  when properly aligned  provide a  d grid  because the
interslice spacing may be much larger than the spacing between grid points in each slice 
alignment of the slices followed by interpolation between the slices is one area of research 
the low level segmentation of medical images typically uses  d extensions of  d techniques  edge detection becomes surface detection  region growing defines volumes instead
of areas  many applications typically do not require detailed  high level models  surface
information can be used to construct models for simulations  volumes and surfaces provide
structural measurements  higher level models are used in the construction of  templates 
for pattern matching  one interesting aspect of medical imaging is the availability of a priori
knowledge  either from a database of similar structures  or from images of the same region
in different modalities  e g  mri images of a brain can be used to guide segmentation of a
lower resolution pet image   one modality may also provide information that is not clear
in another modality  there is considerable research on  registration  of images   aligning
or overlaying two  d images to combine information  segmentation and identification of
matching  landmarks  is important for such image representations 
unlike input for the vision and medical imaging problems  the crystallographic experiment yields data that define a  d function  which allows for the construction of a  d array
of voxels of arbitrary size    an interpretation of the  d atomic arrangement in a crystal structure is readily available for small molecules using the data generated from x ray
   comparatively  machine vision techniques generally provide  d image representations and range data
only provide surface information  medical imaging techniques may result in a  d grid  but the spacing

diffraction techniques  given the magnitudes of the diffracted waves and prior knowledge
about the physical behavior of electron density distributions  probability theory can be applied to retrieve phase information  once magnitudes and phases are known  the spatial
arrangement of atoms within the crystal can be obtained by a fourier transform  the electron density function that is obtained   x  y  z    is a scalar field visualized as a  d grid of
real values called the electron density map  high density points in this image are associated
with the atoms in the small molecule 
the construction of an interpretable  d image for a protein structure from diffraction
data is significantly more complex than for small molecules  primarily due to the nature of
the phase problem  it generally involves many iterations of calculation  map interpretation
and model building  it also relies extensively on input from an expert crystallographer 
we have previously proposed that this process could be enhanced through a strategy that
integrates research in crystallography and artificial intelligence and rephrases the problem
as a hierarchical and iterative scene analysis exercise  fortier et al         glasgow et al  
       the goal of such an exercise is to reconstruct and interpret images of a protein
at progressively higher resolution  for an initial low resolution map  where the protein
appears as a simple object outlined by its molecular envelope  the goal is to locate and
identify protein and solvent regions  at medium resolution  the goal involves locating amino
acid residues along the main chain and identifying secondary structure motifs  at higher
resolution  the analysis would attend to the identification of residues and  possibly  the
location of individual atoms 
a primary step in any scene analysis  whether vision  medical or crystallographic data
are used  is to automatically partition an image representation into disjoint regions  ideally 
each segmented region corresponds to a semantically meaningful component or object in the
scene  these parts can then be used as input to a high level classification task  the processes
of segmentation and classification may be interwoven  domain knowledge  in the form of a
partial interpretation  is often useful for assessing and guiding further segmentation 
several approaches to image segmentation and classification have been considered in the
vision literature  of particular interest for the molecular domain is an approach described
by besl and jain          where the surface curvature and sign of a gaussian is derived for
each point on the surface of a range image  image segmentation is then achieved through
the identification of primitive critical points  peaks  pits  ridges  etc    haralick et al        
defined a similar set of topographic features for use in  d image analysis  wang and pavlidis
        and later lee and kim         extended this work to extract features for character
recognition  gauch and pizer        also identify ridge and valley bottoms in  d images 
where a ridge is defined as a point where the intensity falls off sharply in two directions
and a valley bottom is a point where the intensity increases sharply in two directions  they
further examined the behavior of the ridges and valleys through scale space  the resulting
resolution hierarchies could be used to guide segmentation  maintz et al         and guziec
and ayache        use  d differential operators through scale space to define ridges and
troughs  these provide landmarks which can be used to register images  leonardis  gupta
and bajcsy               use an approach where surface fitting  using iterative regression 
and volume fitting  model recovery  are initiated independently  the local to global surface
along the third axis may be large  and  in such a case  it is necessary to align and interpolate over
multiple  d slices 

   

fileherte  glasgow  baxter  steeg    fortier

fitting is used to guide multiple global to local volume fittings  and is used in the evaluation
of possible models 
as will be discussed in the next section  a topological approach is being used for the
segmentation and classification of molecular scenes  similar to the method of gauch and
pizer  critical points are used to delineate a skeletal image of a protein and segment it into
meaningful parts  these critical points are considered in the analysis of the segmented
parts  this approach can also be compared to a skeletonization method  which has been
described by hilditch        and applied in protein crystallography by greer          unlike
greer s algorithm  which  thins  an electron density map to form a skeleton that traces
the main and secondary chains of the molecule  our proposed representation preserves the
original volumetric shape information by retaining the curvatures of electron density at the
critical points  furthermore  rather than thinning electron density to form a skeleton  our
approach reconstructs the backbone of a protein by connecting critical points into a  d
graph structure 
critical points in an image have also been considered in the medical domain  higgins et
al         analyze coronary angiograms from ct data by thresholding to define  bright 
regions that correspond to the area around peak critical points  these seed regions are then
grown along ridges until there is a steep dropoff  post processing removes cavities and spurs 
the resulting volume is a tree like structure  which is then skeletonized and further pruned
to provide axes  the axes are converted to sets of line segments with some minimum length 
this is similar to bones  jones  zou  cowan    kjeldgaard         a graphical method
which has been developed and applied to the interpretation of medium  to high resolution
protein maps  this method incorporates a thinning algorithm and postprocessing analysis
for electron density maps  also worth mentioning is a previously described methodology
for outlining the envelope of a protein molecule in its crystallographic environment  wang 
      
a distinct advantage of molecular scene analysis  over many applications in machine
vision  is the regularity of chemical structures and the availability of previously determined
molecules in the protein data bank  pdb   bernstein  koetzle  williams    jr          this
database of  d structures forms the basis of a comprehensive knowledge base for template
building and pattern recognition in molecular scene analysis  conklin  fortier    glasgow 
    b  hunter   states        unger  harel  wherland    sussman         although the
scenes we wish to analyze are novel  their substructures most likely have appeared in previously determined structures  another significant difference between molecular and visual
scene analysis is that diffraction data resulting from protein experiments yield  d images 
simplifying or eliminating many of the problems faced in low level vision  e g   occlusion 
shading   the complexity that does exist in the crystallographic domain relates to the
incompleteness of data due to the phase problem 

   segmentation and interpretation of protein images
the use of artificial intelligence techniques to assist in crystal structure determination  particularly for the interpretation of electron density maps  was first envisioned by feigenbaum 
engelmore and johnson        and pursued in the crysalis project  terry         in conjunction with this earlier project  a topological approach to the representation and analysis

methods from both machine vision and crystallography were considered in the development of our computational approach to the analysis of protein structures  among those
studied  a topological analysis provided the most natural way to catch the uctuations of
the density function in the molecular image  in this section we overview such a method
for mapping a  d electron density map onto a graph that traces the backbone of the protein structure  we present results of applying the method for the segmentation of low and
medium resolution maps of protein structures reconstructed using the protein databank of
brookhaven  as well  we show how critical point graphs constructed for medium resolution
maps can be further analyzed in order to identify ff helix and fi  sheet substructures 

    representation of protein structure

crucial to a molecular scene analysis is a representation that will capture molecular shape
and structure information at varying levels of resolution  an important step in a molecular
scene analysis is the parsing of a protein  or protein fragments  into shape primitives so as
to allow for their rapid and accurate identification  shape information can be extracted
from several depictive representations   for example  van der waals surfaces  electrostatic
potentials or electron density distributions  since molecular scene analysis is primarily
concerned with images reconstructed from crystallographic experiments  electron density
maps provide a natural and convenient choice for the input representation 
as mentioned earlier  an electron density map is depicted as a  d array of real  nonnegative values corresponding to approximations of the electron density distribution at
points in the unit cell of a crystal  for the task of segmenting this map into meaningful
parts  we also consider the array in terms of a smooth and continuous function   which maps
an integer vector r    x  y  z   to a value corresponding to the electron density at location
r in the electron density map  similar to related formalisms in vision   the information
in an electron density map is uninterpreted and at too detailed a level to allow for rapid
computational analysis  thus  it is essential to transform this array representation into a
simpler form that captures the relevant shape information and discards unnecessary and
distracting details  the desired representation should satisfy the three criteria put forward
by marr and nishihara concerning     accessibility   the representation should be derivable
from the initial electron density map at reasonable computing costs     scope and uniqueness
  the representation should provide a unique description of all possible molecular shapes
at varying levels of resolution  and    stability and sensitivity   the representation should
capture the more general  less variant  properties of molecular shapes  along with their finer
distinctions 
several models for the representation and segmentation of protein structures were considered  these included a generalized cylinder model  binford         and a skeletonization
method  greer        hilditch         we choose a topological approach  which has been
previously applied in both chemistry and machine vision  in chemistry  the approach has
proven useful for characterizing the shape properties of the electron density distribution
through the location and attributes of its critical points  points where the gradient of the
electron density is equal to zero   johnson        
   the level of representation of the electron density map is comparable to a  d version of the primal sketch
in marr and nishihara s formalism         

   

fianalysis of three dimensional protein images

in the following section  we describe the representation of a protein structure in terms
of a set of critical points obtained through a topological analysis 

    deriving critical point graphs

in the proposed topological approach to protein image interpretation  a protein is segmented
into its meaningful parts through the location and identification of the points in the electron
density map where the gradients vanish  zero crossings   at such points  local maxima and
minima are defined by computing second derivatives which adopt negative or positive values
respectively  the first derivatives of the electron density function  characterize the zerocrossings  and the second derivatives provide information on the zero crossings  in particular 
they identify the type of critical points for the map  for each index value r    x  y  z   in
the electron density map  we define a function  r  
candidate grid points  those that are a maximum or a minimum along three mutually
orthogonal axes  are chosen and the function  r  is evaluated in their vicinity by determining three polynomials  one along each of the axes  using a least square fitting   r  is
the tensor product of these three polynomials  the location of a critical point is derived
using the first derivative of  r   the second derivatives are used to determine the nature
of the critical point  for each critical point  we construct a hessian matrix 

      x        x y       x z
h r          y x       y       y z
      z x       z y       z 
this matrix is then put in a diagonal form in which three principal second derivatives are
computed for the index value r

        z    

the three non zero diagonal elements of array h  r    the eigenvalues   are used to determine the type of critical points of the electron density map  four possible cases are
considered depending upon the number of negative eigenvalues  ne   when ne      the
critical point r corresponds to a local maximum or peak  a point where ne     is a saddle
point or pass  ne     corresponds to a saddle point or pale  while ne    characterizes r as
a pit  figure   depicts a  d graphical projection of potential critical points 
high density peaks and passes are the only critical points currently being considered in
our study  low density critical points are less significant since they are often indistinguishable from noise in experimental data 
the use of the critical point mapping as a method for analyzing protein electron density
maps was first proposed by johnson        for the analysis of medium to high resolution protein electron density maps  within the framework of the molecular scene analysis project 
the use of critical points is being extended for the analysis of medium and low resolution
maps of proteins  the topological approach to the segmentation of proteins was initially
implemented by johnson in the computer program orcrit  johnson         by first locating and then connecting the critical points  this program generates a representation that

figure    graphical illustration of critical points in  d  x and y  plotted against density

captures the skeleton and the volumetric features of a protein image  the occurrence probability of a connection between two critical points i and j is determined by following the
density gradient vector r r   for each pair of critical points  the program calculates a
weight wij   which is inversely proportional to the occurrence probability of the connection 
the collection of critical points and their linkage is represented as a set of minimal spanning
trees  connected acyclic graphs of minimal weight    

    results of segmentation at medium and low resolution

this section presents experimental studies that have been carried out on electron density
maps at   
a resolution  computations were first performed on calculated maps reconstructed from available structural data in order to generate a procedure for the further
analysis of experimental maps  three protein structures  phospholipase a    bp    ribonuclease t  complex   rnt  and trypsin inhibitor   pti   retrieved from the pdb  bernstein
et al          were considered  these structures are composed of          and    amino acid
residues  respectively  and were chosen because of the quality of the data sets  the electron
density images for the proteins were constructed using the xtal program package  hall  
stewart         and were then analyzed using a version of orcrit which was extended and
enhanced to construct and interpret critical point graphs for low  and medium resolution
electron density maps 
applying orcrit to electron density maps generated at medium resolution provides
for a detailed analysis of the protein structures  leherte et al       b   as illustrated in
figure    the topological approach produces a skeleton of a protein backbone as a sequence
   as will be discussed in section    this part of the program is currently being modified to allow for cycles
in the graph 

   

fianalysis of three dimensional protein images

of alternating peaks  dark circles  and passes  light circles   the results obtained from
the analysis of calculated electron density maps at   
a resolution led to the following
observations 

 a peak in the linear sequence is generally associated with a single residue of the
primary sequence for the protein 

 a pass in the sequence generally corresponds to a bond or chemical interaction that
links two amino acid residues  peaks  

thus  the critical point graph can be decomposed into linear sequences of alternating
peaks and passes corresponding to the main chain or backbone of the protein  for larger
residues  side chains may also be observed in the graph as side branches consisting of a
peak pass motif  these observations are featured in figure    which illustrates a critical
point graph and an electron density contour for the unit cell of a protein crystal 
in practice  we found that the critical point graph included some arcs originating from
the presence of connections between critical points associated with non adjacent residues 
this is illustrated in figure   and in the bottom left corner of figure    in the main chain of
both graphs there is a jump that occurred as a result of a disulfide bridge between nearby
residues  these bonds can often be identified  however  through further analysis of the
critical point graphs  for example  disulfide bridges are discerned from the representation
through the higher density values of their associated cysteine residues  to overcome the
problem of errors in the critical point graph due to ambiguous data we plan to generate
multiple possible models for a protein  corresponding to different hypothesized backbones
resulting from the critical point graph  thus  several alternative hypotheses will be considered and used to refine the image in an iterative approach to scene analysis 
experiments were also carried out at low    
a  resolution  where the following was
observed 

 secondary structure motifs  such as ff helices and fi  strands  correspond to linear
 or quasi linear  sequences of critical points  in the case of helices  these sequences
trace the central axis of the structure  see figure     whereas they tend to catch the
backbone itself for fi  strands  the average distance between observed critical points
and a model of the protein backbone was            
a 

 other non linear sequences of critical points were sometimes found to be representative
of irregular protein motifs such as loops 

 highly connected  small graphs of critical points appear in other regions of the maps 
in the solvent region  at the disulfide bridges and between close protein segments 

although the results of segmenting protein images using the topological approach has
proved promising  there is ongoing research being carried out to improve and enhance
orcrit  in particular  we are redeveloping the code for building the graph of critical points 
the new version of the code will incorporate more domain knowledge in order to find
multiple possible backbone traces  it will also incorporate a spline  rather than polynomial 
fitting function to interpolate the critical points for constructing the function  r

   methods for secondary structure identification

once a critical point graph is constructed  it can be analyzed to classify substructures
in the protein  a statistical analysis of the conformation of critical point sequences in
terms of geometrical parameters of motifs consisting of four sequential peak critical points
 pi   pi     pi     pi     suggests that the most useful parameters for the identification of ffhelices and fi  strands are the distance between peaks pi and pi     and the individual and
planar angles among critical points  we describe how these criteria were used to formulate
rules for the identification of secondary structure motifs in a medium resolution electron
density map of a protein 
in a previous paper  leherte et al       a   we described an approach to secondary
structure identification in which the geometrical constraints in a critical point subgraph

were treated in a boolean fashion  i e   they were either satisfied or not depending upon
whether or not their values fell within predetermined ranges  the procedure described in
the current paper relies on probabilistic belief measures based on statistics derived from
the pdb  following  we describe alternative approaches based on the comparison of critical
point graphs with idealized secondary structure motifs  the templates we used consisted
of local subsequences of critical points  each point denoting a residue in an idealized model
of a protein 

    estimating probabilities and combining evidence
to construct our model templates  we first performed a statistical analysis of    nonhomologous protein structures retrieved from the pdb  a set of occurrence probability
distributions f  ssmjg  were estimated for given secondary structure motifs  ssm  and geometric constraints  g   we derived these values for the ff helix  and fi  sheet and turn motifs
and for geometric constraints based on torsion and bond angles and on relative distance
between residues 
in building procedures for structure recognition and discrimination  two important issues must be faced  first  how does one compute the primitive marginal and conditional
probability estimates such as f  ssmjg   and  second  how does one combine the information from the several different pieces of geometric evidence for or against each class  as in
f  ssmjg    g     there are many tradeoffs to consider 
for the single attribute probability estimations  f  ssmjg   one can use discrete categories and estimate probabilities from frequency counts  if only a few  bins  are employed
for  e g   ranges of critical point inter distance values  then achieving sucient sample sizes
for bin counts presents little diculty  as the number of bins grows and the  width  of
each bin correspondingly shrinks  the resulting histogram becomes a better and better approximator of an underlying continuous distribution  but here problems with small counts
lead to larger sampling error  variance   if one chooses to fit continuous distributions to
the data  the bias variance dilemma manifests itself in the choice of distribution types and
the number of parameters for parameterized models 
in combining the individual terms representing secondary structure evidence  one must
address the issue of inter attribute dependencies and the accuracy and eciency tradeoffs it
poses  put most simply  how do we compute f  ssmjg   g   from f  ssmjg   and f  ssmjg   
a pure bayesian approach without underlying independence assumptions requires exponentially many terms  and we therefore seek heuristic shortcuts 
two methods for determining confidence values for secondary structure assessment were
studied and applied to the problem of secondary structure identification     a bayesian  or
minimum message length  mml  approach  similar to that previously used in protein
substructure classification in  dowe  allison  dix  hunter  wallace    edgoose         and
   an approach similar to that used in expert systems such as mycin  shortliffe         we
should emphasize here that the primary goal of our described research is the construction of
effective structure recognition systems  rather than the comparison of alternative methods
of machine learning and classification per se 
   

fianalysis of three dimensional protein images

    a bayesian mml approach

in adopting a bayesian latent class analysis approach to the problem  we decided to treat the
estimation and combination issues together by fitting mixtures of continuous distributions
to the data for each class  under the conditional independence assumption commonly used
in mixture model approaches to classification and clustering  mclachlan   basford        
in a latent class analysis approach to finding structure in a set of datapoints  one begins
with an underlying parameterized model  for example  one might posit that a set of points
represented by a  d scatterplot was generated by a  d gaussian  normal  distribution 
with means       and covariance matrix v     or the data might be better explained by
a mixture  or weighted sum  of several gaussian distributions  each with its own  d mean
vector and covariance matrix  in this approach  one tries to find an optimal set of parameter
values for the representation of each datapoint x    x    x     optimality may be defined
in terms of maximum likelihood  bayes optimality  or  as in our case  minimum message
length  mml    
in the case at hand  we have    dimensions instead of    and not all of the dimensions
are best modeled by simple gaussians  it is generally accepted that angular data should
be modeled by one of the circular distributions such as the von mises distribution  fisher 
      
two independence assumptions  crucial to computational eciency and data eciency 
underlie this approach 
   within a given class  the attributes characterizing a segment are mutually independent 
   the separate datapoints  each corresponding to a segment  are mutually independent 
although neither of these assumptions is strictly true in this application  these assumptions are commonly made in such circumstances  and the methods based on them work
well in practice  where dependence on these assumptions proves untenable  one can employ more elaborate models that incorporate explicit dependencies  such as bayes nets and
graphical models  buntine        

    a mycin like approach

we determined that a method similar to the one used for the diagnosis system mycin  rich
  knight        was also effective for our application  frequency distribution values provide
measures of belief and disbelief for secondary structure assignments based on individual
geometric constraints 

mb  ssm  g    f  ssm  g 
md ssm  g    f  not ssm  g 

   
   

where mb  ssm  g  is a measure of belief in the hypothesis that a given peak is associated
with a secondary structure ssm given the evidence g  whereas md ssm  g  measures the
   however  we use the general term  bayesian  informally for bayesian  minimum description length and
mml approaches to distinguish them jointly from other  especially  frequentist  approaches 

   

fileherte  glasgow  baxter  steeg    fortier

the extent to which evidence g supports the negation of hypothesis ssm for the peak  figure
   illustrates the computed probability distributions for each geometric constraint  bond
angle  distance and torsion angle  and each secondary structure motif  helix  strand  
like the modified bayesian mixture modeling approach described in the previous section 
the mycin methodology represents another heuristic approximation to a pure  naive  bayes
approach  in this case  the initial primitive probability terms are simple frequency counts
and the rules for combining probabilities assume implicitly that different evidence sources
are independent  this can be shown to lead to nonsensical classifications in extreme cases 
though in practice the approach often works quite well 
when two or more pieces of evidence are considered  the confidence measures are computed using the following formulae 
mb  ssm  g    g      mb  ssm  g      mb  ssm  g       mb  ssm  g    
   
md ssm  g    g      md ssm  g      md ssm  g        md ssm  g    
   
given these measures  an overall certainty factor  cf   can be determined for each peak p
in the critical point graph as the difference between the belief and disbelief measures 
cf  ssm  g    mb  ssm  g    md ssm  g 
   
where g corresponds to the geometric constraints associated with peak p 
a result of the application of this method to the interpretation of an ideal critical point
graph is illustrated in figure     this graph shows that broad bands of positive cf s are
indeed representative of regular secondary structure motifs such as ff helices and fi  strands 
in practice  for each critical point  our approach constructs a cf value for each secondary
structure hypothesis  at the end of the procedure  the hypothesis with the highest cf
value is selected  the final results are thus a set of sequences of cf values characterized by
subsequences of various lengths with identical secondary structure selection 
when two or more pieces of evidence are considered  the confidence measures are computed using the following formulae 
mb  ssm  g    g      mb  ssm  g      mb  ssm  g        mb  ssm  g    
   
md ssm  g    g      md ssm  g      md ssm  g        md ssm  g    
   
given these measures  an overall certainty factor  cf   can be determined for each peak p
in the critical point graph as the difference between the belief and disbelief measures 
cf  ssm  g    mb  ssm  g    md ssm  g 
   
where g corresponds to the geometric constraints associated with peak p  a result of the
application of this method to the interpretation of an ideal critical point graph is illustrated
in figure     this graph shows that broad bands of positive cf s are indeed representative
of regular secondary structure motifs such as ff helices and fi  strands 

    results

following we demonstrate how the two methods of analysis described in the previous section
can be applied to the identification of secondary structure in critical point graphs  we
consider graphs constructed from both ideal and experimental electron density maps

    application to ideal data
two bayesian mml and one mycin based analyses were applied to the secondary structure
identification of ideal critical point trees  the first bayesian module  bayes    was trained
using    out of the    ideal protein structure representations that were previously used to
generate occurrence frequency distribution functions for torsion angles  distances and planar
angles  figure      the second bayesian module  bayes    was trained using    ideal critical
point trees and    critical point representations obtained from the orcrit analysis of   
a
resolution reconstructed electron density maps  three ideal critical point representations
were kept for testing  cytochrome c    c c       residues  is characterized by helices
and turns only  penicillopepsin   app       residues  contains short helices    residues or
less   turns  and fi  strands up to    residues long  and the photosynthetic reaction centre
of rhodobacter sphaeroides   rcr       residues  is a rich ff helix structure with regular
segments of up to    residues 
the statistical bayesian modules allow the classification of critical points for which   
geometrical attributes can be calculated  except for the first three and the last three points
of a critical point sequence  all points participate in four torsion angles  four distances
 pi to pi      and three planar angles  the bayesian module can thus be applied to the
secondary structure recognition of segments which contain   peak critical points or more 
while the mycin based module is applicable to   point  or longer  sequences  however  for
comparison purposes  only points for which all    geometrical attributes could be calculated
were considered for recognition  results are presented in table    this table reports
   

fianalysis of three dimensional protein images

the number of segments  which have been correctly or incorrectly identified by either the
bayesian approaches or the mycin based module  all modules were designed to classify
recognized secondary structure motifs among four different classes   helix    strand    turn  
and  other   regarding the class  helix   a distinction between ff helices and helices     was
made a posteriori to help in the interpretation of the results 
two types of percentage values are given in table    the first type  i e   the percentage
of actual secondary structure information that was identified  was computed over the total
number of actual secondary structure motifs present in the three test protein structures    
ff helices     fi  strands         helices  and    turns  higher percentage values observed for
the mycin based results versus the bayesian results come from the fact that longer segments
are recognized as potential helices or strands  a better overlap with the actual secondary
structure motifs is thus more likely to occur using the mycin approach  this is illustrated by
the first two examples described in figure     selected secondary structure motifs of proteins
 c c and  app are compared with the hypotheses generated by the mycin based and bayes
modules  it is observed that  in these two cases  the longer identifications provided using
mycin are closer to the actual secondary structure of the amino acid sequences 
the percentage of correctly identified points within the ideal critical point segments was
computed over the total number of assigned critical point segments reported in table   
regarding the class  helix   the longer segments discovered by the mycin based module  as
well as the larger number of incorrectly recognized segments  lead to lower percentage values
for this particular method  this is shown in the third example displayed in figure     the
mycin based module associates a long ff helix with this particular amino acid sequence of
protein  rcr which deviates from ideality by five residues  while the bayes modules provides
reasonable solutions 
it is worthwhile to not that even if all of the segments are correctly assigned  the
percentage of correctly identified peaks is not       this is due to the fact that most of
the recognized segments  sequences of peaks  are shifted by one residue with respect to the
definition given in the pdb file 
from the results reported in table    it is clear that the first bayesian module allows a
finer differentiation between helices and turns  turns are four or five residue long segments
whose geometry may be similar to the helix geometry  than the mycin based approach  the
mycin based approach tends to assign a label  helix  to actual turns as shown in example
    in figure     on the other hand      helices are correctly identified by the mycinderived rules  but less often discerned using the first bayesian approach  see example    
in figure      the mycin based module actually has a strong tendency to exaggerate the
helical character of a segment that is distorted with respect to the ideal case  this raises
identification ambiguities for            short segments  no wrong identification is made
using the first bayesian approach  except for one fi  strand  this segment was also identified
as a possible strand using the mycin based module  but the hypothesis was later rejected
by a post processing stage which checks for parallelism with other discovered fi  strands 
   in this table a segment denotes a sequence  length     of adjacent peak critical points which belong to
the same secondary structure class  helix  fi  strand  turn   when comparing results  it should be noted
that the pdb data set is  itself  not strictly consistent since varying secondary structure definitions and
assignment methods are used to assess the structure of proteins

fianalysis of three dimensional protein images

the application of the second bayesian approach trained with more realistic critical
point representations generated a larger number of identified fi  strands and turns  this
however went with a number of incorrect identifications which are  in the case of fi  strands 
all associated with very short segments    or   points   in the case of turns  the percentage
of correctly identified critical points is lower      with respect to      due to one particular
motif containing seven points 
the analysis of ideal critical point trees allows to conclude that the second bayesian
module is more accurate in detecting fi  strand and turn structures  there is an increased
number of recognized motifs   but the use of noisy data in the training stage leads to a
less acute ability of the module to distinguish short helix like motifs  there is an increased
number of incorrectly identified motifs  

    application to experimental data
above we presented results obtained in applying methods for secondary structure identification to critical point graphs constructed from ideal electron density maps  following 
we describe an application of our methods to the recognition of motifs in a critical point
representation constructed by applying orcrit to an electron density map generated from
experimental data  we also show how our structure recognition approaches can be improved
through a postprocessing analysis of the representation  the experiment was carried out
using a   
a resolution experimental map of penicillopepsin  a protein composed of    
amino acid residues  hsu  delbare  james    hofmann        james   sielecki        
neglecting the passes located between the peaks  geometrical parameters were computed
for short fragments composed of seven adjacent peaks in the main branch of the graph for
the protein  before achieving this geometrical analysis  some preprocessing work was done
in order to fit the critical point graphs to an ideal model as described above  distances were
computed for sets of adjacent peaks  and peaks separated by a distance smaller than      
a
were merged into a single point situated at their center of mass  the critical point linkage
was then checked  if two adjacent peaks were separated by a distance    
a then the peaks
were assumed to be connected  considering connected sequences of three peaks at a time 
if the distance between the first and third peak was smaller than   
a  then the middle peak
was not considered to be part of the backbone of the protein  i e   the middle peak probably
denotes a side chain   finally  all resulting sequences of peaks  which are thus likely to be
representative of the protein backbone  were submitted to our three secondary structure
analysis methods 
initially poor results observed from the mycin like method motivated the development
of a post processing procedure which was imposed to eliminate all helical segments with
negative torsion angle values and all isolated fi  strand segments  i e   extended segments
that are not parallel to other similar motifs  this postprocessing step analyses the global
properties of the structure  while the measures of belief disbelief focus only on the local
geometric properties of a motif  postprocessing drastically reduces the number of incorrectly
recognized motifs and consequently increases the quality of the recognition procedure  rost 
casadia    farisellis        
table   presents a comparison of results of applying the three methods for identifying
secondary structure motifs to the experimental electron density map of penicillopepsin

according to table    the mycin based approach appears to have greater success in
recognizing helical motifs in experimental maps  example     in figure    depicts one
of the three helix motifs that was correctly recognized using the mycin based approach 
however  this approach also misidentifies several motifs as helices  among the four incorrectly identified helices  two four point segments are actual turns  one four point segment
is characterized by negative torsion angles  and a    point sequence of critical points is a
succession of three jumps  a jump is a connection occurring between non adjacent amino
acid residues   see example     in figure      the bayes modules incorrectly identify a
turn in this same region of the electron density map  jumps are problematic and may
seriously hinder the recognition rate  especially in experimental maps blurred by noise and
errors 
table   illustrates that the consideration of noisier data in the training set  module
bayes    leads to an improvement in the number of identified ff helices with respect to the
first bayesian module  example     in figure      however  this also leads to a number of
incorrectly identified segments  one segment of length two is wrongly identified as helix  it
actually corresponds to a jump between non adjacent amino acid residues  this jump also
generates an interpretation error with the mycin based algorithm  the poor accuracy in
turn recognition        is due to this wrongly identified segment 

   related research
the interpretation of protein images has been greatly facilitated in recent years by the
advent of powerful graphics stations coupled with the implementation of highly ecient
computer programs  most notably frodo  jones        and o  jones et al          although
these programs were designed specifically for the visual analysis of electron density maps
of proteins  they still require a significant amount of expert intervention and interpretation
and require considerable time investment  unlike these systems orcrit was designed as a
more automated approach to protein model building and interpretation 
the research presented in this paper is a component of an ongoing research project in
the area of molecular scene analysis  fortier et al         glasgow et al          the primary
objective of this research is the implementation and application of computational methods
for the classification and understanding of complex molecular images  towards this goal 
we have proposed a knowledge representation framework for integrating existing sources of
protein knowledge  glasgow  fortier  conklin  allen    leherte         representations
for reasoning about the visual and spatial characteristics of a molecular scene are captured
in this framework using techniques from computational imagery  glasgow        glasgow
  papadias         this paper extends previous publications in molecular scene analysis
by placing the research in an artificial intelligence framework and relating it to work in
machine vision  as well  it focuses on the use of uncertain reasoning for secondary structure
interpretation in the critical point representation and provides further experimental results
supporting our approaches to protein image interpretation 
two kinds of image improvement procedures are being considered in conjunction with
the information stored in a critical point representation  the first one consists of improving phase information at a given resolution  this is a necessary  but dicult  step in a
protein structure determination carried out from experimental data  structural informa

tion retrieved from a topological analysis might be injected into a so called direct methods
procedure  which has previously been successfully applied to the structure determination of
small molecules at high resolution  hauptman   karle         and more recently to macromolecules as well  however  these methods are presently not applicable to protein images at
low  and medium resolution data  and time consuming experimental methods are generally
used for phase recovery in protein structure elucidation 
the second set of procedures for protein image enhancement involves the construction
and interpretation of increasingly higher resolution maps  this is presently carried out
visually by crystallographers who have access to a well phased medium  or high resolution
map  the highest density regions are fitted with fragments retrieved from a database of
chemical templates  eventually allowing for the determination of the protein s  d structure
 jones et al          these two protein image reconstruction procedures are interrelated 
improved phases lead to a more reliable map in which further motif identification can take
place  under such considerations  secondary structure motifs detected in a low resolution
map are regions of interest to generate medium resolution information  which would further
give access to the the amino acid residue locations 
these procedures give rise to an iterative approach to molecular scene analysis  in
an iterative refinement process  if some portion of the image can be interpreted then this
information is applied  via an inverse fourier transform  to adjust the current phases  the
modified phases are then used to generate a new image  this approach to scene analysis thus
proceeds from an initial coarse  low resolution  image through progressively more detailed
 higher resolution  images in which further substructures are identifiable  
what this implies is that at any particular resolution  it is not necessary that our analysis
identify all substructures  the recognition of any parts of the scene can be used to improve
phases  giving rise to an overall improvement to the image  the new image can then be
further analyzed leading to additional interpretations  this process is iteratively applied
 within a heuristic search strategy  until the protein structure is fully determined 
the critical point representation described in this paper is just one component of the
knowledge representation scheme for computational imagery  a second component of the
scheme involves a spatial logic  which has been used to represent and reason with the
concepts and qualitative spatial features associated with a protein molecule  conklin et al  
    b  conklin  fortier  glasgow    allen         associated with the spatial representation
is a knowledge discovery technique  called imem  conklin   glasgow         based on
a theory of conceptual clustering  this system has been used to discover recurrent  d
structural motifs in molecular databases  conklin  fortier    glasgow      a  conklin
et al          we anticipate that this and other machine learning discovery techniques
 e g    hunter        lapedes  steeg    farber        unger et al          could be applied
to aid in a top down analysis of novel molecular scenes in order to anticipate and classify
structural motifs  this would be complementary to the bottom up scene analysis provided
by the topological approach described in this paper 
molecular scene analyses can further benefit from research in protein structure prediction  in particular  we are currently investigating formulations derived for the inverse folding
problem  bowie  luethy    eisenberg         given an amino acid sequence and a set of
   the resolution of the image depends both on the number of experimental reections available as well as
on the amount of phase information 

   

fileherte  glasgow  baxter  steeg    fortier

core segments  pieces of secondary structure forming the tightly packed internal protein
core   this approach to prediction evaluates each possible alignment  threading  of a known
primary sequence of amino acids onto possible core templates  the problem of identifying
individual residues in a critical point map at medium to high resolution can be addressed in
a similar manner  i e   by attempting to thread a sequence onto a protein structure derived
from our topological analysis  this problem is significantly simpler than protein structure
prediction since it involves threading a sequence onto its own experimentally determined
structure  rather than onto templates retrieved from a library of possible models  in the
threading approach proposed by lathrop and smith         a scoring function is used to
derive the statistical preference of a residue for a given environment  modifications to the
current scoring function  to incorporate properties available in the electron density map and
critical point graph representations  are being implemented in order to customize this approach to the information available from our topological analysis  baxter  steeg  lathrop 
glasgow    fortier        

   conclusions
it was reported in this paper that a topological approach can effectively be applied to the
segmentation of protein images into their meaningful parts at low  and medium resolution 
furthermore  it was shown that secondary structure motifs could be identified in mediumresolution images through a geometric analysis of the image representation  the application
of geometric rules and probabilities yields a measure of confidence that a given peak is a
component of a known secondary structure motif 
three secondary structure identification modules were applied to the interpretation of
ideal and experimental critical point graphs  two probabilistic bayesian approaches and
a mycin based method all revealed that geometric components such as torsion angles 
distances and planar angles are useful in that they differentiate between helices  strands 
and turns 
both the bayesian and mycin derived approaches were relatively successful in assigning
secondary structure identifications to sequences of critical points that are geometrically well
resolved  in the case of noisy experimental data  their accuracy decreased  we anticipate
that the accuracy could be further improved through the use of larger training sets and
training for      helix and other subclasses  however  we do not expect to achieve a full
secondary structure recognition for a protein   rather we expect to interpret good  less
noisy  portions of an electron density map and use this information to iteratively improve
our image in order to carry out further analyses 
the protein structures used to compose the training and test sets all contain backbone
information only  these structures are free of heteroatoms and or small solvent molecules 
the prior knowledge of the chemical composition of a crystallographic cell would certainly
help in anticipating problems such as connections between non adjacent residues through
high density peaks  additional experimental data would permit us to extend the scope of
the three approaches described in the present paper 
modern crystallographic studies remain at the forefront of current efforts to characterize and understand molecular recognition processes  a long term goal of our research in
molecular scene analysis is to assist these studies through a computational methodology for
   

fianalysis of three dimensional protein images

aiding expert crystallographers in the complex imagery processes required to fully interpret
the  d structure of a protein  the topological approach presented here is an important
component of this methodology  further research is required  however  to extend it for the
analysis of multi resolution maps  and to incorporate more domain knowledge into these
analyses
