 w    w      usual  often write u v rather v u  take u v
abbreviation u v not v u   u v abbreviation v u 
relation strict partial order   is  irre exive  for w  case
w w  transitive relation w   say strict partial order determined
 
said introduction  think providing likelihood  preferential  order worlds w   thus  w w  holds w least likely preferred normal close
actuality w    given interpretation  fact assumed partial
preorder easy justify  example  transitivity says u least likely
v  v least likely w  u least likely w  notice since
partial preorder  may pairs worlds w w  incomparable
according   intuitively  may prepared say either one likelier
other  say total preorder  or connected  linear preorder 
worlds w w    either w w  w  w 
since added likelihood worlds  seems reasonable add likelihood
language  allow us say    likely    example 
exactly mean  although semantic model allows us say
one world likely another  immediately tell us say set
worlds likely another set  but  observed introduction 
need make sense    likely   
extend likelihood ordering worlds one sets worlds  clearly
want way preserves ordering worlds  is  using  
denote ordering sets  would certainly expect u v would imply fug   fvg 
could impose minimal requirements  certainly would enough
uniquely determine ordering sets  example  two general approaches 
distinguish them  put subscripts   
   define    u    v u   u v   v   u v 
define strict partial order spirit two distinct ways 
 a  considering analogous procedure used get   define
   u    v u    v not v    u    call standard method
below 
 b  replacing definition      define    u    v
u   u v   v   u v  call alternative method 
   define    u    v v   v   u   u   u   v
u v  note approach focuses symmetric difference u
v   two ways getting strict partial order 
 a  standard method gives us u    v u    v not v    u

second approach  typically         widely used various applications
literature  example 
dershowitz manna        use define ordering multisets 
used provide technique proving program termination

paper  focus variant second approach  essentially due lewis
        interesting connections default reasoning  roughly speaking  take
u likely v every world v   likely world u  
make precise  u  v w   write u v every world v   v  
world u   u u v  easy check partial preorder  is 
exive transitive   the superscript  set    moreover  total preorder 
  finally  would expect  u v iff fug fvg  relation
sets worlds viewed generalization relation worlds 
apply standard method alternative method define
strict partial order  standard method gives us relation     u   v holds
u v not v u    alternative method gives us relation defined
finite sets taking u v hold u nonempty  every world v   v  
world u   u u v   the reasons u taken nonempty
definition restricted finite sets discussed below  
various approaches compare  clearly u    v implies u v   although
converse hold general     weak ordering  consequence    
  incomparable     s  similar remarks apply      again  easy
see u    v implies u v   hand  two notions equivalent 
example  suppose v v    fvg fv  v  g  fvg    fv  v  g 
focusing       here  rather          or notion   likelihood viewpoint  seem reasonable  intuitions regarding
extending likelihood worlds sets worlds seem well developed 
may possible motivate finest relation extending certain properties  fact motivation here  rather  interest motivated
deep connections   certain approaches nonmonotonic reasoning 
said that  many questions consider could perfectly well explored using           apology  discuss         paper 
except odd remark 
explained two methods getting strict partial order sets
worlds partial order worlds  standard method alternative
method really different  easy see u v iff fug fvg iff fug   fvg   this
true                   well   thus    agree singleton sets
extend relation worlds  moreover    strict partial orders
