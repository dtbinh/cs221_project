easy hard easy pattern diculty combinatorial search problems constraints added explained due competition decrease
number solutions increased pruning  test generality explanation
examining one predictions  number solutions held fixed choice
problems  increased pruning lead monotonic decrease search cost 
instead  find easy hard easy pattern median search cost even number
solutions held constant  search methods  generalizes previous observations
pattern shows existing theory explain full range
peak search cost  cases pattern appears due changes size
minimal unsolvable subproblems  rather changing numbers solutions

peak occurs near transition mostly solvable mostly unsolvable problems
thus independent particular search algorithm  behavior seen
large variety constraint satisfaction problems 
existing explanation concentration hard problems relies competition

problem constraints  williams   hogg         constraints  many solutions search usually easy  constraints added number solutions drops
rapidly  making problems harder  new constraints increase pruning unproductive search choices  tending make search easier  constraints 
decrease number solutions overwhelms increase pruning  giving harder
problems average  eventually last solution eliminated remains
increased pruning additional constraints  leading easier problems  thus phase
transition  point precipitous change solvability unsolvability  less coincides peak solution cost  effects become
pronounced larger problems considered  leading sharper peaks abrupt
