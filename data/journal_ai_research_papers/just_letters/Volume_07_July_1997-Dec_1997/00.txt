abstract

starting with a likelihood or preference order on worlds  we extend it to a likelihood
ordering on sets of worlds in a natural way  and examine the resulting logic  lewis earlier
considered such a notion of relative likelihood in the context of studying counterfactuals 
but he assumed a total preference order on worlds  complications arise when examining
partial orders that are not present for total orders  there are subtleties involving the exact
approach to lifting the order on worlds to an order on sets of worlds  in addition  the
axiomatization of the logic of relative likelihood in the case of partial orders gives insight
into the connection between relative likelihood and default reasoning 

   introduction
a preference order  on a set w of worlds is a reexive  transitive relation on w   various
readings have been given to the  relation in the literature  u  v has been interpreted as  u
at least as preferred or desirable as v   kraus  lehmann    magidor        doyle  shoham 
  wellman         it is this reading that leads to the term  preferential structure     u at
least as normal  or typical  as v   boutilier         and  u is no more remote from actuality
than v   lewis         in this paper  we focus on one other interpretation  essentially also
considered by lewis         we interpret u  v as meaning  u is at least as likely as v   
interestingly  all these readings seem to lead to much the same properties 
in the literature  preference orders have been mainly used to give semantics to conditional logics  lewis        and  more recently  to nonmonotonic logic  kraus et al         
the basic modal operator in these papers has been a conditional    where p   q is interpreted as  in the most preferred normal likely worlds satisfying p  q is the case   however 
if we view  as representing likelihood  then it seems natural to define a binary operator
 on formulas such that    is interpreted as    is more likely than    lewis       
in fact did define such an operator  and showed how it related to    however  he assumed
that  was total  that is  he assumed that for all worlds w  w    w   either w  w  or
w   w  but in many cases in preferential or likelihood reasoning  it seems more appropriate to allow the preference order to be partial  it may well be that an agent finds two
   there is a tradition  starting with lewis         of taking u  v  rather than u  v  to mean that u
is as preferred or as desirable as v  this last reading historically comes from the interpretation of the
preferred world as being less far from actuality  since there seems to be a split in the reading in the
literature  and  has traditionally been taken to mean  at least as likely  in the literature on qualitative
probability  fine        gardenfors         we take this reading here

situations incomparable as far as normality or likelihood goes  for example  one situation
may be better in one dimension but worse in another 
as we show in this paper  there are some subtleties involved in starting with a partial
preference order on worlds  what we are ultimately interested is not an ordering on worlds 
but an ordering on sets of worlds  to make sense of a statement like      we need to
compare the relative likelihood of the set of worlds satisfying   to that of the set satisfying
  unfortunately  there are many possible ways of extending a preference order on worlds
to one on sets of worlds  we focus here on two particular choices  which both agree with the
definition given by lewis in the case that the preference order on worlds is total  but differ
in general  we define  using the definition that allows us to make the most interesting to
work in default reasoning 
we then turn our attention to axiomatizing the likelihood operator  lewis provided an
axiomatization for the case where the preference order is partial  the key axioms used by
lewis were transitivity 
                                  
and the union property 
                                         
this latter property is characteristic of possibility logic  dubois   prade         in the
partially ordered case  these axioms do not suce  we need the following axiom 
                                                         
it is not hard to show that this axiom implies transitivity and the union property  in the
presence of the other axioms   but it is not equivalent to them  interestingly  it is the
property captured by this axiom that was isolated in  friedman   halpern        as being
the key feature needed for a likelihood ordering on sets to be appropriate for doing default
reasoning in the spirit of  kraus et al          thus  by considering preference orders that
are partial  we are able to clarify the connections between      and default reasoning 
the rest of this paper is organized as follows  in section    we consider how to go from
an ordering on worlds to one on sets of worlds  focusing on the differences between total
and partial preference orders  in section    we present a logic for reasoning about relative
likelihood and provide a natural complete axiomatization for it  in section    we relate
our results to other work on relative likelihood  as well as to work on conditional logic and
nonmonotonic reasoning  we conclude in section    proofs of the technical results can be
found in appendix a 

   from preorders on worlds to preorders on sets of worlds

we capture the likelihood ordering on a set w of possible worlds by a partial preorder  that
is  a reexive and transitive relation  on w    we typically write w   w rather than

   a partial order r is typically assumed to be reexive  transitive  and anti symmetric  so that if  a  b    r
and  b  a    r  then a   b   we are not assuming that  is anti symmetric here  which is why it is a
preorder 

 

firelative likelihood in partially ordered preferential structures

 w    w      as usual  we often write u  v rather than v  u  and take u  v to be an
abbreviation for u  v and not v  u   and u  v to be an abbreviation for v  u  the
relation  is a strict partial order   that is  it is an irreexive  for all w  it is not the case that
w  w  and transitive relation on w   we say that  is the strict partial order determined
by  
as we said in the introduction  we think of  as providing a likelihood  or preferential  order on the worlds in w   thus  w  w  holds if w is at least as likely preferred normal close
to actuality as w    given this interpretation  the fact that  is assumed to be a partial
preorder is easy to justify  for example  transitivity just says that if u is at least as likely
as v  and v is at least as likely as w  then u at least as likely as w  notice that since 
is a partial preorder  there may be some pairs of worlds w and w  that are incomparable
according to   intuitively  we may not be prepared to say that either one is likelier than
the other  we say that  is a total preorder  or connected  or a linear preorder  if for all
worlds w and w    either w  w  or w   w 
since we have added likelihood to the worlds  it seems reasonable to also add likelihood
to the language  to allow us to say    is more likely than    for example  but what
exactly should this mean  although having  in our semantic model allows us to say that
one world is more likely than another  it does not immediately tell us how to say that a set
of worlds is more likely than another set  but  as we observed in the introduction  this is
just what we need to make sense of    is more likely than   
how should we extend a likelihood ordering on worlds to one on sets of worlds  clearly
we want to do so in a way that preserves the ordering on worlds  that is  using   to
denote the ordering sets  we would certainly expect that u  v would imply fug   fvg  we
could impose a few other minimal requirements  but they certainly would not be enough to
uniquely determine an ordering on sets  for example  here are two general approaches  to
distinguish them  we put subscripts on   
   define    so that u    v if for all u   u and all v   v   we have u  v  we can
define a strict partial order in this spirit in two distinct ways 
 a  by considering the analogous procedure to that used to get  from   we define
   so that u    v if u    v and not v    u    we call this the standard method
below 
 b  by replacing  in the definition of    by   we define    so that u    v if
for all u   u and all v   v   we have u  v  we call this the alternative method 
   define    so that u    v if for all v   v   u   there is some u   u   v such that
u  v  note that this approach focuses on the symmetric difference between u and
v   there are again two ways of getting a strict partial order 
 a  the standard method gives us u    v if u    v and not v    u   
 b  the alternative method gives us u    v if for all v   v   u there is some
u   u   v such that u  v 
the first approach        was used by doyle  shoham  and wellman        in defining
a logic of relative desire  starting with a preference order on worlds  unfortunately  as

they themselves point out  these relations are too weak to allow us to make important
distinctions  they go on to define other notions of comparison  but these are more tuned
to their applications  and not in the spirit of the notions we are considering here 
the second approach  typically    and      has been widely used in various applications
in the literature  for example 
 dershowitz and manna        use it to define on ordering on multisets  which is then
used to provide a technique for proving program termination 
 przymusinski        uses it to order models of a database 
 brass         cayrol  royer  and saurel         delgrande         and geffner       
all use it to help model various aspects of default reasoning 
in this paper  we focus on a variant of the second approach  essentially due to lewis
        which has interesting connections to default reasoning  roughly speaking  we take
u to be more likely than v if for every world in v   there is a more likely world in u  
to make this precise  if u  v  w   we write u s v if for every world v   v   there is a
world u   u such that u  v  it is easy to check that s is a partial preorder  that is  it is
reexive and transitive   the superscript s is for  set    moreover  if  is a total preorder 
then so is s   finally  as we would expect  we have u  v iff fug s fvg  so the s relation
on sets of worlds can be viewed as a generalization of the  relation on worlds 
we can then apply both the standard method and the alternative method to define a
strict partial order  the standard method gives us the relation     where u   v holds
if u s v and not v s u    the alternative method gives us the relation s defined on
finite sets by taking u s v to hold if u is nonempty  and for every world v   v   there is
a world u   u such that u  v   the reasons that u is taken to be nonempty and that the
definition is restricted to finite sets are discussed below  
how do these various approaches compare  clearly u    v implies u s v   although
the converse does not hold in general     is a very weak ordering  as a consequence    
and   are incomparable  as are    and s  similar remarks apply to      again  it is easy
to see that u    v implies u s v   on the other hand  the two notions are not equivalent 
for example  suppose v  v    then fvg s fv  v  g  but we do not have fvg    fv  v  g 
why are we focusing on s       and s here  rather than          or some other notion   from a likelihood viewpoint  they all seem to be reasonable  our intuitions regarding
extending likelihood from worlds to sets of worlds do not seem to be that well developed  it
may be possible to motivate s as the finest relation extending  that has certain properties  but that was not in fact our motivation here  rather  our interest is motivated by the
deep connections between   and s and certain approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning 
having said that  many of the questions that we consider here could perfectly well be explored using           with that apology  we do not discuss         further in this paper 
except for the odd remark 
we have explained that there are two methods for getting a strict partial order on sets
of worlds from a partial order on worlds  but are the standard method and the alternative
method really so different  it is easy to see that u  v iff fug s fvg iff fug   fvg   this
is true for                and    as well   thus  s and   agree on singleton sets and
extend the  relation on worlds  moreover  both s and   are strict partial orders on
 

firelative likelihood in partially ordered preferential structures

finite sets   the requirement that u must be nonempty in the definition of u s v is there
to ensure that we do not have   s    strictly speaking  we should have also added it to
the definitions of    and    to ensure that they were strict partial orders   as shown in
lemma        and s are in fact identical if the underlying preorder  on worlds is a total
preorder  however  as the following example shows  s and   are not identical in general 

example      suppose w   fw    w  g  and  is such that w  and w  are incomparable 
then it is easy to see that fw    w  g   fw  g  however  it is not the case that fw    w  g s
fw  g  since there is no element of fw    w  g that is strictly more likely than w    
notice that we were careful to define  as we did only on finite sets  the following

example illustrates why 

example      let w    fw    w    w         g  and suppose that  is such that
w   w   w        
then it is easy to see that if we were to apply the definition of s to infinite sets  then we
would have w  s w    and s would not be irreexive  
the approach for extending the definition of s to infinite sets is essentially due to

lewis         who did it for the case of total preorders   the idea is to say that in order
to have u s v   it is not enough that for every element v in v there is some element u in
u that is more likely than v  this definition is what allows w   w  in example     
notice that in the finite case  it is easy to see that if u s v   then for every element v in
v   there must some u   u such that  not only do we have u  v  but u dominates v in
that for no v    v do we have v   u  it is precisely this domination condition that does
not hold in example      this observation provides the motivation for the ocial definition
of s  which applies in both finite and infinite domains 

definition      suppose  is a partial preorder on w   u  v  w   and w   w   we say
that w dominates v if for no v   v is it the case that v  w   notice that if  is a total
preorder  this is equivalent to saying that w  v for all v   v    we write u s v if u is
nonempty and  for all v   v   there exists u   u such that u  v and u dominates v  
it is easy to see that this definition of s agrees with our earlier definitions if u and v
are finite 
we now collect some properties of s       and s   to do this  we need a few definitions 
we say that a relation   on  w  not necessarily a preorder  is qualitative if  v    v      v 
and  v    v      v  implies v     v    v     we say that   satisfies the union property if
v    v  and v    v  implies v     v    v    we say that   is orderly if u   v   u    u  
and v    v implies u     v     we provide some intuition for these properties following
proposition      after showing how they help us characterize s       and s  
   we remark that similar results hold for    and      they are identical if the underlying order on worlds
is a total preorder  and this example can also be used to show that they differ if the underlying order is
partial 
   similar problems arise for    when dealing with infinite sets  and the solution for s described in
definition     can be applied to    as well

lemma      if   is an orderly qualitative relation on  w   then   is transitive and satisfies

the union property 

proof  see appendix a 
the converse to lemma     does not hold  indeed  an orderly strict partial order on
 w may satisfy the union property and still not be qualitative  for example  suppose
w   fa  b  cg  and we have fa  bg   fcg  fa  cg   fbg  fa  b  cg   fbg  fa  b  cg   fcg  and
fa  b  cg   fb  cg  it can easily be checked that   is an orderly strict partial order that
satisfies the union property  but is not qualitative 
with these definitions in hand  we can state the key properties of the relations we are
interested in here 

proposition     
 a  if  is a partial preorder on w   then s is an orderly partial preorder on  w that
satisfies the union property 

 b  if  is a partial preorder on w   then   is an orderly strict partial order on  w  
 c  if  is a strict partial order on w   then s is an orderly qualitative strict partial
order on  w  

proof  see appendix a 
we can now discuss how to interpret the properties we have been considering in light of
this result 
to the extent that we think of   as meaning  more likely than   then orderliness is a
natural property to require  if u is more likely than v   then certainly any superset of u
should be more likely than any subset of v   it is thus not surprising that all three of the
relations we have defined are orderly 
clearly the union property generalizes to arbitrary finite unions  that is  if   satisfies
the union property and a   bi   i              n  then a   b            bn   in particular  if
u  vj for j              n   then fug s fv            vn g  no matter how large n is  and similarly
if we replace  by   since the fact that s is qualitative means that it satisfies the union
property  by lemma       this is very different from probability  where suciently many
 small  probabilities eventually can dominate a  large  probability  this suggests that
u  v should perhaps be interpreted as  u is much more likely than v   more generally 
if   satisfies the union property  then u   v can be interpreted as meaning that u is
much more likely than v   in this sense  the notion of likelihood corresponding to s or s
is closer to possibility  dubois   prade        than probability  since the relation  more
possible than  satisfies the union property 
note that  in general    does not satisfy the union property  in example      we have
fw    w  g   fw  g and fw    w  g   fw  g  but we do not have fw    w  g   fw    w  g 
the qualitative property is somewhat more dicult to explain intuitively  of the three
relations we are considering  only the s relation satisfies it  the fact that   does not
satisfy it follows from lemma      together with the observation that   does not satisfy
the union property  example     also shows that s is not qualitative  since if it were 
 

firelative likelihood in partially ordered preferential structures

we could conclude from fw    w  g s fw  g  taking v    fw  g and v    v    fw  g in the
definition of qualitative  that fw  g s fw  g  a contradiction  our interest in the qualitative
property stems from the fact that  in a precise sense  it is the property that characterizes
s  it first arose in  friedman   halpern         where it was shown to be the key property
required of a generalization of probability called plausibility to capture default reasoning 
this is discussed in more detail in section   
if  is a total preorder  then we get further connections between these notions  before
we discuss the details  we need to define the analogue of total preorders in the strict case 
a relation   on an arbitrary set w    not necessarily of the form  w   is modular if w   w 
implies that  for all w    either w    w  or w    w    modularity is the  footprint  of a total
preorder on the strict order determined by it  this is made precise in the following lemma 
lemma      if  is a total preorder  then the strict partial order  determined by  is
modular  moreover  if   is a modular  strict partial order on w   then there is a total
preorder  on w such that   is the strict partial order determined by  
proof  see appendix a 
modularity is preserved when we lift the preorder from w to  w  
lemma      if  is a modular relation on w   then s is a modular relation on  w  
proof  see appendix a 
although we showed that the converse to lemma     does not hold in general for strict
partial orders  it does hold for orders that are modular 
lemma      if   is a modular strict partial order and satisfies the union property  then
  is qualitative 
proof  see appendix a 
as shown in  friedman   halpern         there is a connection between nonmonotonic
reasoning  conditional logic  and the qualitative property   this is discussed in section    
this relationship is best understood by considering s  rather than s or     which is why
we focus on s here  lewis        was able to use   because he focused on total preorders 
the following lemma makes this precise 
lemma      if  is a total preorder  then s and   agree  in general  u s v implies
u   v   but the converse does not hold 
proof  see appendix a 
we close this section by considering when a preorder on  w can be viewed as being
generated by a preorder on w   this result turns out to play a key role in our completeness
proof  and emphasizes the role of the qualitative property 
theorem       let f be a finite algebra of subsets of w  that is  f is a set of subsets of
w that is closed under union and complementation and contains w itself  and let   be an
orderly qualitative relation on f  
 

fihalpern

 a  if   is a total preorder on f   then there is a total preorder  on w such that   and
s agree on f  that is  for u  v   f   we have u   v iff u s v   
 b  if   is a strict partial order and each nonempty set in f has at least  log jfj 
elements  then there is a partial preorder  on w such that   and s agree on f  

log jf j 

proof  an atom of f is a minimal nonempty element of f   since f is finite  it is easy to
see that every element of f can be written as a union of atoms  and the atoms are disjoint 
part  a  is easy  for each w   w   let aw be the unique atom in f containing w  define 
on w so that v  w iff av   aw   it is easy to see that if   is a total preorder on f   then
 is a total preorder on w and   agrees with s on f   the proof of  b  is considerably

more dicult  see appendix a for details 
it is not clear that the requirement that the sets in f have at least  log jfj 
elements
is necessary  however  it can be shown that theorem      b  does not hold without some
assumptions on the cardinality of elements in f   for example  suppose that the atoms of
f are a  b   and c   let   be defined so that  b   c    a  w  a  x     for all nonempty
x   f   and these are the only pairs of sets that are in the   relation  it is easy to see
that   is an orderly  qualitative  strict partial order  however  if w   fa  b  cg  a   fag 
b   fbg  and c   fcg  there is no ordering  on w such that s and   agree on f   it is
easy to see that such an ordering  must make a  b  and c incomparable  but if they are
incomparable  we cannot have fb  cg s fag  on the other hand  if we allow c to have two
elements  by taking w   fa  b  c  dg  a   fag  b   fbg  and c   fc  dg  then there is an
ordering  such that s      we simply take a  c and b  d

   a logic of relative likelihood

we now consider a logic for reasoning about relative likelihood  let  be a set of primitive
propositions  a basic likelihood formula  over   is one of the form      where   and
are propositional formulas over   we read    as    is more likely than    let l
consist of boolean combinations of basic likelihood formulas  notice that we do not allow
nesting of likelihood in l  nor do we allow purely propositional formulas  there would no
diculty extending the syntax and semantics to deal with them  but this would just obscure
the issues of interest here 
a preferential structure  over   is a tuple m    w      where w is a  possibly
infinite  set of possible worlds   is a partial preorder on w   and  associates with each
world in w a truth assignment to the primitive propositions in   notice that there may be
two or more worlds with the same truth assignment  as we shall see  in general  we need to
have this  although in the case of total preorders  we can assume without loss of generality
that there is at most one world associated with each truth assignment 
we can give semantics to formulas in l in preferential structures in a straightforward
way  for a propositional formula    let      m consist of the worlds in m whose truth
assignment satisfies    we then define

m j     if      m s     m  
we extend j  to boolean combinations of basic formulas in the obvious way 
 

firelative likelihood in partially ordered preferential structures

notice that m j        false  iff       m     iff      m   w   let k  be an abbreviation for       false   it follows that m j  k  iff   is true at all possible worlds  
with these definitions  we can provide a sound and complete axiomatization for this
logic of relative likelihood  let ax consist of the following axioms and inference rules 
l  
l  
l  
l  
gen 
mp 

all substitution instances of tautologies of propositional calculus
       
                                                        
 k             k                         
k   for all propositional tautologies    generalization 
from   and     infer  modus ponens 

l   l   and l  just express the fact that s is irreexive  qualitative  and orderly 
respectively  this is made precise in the proof of the following result  the axiom gen is the
analogue of the inference rule  from   infer k    typically known as generalization  we
do not have this inference rule here  since our language does not allow nested occurrences
of   thus  for an arbitrary formula    the formula k  is not in our language  it is in our
language only if   is propositional  the axiom takes care of this case 

theorem      ax is a sound and complete axiomatization of the language l with respect
to preferential structures 

proof  the validity of l  is immediate  it is clear that the fact that s is irreexive and

qualitative  as shown in proposition      implies that l  and l  are valid  to see that l 
corresponds to orderliness  note that if m j  k             k         and      then
     m         m         m      m   and      m s     m   since s is orderly  it follows that
       m s       m   so m j          thus  l  is valid  it is also clear that mp and gen
preserve validity  thus  the axiomatization is sound 
the completeness proof starts out  as is standard for completeness proofs in modal logic 
with the observation that it suces to show that a consistent formula is satisfiable  that
is  we must show that every formula   for which it is not the case that    is provable
from ax is satisfiable in some preferential structure m   however  the standard modal
logic techniques of constructing a canonical model  see  for example   hughes   cresswell 
       do not seem to work in this case  finding an appropriate partial preorder on worlds
is nontrivial  for this we use  part  b  of  theorem       see appendix a for the details 
what happens if we start with a total preorder  let axm consist of ax together with
the obvious axiom expressing modularity 
l                                      
we say that a preferential structure is totally preordered if it has the form  w      
where  is a total preorder on w  
   k was defined by lewis         although he wrote   rather than k  

 

fihalpern

theorem      axm is a sound and complete axiomatization of the language l with respect
to totally preordered preferential structures 

proof  for soundness  we just have to check that l  is valid in totally ordered preferential

structures  this is straightforward and left to the reader  the completeness proof uses
theorem      again  but is simpler than the proof of completeness in theorem      we
leave details to appendix a 
we remark that in light of proposition      we can replace l  in axm by axioms saying
that  is transitive and satisfies the union property  namely 
l                                    
l                                             
the result is an axiomatization that is very similar to that given by lewis        
in the proof of theorem      when showing that a consistent formula   is satisfiable  the
structure constructed may have more than one world with the same truth assignment  this
is necessary  as the following example shows   we remark that this observation is closely
related to the cardinality requirements in theorem      b   

example      suppose    fp  qg  let   be the formula  p    p   q        p   q  
  p   q       p   q     p   q    it is easy to see that   is satisfied in a structure consisting
of four worlds  w    w    w    w    such that w   w    w   w    p   q is true at w    p   q is true
at w    and  p   q is true at both w  and w    however    is not satisfiable in any structure
where there is at most one world satisfying  p   q  for suppose m were such a structure 
and let w be the world in m satisfying  p   q  since m j  p    p   q   it must be the
case that   p  m s fwg  thus  there must be a world w      p  m such that w   w  but w 
must satisfy one of p   q or p    q  so m j    p   q     p   q       p    q     p   q   
contradicting the assumption that m j    
it is not hard to see that the formula   of example     is not satisfiable in a totally
preordered preferential structure  this is not an accident 

proposition      if a formula is satisfiable in a totally preordered preferential structure 

then it is satisfiable in a totally preordered preferential structure with at most one world per
truth assignment 

proof  see appendix a 
the results of this and the previous section help emphasize the differences between
totally preordered and partially preordered structures 

   related work

the related literature basically divides into two groups  with connections between them  
 a  other approaches to relative likelihood and  b  work on conditional and nonmonotonic
logic 
  

firelative likelihood in partially ordered preferential structures

we first consider relative likelihood  gardenfors        considered a logic of relative
likelihood  but he took as primitive a total preorder on the sets in  w   and focused on
connections with probability  in particular  he added axioms to ensure that  given a preorder
s on  w   there was a probability function pr with the property that  in our notation 
u s v iff pr u    pr v    fine        defines a qualitative notion  of comparative
probability  but like gardenfors  assumes that the preorder on sets is primitive  and is
largely concerned with connections to probability 
halpern and rabin        consider a logic of likelihood where absolute statements about
likelihood can be made    is likely  is somewhat likely  and so on   but there is no notion
of relative likelihood 
of course  there are many more quantitative notions of likelihood  such as probability 
possibility  dubois   prade         ordinal conditional functions  ocfs   spohn        
and dempster shafer belief functions  shafer         the ones closest to the relative likelihood considered here are possibility and ocfs  recall that a possibility measure poss on
w associates with each world its possibility  a number in         such that for v  w   we
have poss v     supfposs v    v   v g  with the requirement that poss w        clearly a
possibility measure places a total preorder on sets  and satisfies the union property  since
poss a   b     max poss a   poss b     the same is true for ocfs  we refer the reader
to  spohn        for details  fari nas del cerro and herzig        define a logic qpl
 qualitative possibilistic logic  with a modal operator   where    is interpreted as
poss         poss         clearly     essentially corresponds to     they provide
a complete axiomatization for their logic  and prove that it is equivalent to lewis  logic  
not surprisingly  an analogue of ax m is also complete for the logic  further discussion of
the logic can be found in  bendova   hajek         we discuss other connections between
possibility measures  ocfs  and our logic below  in the context of conditionals 
we now turn our attention to conditional logic  lewis s main goal in considering preferential structures was to capture a counterfactual conditional    where     is read
as  if were the case  then   would be true  as in  if kangaroos had no tails  then they
would topple over   he takes this to be true at a world w if  in all the worlds  closest  to
w  where closeness is defined by a preorder   where kangaroos don t have tails  it is the
case that kangaroos topple over  
more abstractly  in the case where w is finite  for a subset v  w   let best v     fv  
v   v   v implies v     v g  thus  best v   consists of all worlds v   v such that no world
v    v is considered more likely than v   we take best         
if w is finite  we define
 m  w  j      if best      m         m  
thus 
true 

    is true exactly if   is true at the most likely  or closest  worlds where   is

   actually  the axiomatization given in  fari nas del cerro   herzig        is not quite complete as stated 
to get completeness  we must replace their axiom qpl  true    by the axiom    false  luis fari nas
del cerro  private communication        
   to really deal appropriately with counterfactuals  we require not one preorder   but a possibly different
preorder w for each world w  since the notion of closeness in general depends on the actual world  we
ignore this issue here  since it is somewhat tangential to our concerns 

  

fihalpern

for infinite domains  this definition does not quite capture our intentions  for example 
in example      we have best w         it follows that if m    w         then m j 
true    p even if  makes p true at every world in w    we certainly would not want to
say that  if true were the case  then p would be false  is true if p is true at all the worlds in
w    the solution here is again a generalization of lewis s definition in the case of totally
ordered worlds  and is much like that for s in infinite domains  we say m j      if
for all u            m   there exists a world v           m such that v  u and v dominates
         m   this definition agrees with the definition given above for the case of finite w  

lemma      if w is finite  then best      m         m iff for all u            m   there exists
a world v           m such that v  u and v dominates          m  
proof  see appendix a 
lewis        argues that this definition of   captures many of our intuitions for counterfactual reasoning  we can give   another interpretation  perhaps more natural if we are
thinking in terms of likelihood  we often want to say that   is more likely than not in l 
this can be expressed as        more generally  we might want to say that relative to  

or conditional on being the case    is more likely than not  by this we mean that if we
restrict to worlds where is true    is more likely than not  that is  the worlds where    
is true are more likely than the worlds where      is true 
let us define      to be an abbreviation for k                   that is 
     is true vacuously in a structure m if does not hold in any world in m   otherwise 
it holds if   is more likely than not in the worlds satisfying  
although the intuition for    seems  on the surface  quite different from that for   
especially in finite domains  it is almost immediate from their formal definitions that they
are equivalent   this connection between   and    was already observed by lewis       
in the case of total proeorders  

lemma      for all structures m   we have m j      iff m j       
proof  this is almost immediate from the definitions  see appendix a for details 
given lemma      we can write   for both   and      the lemma also allows us to

apply the known results for conditional logic to the logic of relative likelihood defined here 
in particular  the results of  friedman   halpern        show that the validity problem for
the logic of section   is co np complete  no harder than that of propositional logic  for the
case of both partial and total preorders  
more recently    has been used to capture nonmonotonic default reasoning  kraus et al  
      boutilier         in this case  a statement like bird   fly is interpreted as  birds
typically y   or  by default  birds y   the semantics does not change  bird   fly is
true if in the most likely worlds satisfying bird   fly holds as well  dubois and prade       
have shown that possibility can be used to give semantics to defaults as well  where    
   we remark that there are also well known axiomatizations for various conditional logics  burgess       
friedman   halpern        lewis         these do not immediately give us a complete axiomatization
for the logic of relative likelihood considered here  since we must find axioms in the language with  
not in the language with

analogue of the definition of   in terms of s  goldszmidt and pearl        have shown
that a similar approach works if we use spohn s ocfs 
these results are clarified and unified in  friedman   halpern         suppose we start
with some mapping pl of sets to a partially ordered space with minimal element    such
a mapping is called a plausibility measure in  friedman   halpern          define    
as pl        or pl         pl         then it is shown that   satisfies the klm
properties the properties isolated by kraus  lehmann  and magidor        as forming the
core of default reasoning if and only if pl is qualitative  at least when restricted to disjoint
sets   since s  poss  and ocfs give rise to qualitative orders on  w   it is no surprise that
they should all lead to logics that satisfy the klm properties 
we remark we can also start with    and then define  in terms of    there are  in
fact  three related ways of doing so  define     to be an abbreviation for               
                    define      to be an abbreviation for                         
define       to be an abbreviation for       false                        

proposition      for all structures m   the following are equivalent 
 a  m j    
 b  m j     
 c  m j        
 d  m j         
the first translation is essentially due to kraus  lehmann  and magidor         the second is essentially due to freund         and the third is due to lewis         since the
equivalences are so close to those already in the literature  we omit the proof of this result
here  using these equivalences and results of  kraus et al          daniel lehmann  private
correspondence        has provided an alternate proof for theorem      see the remarks
after the proof of that theorem in appendix a for a few more details 

   conclusion

we have investigated a notion of relative likelihood starting with a preferential ordering on
worlds  this notion was earlier studied by lewis        in the case where the preferential
order is a total preorder  the focus of this paper is on the case where the preferential order is
a partial preorder  our results show that there are significant differences between the totally
ordered and partially ordered case  by focusing on the partially ordered case  we bring out
the key role of the qualitative property  axiom l    whose connections to conditional logic
were already observed in  friedman   halpern        
   that is  if v    v    and v  are disjoint sets  we require that if pl v   v      pl v    and pl v   v      pl v    
then pl v      pl v    v     the result also requires the assumption that if pl u     pl v        then
pl u   v

appendix a  proofs

we repeat the statements of the results we are proving here for the convenience of the
reader 

lemma      if   is an orderly qualitative relation on  w   then   is transitive and

satisfies the union property 
proof  suppose   is an orderly qualitative relation  to see that   is transitive  suppose
v    v  and v    v   since   is orderly  it follows that  v    v      v  and  v    v      v   
since   is qualitative  it follows that v     v    v     from the fact that   is orderly  we
get that v    v    thus    is transitive  as desired 
to see that   satisfies the union property  suppose v    v  and v    v    since   is
orderly  we have that  v    v    v  and  v    v    v    using the fact that   is qualitative 
we get that v     v    v     hence    satisfies the union property 

proposition     
 a  if  is a partial preorder on w   then s is an orderly partial preorder on  w that
satisfies the union property 
 b  if  is a partial preorder on w   then   is an orderly strict partial order on  w  
 c  if  is a strict partial order on w   then s is an orderly qualitative strict partial
order on  w  

proof  we prove part  c  here  the proof of parts  a  and  b  is similar in spirit  and is
left to the reader  the fact that s is an orderly strict partial order is straightforward 
and is also left to the reader  to see that s is qualitative  suppose v    v  s v  and
v    v  s v    let v   v    v    we must show that there is some v    v  that dominates
v    v  such that v   v  suppose without loss of generality that v   v   an identical
argument works if v   v     since v    v  s v    there is some u   v    v  that dominates
v  such that u  v  if u dominates v    then it clearly dominates v    v  and it must be

in v    so we are done  thus  we can assume that u does not dominate v    so there is some
element u    v  such that u   u  since v    v  s v    there must be some v    v    v 
  

firelative likelihood in partially ordered preferential structures

such that v  dominates v  and v   u    since u dominates v  and u   u  it follows that u
dominates v    since v   u    we have that v  dominates v    hence  v  dominates v    v   
it follows that v  cannot be in v    so it must be in v    thus  we have an element in v   
namely v    such that v   v and v  dominates v    v    as desired 

lemma      if  is a total preorder  then the strict partial order  determined by 
is modular  moreover  if   is a modular  strict partial order on w   then there is a total
preorder  on w such that   is the strict partial order determined by  
proof  suppose  is a total preorder  to see that  is modular  suppose that w   w   
given an arbitrary w    if w   w    it follows from the transitivity of  that w   w    on
the other hand  if it is not the case that w   w    then w   w    thus  we have that either
w   w  or w   w    so  is modular 
now suppose that   is a modular strict partial order on w   define  so that w  v
either if w   v or if neither w   v nor v   w hold  clearly   is reexive  to see that it
is transitive  suppose that v   v  and v   v    there are three cases      if v    v    then
since   is modular  we have that either v    v  or v    v    we cannot have v    v    for
then we would not have v   v    thus  we must have v    v    and hence v   v        if
v    v    then using modularity again  we get that either v    v  or v    v   again  we
cannot have v    v    so we must have v    v    and so we also have v   v        if neither
v   v  nor v   v  hold  then we claim that neither v   v  nor v   v  hold  for if v   v   
then by modularity  we must have either v    v  or v    v    and if v    v    then either
v    v  or v    v    which contradicts the assumption that v   v  and v   v    thus  we
can again conclude that v   v    thus   is transitive  finally  it is almost immediate from
the definition that   is the strict partial order determined by  
lemma      if  is a modular relation on w   then s is a modular relation on  w  
proof  suppose  is modular  we want to show that s is modular  so suppose that
v  s v    and it is not the case that v  s v   we must show that v  s v    since it is not
the case that v  s v    there must be some v   v  such that for all u   v    we do not have
u  v   now suppose v   v   we claim that v  v  to see this  note that since v  s v   
there must be some u   v  such that u  v  since  is modular  we have that either
u  v or v  v  since  by choice of v   we do not have u  v   we must have v  v  it
follows that v  s v   
lemma      if   is a modular strict partial order and satisfies the union property  then

  is qualitative 
proof  suppose that   is modular strict partial order that satisfies the union property 
to see that   is qualitative  suppose that  v    v      v  and  v    v      v    since   is
modular  it follows that either  v    v      v  or v    v    if  v    v      v    then  using the
fact that   satisfies the union property and  v    v     v    we get that  v    v       v    v    
using transitivity  it follows that  v    v      v    using the union property again  we get
that  v    v       v    v     this contradicts the assumption that   is irreexive  thus  we
  

fihalpern

must have that v   v    a similar argument shows that v   v    using the union property 
we get that v     v    v     as desired 

lemma      if  is a total preorder  then s and   agree  in general  u s v implies
u   v   but the converse does not hold 
proof  it is immediate from the definitions that u s v implies u   v   and the fact that
the converse does not hold is shown by example      to show that s and   are equivalent
if  is a total preorder  suppose u   v   clearly u is nonempty  since v s   for all v  
we want to show that u s v   so we must show that for all v   v   there is some u   u
that dominates v such that u  v  we actually show that there is some u   u such that
u  v  for all v    v   suppose not  then for every u   u   there is some vu such that we do
not have u  vu   since  is a total order  this means that vu  u  but this  in turn  means
that v s u   contradicting our assumption that u s v   since there is a u   u such that
u  v for all v   v   it easily follows that u dominates v and that u s v   as desired 
theorem       let f be a finite algebra of subsets of w  that is  f is a set of subsets

of w that is closed under union and complementation and contains w itself  and let   be
an orderly qualitative relation on f  
 a  if   is a total preorder on f   then there is a total preorder  on w such that   and
s agree on f  that is  for u  v   f   we have u   v iff u s v   
 b  if   is a strict partial order and each nonempty set in f has at least  log jfj 
elements  then there is a partial preorder  on w such that   and s agree on f  

log jf j 

proof  part  a  was already proved in the main text  so we prove part  b  here 

we proceed as follows  we say that a pair  a  x   is minimal pair of   if x   a and
there is no x    x     is used here to denote strict subset  such that x     a  the
minimal pairs in an ordered relation determine it  indeed  the following stronger result
holds 

lemma a    if   and    are two orderly qualitative relations on f such that for each

minimal pair  a  x   of   we have x   a  and for each minimal pair  a    x     of    we
have x      a    then         

proof  suppose the assumptions of the lemma holds and that x   y   we must show that
x    y   suppose a is an atom such that a  y   since   is orderly  we must have x  a 
let x   be a minimal subset of x such that x     a  since f is finite  such an x   must

exist  thus   a  x     is a minimal pair of    by assumption  we have x      a  since   
is orderly  we also have x    a  thus  we have x    a for each atom a  y   since
   is qualitative  it also satisfies the union property  and hence x    y as desired  by
symmetry  it follows that         
a minimal pair tree for   is a rooted tree whose nodes are labeled by atoms such that
the following conditions are satisfied 
  

firelative likelihood in partially ordered preferential structures

   if a node in the tree labeled b is an immediate successor of a node labeled a  then
there must be a minimal pair  a  x   of   such that b  x  
   if there is a node t in the tree labeled a and a minimal pair of   of the form  a  x   
then there must be some atom b  x such that a node labeled b is an immediate
successor of t 
   there does not exist a path in the tree such that two nodes in the path have the same
label 
   a node does not have two distinct successors with the same label 
a minimal pair tree is rooted at a if the root of the tree is labeled by the atom a 
since a subset of f can be written in a unique way as the union of atoms  there is
a     correspondence between subsets of f and sets of atoms  thus  there are exactly
log jfj  atoms  because of the third condition  a path in the tree can have length at
most log jfj   since all the atoms on the path must be distinct  it follows that there
are at most log jfj    log jfj log jfj     jfjlog log jfj    possible paths in a tree rooted at
a  we can identify a tree with the set of its paths  which means that there are at most
 log jfj     log jfj 
possible trees rooted at an atom a 
we now label each element in w with a minimal pair tree in such a way that every
element of atom a is labeled by a tree rooted at a  and every minimal pair tree rooted at a
is the label of some element of a  since we have assumed that a has at least  log jfj 
elements  there is such a labeling  let l w  be the label of node w  we define  on w so
that w   w iff l w    is a proper subtree of l w   clearly  is a strict partial order 
we claim that   agrees with s  by lemma a    it suces to show that if  a  x   is a
minimal pair of    then x s a  and if  a  x   is a minimal pair of s   then x   a  so
suppose  a  x   is a minimal pair of    we want to show that x s a  let w   a  and
suppose that l w    t   thus  t is a minimal pair tree rooted at a  the construction of
minimal pair trees guarantees that there is a successor of the root in tree t labeled b for
some atom b  x   consider the subtree of t rooted at b   this is a minimal pair tree
rooted at b   and hence must be the label of some w    b  x   thus  w   w  it follows
that x s a 
now suppose that  a  x   is a minimal pair of s   we want to show that x   a 
suppose not  as we show below  this means that there exists a minimal pair tree t rooted
at a such that no node in t is labeled by an atom contained in x   let w be an element of
a with l w    t   by construction  there is no element w  of x such that w   w  thus 
we do not have x s a  contradicting our initial assumption 
it remains to show that there exists a minimal pair tree t rooted at a such that no
node in t is labeled by an atom contained in x   clearly  we cannot have x     a for some
x    x   for then  by the preceding argument  we would have x   s a  and  a  x   would
not be a minimal pair of s  it follows that if  a  y   is a minimal pair of    then we must
have y   x      
two general fact about orderly  qualitative relations will be useful in our construction

proof  notice that  y   x     x    x   since    is qualitative  it follows that  y   x      x

 take both v  and v  in the definition of qualitative to be x   
lemma a    if    is an orderly  qualitative relation such that  x    x       x  and
x      x    then  x    x        x   
proof  since    is orderly  our assumptions imply that  x    x     x       x  and that
 x    x     x       x    since    is qualitative  it follows that  x    x        x    x     the
result follows using the fact that    is orderly again 
we start by constructing a tree whose nodes are labeled by atoms and whose root is
labeled by a  we proceed in log jfj      stages  at each stage  we have a tree whose nodes
are labeled by atoms  at stage    we just take a single node labeled by a  suppose we
have constructed a tree whose nodes are labeled by atoms and whose root is labeled by a
at stage k   log jfj   for stage k      for each leaf t in the stage k tree  if t is labeled by
b   then for each atom c   if there is a minimal pair  b  y   of   with c  y   we add a
successor to t labeled c   we call the tree constructed at the end of stage log jfj  the full
tree for a 
we next mark nodes in the full tree in stages  at the kth stage  for each atom b   we
mark an unmarked node t labeled b if one of the following three conditions holds     
b  x       there is an ancestor of t in the tree also labeled b       there is a minimal pair
 b  y   of   and all the successors of t with a label contained in y were marked at an earlier
stage  if there are no unmarked nodes satisfying one of these three conditions at stage k 
then the marking process stops  otherwise  we continue to stage k     since there are only
finitely many nodes  this marking process is guaranteed to terminate 
our goal is to show that  at the end of the marking process  the root of the full tree
is unmarked  for if this is the case  let t be the subtree of the full tree consisting of all
the unmarked nodes all of whose ancestors are unmarked  it is easy to check that t is a
minimal pair tree and our marking procedure guarantees that no node in t is labeled by
an atom contained in x   so we are done 
to see that the root of the full tree is unmarked  we proceed as follows  define a   cover
for a node t in the full tree to be just t itself  suppose we have defined a k cover for t  a
set z of nodes is a  k      cover for t if there exists a k cover z   for t such that for some
node t  in z   labeled b and some minimal pair  b  y   of    we have that z consists of all
the nodes in z   except for t    together with all the successors of t  that are labeled by an
atom contained in y   an easy argument by induction on k shows the following 
lemma a    if z is a k cover for a node t labeled c and k      then there exist a set y
such that  c  y   is a minimal pair of    successors t            tm of t in the full tree  atoms
d            dm such that y    mi  di and di is the label of ti   i              m  and a partition
z            zm of z into disjoint subsets such that zi is a ki  cover for ti  i              m  for
some ki   k 
given a set z   let uzn consist of the union of the atoms labeling the nodes of z still
unmarked at the nth stage  we take uz  to be the union of the atoms labeling the nodes in
z    given a node t  let vt consist of the union of the atoms d labeling ancestors of t such
that t or some descendent of t has the label d 
the key fact is the following result 
  

firelative likelihood in partially ordered preferential structures

lemma a    if z is a k cover for a node t labeled c and k      then  uzn   vt   x     c  
proof  we proceed by induction on k  with a subinduction on n  if k      then there is
some set y such that  c  y   is a minimal pair of   and the nodes in z are labeled by the
atoms contained in y   since  c  y   is a minimal pair of    we have that y   c   since  
is orderly   y   vt   x     c   by definition  uz    y   so this takes care of the case n     
suppose n     and  uzn     vt   x     c   for the inductive step  it suces to show that
that if
 y     v t   x     c
   
and d is the label of a node t  in z marked at stage n  then
  y     d    vt   x     c 

   

so suppose that     holds and d is the label of t    we must consider how t  was marked 
if d  x then     is immediate  if there is an ancestor of t  also labeled d  then d  vt  
and  since k      we have vt  vt   c   thus  since   is orderly  it follows that
 

 

  y     d    vt   x   c     c 

   

so     follows from lemma a    finally  suppose there is some minimal pair  d  y      of
  such that all the successors of t  labeled by an atom in y    are marked by stage n     
let z   consist of the successors of t  labeled by atoms contained in y      z   is a   cover for
t    since uzn        it follows from the induction hypothesis that  vt   x     d  again 
since vt  vt   c       follows orderliness and lemma a    and the desired     follows from
lemma a   
now suppose k      let y  d            dm   z            zm   t            tm be the sets and nodes
guaranteed to exist by lemma a    since zi is a ki  cover for ti for some ki   k  by
the induction hypothesis   uzn   vt   x     di   since uzn  uzn and vt  vt   c   by
orderliness  we have that  uzn   vt   x   c     di   since   is qualitative  we have that
 uzn   vt   x   c       i di    since  idi   y and y   c       now follows  and again    
follows from lemma a   
finally  suppose  by way of contradiction  that the root r of the full tree is marked  say
at stage n of the marking process  lemma a   assures us that a   x      since  a  x  
is a minimal pair of s  so condition     of the marking process does not apply  since r
has no ancestors  condition     does not apply either  thus  there must be some minimal
pair  a  y   of   such that all the nodes in the set z consisting of the successors of r in
the full tree that are labeled by atoms contained in y are marked by stage n      thus  we
uzn        since vr     and z is a   cover for r  by lemma a    it follows that x   a 
contradicting our original assumption

for the completeness theorems  theorems     and      it is convenient to start by proving theorem      since it is simpler  and contains the key ideas for the proof of theorem     

theorem      axm is a sound and complete axiomatization of the language l with
respect to totally preordered preferential structures 
  

fihalpern

proof  soundness was proved in the main text  so we just consider completeness here 

suppose that   is consistent with axm   we want to show that that   is satisfiable in a
totally preordered preferential structure  let               m be the basic likelihood formulas
that are subformulas of    by definition    is a boolean combination of these formulas 
define an atom over   to be a conjunction of the form             m   where i is either  i or
  i  using straightforward propositional reasoning  l  and mp   it is straightforward to
show that   is provably equivalent to the disjunction of the consistent atoms over    thus 
since   is consistent  some atom over    say   is consistent  we now construct a totally
ordered preferential structure satisfying   clearly this structure will satisfy   as well 
let p            pn be the primitive propositions in  that appear in    let  consist of
all the n    n truth assignments to these primitive propositions  we take w    and
let f consist of all subsets of   we define a total preorder   on f as follows  notice
that to each set v in f   there corresponds a propositional formula  v that is made true
precisely by the truth assignments in the subset v   of  that corresponds to v   to be
precise  given a truth assignment ff  let  ff consist of the conjunction q            qn  where qi
is pi if ff pi     true  and  pi otherwise  let  v be the disjunction of the formulas  ff for
ff   v      we take the empty disjunction to be the formula false   notice for future reference
that  v  v is provably equivalent to  v    v   conversely  for every propositional formula
that mentions only the primitive propositions in fp            pn g  there is a corresponding
subset a in f that consists of all truth assignments that make true 
we define a binary relation   on f as follows  v   v   iff ax        v   v   
we claim that   is a modular  qualitative  strict partial order on f   the fact that   is
irreexive follows easily from l   the fact that it is orderly follows from l   the fact that
it is qualitative follows from l   transitivity follows from the fact that   is qualitative and
orderly  by lemma      modularity follows from l   all these arguments are straightforward  we prove the fact that   is qualitative here  and leave the remaining arguments to
the reader 
suppose v    v    v    f    v    v      v    and  v    v      v    our assumptions and
the definition of f imply that ax         v    v     v   and that ax     
   v    v     v    by l  and straightforward propositional reasoning  we get that
ax        v    v    v     so that v     v    v    as desired 
by lemma      there is a total preorder    on f such that   is the strict partial order
determined by      by theorem      a   there is total preorder  on w such that    and
s agree on f   since   is the strict partial order determined by s  it follows that   and
  agree  since  is a total preorder  by lemma      s and   agree  let m    w      
we now claim that for each formula  j that is one of the basic likelihood formulas that is a
subformula of    we m j   i iff  j is a conjunct of   for suppose  j is of the form     
if  j is a conjunct of   then clearly ax              thus  a   a by definition 
so a s a by construction  since a and a consist of the worlds in w where and
    respectively  are true  it follows that  m  w  j       on the other hand  if   j is a
conjunct of   then we have ax               we must have  m  w  j          
for if  m  w  j       the same arguments as those above would imply that a   a  
and so ax           contradicting the consistency of  
thus  m satisfies   and hence   
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

firelative likelihood in partially ordered preferential structures

theorem      ax is a sound and complete axiomatization of the language l with respect

to preferential structures 
proof  again  soundness is proved in the main text  so we just consider completeness  the
ideas are much in the spirit of the proof of theorem      we again take  to consist of all
the n    n truth assignments to these primitive propositions  however  since we plan to
apply part  b  of theorem       we no longer take w     rather  we take w to consist
of  n copies of the truth assignments in   more precisely  let w consist of the n  n
worlds of the form wffi   such that i               n and ff     let f consist of all subsets of
w that correspond to subsets of   that is  v   f iff there exists some v     such that
v   fwffi   i               n   ff   v   g  clearly  f is a finite algebra with n elements  and
each nonempty set in f has at least  log jfj 
elements 
we define a strict partial order   on f just as in the proof of theorem      v   v   iff
ax       v   v   as before    is an orderly qualitative strict partial order on f   it
is not necessarily modular  since we no longer have l  
by theorem      b   there is a partial preorder  on w such that   and s agree on
f   let m    w       where  wffi     ff  just as in the proof of theorem      we can now
show that m j

as we noted earlier  daniel lehmann has found another proof for theorem      using
results from  kraus et al          to show that a formula in l that is consistent with ax
is satisfiable  he first translates it to a formula of conditional logic  using proposition      
it then follows from the representation theorem of  kraus et al         that this translated
formula is satisfiable in a preferential structure  the original formula is then satisfiable in
the same structure  this proof allows us to avoid using theorem      altogether  however 
we feel that theorem      gives insight into the connection between partial orders on worlds
and partial orders on sets of worlds  and thus is of interest in its own right 

proposition      if a formula is satisfiable in a totally preordered preferential structure 
then it is satisfiable in a totally preordered preferential structure with at most one world per
truth assignment 
proof  this follows immediately from the completeness proof of theorem      the structure
constructed in that proof has one world per truth assignment 
lemma      if w is finite  then best      m         m iff for all u            m   there
exists a world v           m such that v  u and v dominates          m  
proof  suppose best      m         m   if u            m   then we cannot have u  
best      m    since best      m         m   since w is finite  there exists a world v   best      m  
such that v  u  since v   best      m    we have that v dominates          m   conversely 
suppose that for all u            m   there exists a world v           m such that v  u
and v dominates          m   if u   best      m    then we must have u        m   for if not 
there exists a world v           m such that v  u  contradicting the assumption that
u   best      m

lemma      for all structures m   we have m j      iff m j       
proof  suppose m j       by definition  this means that for all u            m   there
exists a world v           m such that v  u and v dominates          m   it immediately
follows that  a  if         m     then          m     and  b  if         m       then by
definition we have m j              it follows from  a  that if         m     then
    m      so m j  k     and from  b  that if         m      then m j             
thus  m j  k                   i e   m j      
the converse follows equally easily  suppose m j        clearly if m j  k   then
we trivially have that for all u            m   there exists a world v           m such that
v  u and v dominates          m   on the other hand  if m j              then it
follows by definition that for all u            m   there exists a world v           m such
that v  u and v dominates          m   either way we have m j
