x    x

moreover  allowing integer variables  completely novel modeling capabilities emerge
setting w r t  earlier approaches  indeed  integer variables used isolate
non convex regions  might needed model specific application requirements
ntu nature  exemplified below 
    consider alternative scenarios 
allowing integer variables  may model alternative preferences players  i e  
may enforce disjunctions preferences  instance  consider scenario
either players     must get together    players     must get

basic modeling capabilities constrained games discussed 
order illustrate possible applications resulting framework  convenient
preliminarily observe two properties  which related use integer variables  
first  easy check that  constrained games  may deal imputation
sets arbitrary sizes  
proposition      let g   hn  vi tu game let x x g  arbitrary finite
set imputations  then  finite set constraints lc x g lc     x  
addition  integer variables might used succinctly specify exponentially many

believe setting emerging properties rather appealing
knowledge representation perspective  indeed  one may exploit constrained games
naturally model scenarios non transferable conditions emerge  devising
compact specifications desired restrictions utilities may transferred among
coalition members  fact  various circumstances envisaged usage
constrained games natural choice  instance  whenever worth distributed
among agents comes set indivisible goods  exemplified below 
example      distributing indivisible goods   certain region country
famous hosting several producers two kinds goods  named

respectively  assembling together one piece one piece   novel kind indivisible
good obtained and  fact  commercializing assembled product much
advantageous business selling separately  therefore  agreement found
amongst producers area order assemble pieces overall
available  provided resulting units assembled product  fairly  distributed
amongst involved producers  would independently commercialize them
