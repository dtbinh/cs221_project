   basic concepts argumentation frameworks
present work lies frame general theory abstract argumentation frameworks proposed dung         abstract framework assumes set arguments given  well different conflicts them  focuses definition

main issue argumentation system selection acceptable sets arguments  intuitively  acceptable set arguments must sense coherent
strong enough  e g   able defend every attacking argument   argumentation semantics defines properties required set arguments acceptable  this
collective acceptability   selected sets arguments given semantics
called extensions semantics  set extensions characterizes outcome

presence cycles attack graph often raised problems  namely
stable semantics  may happen extension exists  note authors
consider attack graphs without odd length cycles  arguing odd length cycle
carries counterintuitive information  following results give properties preferred 
grounded stable extensions depending existence cycles attack graph 
proposition    dunne   bench capon              let g denote attack graph associated ha  ri 
   g contains cycle  ha  ri unique preferred extension 
grounded extension unique stable extension 
      unique preferred extension ha  ri  g contains odd length cycle 
   ha  ri stable extension  g contains odd length cycle 
   g contains odd length cycle  preferred stable extensions coincide 
   g contains even length cycle  ha  ri unique preferred extension

section  give definition change argumentation  change may concern
set arguments and or set attacks them  so  least four cases
encountered 
definition    change operations  let ha  ri argumentation framework 
adding one interaction i  two existing arguments  i     x   
x a  change operation defined by 
ha  rii i    ha  r  i   i
removing one existing interaction i  ha  ri  i  r  change operation
defined by 
ha  rii i    ha  r    i   i
adding one argument z   set interactions concerning z denoted
iz change operation defined by 


ha  rii  z  iz     ha  z   r iz
here  iz supposed non empty set pairs arguments  either form
 x  z   z  x  x a  
removing one argument z interacts arguments change

ha  rii z   ha    z   r   iz
here  iz denotes set interactions concerning z  set   z  x   
 z  x  r    x  z   x  z  r  
note case adding new argument  resp  removing existing argument 
interact argument trivial  added  resp 
removed from  extension  indeed  change interesting concerned
argument interacts previous ones 
recent work dynamics argumentation  boella et al       a      b  
four types change defined introduced different names  respectively attack refinement  attack abstraction  argument refinement argument abstraction  however  operations attack refinement  attack abstraction argument
abstraction studied restricted context  see section   discussion  
following  identify argumentation framework ha  ri associated
attack graph g  write x g instead x argument represented node g 
set extensions ha  ri denoted e  with e            en denoting extensions  
   note that  definition  impossible  z  z  iz  
   note z removed  set interactions concerning z must removed

change operation produces new framework ha   r represented graph g  
new set extensions e  with e            ep denoting extensions  
explained above  changing argumentation framework may modify set extensions  given semantics  modifications less important  depends
kinds interactions added removed precisely status
arguments involved interactions 
impact change studied two points view 
first one concerns structure set extensions address either
comparison number extensions change  or 
number remains unchanged  comparison contents extensions
change 
second point view concerns status particular arguments 
so  next sections  propose two classes general properties change
operation  one point view  proposed properties characterize relation
particular framework resulting framework change 
    structural properties
structural properties  presented section  based impact change

proof lemma

let ei    z   assume argument attacking      z since z

now  prove g g number extensions  first part
proof  know extension g included extension g   moreover  two

two non empty preferred extensions defends elements strictly contains

so we know g least many extensions g g least one nonempty extension  so  ej e   ej        due lemma    ej    z  admissible g  so

proof proposition    
e         obviously change satisfies monotony

let eg  resp  eg   denote grounded extension g  resp g    due proposition      know
eg e eg e   dung        proved controversial argument

proof proposition     e         even length cycle g evenlength cycle g  consequence  according proposition     one extension e g
