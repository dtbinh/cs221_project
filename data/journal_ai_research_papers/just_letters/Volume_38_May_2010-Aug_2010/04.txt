abstract
coalitional games serve the purpose of modeling payoff distribution problems in scenarios where agents can collaborate by forming coalitions in order to obtain higher worths than
by acting in isolation  in the classical transferable utility  tu  setting  coalition worths
can be freely distributed amongst agents  however  in several application scenarios  this
is not the case and the non transferable utility setting  ntu  must be considered  where
additional application oriented constraints are imposed on the possible worth distributions 
in this paper  an approach to define ntu games is proposed which is based on describing allowed distributions via a set of mixed integer linear constraints applied to an
underlying tu game  it is shown that such games allow non transferable conditions on
worth distributions to be specified in a natural and succinct way  the properties and the
relationships among the most prominent solution concepts for ntu games that hold when
they are applied on  mixed integer  constrained games are investigated  finally  a thorough analysis is carried out to assess the impact of issuing constraints on the computational
complexity of some of these solution concepts 

   introduction
cooperative game theory providesunder the concept of coalitional gamesan elegant
framework for modeling multi agent systems where agents might collaborate with other
agents  by forming coalitions in order to guarantee themselves some advantage  within
this framework  each coalition s  n  where n is the set of all the players  also called the
grand coalition   is assigned a certain worth v s   r  and the outcome of the game is a
vector of real payoffs  xi  in that is meant to specify the distribution of the worth granted
to the players as the result of the game 
coalitional games are very often classified according to the mechanisms underlying payoff
distributions  the best known and most widely studied class therein is that of coalitional
games with transferable utility  or tu games   osborne   rubinstein         where no
constraints whatsoever are imposed over the way coalitional worths can be distributed
amongst coalition members  in this context  several outcomes might be associated with a

given game  and hence a relevant question is to understand which outcomes most properly
capture the rational behavior of the players  this matter has been extensively studied in
economics and social sciences  aumann   hart         in fact  various solution concepts
have been proposed in the literature to identify worth distributions that embody some
rational concept of stability  i e   that are somehow immune to deviations caused by
groups of players who may decide to leave the grand coalition and to form sub coalitions in
order to claim for higher worths 
there are cases  however  where players cannot freely distribute the coalition worth so
that a pure tu framework is not appropriate for such modeling purposes  aumann   peleg 
       to deal with those scenarios  coalitional games without transferable utility  or ntu
games  have been introduced in the literature  where the worth function is defined as to
return all those allowed worth distributions  called consequences  in this setting  associated
with any given coalition  rather than associating just one real value with it  in fact  it is
easily understood that ntu games are more general than tu ones  since any game of the
latter kind can be expressed as an ntu game where any possible worth distribution among
the members of a coalition s is a consequence for s 
    modeling ntu specifications via mixed integer linear constraints on
tu games
enhancing tu games with application oriented constraints over the set of all possible outcomes is an approach that has been exploited in the literature in order to model nontransferable scenarios  the first occurrence of the name constrained games goes back to
the seventies  and is due to aumann and dreze         who considered games with coalition structures  where players are partitioned in groups s            sk   and where any outcome
 xi  in must allocate the total payoff v s
p j   exactly amongst the members of each group sj  
that is  so as to satisfy the equalities isj xi   v sj    for    j  k  however  aumann
and dreze noticed in their turn that considering constraints over tu games was not a novel
idea  since the core and the nucleolus  which are two prominent solution concepts for tu
games  were indeed defined by gillies        and schmeidler         respectively  on games
with outcomes restricted to subsets of r n    
recently  constrained games have been reconsidered under the pragmatic perspective
of modeling some relevant application scenarios  such as price formation  byford       
and autonomic wireless networks  jiang   baras         as a matter of fact  however 
they received considerably little attention over the years  in particular  no general framework was proposed in the literature and no systematic study of the  analytical  as well as
computational  properties of this kind of approaches was conducted so far 
in this paper  we embark on a systematic formalization of constrained games  and we
investigate a framework allowing to succinctly specify non transferable conditions on the
outcomes of an underlying tu game  via a set of constraints expressed as mixed integer
linear  in equalities   note that such constrained games are defined on top of an underlying
tu specification  and hence they are expected to retain some of the nice properties of the
transferable setting  however  their ability of restricting the set of possible outcomes makes
   a good source for basic notions and results on mixed integer linear programming is the book by
nemhauser and wolsey

them fit the more general framework of ntu games  from which they smoothly inherit the
solution concepts that we shall use 
by allowing integer variables  the constrained games studied in this paper will improve
the expressiveness of classical ntu formalizations  in that admissible outcomes might be
possibly restricted over non convex and non comprehensive regions  definitions for these
properties are recalled in section       indeed  those ntu games that attracted much attention in earlier literature do not allow to specify arbitrary consequences  aumann   hart 
       rather  according to the classical definition due to aumann and peleg         an
ntu game is actually a game that must satisfy additional conditions such as  in particular  convexity and comprehensiveness  this view features several nice properties under a
mathematical perspective  weber        mclean         and it influenced several other proposals for defining ntu games which appeared in the literature  where further additional
conditions are often considered  however  this view is not appropriate to model application
scenarios where those required properties do not naturally hold 
in fact  the framework of constrained games proposed in this paper can be viewed as a
framework to  succinctly  define ntu games where convexity and comprehensiveness do not
necessarily hold  this is an important peculiarity of our approach from a knowledge representation perspective  an intuitive exemplification of those scenarios where this peculiarity
might be very useful is illustrated below 
example      three brothers  tim  john and jim  aged       and    resp   have collected
into a piggy money box all the small euro coins  values          and    cents  that mom
every week has given to each of them since the age of four  now  the time has come to
break the money box and divide its content  in order to avoid quarrels among the kids 
mom decides that the distribution has to go with their ages  so that tim will deserve at
least      the money john will get and john  in its turn  will receive at least     of jims
money share   jim is not very happy with that  but agrees to comply with moms rule  
the money box gets broken and the little treasure of seven euros and ninety euro cents 
as resulting from the available coin set including one hundred   cent coins  seventy   cent
coins  fifty   cents coins  and thirty    cent coins  can then be divided amongst the kids 
note that this scenario is based on the non transferable condition that the treasure
cannot freely be distributed amongst the brothers  the specific distribution rule  however 
does not fit the classical ntu formalization by aumann and peleg        
on the other hand  it is easily seen that the scenario can be modeled by means of a
set of linear  in equalities  with a few variables taking values from the set z of integer
numbers  in this example  admissible outcomes can indeed be identified as the solutions to
the following set of mixed integer linear  in equalities  the three brothers tim  john and
jim are denoted by using the indexes      and    respectively

note that the auxiliary variables ij denote the number of coins of value j taken by
player i  the first five equalities encode restrictions on the domains of the variables as defined
by the available coin set  and the subsequent two inequalities encode moms rule  which
can be seen  for instance  as playing the role of a central market regulation authority   
    contribution and organization
despite the intuitiveness of the modeling approach adopted in example      there is no
reference framework in the literature accounting for it  both because of the specificity of
moms rule and because money distribution is constrained by the available coin set  so that
those allowed outcomes do not form a convex set 
proposing and investigating a framework that may serve to model such kinds of scenarios
is the main contribution of this paper  in more detail 
 we define a formal framework for ntu games based on mixed integer linear constraints applied to an underlying tu game  we discuss its modeling capabilities  and
we show how main solution concepts for ntu gamesin particular  core  bargaining
set  kernel  nucleolus  and shapley valuespecialize within this novel framework 
 we analyze the impact of constraints on the basic properties of such solution concepts 
moreover  we highlight similarities and differences featured by constrained games as
opposed to tu games  by investigating in particular whether an outcome that is stable
 under these concepts  in a tu game remains stable if constraints are issued 
 we assess the impact of adding constraints on the computational complexity underlying some of these concepts  in particular  we consider games in characteristic function
form  von neumann   morgenstern        within a setting where worths are given
as oracles  in this context  we discuss both the intrinsic difficulty of checking whether
a given worth distribution is in the core or in the bargaining set  and of deciding the
non emptiness of these solutions  complexity results for constrained games are also
compared with those characterizing tu games 
the rest of the paper is organized as follows  in section    we overview some basic
notions of cooperative game theory  the formal framework of constrained games is defined
in section    the properties of this novel framework are illustrated in section    and its
analysis from the computational viewpoint is carried out in section    a discussion and a
few concluding remarks are reported in section   

   

fimixed integer constrained coalitional games

   coalitional games
an important issue in cooperative game theory is to determine payoff distributions for the
agents in scenarios where they can collaborate by forming coalitions  in order to obtain
higher worths than by acting in isolation  in this context  one usually does not take care of
other relevant problems emerging in the coalition formation process  such as the coalition
value calculation and the coalition structure generation problemsan excellent overview of
these problems and a state of the art algorithm facing the latter one can be found in the
work by rahwan  ramchurn  jennings  and giovannucci        
coalitional games have been introduced by von neumann and morgenstern        in
order to model payoff distributions problems in scenarios where utility can be freely transferred among players  in these cases  coalitional games can be described by associating a
payoff with each possible coalition  thus  a coalitional game with transferable utility  tu 
is a pair hn  vi  where n is a finite set of players  and v is a function  v    n   r  that
associates with every coalition s  n a real number v s   called the worth of s 
scenarios where utility cannot be freely transferred among players were first formalized
by aumann and peleg         in these scenarios  games have to be described by specifying
all the possible payoff distributions for the players in each coalition  rather than by just one
 global  payoff  for any coalition s  n   let  s  denote the cardinality of s  and let rs be
the  s  dimensional real coordinate space  whose coordinates are labeled with the members
of s  in particular  given a payoff vector x  rs   xi denotes the component associated
with the player i  s  then  a coalitional game without transferable utility  ntu  is a
pair hn  v i  where n is a finite set of players  and v is a function associating with every
coalition s  n a set of payoff vectors v  s   rs   also called consequences 
note that ntu games are generalizations of tu games  in particular  according to the
standard encoding  discussed  e g   in the handbook edited by aumann and hart        and
in the book by peleg and sudholter         the tu game hn  vi will be viewed throughout
this paper as the ntu game hn  vv i  where

let g   hn  v i be an ntu game  a consequence x  v  n   is an imputation of g if
the following two properties hold  see  e g   peleg        peleg   sudholter        

    efficiency  for each y  v  n    there is a player i  n such that xi  yi this property
is also known as weak pareto optimality  and
    individual rationality  for each player i  n   xi  max  yi   yi  v   i     
the set of all imputations of an ntu game g is denoted by x g   if g is actually a tu
game  i e   g   hn  vi  or  equivalently  g   hn  vv i   it is immediate to check that

   indeed  this encoding allows most of the solution concepts originally defined for tu games to be smoothly
generalized to the ntu frameworkas we shall discuss later in the section 

   

figreco  malizia  palopoli    scarcello

in particular  note that xj  v  j   encodes the individual rationality of player j at x 
an outcome for g is an imputation taken from x g  specifying a payoff distribution for
all the players of the game  this outcome should represent a kind of agreement amongst
players  which has to be stable with respect to the possibility that subsets of players get
an incentive to deviate from it  by forming coalitions on their own  depending on the criterium adopted to define this concept of stability  various  solution  concepts for coalitional
games can be defined  the most relevant solution concepts for coalitional gamessuch as
the core  the bargaining set  the nucleolus  the kernel  and the shapley valuehave been
originally defined within the tu framework  see  e g   osborne   rubinstein         several
efforts have been subsequently paid to apply these concepts within the more general ntu
framework  see  e g   aumann   hart         natural extensions have been defined in some
cases  while natural counterparts are still missing and looked for in others 
in the following  we shall provide an overview of the definitions of the basic solution
concepts for tu games and their canonical extensions to ntu games 
    core
the concept of the core goes back to the work by edgeworth         in the tu framework 
it has been formalized by gillies         and it was first extended to the ntu framework
by aumann         in fact  this is the solution concept that enjoys the most canonical
extension to the ntu case  which is the one presented next 
let g   hn  v i be an ntu game  for any coalition s  n   a vector y  rs of
real numbers is called s feasible if y  v  s   let x be a consequence in rn   then  the
pair  y  s  is an objection to x if y is an s feasible payoff vector such that yk   xk for all
k  sin this case  the coalition s is also said to block x via y 
definition      the core c  g  of an ntu game g   hn  v i is the set of all imputations
x to which there is no objection  that is 
c  g     x  x g   s  n  y  v  s  such that yk   xk   k  s    



thus  an imputation x in the core is stable because there is no coalition whose members will receive a higher payoff than in x by leaving the grand coalition 
the application of definition     over tu games exactly coincides with the original
formulation by gillies         moreover  it is easily seen that  when applied over tu
games  definition     can be equivalently restated as illustrated next  see  e g   osborne  
rubinstein         for a coalition
s  n and a payoff vector x  rn   we define x s  as
p
the value of the expression is xi  
definition      the core c  g  of a tu game g   hn  vi is the set of all imputations
x  x hn  vv i  such that  for each coalition s  n   x s   v s  


thus  the core of a coalitional game with transferable utility and  n   players is defined
by a set of inequalities over  n   variables and  in fact  it is a polytope in rn  

   

fimixed integer constrained coalitional games

    bargaining set
the concept of bargaining set was defined by aumann and maschler         and has many
variants even within the tu context  see  e g   maschler         a natural extension to the
ntu framework was given by peleg         which is discussed next 
let g   hn  v i be an ntu game  and x be a consequence in v  n    let s  n be
a coalition  and y be an s feasible payoff vector  i e   y  v  s    the pair  y  s  is an
objection of player i against player j to x if i  s  j 
  s  and yk   xk for all k  s 
a counterobjection to the objection  y  s  of i against j to x is a pair  z  t   where j  t  
i
  t   and z is a t  feasible payoff vector such that zk  xk for all k  t   s and zk  yk
for all k  t  s  if there does not exist any counterobjection to  y  s   we say that  y  s 
is a justified objection 
definition      the bargaining set b g  of an ntu game g is the set of all imputations
x to which there is no justified objection 

note that the above definitions straightforwardly apply to tu games  and coincide for
them with the one originally proposed by aumann and maschler         for the sake of
completeness  we just recall here that y  resp   z  is an s feasible  resp   t  feasible  payoff
vector in the tu game hn  vi if y  vv  s 
p resp   z  vv  t    holds 
p that is  if y s   v s 
 resp   z t    v t   recall that y s    is yi  resp   z t     it zi   
    nucleolus

the nucleolus is a solution concept introduced by schmeidler         its definition is based
on the notion of excess e s  x  v   of a coalition s at an imputation x  which is a measure
of the dissatisfaction of s at x 
in the case of tu games  where v denotes the worth function   it is widely accepted that
the canonical definition of the excess is e s  x  vv     v s   x s   then  for each vector
x  rn   let us define  x  as the vector where the excesses associated with all coalitions
 but the empty one  are arranged in non increasing order 
 x     e s    x  v    e s    x  v            e s  n      x  v    
let  x  i  denote the i th element of  x   for a pair of imputations x and y  we say
that  x  is lexicographically smaller than  y   denoted by  x    y   if there exists a
positive integer q such that  x  i     y  i  for all i   q and  x  q     y  q  
since the excess is a measure of dissatisfaction  the imputations lexicographically minimizing the vector of the excesses are very natural candidates to be the stable outcomes
for the game  this is indeed the idea underlying the definition of the nucleolus  as it was
defined by schmeidler        for tu games 
definition      the nucleolus n  g  of a tu game g   hn  vi is the set
n  g     x  x hn  vv i    y  x g  such that  y    x   



for games that do not fit the tu framework  the above definition can still be used
provided that a suitable generalization of the concept of excess is conceived  the most
   

figreco  malizia  palopoli    scarcello

influential approach to define excess functions for ntu games was proposed by kalai        
who axiomatized the properties that such functions should satisfy as to retain some of the
nice features of the underlying tu specifications  these properties are as follows 
   let x  y  rn   if xi   yi for all players i  s  then e s  x  v     e s  y  v   holds  for
each function v  
   let x  y  rn   if xi   yi for all players i  s  then e s  x  v     e s  y  v   holds  for
each function v  
   let x  rs   if there is no vector y  v  s  such that  i  s  yi   xi   then
e s  x  v       holds  for each function v  
   e s  x  v   is continuous jointly in x and v  
as an example  a prototypical excess function discussed by kalai is the following 


t
  i  s  
ek  s  x  v     sup t  r   y  v  s  such that yi   xi  
 s 

   

this function coincides with the canonical excess function v s x s  whenever it is applied
on tu games  kalai        
    kernel
the kernel is a solution concept originally introduced in the tu framework by davis and
maschler        to help to understand the properties of the bargaining set 
for a tu game hn  vi  define the surplus si j  x  of player i against player j at an
imputation x as the value si j  x    maxs is j   s e s  x  vv     maxs is j   s  v s   x s   
definition      the kernel k  g  of a tu game g   hn  vi is the set 
k  g     x  x hn  vv i    si j  x    sj i x   xj   v  j    i  j  n  i    j  



note that the above definition for tu games is again based on the notion of excess 
intuitively  the surplus of player i against j at x is the highest payoff that player i can
gain  or the minimal amount i can lose  if it is a negative value  without the cooperation
of j  by forming coalitions with other players that are satisfied at x  thus  si j  x  is the
weight of a possible threat of i against j  in particular  player i has more bargaining
power than j at x if si j  x    sj i  x   however  player j is immune to such threat whenever
xj   v  j    since in this case j can obtain v  j   even by operating alone  we say that
player i outweighs player j at x if si j  x    sj i x  and xj   v  j    the kernel is then the
set of all imputations where no player outweighs another one 
generalizing the kernel to ntu games is based on considering generalizations of the
excess function  as for the nucleolus  again  an influential approach  which is recalled next 
is due to kalai  however  it is worthwhile noticing here that other approaches have also been
proposed in the literature  see  e g   orshan   zarzuelo        peleg   sudholter        
indeed  differently from the solution concepts discussed so far  variations of the kernel  and
   

fimixed integer constrained coalitional games

related concepts  such as the prekernel  which is the focus of the extensions cited above  to
ntu games are still subject of research and debate  cf  serrano        
let g   hn  v i be an ntu game  we say that a payoff vector t  rn is a transfer from
player j to player i if tj     ti     and tk      for each player k  n    i  j   the transfer
t is justified at an imputation x  if for every real number             the vector y   x   t
 such that yk   xk   tk   for each k  n   is an individually rational vector in v  n   and
 x   t    x of course  an excess function for g satisfying kalais axiomatization must
be used in order to define the excess vectors  the kernel k  g  of g is the set  k  g   
 x  x g    there is no justified transfer from player j to player i at x  i  j  n  i    j  
    shapley value
the shapley value is a solution concept introduced in the tu framework by shapley        
this concept associates with every tu game g   hn  vi a unique payoff vector  g   rn  
where each component  g i   which is called the shapley value of player i  indicates the
worth to be assigned to player i  based upon her ability in cooperation as measured by the
expected marginal contribution of player i to forming coalitions  as formalized below  
let  be a permutation on the set n of players  for any player i  we denote by pi the
set of players preceding i in   the marginal contribution of player i to the coalition pi is
v pi   i    v pi    if permutations are chosen uniformly at random from the set  of all
possible permutations 
p the expected marginal contribution of player i in the game g is the
value  g i    n      v pi   i    v pi   or  equivalently 
 g i  

x

sn   i 

 s    n     s      
 v s   i    v s    
 n   

the shapley value is the unique payoff vector satisfying the following properties  which
constitute its axiomatic characterization   
p
    efficiency 
in  g i   v n   

    symmetry  two players i and j are symmetric if  for each s  n with i  j 
  s 
v s   i     v s   j    if players i and players j are symmetric  then  g i    g j  
    dummy  a player i is dummy if  for each s  n    i   v s   i    v s    v  i    if
player i is a dummy player  then  g i   v  i   
    additivity  let g    hn  wi be a tu game  and g    hn  v   wi be the tu game such
that  v w  s    v s  w s  for each coalition s  n   then   g   i    g i   g   i  

note that the shapley value might not satisfy the individual rationality  and thus it is
not necessarily an imputation  payoff distributions that are efficient  but not necessarily
individually rational  are called pre imputations in the literature 
generalizing the shapley value to the ntu framework is not straightforward  different
extensions of the shapley value for ntu games have been proposed  each of them  when
   the characterization reported here is the one that can be found most often in the literature  however 
the original axiomatic formulation of shapley requires the carrier axiom instead of the efficiency and
dummy axioms  the two axiomatizations are equivalent  shapley        winter

evaluated on the ntu version of a tu game  coincides with the standard shapley value for
tu games  here we discuss the generalization proposed by shapley        himself in the
formulation reported by mclean         and we refer the interested reader to this latter
work for an extended treatment of the subject of values for ntu games  and to the paper
by hart        for a comparison between the most notable three of them 
let g   hn  v i be an ntu game  for a vector   rn of strictly positive real numbers 
let g be the game hn  v i where
 
 
x
v  s    sup
i zi   z  v  s   
is

the tu game g is said to be defined for g if v  s  is finite for each s 
definition      let g   hn  v i be an ntu game  a vector x  rn is a shapley ntu
value payoff for g if there exists a vector   rn of strictly positive real numbers such
that  x  v  n    g is defined for g  and i xi    g  i for each player i  n   the set of
all shapley ntu values for g is denoted by  g  

shapley ntu values fulfill  with some adaptations  the same axioms characterizing
standard tu shapley values  actually  these axioms do not suffice to uniquely characterize
the ntu counterpart  and other axioms have to be issued in order to define unambiguously
the ntu shapley value  an axiomatization for the ntu case was given by aumann        
the interested reader is referred again to the work by mclean         for more on this issue 
    properties of solution concepts for tu games
we conclude by recalling some well known properties of the solution concepts discussed
above  when they are applied over tu games 
proposition      see  e g   osborne   rubinstein         let g   hn  vi be a tu game
such that x g       then 
     n  g       
    n  g   k  g   hence  k  g       
    k  g   b g   hence  b g       
    c  g   b g   and 
    c  g      implies n  g   c  g  
note that there is no relationship between the shapley value and the other solution
concepts  just recall that the shapley value is not necessarily an imputation

assume that a tu game g   hn  vi is given and consider the problem of modeling and
dealing with constraints to be imposed on feasible worth distributions amongst players in g 
   

fimixed integer constrained coalitional games

these constraints might be implied by the very nature of the domain at hand  e g   when the
worth is not arbitrarily divisible   or because they reflect some hard preferences expressed
by the players or by some regulation authorityrecall again example      our approach
to encode application oriented constraints within a classical coalitional tu game setting
is by defining a set of mixed integer linear  in equalities  which have to be satisfied by the
imputations of the game g  this approach is first formalized below  subsequently  we shall
illustrate its modeling capabilities and discuss its relationships with the tu framework 
we start by recalling that a mixed integer linear  in equality is a linear  in equality
where some variables might be constrained to take values from the set z of integers  for a
set lc of mixed integer linear  in equalities  we denote by real  lc  and int lc  the sets of
all the variables in lc defined over r and z  respectively  moreover  we assume that worth
distributions can be constrained by defining inequalities via player and auxiliary variables 
a player variable has the form xi   where i  n is a player in the underlying tu game 
and it is meant to encode the worth that has to be assigned to player i in the outcomes
of the game  the  possibly empty  set of the auxiliary variables in lc is then the set
real  lc   int lc     xi   i  n    auxiliary variables are sometimes useful for the modeling
purposes  as we illustrated in example     
let us now proceed with our formalization  let g   hn  vi be a tu game  and recall
from section   that g can be viewed as the ntu game hn  vv i  let lc be a set of mixedinteger linear  in equalities  define  lc  as the set of all the solutions to lc  moreover  for
a coalition s  n   let  lc  s  denote the projection of  lc  onto the subspace associated
with payoff domains for players in s  that is  a vector y with index set s belongs to  lc  s 
if and only if there is a vector x   lc  such that xi   yi holds  for each i  s 
intuitively  a constrained game on lc is defined by restricting the consequences of an
underlying tu game g to those belonging to the solution space of the set lc of mixed integer
linear  in equalities projected onto the subspace associated with player variablesrecall
that further auxiliary variables may occur in lc  this is formalized below 
definition      mixed integer constrained games   let g   hn  vi be a tu game and
let lc be a set of mixed integer linear  in equalities  then  the  mixed integer  constrained
game g lc is the ntu game hn  vlc i where vlc  s    vv  s    lc  s   that is

    modeling capabilities of constrained games

constraining a tu game g via a set lc of  in equalities that do not involve integer variables
 i e   int lc      is an abstraction of those approaches in the literature that consider
specific sets of  in equalities over real variables  such as aumann   dreze        byford 
      jiang   baras         in particular  this capability might be exploited to 
    state hard preferences on the worth distributions 
as an example  consider a game g   hn  vi over the set of players n                
and where v n         assume that players   and   together require to get at least a

   

figreco  malizia  palopoli    scarcello

half of the worth  then  this requirement can be modeled as 

x    x    
x    x    x    x   r
moreover  by allowing integer variables  completely novel modeling capabilities emerge
in our setting w r t  earlier approaches  indeed  integer variables can be used to isolate
non convex regions  which might be needed to model specific application requirements that
are ntu in their very nature  as exemplified below 
    consider alternative scenarios 
by allowing integer variables  we may model alternative preferences of the players  i e  
we may enforce disjunctions of preferences  for instance  consider a scenario where
either players   and   must get together no more than    or players   and   must get
together no more than    in this case  we have two constraints  i e   x    x     and
x    x      and the goal is to define a set of  in equalities prescribing that at least
one of them is satisfied  to this end  an auxiliary integer variable can be used 

x    x       u  y




 x    x       u      y 
 y 



x  x  x  r

      
yz

where the constant value u is an upper bound on the worth of any coalition  indeed 
in the case where y      the constraint x    x       u is trivially satisfied  because u
is sufficiently large   and thus  we just enforce x   x      symmetrically  if y      the
constraint x    x       u is trivially satisfied  and thus  we just enforce x    x     
of course  with simple manipulations  one may easily specify other kinds of alternatives  e g   the fact that at least  or at most  k given constraints are to be satisfied 

    restrict worth functions over specific domains 
when domains are required to be integer intervals  this is rather obvious  for instance 
assume that x  should take values from the domain                         then  we may
simply consider the following constraints 

    x     
x  x  x  r
      
x   z

in order to model more general scenarios  we can have  as in point     above  mixedinteger linear  in equalities to be defined over auxiliary variables  for instance  assume
that player   wants either to take the whole worth for herself  even when forming
coalitions with other players  or  whenever this is not possible  to get nothing  this
can be modeled by a few constraints  over an additional variable win fact  notice

note that example     basically presents a more realistic case  where several auxiliary
variables are used to restrict money distributions to the available coin set 
now that the basic modeling capabilities of constrained games have been discussed 
in order to illustrate possible applications of the resulting framework  it is convenient to
preliminarily observe two of its properties  which are related to the use of integer variables  
first  it is easy to check that  over constrained games  we may deal with imputation
sets of arbitrary sizes  
proposition      let g   hn  vi be a tu game and let x  x g  be an arbitrary finite
set of imputations  then  there is a finite set of constraints lc such that x g lc     x  
in addition  integer variables might be used to succinctly specify exponentially many
imputations via polynomially many  in equalities 
proposition      there exists a class c    g nlc  n   of constrained games such that each
game g nlc is over n     players  lc consists of    n     inequalities  and  x g lc       n  
we believe that the setting emerging from the above properties is rather appealing
from a knowledge representation perspective  indeed  one may exploit constrained games
to naturally model scenarios where non transferable conditions emerge  by devising very
compact specifications of the desired restrictions on how utilities may be transferred among
coalition members  in fact  various circumstances can be envisaged where the usage of
constrained games is a natural choice  for instance  whenever the worth to be distributed
among the agents comes as a set of indivisible goods  as exemplified below 
example      distributing indivisible goods   a certain region of the country is
famous for hosting several producers of two kinds of goods  named  and   for each
producer i              n   let i and i denote the quantity of  and  pieces produced by i 
respectively  by assembling together one piece  and one piece   a novel kind of indivisible
good can be obtained and  in fact  commercializing the assembled product is a much more
advantageous business than selling  and  separately  therefore  an agreement is found
amongst producers in the area in order to assemble the pieces of  and  that are overall
available  provided that the resulting units of the assembled product are  fairly  distributed
amongst the involved producers  which would like to independently commercialize them 
this scenario can be easily modeled within our framework as follows  first  we associate
with every coalition s              n   the number of pieces of the assembled product that s
can produce  thus  we just define 
x

v s    min 
i  
i

   for the sake of exposition  proofs of the propositions stated in this section are reported in the appendix 

   

figreco  malizia  palopoli    scarcello

then  since the assembled product is indivisible  any possible worth distribution is a
vector of non negative integers  which can immediately be modeled via the following set of
constraints lc    xi     xi  z     i  n   in particular   lc  is not a convex region 
so that earlier modeling perspectives on ntu games  such as those present in the handbook
edited by aumann and hart         do not apply here 

there are cases  however  where the worth might practically be assumed to be divisible 
but specific constraints regulate its actual distribution  notably  even in these cases  integer
variables may play a crucial role as illustrated next 
example      service composition   assume that a service t can be acquired for    
eurosfor the sake of simplicity  we assume that money is divisible  for otherwise worth
distributions might simply be restricted over a discrete domain as in example     or in
example      supplying the service t implies executing m tasks  named t            tm  
assume also that there is a set             n  of agents  each one capable of carrying out
some of those m tasks  and let sij denote the ability of agent i to perform the task tj  sij    
means that agent i is able to perform tj   whereas sij     means that she is not capable to
do so  pthus  a coalition s              n  is capable of supporting the service t in the case
where is sij     for each j              m  
assume  moreover  that in order to complete t   not only all of its tasks must be completed  but agents contributing to t must be able to exchange some partial results returned
by performing required tasks  establishing a communication infrastructure guaranteeing
the needed result transfers to take place has a specific cost for each coalition s  which we
denote by com s         hence  the amount of money that might finally be distributed
amongst players in s is described by the following worth function 

p
i
     com s  if
is sj     j              m 
v s   
 
otherwise 
note that the above scenario defines a classical tu game g   h            n   vi  however 
things may be significantly different if we assume that each agent i has to sustain an internal
cost  say cij   whenever actually performing the task tj   and that  hence  she may decide not
to perform the task at all  if it is not convenient  indeed  in this case  letting ji        
be a variable denoting whether i is actually performing tj   it is p
natural to state that the
i
i
total internal cost for agent i  which is given by the expression m
j   j  cj   should not
exceed what the agent gets from the worth distribution  hence  utilities cannot be freely
distributed and  for a proper modeling of this more realistic scenario  the game has to be
enriched with the following set of constraints 
x

fimixed integer constrained coalitional games

with respect to this formalization  it is worthwhile noting that if  lc  is empty then the
service cannot be provided at all  and indeed x g lc   would be empty in its turn  otherwise 
i e   if  lc       the imputations of g lc correspond to those worth distributions associated
with some legal staffing for the tasks  rather than to all arbitrary possible worth distributions
 as it would be in the plain tu case  
it is worthwhile contrasting the above formulation with an alternative tu one  where
the constraints in lc are directly encoded in the definition of worth function  instead of
using a separate component thereof  as done in the ntu framework we are proposing here 
for instance  one may add to the condition for v s         com s  the requirement
that there exists an element x   lc  such that for each task tj   there is a player i  s
with ji       in x   this way  we can ensure that the payoff      com s  is assigned
to each coalition s which is formed by players that can perform some task conforming
with cost constraints  and that can jointly complete t this refined modeling perspective
is exactly the one underlying the class of linear programming games  see  e g   owen        
however  this approach would not prescribe how the payoff      com s  has to be actually
distributed amongst the players in s  in fact  while focusing on accurately modeling the
worth function  it cannot guarantee that the outcome of the game  according to any chosen
solution concept  fulfils the desired constraints on the distribution of payoffs for the single
players  in other words  using constraints in the definition of the worth function may be
useful in certain cases for more careful modeling purposes  but cannot in general replace
the use of external constraints to actually constrain the allowed worth distributions  
as an important remark  we note here that the structure of the above example may
well be used as a guideline in the formalization of other application scenarios  indeed 
the basic idea is to use mixed integer linear constraints to define solutions for combinatorial problems associated with feasible worth distributions  reflecting  e g   the costs of
such solutions   thus  while we have contextualized the approach to the case of a staffing
problem  very similar encodings can be used to define constrained games suited to deal with
scheduling and planning problems  just to cite a few 
    a closer look at constrained games
we can now resort to the presentation of the framework of constrained games by analyzing the structure of their consequences  and the role played by the individual rationality
requirement in this context  this analysis will provide important bases for our subsequent
treatment of the analytical and the computational properties of ntu solution concepts as
applied on constrained games 
      consequences in constrained games
in order to understand the nature of constrained games  it is convenient to take a closer
look at the structure of the function vlc   in fact  while in principle an ntu game hn  v i
does not impose any requirement on the function associating a set of consequence v  s  with
each coalition s  n   those ntu games that attracted much attention in the literature do
not actually allow arbitrary consequences to be specified  aumann   hart         indeed 
the sets of consequences are usually required to satisfy some additional conditions  which
are  de facto  conceived as to guarantee that nice properties hold over the solution concepts
   

figreco  malizia  palopoli    scarcello

of interest  some of the assumptions that have been most often considered in the literature
 not necessarily required to simultaneously hold  are recalled next  for each s  n   v  s 
might be required to be 
     upper  bounded  there is a real number a  r such that for each x  v  s   and for
each i  s  xi  a holds 
    closed  v  s  contains its own boundaries 
    compact  v  s  is both closed and bounded 
    comprehensive  if x  v  s   y  rn and  i  s  yi  xi    then y  v  s  
    convex  for each pair x  y  v  s   and for each real number t      t      the vector
    t x   ty belongs to v  s  
    non empty   v  s       
in the case of constrained games  we do not explicitly ask for the above requirements
to be satisfied  thereby giving rise to a setting with very powerful modeling capabilities  as
we discussed in section       the differences between constrained games and classical ntu
games are illustrated next 
consider the function vlc associated with a constrained game g lc   the first difference
concerns property      because vlc  s  is not required to be bounded  as for the tu case 
where individual payoffs for players in s are not bounded in general  since the only requirement is that their sum does not exceed the worth v s  associated with ssee equation    
in section     actually  this is not a substantial difference given that  in any possible worth
distribution for g lc corresponding to any solution concept illustrated in section    the
payoff of each player is bounded 
similarly  it is easy to see that there might be cases where property     does not hold
in the context of constrained games  indeed  vlc  s  might be not closed whenever lc
contains some strict inequality that excludes the boundary of vlc  s   however  it is known
that such cases are undesirable for some solution concepts  and hence we shall consider
constraints based on non strict inequalities only  property     is the combination of the
first two properties  and thus the above lines of reasoning still apply 
the differences in the remaining three properties  instead  do characterize the framework
of constrained games and are at the basis of its modeling capabilities  in fact  the ability to
handle sets of consequences that are not comprehensive and convex  and that are possibly
empty for some coalition  is an important peculiarity of constrained games from a knowledge
representation perspective  indeed  we may lose comprehensiveness each time a constraint
on the payoff distribution is given which states that some players are required to get at least
a certain worth  we may lose convexity  as well as comprehensiveness  each time integrality
constraints are involved  moreover  we may deal with an empty set of consequences for
some coalition s whenever there is no feasible way to distribute the worth associated with
s according to the constraints that players in s must satisfy 
example      consider the tu game g   hn  vi such that n              v                
and v s      for each s             consider a scenario where the worth in g is restricted
   

fimixed integer constrained coalitional games

to be an integer value  i e   payoff distributions are taken from z           and where players
  and   require to get at least    these constraints can be modeled as follows 

x    x    
lc  
x    x    x   z
note that  lc                x  z          x    x        lc             x  z       
x   x        lc            z         lc            z         lc         z       lc        
z      and  lc         z      then  the constrained game g lc   hn  vlc i is such that 
vlc              
 
vlc         
 
vlc         
 
 
vlc         
vlc   i  
 

 x  r          x    x    x        lc              
 x  z          x    x    x      x    x      
 x  r        x    x        lc             
 x  r        x    x        lc             x  z        x    x      
 x  r        x    x        lc             x  z        x    x      
 x  r i    xi       lc   i      x  z i    xi       i            

despite the very simple constraints considered for g  it is immediate to check that  e g  
vlc  n   is not comprehensive and not convex  and that vlc          is empty  indeed  the
integrality constraints immediately lead to loose comprehensiveness and convexity  moreover  the fact that players   and   require to get at least   implies that the coalition       
will never form to deviate from the grand coalition  given that these two players cannot
guarantee themselves any worth when acting without player    indeed  v               
      individual rationality in constrained games
a further important issue to be pointed out for constrained games is related to the individual
rationality requirement over the set of imputations  let g   hn  v i be an ntu game  and
recall from section   that any imputation x  x g  must be such that for each player
i  n   xi  max  yi   yi  v   i     
consider a constrained game g lc where g   hn  vv i is the underlying tu game  by
definition      the set vlc   i   coincides with vv   i     lc   i    then  because of the individual rationality requirement  for each player i  xi  max  yi   yi  vv   i   lc   i     
note that a special case occurs when vlc   i     vv   i     lc   i       in this case 
indeed  max  yi   yi  vlc   i     is not defined  as a real value   an approach might be
therefore to observe that the game is over constrained  and then stop the analysis  this
approach is  in fact  consistent with several ntu formalizations requiring that the set of
consequences is non empty  for each possible coalition  see section        
however  in example     we have already pointed out that empty sets of consequences
may naturally emerge from constrained games  because vlc  s     reflects the fact that
coalition s cannot form to deviate from the grand coalition  for there is no worth distribution
that can be in principle granted to its members alone  according to the underlying tu
game   and that satisfies the constraints at hand  consequently  a finer grained perspective
should be considered to deal with the individual rationality requirement  in this special case
where vlc   i       for some player i  n  
the basic observation is that vlc   i      necessarily implies that xi   v  i   holds  for
each imputation x  vlc  n    thus  in these extreme scenarios  the individual rationality
   

figreco  malizia  palopoli    scarcello

constraint is conceptually satisfied  though formally undefined  for each possible imputation
x  since constraints in lc require xi to be larger than v  i    technically  we stress here that
the same conclusion is implied by defining max       which is the standard extension
of max over empty sets 
in the light of the above perspective  we can show that individual rationality is preserved when constraints are added to a given tu game 
proposition      let g   hn  vi be a tu game and let x be a payoff vector that is
individually rational w r t  g  i e   xi  v  i    for each player i  n    then  for each set
lc of constraints  x is individually rational w r t  the constrained game g lc  

   solution concepts for constrained games
constrained coalitional games are special cases of ntu games  and therefore they inherit
from them the various solution concepts we have discussed in section    thus  for a constrained  and  as such  ntu  game g lc   it is of interest to compute the core  the bargaining
set  the nucleolus  the kernel  and the shapley value  in this section  we will study the properties of these concepts  by highlighting similarities and differences featured by constrained
games as opposed to tu games 
in a nutshell  we will show that the properties of tu games stated in proposition    
still hold over constrained games for all solution concepts  but for the bargaining set that
might be empty in some games  moreover  the portion of the core of a tu game g that
satisfies all the constraints is preserved  in the sense that it is a subset of the core of
the constrained game g lc built on top of g  on the other hand  for the other solutions
concepts  the preservation property holds in special cases only 
before illustrating our results  it is useful to state a property relating the imputation
set of a constrained game with the imputation set of the underlying tu game 
proposition      let g lc be a constrained game where g   hn  vi 
 lc  n    x g lc   

then  x g  

proof  let x be a payoff vector in x g    lc  n    since x  x g  then x  vv  n   
we are also assuming that x   lc  n   and hence we have that x  vlc  n  recall  by
definition      that vlc  n     vv  n     lc  n    being x  x g   x is also efficient w r t 
g  meaning that for each y  vv  n    there is a player i  n with xi  yi   moreover  since
vlc  n    vv  n    x is also efficient w r t  g lc   finally  by proposition      we know that x
is individually rational w r t  g lc   thus  x  x g lc   
based on the above result  to show that an imputation x  x g  also belongs to x g lc   
in the following we shall just show that x satisfies the constraints in lc  thereby avoiding
to explicitly reason on the efficiency and the individual rationality of x 
    relationships among solution concepts
we start our analysis by investigating whether the properties of the basic solution concepts
 as they appear from proposition      are preserved in the setting of constrained games 

   

fimixed integer constrained coalitional games

      counterparts of proposition         and proposition        
let us begin by focusing on the first two properties in proposition      which pertain to the
nucleolus  in the tu framework  the nucleolus always consists of exactly one imputation 
in the constrained framework  the properties of this solution concept are intimately related
to the closeness of  lc   and  in turn  of x g lc     i e   to whether  lc  contains its
own boundaries  recall from section   that  lc  might not be closed only due to the
occurrence of some strict inequalities in lc 
proposition      there exists a constrained game g lc  with int lc      such that
x g lc       and where n  g lc       for the excess function ek in equation     on
page      
proof  consider the game g over players         where v             and v        v       
   given the constraint lc    x         x   r   one may note that x g lc        indeed 
observe that max x    x   vlc          max x    x   vlc             since vlc   i    
vv   i     lc   i      xi  r i    xi       lc   i      xi  r i    xi      for
each i          thus  a payoff vector x  x g lc   is just required to satisfy x     and
x      in order to be individually rational  in particular  we claim that x g lc      x 
r        x    x       x         x      x       indeed  any vector x  vlc  n      x  rn  
x    x      x         such that x       and x       is not efficient  given that there is a
vector y  vlc  n   such that x    y       and x    y         with y    y       moreover 
any vector x  vlc  n   such that x         x         and x    x      is also not efficient 
given the existence of a vector y  vlc  n   such that x    y    x     x   x       and
x    y    x     x   x    with  therefore  y    y      
consider now an imputation x with x    x      and x        and hence x         
then  we can always build an imputation y    x such that y    x          x        x  and
y       y    x    just notice here that y       holds  for this new imputation  it is the case
that  y    x  holds w r t  the excess function ek in equation      indeed  by recalling
that vlc   i      xi  r i    xi     and that xi    and yi    hold  for each i          we
have  x        x    x    and  y        y    y     thus  there is no imputation x that
belongs to n  g lc    i e   n  g lc       note that  lc  is not closed 
in practical applications of linear programming  one may deal with non strict inequalities
only  see  e g   papadimitriou   steiglitz         in these cases  i e   whenever x g lc   is
closed and hence compact  since it is always bounded   the nucleolus is not empty  this
property was observed to hold by kalai        along with the relationship of the nucleolus
with the kernel  these properties can be restated in our context as follows 
proposition      cf  kalai         let g lc be a constrained game with x g lc       
then 
    if x g lc   is compact  then  n  g lc       
    n  g lc    k  g lc    hence  k  g lc       whenever x g lc   is compact  
in the following  examples and counterexamples will be built avoiding the use of strict
inequalities

      counterparts of propositions               and    
let us now move to analyze the counterpart of proposition          to this end  we first
notice that  unlike in the tu case  the bargaining set can sometimes be empty 
proposition      there exists a constrained game g lc  with int lc      such that
x g lc       and b g lc      
proof  consider the tu game g over players               whose worths are as follows 
v                    v              v                 v                 v           and v s     
for any other coalition s                consider moreover the following set of constraints 

x    x    x    x     




x
     x    x     
x    x     
lc  


x   x     


  
x    x    x    x   r

let x be the payoff vector with x      and x    x    x       observe that x satisfies
the constraints in lc  moreover  x is an imputation of x g   thus  by proposition      x
belongs to x g lc    in fact  x is the only vector in  lc  and  therefore  it is the only
imputation in x g lc    thus  to prove that b g lc       we have just to show that x is
not contained in b g lc    to this end  consider the objection  y          of player   against
player    where y       and y         note that y    y    v              y      and y      
and thus y is        feasible  moreover  recall that v        v           v              it
follows that counterobjections of   against   to  y          may be only constructed over
the coalition            assume that  z             is one such a counterobjection  for player
   which belongs to the intersection of the two coalitions        and            z   y     
holds  because of the constraint z    z    z       this entails z    z       however  this
is impossible since we should have also z   x      and z   x       thus  there are
no possible counterobjections to the objection  y          to x  it follows that x does not
belong to b g lc   and  hence  b g lc       even though x g lc       
as a consequence  we derive that the counterpart of proposition         does not hold
over constrained games  indeed  we may just consider the game g lc defined in the proof
of proposition     and observe that  since x g lc        by proposition      we know that
k  g lc       
corollary      there is a constrained game g lc  with int lc      such that b g lc     
while k  g lc        and thus k  g lc     b g lc    
below we complete the picture pertaining to the bargaining set  by showing that the
core is always included in it  this provides the counterpart of proposition         
proposition      let g lc be a constrained game  then  c  g lc    b g lc   
proof  consider an imputation x  c  g lc   and assume by contradiction that x 
  b g lc   
by this  there must exist an objection  y  s  to x  therefore  it must be the case that y is an
s feasible payoff vector in g lc and yk   xk   for each k  s  this implies that x 
  c  g lc   
a contradiction  thus  x  b g lc

we finally stress that the counterpart of proposition         is already known from the
work by kalai         and can be restated in the settings of constrained games as follows 
proposition      cf  kalai         let g lc be a constrained game  then  c  g lc      
implies n  g lc    c  g lc   
    preservation of solution concepts
we continue our investigation by turning to the problem of assessing whether an outcome
that is stable  under some solution concept  in a tu game remains stable when constraints
are issued  a crucial issue here is to what extent the imputation set is affected by the
constraints imposed over the game  this issue is illustrated next 
example      consider the tu game g   hn  vi where n           v              and
v        v           it is immediate to check that x g     x  r        x    x       x  
   x       the solution concepts for g are as follows  see figure   for an illustration  
core  for any imputation x  x g  and for each coalition s          it is the case that
x s   v s   thus  c  g    x g  
bargaining set  since c  g   b g   recall proposition      and since b g   x g   we
immediately have that b g    c  g    x g  
nucleolus  let x  x g  be an imputation  considering the standard excess function
for tu games  we have that either  x        x    x    or  x        x    x    
depending on whether x   x  or x    x    indeed  just recall that v          
x             and v        v           thus  the lexicographically minimum excess
vector is obtained at the imputation x such that x    x       i e   n  g     x  
kernel  since n  g   k  g   recall proposition       we have that x  k  g   consider
now an imputation x  x g  such that x    x  assume that x       the same line
of reasoning applies to the case where x        and thus x       for the standard
excess function on tu games  s     x    x  and s     x    x  are the surpluses at x 
   

figreco  malizia  palopoli    scarcello

because v        v           then  s      s    holds  and in order to have x  k  g  
it should be x    v           which is not the case  because x       it follows that
k  g     x  
shapley value  note that the two players of g are symmetric and hence their shapley
value must be the same  thus   g           
now  consider the constraints lc    x   x      x    x   r   then  it is easily checked that
x g lc      x  r        x    x       x      x       and hence x g   x g lc       by
applying the same line of reasoning as above  and by considering kalais excess function in
equation     for the nucleolus and the kernel   we derive that c  g lc     b g lc     x g lc  
and n  g lc     k  g lc      y   where y    y        see  again  figure    
moreover  as for the shapley ntu values of g lc   note that only vectors            
with              are such that g lc  is definedfor
every vector
p g lc   in fact  for  
            with        the value v lc   n     sup
in i zi   z  v  n   is infinite 
indeed  in pre imputations players are not necessarily individually rational  and hence in
this game one player may get an unbounded negative value  as long as the other one gets
an unbounded positive value such that their sum is    now  for every          the worth
function of the tu game g lc  is v lc          v lc             and v lc   n       since
the two players are symmetric  the shapley values of this family of games are of the form
 g lc                 therefore  no consequence x  v  lc  n   different from             admits a
vector              with         such that i xi    g lc   i for both players   and    we
conclude that the singleton  y  is also the set of all shapley ntu values of g lc  
thus  all the solutions concepts for the constrained game g lc are completely unrelated
to those of g 

note that  in the above example  the fact that no solution concept is preserved is not
by chance  indeed  recall that core  bargaining set  nucleolus  and kernel are defined as
refinements of the set of all possible imputations  therefore  in the extreme scenario where
x g   x g lc      holds  for a constrained game g lc built on top of the tu game g  
none of these solution concepts can be preserved 
fact      let g lc be a constrained game such that x g   x g lc       then 
    c  g   c  g lc      
    b g   b g lc      
    n  g   n  g lc       and 
    k  g   k  g lc      
moreover  recall that shapely ntu values are refinements of the set of all possible payoff
distributions associated with the grand coalition  and  in particular  of the pre imputations
for tu games   thus  if  g    vlc  n    as in example       this solution concept cannot
be preserved  in general  since  g  is a pre imputation  the following holds 
fact       let g lc be a constrained game  with g   hn  vi  assume that vlc  n     x 
vv  n     x is efficient       then   g     g lc   
   

fimixed integer constrained coalitional games

in the light of the above observations  it is however of interest to analyze whether
preservation properties hold with respect to  pre imputations of both g and g lc  
as an example  it is of interest to establish the relationship between payoff vectors in
c  g  x g lc    i e   vectors that are in the core of the tu gameand thus are imputations
for this gameand that are also imputations for the constrained game  and payoff vectors
in c  g lc    x g   i e   vectors that are in the core of the constrained gameand thus are
imputations for this gameand that are also imputations for the tu game   exploring
these relationships  for each solution concept  is addressed in the rest of this section 
      core
our first result concerns the core  and shows that imputations that are in the core of the
tu game and satisfy the constraints are also in the core of the resulting constrained game 
proposition       let g lc be a constrained game  then  c  g   x g lc    c  g lc   
x g  
proof  let g   hn  vi be a tu game  and recall from section   that g can be equivalently
viewed as the ntu game hn  vv i  assume that x is a payoff vector in c  g   and hence in
x g   then  there is no coalition s  n and no vector y  vv  s  such that yi   xi   i  s 
by definition      for the ntu game g lc   hn  vlc i  it is the case that vlc  s   vv  s  
for each s  n   therefore  there is no coalition s  n and no vector y  vlc  s  such that
yi   xi   i  s  that is  if x  x g lc    then x belongs to c  g lc   
however  the above inclusion can be strict in some cases  even if no imputation is affected
by the constraints  i e   even if x g    x g lc   
proposition       there exists a constrained game g lc  with int lc      such that
x g    x g lc    c  g     and c  g lc        thus  c  g   x g lc    c  g lc    x g  
proof  consider the tu game g   hn  vi such that n              v           v          
v           v              v              v              and v                 notice that
x g     x  with x       x       and x       and that c  g      in particular  for
the latter equality  consider the pair  y          such that y    y         since y          
v          y    x  and y    x    we have that  y          is an objection to x  which therefore
does not belong to c  g  
consider now the following set of constraints 

x    x    
lc  
x    x   r
it is easily seen that x satisfies lc  thus  x  x g lc   holds by proposition      moreover 
since  lc   i     r i  holds for each player i  n   because there is no constraint on
worths of singleton coalitions  the individual rationality constraint on g lc prescribes that
for each x  x g lc    x   v           x   v           and x   v           since
v                 x is in fact the only imputation in x g lc    thus  x g    x g lc   
to conclude the proof  let us now observe that  in the constrained game g lc   there is
no        feasible vector z with z    x  and z    x    indeed  just observe that z    z    
holds because of the constraints  while x    x       that is  there is no objection to x 
which is therefore an imputation in c  g lc

      bargaining set
as far as the bargaining set is concerned  we can show that there are constrained games
whose bargaining set is completely unrelated with that of the underlying tu games  this
is because objections and counterobjections are not necessarily restricted to the set of
the possible imputations  thus  constraints may radically alter the feasibility properties
of certain payoff vectors  yet without affecting the imputation set  this is shown in the
following two propositions 
proposition       there exists a constrained game g lc  with int lc      such that
x g    x g lc    and b g   x g lc     b g lc    x g  
proof  consider the tu game g   hn  vi such that n                    v                      
v                 v                 v              v           and v s      for each other
coalition s  n   consider the imputation x such that x       x       x       x       and
x       we claim that x  b g   indeed  let  y  s  be an objection to x  this objection can
be carried out through three different coalitions  each of them having a counterobjection 
 first  we can have s              y    x       y    x       y    x       and y    y   
y   v                 in this case  y  s  is an objection against player   or against
player    in the former case   z       with z    x      is a trivial counterobjection to
 y  s   in the latter case   z       with z    x      is a counterobjection to  y  s  
 second  we can have s              y    x       y    x       y    x       and
y    y    y   v                 in this case   y  s  is an objection of some player in s
against player   or against player    as we observed above   z       with z    x     
is a trivial counterobjection to any objection against    thus  let us assume that
 y  s  is an objection against player    if  y  s  is an objection of player   or   
we may just consider the pair  z          with z    y  and z    x    indeed  note
that y      holds and  thus  z    z        x        v          therefore  z is
       feasible  and  z          is a counterobjection to  y  s   on the other hand  if
 y  s  is an objection of player   against player   to x  we may consider the pair
 w             such that w    x    w    y    and w    y    note that y    y      and 
thus  w    w    w    x                v             then  w is           feasible  and
 w             is a counterobjection to  y  s  
 finally  we can have s           y    x       y    x       and y   y   v             
in this case   y  s  is an objection of some player in s against       or    let us consider
the first two cases  since  z       with z    x      is a trivial counterobjection to
objections against    if  y  s  is an objection of player    against player   or     we
may consider the pair  z             such that z    y    z    x    and z    x    note that
y      and  thus  z   z   z      x   x          v                 hence   z            
is a counterobjection to  y  s   if  y  s  is an objection of player    against player   or
    we may consider the pair  w             such that w    y    w    x    and w    x   
note that y      and  thus  w    w    w        x    x            v                
hence   w             is a counterobjection to  y  s

consider now the following set of constraints 

x    x    x

it is immediate to check that x g    x g lc    indeed  the individual rationality over

logically implied for all individually rational vectors in vlc  n    however  lc plays a crucial
role concerning the formation of the coalition            indeed  consider the objection

 z  t   to  y          must be such that t              thus  z   y         z   x       and

proposition       there exists a constrained game g lc  with int lc      such that

 observe that y           v          player   cannot counterobject either as a singleton 
since v        x    or through coalition         since for each vector z  r      such that

consider now the following set of constraints

it is immediate to check that x g    x g lc    moreover  let us notice that no player has
a justified objection against player   or   to x  since they can counterobject as singletons 
indeed  just observe that v  i         xi   for i          consider  then  an objection
 y          of player   against player    such that y   x      and y   x       since  y must
belong to vlc           we have that y     holds  thus  the pair  z          with z       y 
and z    x      is a counterobjection to  y           because z               v          by
the symmetry in the game definition  the same line of reasoning as above applies to show
that also player   has no justified objections against player    therefore  x  b g lc

x       that    x    x      implies x       that    x    x      implies x       and that
   x    x      implies x       by simple algebraic calculations  the above relationships
together with the individual rationality of x  i e   x      x      and x      entail that
x   x      and x   x      must hold  in turn  since x    x    x       the latter two
equations uniquely determine the value of x  in particular  k  g  is the singleton  x  such
that x       x      and x       moreover  since n  g   k  g  and  n  g        see
proposition       we have that n  g    k  g  
consider now the following set of constraints 

x    x    



x    x    
lc  
x   x    


  
x    x    x   r

notice that the above constraints do not modify the imputation set  that is  x g   
x g lc        moreover  observe that v  lc   vv   where v  is the worth function of the game
g    hn  v  i in which v                v             v             v                and v   s     
for all other coalitions s  n   by this  the excess function ek reported in equation     coincides with the canonical tu excess  and the definitions of kernel ntu and nucleolus ntu
coincide with those for tu games  cf  kalai         so the kernel and nucleolus of g lc are
those of g    finally  it is easily checked that k  g    is the singleton  x   such that x      
x      and x       and  thus  k  g      n  g      it follows that k  g   k  g lc      and
n  g   n  g lc      
      shapley value
let us conclude our analysis with the shapley value  below  we show that this solution concept is preserved whenever the set of all pre imputations is not modified by the constraints 
proposition       let g lc be a constrained game  if the sets of pre imputations of g and
g lc coincide  then  g lc       g   

proof  let px g     x  rn   x n     v n    be the set of all pre imputations of the tu
g   hn  vi  in fact  recall that px g  contains all the efficient payoff vectors in vv  n      x 
rn   x n    v n     let px g lc      x  rn   x n    v n  x   lc  n  x is efficient 
be the set of all pre imputations of g lc   since px g    px g lc    it must be the case that
 lc  n    vv  n      x  rn   x n    v n     therefore  vlc  n     vv  n     lc  n    
vv  n    for each coalition s and vector y  rs   consider now the vector x  rn with
xi   yi   for each i  s  and xi    v n    y s    n   s   for each i   n   s   note that
x n     v n   and  hence  x  vv  n   and x   lc  n    therefore  y belongs to  lc  s  
thus   lc  s    rs and  hence  vlc  s    vv  s    lc  s    vv  s   for each s  n  
finally  since vlc  n     vv  n   also holds  and thus vlc  s    vv  s   for each s  n    it
follows that  g lc       g    see  e g   mclean        
   

fimixed integer constrained coalitional games

however  the shapley value  g  is not preserved in general  even if  g  is an imputation  and if imputation sets are not affected by the constraints 
proposition       there exists a constrained game g lc  with int lc      such that
 g   x g   x g    x g lc    and  g  
   g lc   
proof  consider the tu game g   hn  vi such that n              v                
v              v              v              and v s       for each other coalition s  n   by
simple calculations  one may compute the shapley value  g   and notice that  g         
 g          and  g          thus   g   x g  
consider now the following set of constraints 

x    x    
lc  
x    x   r
and notice that they do not modify the imputation set  that is  x g    x g lc       
indeed  the inequality x    x     is logically implied by the worth of the grand coalition
 which forces x    x    x      and by the individual rationality of all players  i e   x     
x      and x       for the sake of completeness  note that the constrained game g
does not fit the hypothesis of proposition      since px g     px g lc    indeed  any payoff
vector x with x    x      and x n    v n       is a pre imputation for g but not for g lc  
because x    x     is not satisfied  
moreover  observe that v  lc   vv   where v  is the worth function of the game g   
hn  v  i in which v                v             v             v                and v   s      for all
other coalitions s  n   this suffices to conclude that  g lc       g      see  e g   mclean 
       however  it is easily checked that  g    is such that  g        g        g         
thus   g  
   g lc   

   complexity analysis
in this section  we shall look at the core and the bargaining set for  constrained  coalitional
games from a computational viewpoint  in particular  our aim is to shed light on the impact
of issuing constraints w r t  the intrinsic complexity of these notions  and to assess whether
any price has to be paid for the increased expressiveness of constrained gamesfor the sake
of completeness  background notions on complexity theory are reported in the appendix 
we argue that it is in fact sensible to analyze these computational properties  as this
corresponds to analyzing the feasibility of using such concepts under the thesis of bounded
rationality  that is  that decisions taken by realistic agents cannot involve unbounded resources to support reasoning  simon         moreover  it is worthwhile noting that studying
such matters might hopefully guide the design of effective computation algorithms 
we leave as future work a complexity analysis of the other solution concepts  where
it would be interesting to consider various kinds of kalais excess functions with different
computational properties 
    setup and problems analyzed
in the analysis that follows  we assume games to be provided in characteristic function form 
i e   we deal with scenarios where coalition worths are returned by some given function  von
   

figreco  malizia  palopoli    scarcello

neumann   morgenstern         for instance  the games discussed in example     and
in example     are in characteristic function form  moreover  by following the general
framework proposed by bilbao         we assume that the input for any reasoning problem
consists of a constrained game g lc where the worth function v is given as an oracle  in
particular  we shall consider two types of oracles 
    oracles computable in polynomial time in the size   g lc    of the game representation 
  for instance  the game in example     fits this framework  as well as the game in
example      provided that the cost function com s   of establishing a communication
infrastructure over the agents in s  comes as an oracle computable in polynomial time 
    oracles computable in non deterministic polynomial time in the size   g lc    of the
game representation  for instance  the game in example     may fit this setting
in the cautious perspective where we require that  for any coalition s  the value
v s         com s  can actually be obtained in some imputation  that is  if we
add the condition that there is an element x   lc  such that for each task tj  
there is a player i  s with ji       in x   i e   that the task t can actually be
performed by coalition s while conforming with all the costs constraints  here  we
also require of course that com s  is computable in non deterministic polynomial
time  note that such powerful worth functions can be used to encode np complete
problems reflecting results of complex algorithmic procedures  such as those arising
in allocation  scheduling and routing scenarios  to name a few 
let us remark that the framework where the worth function is an oracle computable in
polynomial time encompasses all those settings where games are  implicitly  described over
some kind of compact structures  and where simple calculations on such encodings are to
be performed to compute the worth of any given coalitionnoticeable and very influential
settings of this type are the graph and hypergraph games  deng   papadimitriou        
the marginal contribution nets  ieong   shoham         the games in multi issue domains
 conitzer   sandholm         and the weighted voting games  elkind   pasechnik       
elkind  goldberg  goldberg    wooldridge         therefore  our membership results will
immediately carry over to the various classes of games cited above  whereas hardness results
are specific to the oracle setting  and do not hold in general for these  sub settings 
within the setting discussed above  we shall next focus on checking whether a given
imputation satisfies the conditions needed to be in the core or in the bargaining set  thus 
given a constrained game g lc and a vector x  the following problems will be considered 
 core check  is x in c  g lc   
 bargainingset check  is x in b g lc   
in addition  recall from section   that the core and the bargaining set might be empty
for constrained games  thus  it is sensible as well to study the following problems 
   as usual  it is implicitly assumed that the game representation includes the list of players  so that 
for every coalition s    s      g lc     otherwise  one should more formally say  e g   that oracles are
computable in polynomial time in the combined size of g lc and s

figure    complexity results for constrained games  hardness results hold even on cohesive games with worth functions given as polynomial time oracles  membership
results hold on non deterministic polynomial time worth function oracles  without any assumption on the representation of real numbers 

 core nonemptiness  is c  g lc       
 bargainingset nonemptiness  is b g lc       
overview of the results  a summary of our results is reported in figure    note there
that four settings emerge from our analysis  tu games  constrained games without integer
variables  i e   int lc       constrained games without auxiliary integer variables  i e  
int lc    xi   i  n     and arbitrary constrained games  in fact  we stress that hardness
results are established without the use of auxiliary real variables  while membership results
 for constrained games  hold even if variables of this kind actually occur  thus  auxiliary
real variables play no computational role in the setting of constrained games 
concerning the checking problems  figure   evidences that core check is co nphard for tu games  and in co np for constrained games where auxiliary integer variables
are not allowedas said above  there is no bound in the membership result on the number
of considered auxiliary real variables  by allowing the use of auxiliary integer variables 
core check becomes dp  hard  and in fact complete for this class  thus  auxiliary integer
variables cause a slight increase of complexity for this solution concept  on the other hand 
it emerged that the occurrence of real variableseither player variables or auxiliary ones
and of integer player variables is completely immaterial from a computational perspective 
as far as the bargainingset check is concerned  we can deliver the good news that
adding constraints does not alter the complexity w r t  the tu case  indeed  this problem
p
is p
   hard for tu games  and it is in   whichever constraints are considered 
concerning the non emptiness problems  we show instead that constraints may radically
alter the computational properties  indeed  corenonemptiness raises one level up
in the polynomial hierarchy  from co np in absence of constraints  malizia  palopoli   
scarcello        to p
    while bargainingset nonemptiness is trivial on tu games
 since this concept is always non empty there   but it becomes p
   complete on constrained
games  interestingly  in both cases  auxiliary and integer variables do not play any role 
indeed  hardness results are established for the basic case where int lc      and without
auxiliary variables   while membership results hold for arbitrary constraints 
in the following  all hardness results will be shown to hold in the simplest case of
 deterministic  polynomial time worth function oracles  moreover  membership results will
not assume any a priori bound on the representation size of real numbers  to this end  some

non trivial technical matters will be faced next  to show that algorithms can safely work
with as few as polynomially many bits  for any solution concept considered in this paper 
    hardness results  on cohesive games with polynomial time oracles 
in this section  we shall establish our hardness results  in particular  in order to highlight
the intrinsic difficulty associated with the solution concepts  constructions are reported
over kinds of worth functions that are simple not only from a computational viewpoint 
in that they are given via oracles computable in polynomial time  but also from an algebraic
viewpoint  as they induce cohesive games 
we recall here that a  tu  game is cohesive
if its worth function v is such that  for each
p
partition s of the players in n   v n    ss v s  holds  osborne   rubinstein       a
condition often imposed in order to guarantee that the grand coalition actually forms  note
that earlier proofs of complexity results on compactly specified games  see  e g   deng  
papadimitriou        greco  malizia  palopoli    scarcello      b  ieong   shoham       
do generally exploit constructions over games that are not cohesive and  hence  they do not
entail the hardness results stated in this paper  in fact  our results interestingly show that
cohesivity does not simplify reasoning with solution concepts for coalitional games 
in order to establish hardness results  we exploit a number of reductions that refer to
boolean formulae  let  be a boolean formula  and let vars      w            wn   be the set
of boolean variables occurring in   recall that a literal is either a boolean variable wi or
its negation wi   the former is called a positive literal  while the latter is called a negative
literal  we denote by vars      wi   wi  vars    the set of negative literals for the
variables occurring in   literals are associated with game players in most proofs  for a
set of players s  define  s  to be the truth assignment where wi  vars   is true if wi
occurs in s  and false  otherwise  the fact that  s  satisfies  is denoted by  s      
moreover  we say that a coalition s  vars  vars   is consistent w r t  a set of variables
y  vars   if  for each wi  y     wi   wi    s      holds  in the case where y   vars   
we simply say that s is consistent 
we start by demonstrating hardness results for the various membership checking problems  the first result is the co np hardness of core check  which is established on the
basis of rather standard arguments reported below just for the sake of completeness  in
particular  the reader may find it useful to check that the reduction exploited in the proof is
based on games that are cohesive  which makes it different from earlier complexity results
given in the literature for specific kinds of compactly specified games 
theorem      core check is co np hard  even for cohesive tu games with polynomialtime oracles and if the input vector is an imputation 
proof  recall that deciding whether a boolean formula  over the variables x            xn
is not satisfiable  i e   deciding whether there exists no truth assignment to the variables
making  true  is a co np complete problem  johnson        
given such a formula   we build in polynomial time the tu game g     hn  vi  where
n   vars     w  e  and where  for each set of players s  v is such that 

   if s   n 
v s   
  if e 
  s  w  s   s       and

  otherwise 
   

fimixed integer constrained coalitional games

consider  now  the vector x where xe     and xp     for each other player p  and note
that x is an imputation  we claim that  x  c  g    if and only if  is not satisfiable 
   x  c  g    implies that there is no coalition s and s feasible payoff vector y with
yi   xi   for each i  s  consider any coalition assignment s such that e 
  s and
w  s  and observe that x s       since x  c  g     we must have v s       which
entails that  s  does not satisfy   by definition of the worth function  given that
there is a one to one correspondence between coalitions s  with e 
  s and w  s 
and truth assignments for   we conclude that  is not satisfiable 
   if x 
  c  g     there must exist a coalition s  n such that x s    v s   which
is only possible if x s      and v s       by construction of the worth function  it
follows that s  n   e 
  s  w  s and  s       that is   is satisfiable 
finally  observe that the role of player w is to guarantee that the game is cohesive 
indeed  for any partition s of n   there is at most one set s  s that contains w  and hence
that may get   as its coalition worth 
when considering constrained games and arbitrary input vectors  i e   not necessarily
imputations   core check turns out to be slightly more difficult than in the previous
case  in fact  we stress here that the use of auxiliary integer variables is crucial in order to
establish the result illustrated next 
theorem      core check is dp  hard  even for cohesive constrained games with polynomial time oracles 
proof  given a pair of boolean formulae        deciding whether  is not satisfiable and 
is satisfiable is a prototypical dp  complete problem  johnson         assume  w l o g   that
   c       cm   with ci   ti   ti   ti     for each i              m   that is   is in conjunctive
normal form and every clause contains exactly three literals  moreover  let vars     
 y            y   and vars      x            xn    and assume w l o g  that vars    vars       
consider the tu game g     hn  vi built in the proof of theorem      and recall that
n   vars     w  e  and that the vector x  where xe     and xp      for each player
p  n with p    e  belongs to c  g    if and only if  is not satisfiable 
consider then the following set of constraints 

   tyj     j               



 ti        ti        ti         i              m 
lc  
x  r  p  n


 p
tyj  z  j               

where  ti h   denotes the expression    tti h if ti h is a negative literal  and the expression
tti h if ti h is a positive literal  note that players in n are actually not constrained in lc 
therefore  if  lc      then  lc  n      trivially holds  since  lc  n   is the restriction
of an empty set over rn    otherwise  i e   if  lc       then  lc  n     rn and therefore
these constraints are immaterial  of course  if  lc      then there is no imputation
of g   lc   otherwise  all the solution concepts for g   are preserved in g   lc   since
constraints do not play any role in this case 
   

figreco  malizia  palopoli    scarcello

observe now that  for each j                 tyj is constrained over the domain       
as to encode the truth value of the boolean variable yj   clearly  lc can be computed in
polynomial time from   and it is immediate to check that  lc      if and only if  is
satisfiable  it follows that the vector x is in the core of g   lc if and only if x belongs to
the core of g    i e    is not satisfiable  and  lc       i e    is satisfiable  
we now turn to the study of the bargaining set  notice that for the class of graph games
 which is an instance of the more general framework we are considering here  completeness
for bargainingset check in p
  has recently been established by greco et al       b  
clearly enough  this result already implies that bargainingset check is p
   hard on
tu games with polynomial time oracles  below  we show that this hardness result still
holds on games with polynomial time oracles which are moreover cohesive 
theorem      bargainingset check is p
   hard  even for cohesive tu games with
polynomial time oracles and if the input vector is an imputation 
proof  we show a polynomial time reduction from the problem of deciding whether a quantified boolean formula h   y            yn z            zq  is valid  which is a well known p
 complete problem  johnson         let y    y            yn   and z    z            zq   denote the
sets of universally and existentially quantified variables  respectively 
based on h  we build a game g h    hn  vi  where n   vars    vars     a  a  
and where  for each set of players s  v is such that 

  if s   n 



  if  s    n and s is consistent w r t   y            yn   
v s   
  if s is consistent    a  a    s       and  s      



  otherwise 
let x be the imputation with xa   xa     and xp      for each other player p 
the construction of g h  and x is defined as to guarantee two basic properties  which are
intuitively illustrated next 

    recall that an objection  y  s  of player i against player j to x is such that i  s 
j
  s  y s   v s  and yk   xk   for each k  s  since v s    x s  must hold for any
objection  y  s   it is the case that objections are one to one associated with truth
assignments for the variables in y  indeed  this is to have v s       and x s       
let  y   s  be the truth assignment associated with coalition s 
    recall that a counterobjection  z  t   to an objection  y  s  of player i against player j
to x is such that i 
  t   j  t   z t    v t    zk  yk   for each k  t  s  and zk  xk  
for each k  t   s  if  y  s  is an objection against a player j 
   a  a    then  z   j  
with zj     is a trivial counterobjection  on the other hand  counterobjections  z  t  
to objections  y  s  against a or a are necessarily such that t s     because z t   
  and xa   xa      in particular  z t       must hold  thus  these counterobjections
are one to one associated with all the possible satisfying truth assignments for the
variables in h  which are moreover obtained as extensions of the assignment  y   s  

   

fimixed integer constrained coalitional games

by definition      x is in the bargaining set of g h  if and only if for each objection
 i e   assignment  y   s  to the variables in y   there is a counterobjection  i e   satisfying
assignment obtained by extending  y   s    therefore  the following claim holds  whose
formal proof is reported in the appendix 
claim a  x  b g h   if and only if h is valid 
to conclude the proof  note that the game is cohesive  indeed  for each coalition s
where v s       it is the case that  s   y            yn   y            yn      n  thus  given any three
coalitions s    s  and s  with v s      v s      v s         it must be the case that two
of them overlap over some players  therefore  any partition s of n contains at most two
coalitions getting a worth greater than    and the result follows since v n       
in the remainder of the section we prove our hardness results for non emptiness problems 
we start by showing that adding constraints to the game causes the complexity of the nonemptiness problem for the core to raise one level up in the polynomial hierarchyfrom
co np in absence of constraints  malizia et al         to p
    note that in the proof
below  integer and auxiliary variables do not play any role 
theorem      core nonemptiness is p
   hard  even for cohesive constrained games
with polynomial time oracles  and where integer and auxiliary variables are not allowed 
proof  deciding whether a quantified boolean formula f   x            xn y            yq  is
valid is a well known p
   complete problem  johnson        
based on f   we build in polynomial time the game g f     hn  vi  where n   vars  
vars     a  and where  for each set of players s  v is such that 

    n if s   n 
v s   
n
if s is consistent and  s       

 
otherwise 

in addition  we build in polynomial time a set lc that  for each    i  n  contains the
following constraints 

xxi   xxi    




x xi   



xxi   
lc  
xa      n





 x  r
x

 xi xi
xa  r
first  note that lc forces xxi   xxi      and forces xa to take value    n  thus  since
v n        n  any imputation x for the constrained game g f   lc does not distribute any
worth to the players associated with the variables in  y            yq    an imputation x is then
associated with an assignment  x  to the variables in  x            xn   such that xi is true
in  x  if and only if xxi    note that we are associating   with false  here 
to understand the salient features of the reduction  recall now that an objection  y  s 
to an imputation x is such that y  vlc  s  and yk   xk for all k  s  since y s    x s 
holds  we have only to take care of coalitions s  n such that s is consistent and  s  is
not a satisfying truth assignment  recall that vlc  s     x  rs   x s   v s     lc  s

thus  for any such objection  y  s  with xi  s  resp   xi  s   we have yxi     resp  
yxi      therefore  s cannot include players in  x    x         xn   xn   getting a worth   in
x  it follows that the set of all possible objections  y  s  to any imputation x corresponds to
a superset of all truth assignments  s  which are not satisfying and which are extensions
of  x   this correspondence allows us to establish the following result  whose formal proof
is deferred to the appendix  
claim b  c  g f   lc       if and only if f is valid 
to conclude the proof  we notice that g f   lc is cohesive  indeed  each coalition s with
v s    n must be consistent  and thus  s   vars    vars       n   q  therefore  given
any three coalitions s    s  and s  with v s      v s      v s      n  it must be the case
that two of them overlap over some players  it follows that any partition s of n contains
at most two coalitions getting worth n 
the non emptiness problems for the bargaining set is trivial over tu games  since this
concept is always non empty there  this is no longer the case over constrained games  where
this problem turns out to be quite difficult  as in the proof of theorem      integer and
auxiliary variables play no role in the result shown below 
theorem      bargainingset nonemptiness is p
   hard even for cohesive constrained
games with polynomial time oracles and where integer and auxiliary variables are not allowed 
proof  deciding the validity of the formula p   x            xm y            yn z            zq  is a
well known p
   complete problem  johnson        
based on p   we build in polynomial time a game g p     hn  vi  where n   vars   
vars     a  w  and where  for each set of players s  v is such that 


 m     if s   n


 
if w  s   s    n    




s is consistent w r t   y            yn   

v s   
 
if s    xi   xi    for some i


 
if a  s  s    a  is consistent 





 s       and


 
otherwise 
we also build in polynomial time a set lc that  for each    i  m  contains the following
constraints 

xxi   xxi    




x xi   



xxi   
 xa    




 xxi   xxi  r

xa  r

first  we observe that  because of the above constraints and of the fact that v n    
m    in any imputation of this game all players yj      j  n  and all players zr      r  q 
get payoff    moreover  any imputation x for which there is an index i     i  m  such
that xxi     and xxi     cannot belong to the bargaining set of g p   lc   for the objection
   

fimixed integer constrained coalitional games

 
 y   w  y         yn    against player a such that yyj   n  
is justified  indeed  if  z  t   were
a counterobjection with a  t   we would have za  xa      indeed  xa     is prescribed
by lc   moreover  because of the definition of the worth function  t would be such that
t    a  is consistent  i e   for each i         m    t   xi   xi         assume that xi  t
 the same line of reasoning applies if xi  t    then  zxi  xxi     must hold and we
would have z t        which is impossible since v t      and since v t    z t   holds for
any counterobjection  thus  the set of imputations x that might possibly belong to the
bargaining set are restricted to those where variables xxi and xxi take distinct values from
the set         as a result  we can associate any such imputation x of the constrained game
g p   lc with an assignment  x  to the variables in  x            xm   such that xi is true in
 x  if and only if xxi      note that we are associating   with true here 
in fact  in order to show the correctness of the reduction  we may basically follow the
spirit of the proof of theorem      for any imputation x  with the properties illustrated
above   the set of the possible objections  y  s  corresponds to the set of all possible truth
assignments  y   s  for the variables in y    y         yn    objections that might be
possibly justified are then restricted to those against player a  for which counterobjections
correspond to satisfying assignments extending  x  and  y   s   thus  the following can
be shown  whose detailed proof is reported in the appendix 

claim c  b g p   lc       if and only if p is valid 
finally  note that the game is cohesive  indeed  consider any partition s of the players
in n   and a coalition s  s where v s       in the case where a  s and s is consistent
w r t  vars    then there cannot exist any other coalition s   s with v s        and
with s     xi   xi   for some i  in addition  there can exist at most one further coalition
s   sp
with v s         for  s      n      w  s    and s  is consistent w r t   y            yn    
thus  ss v s      similarly 
p if there is no coalition s  s such that a  s and s is
consistent w r t  vars    then ss v s   m      indeed  s might contain the coalitions
 x    x              xm   xm    plus at most one coalition that is consistent w r t   y            yn  
and which gets worth    in particular  s cannot contain two coalitions s  and s  consistent
w r t   y            yn   and with v s      v s         as w should be contained in both 
    membership results
we now complete the picture of the complexity arising in the context of constrained games
by proving membership results that  together with the proofs in the previous section  provide
the completeness results reported in figure    in particular  we shall consider the case where
the worth function v is an oracle that can be computed in deterministic polynomial time
in the size   g lc    of the constrained game  while deferring a discussion about how these
results can be extended to the case where v is an oracle computable in non deterministic
polynomial time to section       
we start our analysis by stating the complexity of checking whether a vector is an
imputation 
lemma      deciding whether a vector is an imputation is in dp for constrained games 
in particular  the problem is in co np for constrained games without auxiliary integer
variables  and in p for constrained games without integer variables

proof  let g   hn  vi be a tu game and let lc be a set of constraints  let x be a vector
assigning a payoff value to each player in n   recall that x is an imputation in x g lc  
if      x  vlc  n      x  rn   x n    v n      lc  n        x is efficient  and     x is
individually rational 
    checking whether x n    v n   is feasible in polynomial time  moreover  checking
whether x   lc  n   is feasible in np  indeed  we can consider the set of linear
inequalities lc derived from lc by replacing all player variables by their values according to x  note that lc is a mixed integer linear program defined over the variables
 if any  in real  lc   int lc     xi   i  n    and that x   lc  n   if and only if lc
is satisfiable  by well known results on mixed integer linear programming  see  e g  
nemhauser   wolsey         lc admits a solution if and only if it admits a solution
that can be represented with polynomially many bits  in the size of lc    thus  the
problem can be solved by first guessing in np a vector x assigning a value to each
variable in real  lc   int lc     xi   i  n    and by subsequently checking whether x
satisfies all the constraints in lc  which is feasible in polynomial time   of course  if
int lc    xi   i  n    then lc is a linear program without integer variables  in this
special case  the satisfiability of lc can be checked in p  see  e g   papadimitriou  
steiglitz        
    recall that x is efficient if for each x  vlc  n    there is a player i  n such that
xi  xi   consider the set of linear inequalities lc derived from lc by adding the
 n       inequalities  x n    v n    and xi   xi for each i  n   then  x is efficient if
and only if lc is not satisfiable  this latter task is feasible in co np  since lc is a
mixed integer linear program whose satisfiability can be checked in npsee      in
the special case where int lc      lc does not contain integer variables and  hence 
its  un satisfiability can be checked in polynomial time 
    recall that x is individually rational if for each player i  n   xi  max  xi   xi 
vlc   i      consider the set of linear inequalities lc
i derived from lc by adding the
two inequalities xi  v  i   and xi   xi   the individual rationality holds if and only
if lc
i is not satisfiable  for each i  n   as in the point     above  this task is feasible
in co np in general  and in polynomial time whenever int lc     
we can now conclude that deciding whether x is an imputation is the conjunction of
problem      which is feasible in np  and of problems     and      which are feasible in
co np  thus  the problem is in dp  
in the case where int lc    xi   i  n   holds      is feasible in polynomial time and 
hence  deciding whether x is an imputation is in co np 
finally  if int lc      problems           and     are feasible in polynomial time 
let us now consider the membership of core check  this proof is routine and is
reported for the sake of completeness only 
theorem      core check is in dp   in particular  it is in co np for constrained
games without auxiliary integer variables 

   

fimixed integer constrained coalitional games

proof  let x be the input vector for the game g lc   where g   hn  vi  we have to check
that x satisfies the conditions of the core and that x is indeed an imputation 
concerning the former task  recall that the complementary problem of deciding whether
x is not in the core amounts to finding a coalition s and a vector x  vlc  s  such that
xi   xi   i  s  consider the set of linear inequalities lcs derived from lc by adding the
 s      inequalities x s   v s   and xi   xi i  s  then  x is not in the core if there is
a coalition s such that lcs is satisfiable  this task can be therefore solved by guessing in
np a coalition s together with a vector x assigning a value to each variable in lcs   and
by subsequently checking that x does indeed satisfy all the constraints in lcs   it follows
that deciding whether x satisfies the conditions of the core is feasible in co np 
concerning the task of checking whether x is an imputation  we use the results in
lemma      thus  for general games  core check can be solved by the conjunction of a
problem in co np and a problem in dp   of course  this is again a problem feasible in dp  
moreover  if int lc    xi   i  n   holds  then core check is feasible in co np 
deriving the membership result for bargainingset check on constrained games requires a more sophisticated line of reasoning  we start by recalling that  for tu games  it
is has been shown that bargainingset check is in p
   greco et al       b   in fact 
this result has been established by exploiting a characterization for the bargaining set that
does not hold in the presence of constraints  below  by exploiting a completely different
proof technique  we shall show that  surprisingly  the presence of the constraints does not
alter the computational properties of this problem 
for the following proofs  we recall that given a set lc of linear  in equalities over n
real variables  the set  lc  is a polyhedron in rn   whose faces are given by the halfspaces
associated with the  in equalities in lc  and whose vertices are given by the intersection of n
inequalities from lc  and hence can be represented with polynomially many bits in the size
of lc  see  e g   papadimitriou   steiglitz        nemhauser   wolsey         a bounded
polyhedron is called a polytope  moreover  we use the following notation  let s  n be a
set of players and let ys be the set of variables  yk   k  s   we denote by lcys the copy
of the system of mixed integer linear inequalities lc where every player variable xi   with
i  s  is renamed as yi   and every other variable v in lc is renamed as vys  
lemma      let g   hn  vi be a tu game  lc be a set of constraints  and x be an
imputation for g lc that does not belong to b g lc    then  there exists a justified objection
to x that is representable with polynomially many bits 
  s 
proof  since x 
  b g lc    there are two players i and j  a coalition s with i  s and j 
and an s feasible vector y such that  y  s  is a justified objection of i against j to x  let
lci j s be the system consisting of the  in equalities in lcys plus the  s      inequalities 
y s   v s  and yk   xk   k  s  then  the set  lci j s   ys   consists of all the s feasible
vectors y such that  y  s  is an objection of i against j to x 
let us now consider possible candidate counterobjections  for any t  n with j  t
and i 
  t   let lci j s t be the system including the  in equalities in lcys and in lczt   plus
the inequalities y s   v s   yk   xk   k  s  z t    v t    zk  yk   k  t  s  and
zk  xk   k  t   s  note that  lci j s t   ys   contains all vectors y over the index set s
such that there exists a counterobjection through t   and hence of the form  z  t    to the
   

figreco  malizia  palopoli    scarcello

figure    illustration of claim d  with coalitions t    t    and t   
objection  y  s  of i against j to x  it follows that the set of all vectors y such that  y  s 
is a justified objection of i against j to x is the set 
 
 lci j s   ys    
 lci j s t   ys   
t  it
  jt

to conclude the proof we claim the following 
s
i j s t   y   contains a point  i e   a justified obclaim d   lci j s   ys     t  it
s
  jt  lc
jection to x  that can be represented with polynomially many bits 
to prove the claim  let us consider the following geometrical arguments  consider first
the case where lci j s and lci j s t  for each t   i 
  t  j st   contain no integer variables 
i j s t   y    the
and let p be a maximal convex subset of  lci j s   ys     t  it
s
  jt  lc
s
vertices of p   which are points of r   are given by the intersection of at most  s   independent  halfspaces that are facets of  lci j s   ys   or of some  lci j s t   ys    and thus
they can be represented with polynomially many bits  in fact  p might not contain its own
boundaries  thus  if some of its vertices actually belongs to p   then the result straightforwardly holds  on the other hand  if p is a possibly open segment with endpoints y a and y b
 representable with polynomially many bits   then the middle point ym necessarily belongs
to p  since p is convex  and can be represented with polynomially many bits  finally  if
the polytope p has more than two vertices  as shown in figure     then it must have at
least three vertices y a   y b   and y c that do not belong to the same face of p   therefore 
the barycenter y of the triangle with vertices y a   y b   and y c belongs to p   and it can be
represented with polynomially many bits  because this is the case for y a   y b   and y c  
   

fimixed integer constrained coalitional games

to conclude the proof  we observe that integer variables in lci j s and lci j s t  for
each t   i 
  t  j  t   can be easily preprocessed  roughlythe technical details are
reported in the appendix  since  lci j s   ys   is a polytope by construction of lci j s and
since  therefore  its vertices can be represented with polynomially many bits  all integer
components of interest  basically those falling within  lci j s   ys    can be represented
with polynomially many bits  as well  thus  to find a point with polynomially many bits
as asked for in claim d  we can iterate over all the possible combinations
of integer values
s
i j s
i j s t   y   by
and  at each step  evaluate the expression  lc
  ys     t  it
s
  jt  lc
replacing all integer values with the combination of values at hand  of course  the resulting
expression does not involve integer variables  all the inequalities in it are still representable
with polynomially many bits  and therefore the above line of reasoning applies 
armed with the above lemma  we can state the complexity of bargainingset check 
theorem      bargainingset check is in p
  
proof  we show that the complementary problem of deciding whether a vector x is not in
the bargaining set of a given constrained game g lc is in p
    we start by checking whether
x is an imputation in dp  cf  lemma     recall that dp is contained in p
    if this is
the case  by lemma     we guess in non deterministic polynomial time a justified objection
to x  that is  a coalition s  two players i  s and j 
  s  and a vector y such that  y  s 
is an objection of i against j to x  consider the system lc of the  in equalities obtained
from lci j s  recall its definition in the proof of lemma      by replacing player variables
associated with the coalition s by the respective values in y  of course   y  s  is an objection
if and only if lc is satisfiable  by well known results on mixed integer linear programming
 see  e g   nemhauser   wolsey         lc admits a solution if and only if it admits a
solution that can be represented with polynomially many bits  therefore  within the same
non deterministic step  we can also guess an assignment  call it w   to all the variables in
lc   and then check in polynomial time that w actually satisfies all the constraints  i e  
that y is actually an objection  
to conclude the algorithm for solving bargainingset check  we now have to check
that there is no counterobjection  z  t   to the objection  y  s  of i against j to x  this task
requires a co np oracle call  in particular  the oracle works by checking the complementary
condition in np  to this end  in a non deterministic step  it first guesses a coalition t with
j  t and i 
  t   consider now the system lc including the  in equalities in lczt   plus
the inequalities z t    v t    zk  yk   k  t  s  and zk  xk   k  t   s  then  there
is a counterobjection  z  t   to  y  s  for some vector z if and only if lc is satisfiable  as
in the case above  a solution to lc is guaranteed to exist which can be represented with
polynomially many bits  so that this solution  call it w   can be guessed within the same
non deterministic step by the oracle  in fact  to check that w actually satisfies lc is
trivially feasible in polynomial time 
we now turn to analyze non emptiness problems  we start with the non emptiness
of the core  which is a co np complete problem for tu games  malizia et al         
constraints do play a role here  since we have shown that core nonemptiness is p
 hard  cf  theorem       below  we confirm that this is the exact complexity of this problem 

   

figreco  malizia  palopoli    scarcello

theorem       core nonemptiness is in p
  
proof  let us again adopt the notation used in the proof of lemma      let s  n be a
coalition  and lcs be the set of mixed integer linear  in equalities including the  in equalities
in lcxn and lcys   plus the inequalities y s   v s  and yi   xi   for each i  s  we get 
 
c  g lc     x g lc    
 lcs   xn   
sn

let lcx be the set of the  in equalities in lcxn plus the inequality x n    v n    moreover 
for each player i  let lci be the set of the  in equalities lcxn and lcy   plus the inequalities
 i 

x n    v n   and xi   yi  v  i    then  the set  lci   xn   consists of all the vectors
that are not individually rational  w r t  player i   thus 

c  g lc    

x

 lc   xn

 lc   xn

 lcs   xn   

sn

in particular  note that the efficiency condition on imputations is guaranteed  indeed 
the points that are not efficient are removed  because they belong to the set  lcn   xn   
which is considered above for s   n  
by applying the same line of reasoning as in claim d  in lemma      on the above
expressions  we have that  if c  g lc   is not empty  then it contains an imputation that is
representable with polynomially many bits  thus  we can decide the non emptiness of the
core by first guessing in np a vector x  then  we may call a dp oracle  corresponding
to the invocation of an np and a co np oracle  to check that x is an imputation  cf 
lemma       and finally we can verify that x is in the core with a further call to a co np
oracle  in particular  this latter oracle works by checking the complementary condition in
np  i e   it checks whether x is not in the core  to this end  the oracle guesses in a nondeterministic step a coalition s  consider now the system lc formed by the  in equalities
in lcys plus the  s      inequalities  y s   v s  and yk   xk   k  s  then  there is an
objection  y  s  to x for some vector y if and only if lc is satisfiable  again  lc admits a
solution if and only if it admits a solution that can be represented with polynomially many
bits  therefore  within the same non deterministic step  we can also guess an assignment
 call it w   to all the variables in lc   and then check in polynomial time that w actually
satisfies all the constraints 
now  we can complete our picture with the bargaining set 
theorem       bargainingset nonemptiness is in p
  
proof  consider again the setting in the proof of lemma      let i and j be two players
in n   for any coalition s with i  s and j   s  let lci j s be the system consisting of the
 in equalities in lcxn and in lcys plus the  s      inequalities  y s   v s  and yk   xk  
k  s  moreover  for each pair of sets of players s and t with i  s   t and j  t   s 
let lci j s t be the system of mixed integer inequalities including the inequalities of the
systems lcxn   lcys   and lczt   plus the inequalities y s   v s   yk   xk for each k  s 
   

fimixed integer constrained coalitional games

z t    v t    zk  yk for each k  t  s  and zk  xk for each k  t   s  that is  we
proceed in the same way as in the proof of lemma      but here the components of vector
x are variables of this linear program  while in the previous lemma they were fixed values 
observe now that  lci j s t   xn  ys   contains all pairs hx  yi such that there exists a
counterobjection  z  t   to the objection  y  s  of i against j to x  and that  lci j s   xn ys  
consists of all pairs hx  yi such that y is an s feasible vector with i  s and j   s such that
 y  s  is an objection to x  then  the set
 
 i  j  s     lci j s   xn  ys    
 lci j s t   xn  ys  
t  it
  jt

is the set of all pairs hx  yi such that  y  s  is a justified objection of i against j to x 
therefore 
 
b g lc     x g lc    
 i  j  s  xn   
sn isj s
 

where  by considering efficiency and individual rationality  see the notation in the proof of
theorem        we have
  
 lci   xn   
x g lc      lcx   xn      lcn   xn    
in

by slightly adapting the proof of claim d  in lemma       one may show that if the
bargaining set is not empty  there exists a vector x  b g lc   which can be represented
with polynomially many bits  therefore  bargainingset nonemptiness can be solved
by first guessing in non deterministic polynomial time such a vector x  then  we may call
a dp oracle to check that x is an imputation  cf  lemma       and finally we can verify
that x is indeed in the bargaining set with a further call to a p
  oracle  in order to solve
bargainingset check on input x  cf  theorem      
      extension to more general worth functions
in all the membership results above  we have assumed that worth functions are polynomial time computable and  within this setting  we have shown that various hardness results
are indeed tight  thus  the reader might be inclined to believe that  by considering more
powerful worth functions  the complexity for these problems may consistently increase  surprisingly  this is not the case  indeed  we can show that nothing has to be paid if more
powerful worth functions that encode np complete problems are considered 
to this end  let vg lc denote the worth function of a game g lc   and define the worthfunction graph for any class c of constrained games as the set of tuples wc    h g lc   s   wi  
g lc  c  vg lc  s    w   recall  e g   from the work by johnson         that such a
function is computable in non deterministic polynomial time if there is an integer k such
that wc is  i  k balanced  i e     w       g lc        s   k   and  ii  k decidable  i e   there
is a non deterministic turing machine that decides whether a given tuple t belongs to wc
in o   t  k   time  more precisely  since vg lc is a partial  standard  single valued function
 multi valued functions are also considered in the literature   the class of functions that we
consider is called npsv  see  e g   selman        
   

figreco  malizia  palopoli    scarcello

the complexity of various solution concepts for tu games within a setting where worth
functions are given as oracles computable in npsv has been analyzed in an extended
version of the work by greco et al       b   there  it emerged that all the membership
results in figure   hold on any class c of games having such worth functions  very roughly 
the basic observation is that if we consider npsv worth functions  any non deterministic
algorithm m that guesses in polynomial time some coalition s for a game g lc  c  can
at the same time  with just a polynomial time delay  guess a worth w and an additional
string c  of polynomial size w r t    g lc        s     which acts as a certificate to decide
whether the tuple h g lc   s   wi belongs to the np set wc   thus  the complexity of any
 non deterministic  algorithm that uses the value vg lc  s  after a guess of the coalition s is
not affected by replacing a polynomial time worth functions with npsv worth functions 
by exploiting this line of reasoning  it is easy to adapt proofs of membership results in order
to deal with such more general worth functions 
theorem       the membership results in figure   hold on any class c of games whose
worth functions are in npsv 

   discussion and conclusion
imposing linear constraints on the outcomes of games is an approach that has been explored
by several authors in the context of non cooperative strategic games  e g   charnes       
semple        ryan         however  in the context of cooperative games this approach
has received considerably less attention and  indeed  no general framework was proposed in
the literature and no analysis of its properties was conducted so far 
in this paper  we have faced the issue by conducting a systematic study of constrained
games within a framework where constraints are defined as mixed integer linear  in equalities imposed over an underlying tu game  seemingly close to the class of constrained
games is the class of linear programming games  see  e g   owen         where the worth
v s  of a coalition s is implicitly given as a linear program  e g   as the maximum of a
given objective function over a feasible region  lc  defined in terms of a set of linear
 in equalities lc   of course  this approach differs from the setting of constrained games
where the role of lc is  instead  to govern the distribution of the worths within an ntu
perspective  moreover  differently from classical ntu formalizations  constrained games
allow to define non convex and non comprehensive sets of worth distributions  which is an
appealing modeling capability that emerged to be useful in several application domains 
finally  the resulting game framework has been analyzed with respect to the preservation
and the computational properties of some relevant solution concepts 
it is worthwhile noticing that the framework we have discussed in this paper shares the
spirit of the recent arguments by shoham         who advocated the use of a broader vocabulary than the fairly terse one characterizing the early foundations of the game theory  also
relevant are those proposals that reconsidered basic concepts of cooperative games in the
light of a modeling perspective that is closer to the requirements of computer science applications  seminal and influential directions of this type give rise  in particular  to coalitional

temporal qualitative coalitional games  agotnes  van der hoek    wooldridge         and
cooperative boolean games  dunne  van der hoek  kraus    wooldridge         in the
light of the above approaches  an interesting avenue of further research may be to consider
more expressive kinds of constraints  formulated for instance via logic based languages  and
where preference criteria can be adopted in place of hard constraints 
other avenues of research are related to some technical questions that were not explored
in the paper  first  our complexity analysis focused on the notions of the core and the
bargaining set  which are founded on the concepts of objections and counterobjections  of
course  it would be interesting to complement our results with the analysis of the kernel  the
nucleolus  and the shapely value  actually  hardness results for the kernel and the nucleolus
of tu  graphical  games have recently been illustrated by greco et al       b   and indeed
they trivially provide lower bounds for the complexity of such solution concepts in the
setting of constrained games  however  providing tighter computational bounds requires
a deeper understanding of the computational aspects underlying kalais axiomatization 
which is outside the scope of this paper  furthermore  for the shapley value  it is of interest
to study other extensions that have been provided in the literature for ntu games and to
assess their behavior when applied to constrained games 
moreover  our hardness results have been shown to hold even by restricting the underlying tu games to use cohesive worth functions only  it might be of interest to study the
complexity when different specific kinds of functions are considered  for instance  monotone 
superadditive  weakly superadditive  or convex ones     similarly  assessing to which extent
considering such specific kinds of worth functions affects the analytical properties studied
in section   is an interesting question which we leave for further research 
finally  from a modeling viewpoint  we recall that the framework proposed in the paper
exploits one set of linear  in equalities to constrain the outcomes of all coalitions  thus  in
the light of adding modeling power to this framework  it might be of interest to study a natural generalization where each coalition is equipped with its specific set of linear  in equalities 
in particular  this setting would call for conceiving suitable mechanisms to compactly represent  exponentially many  different sets of constraints  and for defining formal measures
for the expressivity of such compact representations for constraint based ntu games 
acknowledgments
a coalitional game framework for dealing with linear constraints imposed on tu games
was first illustrated by the authors in an extended abstract published in the proceedings of
the  th international conference on autonomous agents and multiagent systems  greco 
malizia  palopoli    scarcello      a   there  some solution concepts have been defined
and studied  which were based on proposing ad hoc adaptations of solution concepts for
tu games  following the suggestions of the anonymous referees  the constrained game
framework proposed in the present paper fits instead the framework of ntu games  in its
most general form  thus  the solution concepts studied in this paper are just given as
suitable specializations of the standard solution concepts defined for ntu games

appendix a  computational complexity
in this appendix we recall some basic definitions of complexity theory  by referring the
reader to the work by johnson        for more on this topic 
a   the complexity of decision problems  p  np  and co np
decision problems are maps from strings  encoding the input instance over a fixed alphabet 
e g   the binary alphabet         to the set  yes  no   the class p is the set of decision
problems that can be solved by a deterministic turing machine in polynomial time with
respect to the input size  that is  with respect to the length of the string that encodes the
input instance  for a given input x  its size is usually denoted by   x   
throughout the paper  we often refer to computations carried out by non deterministic
turing machines  too  recall that these are turing machines that  at some points of the
computation  may not have one single next action to perform  but a choice between several
possible next actions  a non deterministic turing machine answers a decision problem if
on any given input x   i   there is at least one sequence of choices leading to halt in an
accepting state if x is a yes instance  and  ii   all possible sequences of choices lead to
some rejecting state if x is a no instance 
the class of decision problems that can be solved by non deterministic turing machines
in polynomial time is denoted by np  problems in np enjoy a remarkable property  any
yes instance x has a certificate of its being a yes instance  which has polynomial length
and which can be checked in polynomial time  in the size   x     as an example  the problem
of deciding whether a boolean formula  over the variables x            xn is satisfiable  i e  
deciding whether there exists some truth assignment to the variables making  true  is a
well known problem in np  in fact  any satisfying truth assignment for  is obviously a
certificate that  is a yes instance  i e   that  is satisfiable 
the class of problems whose complementary problems are in np is denoted by co np 
as an example  the problem of deciding whether a boolean formula  is not satisfiable is
in co np  of course  the class p is contained both in np and co np 
the class dp is the class of problems that can be defined as a conjunction of two
problems  one from np and one from co np  respectively  for instance  it is in dp to
decide whether  for a given pair of boolean formulae         is satisfiable and  is not 
a   further complexity classes  the polynomial hierarchy
throughout the paper  we also refer to a particular type of computation called computation
with oracles  intuitively  oracles are subroutines that have unary cost 
p

the classes p
k   k   and k   forming the polynomial hierarchy  are defined as follows

a well known problem at the k th level of the polynomial hierarchy is deciding the
validity of a quantified boolean formula with k quantifier alternations  a quantified boolean

formula  short  qbf  with k quantifier alternations has the form q  x  q  x     qk xk  
where k     xi     i  k  is a set of variables  qi         
sk  i  k   qi    qi

k      this problem coincides with the problem of deciding whether the boolean formula 
is satisfiable  resp   not satisfiable   which is indeed in np  resp   co np  
a   reductions among decision problems
a decision problem a  is polynomially reducible to a decision problem a    denoted by
a  p a    if there is a polynomial time computable function h such that  for every x  h x 
is defined and x is a yes instance of a  if and only if h x  is a yes instance of a    a
decision problem a is complete for the class c of the polynomial hierarchy  beyond p  if a
belongs to c and every problem in c is polynomially reducible to a  thus  problems that
are complete for the class c are the most difficult of the problems in c 
it is worthwhile observing that the problems discussed in this section are known to be
complete for the classes in which the membership has been pointed out  in particular 
deciding the validity of a qbfk   resp   qbfk    formula is the prototypical p

proposition     let g   hn  vi be a tu game and let x  x g  be an arbitrary finite

proof  consider the game g   hn  vi  the set x    x            xk   of imputations of g  and
the set of constraints

it is immediate to check that vlc  n     x   moreover  we observe that each vector
xj  vlc  n       j  k  is efficient  since it cannot be dominated by any other vector in
x  just notice that x is a set of imputations for g   finally  notice that each imputation
x  x is individually rational w r t  g  thus  by proposition      x is individually rational
w r t  the constrained game too  it follows that vlc  n     x g lc   
proposition     there exists a class c    g nlc  n   of constrained games such that each
game g nlc is over n     players  lc consists of    n     inequalities  and  x g lc       n

proposition     let g   hn  vi be a tu game and let x be a payoff vector that is individually rational w r t  g  i e   xi  v  i    for each player i  n    then  for each set lc of
constraints  x is individually rational w r t  the constrained game g lc  
proof  let x be a payoff vector such that xi  v  i    for each player i  n   consider
the constrained game g lc and a player i  n   if vlc   i     vv   i     lc   i      
we trivially have that xi     otherwise  i e   if vlc   i        we can just notice that

appendix c  proofs of claims in section  
claim a  x  b g h   if and only if h is valid 
proof  let us study the structure of a possible objection to x  recall that  y  s  is an
objection of player i against player j to x if and only if  i  s  j 
  s  y s   v s  and
yk   xk   for each k  s  thus  we observe that v s      must hold  in order to improve the
payoffs of its members  and because a worth value equal to   can only be obtained by the
grand coalition  in addition  since xa   xa     and since y s   v s       it must also be
the case that  a  a    s     because these players get   in the current imputation x  due
to the definition of the worth function  this entails that s is consistent over the variables y 
i e   it is a set of n players corresponding to literals over the universally quantified variables 
we thus associate with each possible objection  y  s  to x  where y s     and yk     
k  s  a truth value assignment to the variables in y such that     i  n  yi is assigned
false if yi  s  and true if yi  s   according to our notation  this means that such an
objection is associated with the truth value assignment  y   s   but we can define the
converse  as well  for any truth value assignment y for the universally quantified variables 
its associated objection is the pair  y  s  such that s    yk  y   y  yk     false    yk  
 
yk  y  y  yk     true   and yp    s 
  for each p  s  note that  y  s  is an objection of

any player in s against player a or a to x  and that  y   s    y  
indeed  if  y  s  is an objection against a player j 
   a  a    then  z   j   with zj    
is a trivial counterobjection  since v  j     xj     and j 
  s  it follows that the set of
objections that are possibly justified has to be restricted to those against player a or player
a   next  we consider the case of an objection against a  but exactly the same arguments
hold for objections against a   let  y  s  be an objection of i against player a to x  any
counterobjection  z  t   must now be with a  t  and i 
  t    thus  in order to have
za  xa      it must be the case that v t      and  actually  that v t        due to the
definition of the worth function  in particular  the latter  with the fact that za      entails
that  for each player p    a with p  t   it holds that zp      thus  t  s must be empty 
because all members of s get something according to y  t   a  is consistent  and  t       
in particular  since t  s     according to this satisfying assignment  yi is true in  t  
if and only if yi 
  s  it follows that  t   coincides with  y   s  over the universally
quantified variables  and thus it is in fact an extension of this truth value assignment to
   

fimixed integer constrained coalitional games

the set of all variables occurring in the formula   conversely  note that every satisfying
assignment for  that extends  y   s  corresponds to such a counterobjection to  y  s  
given the above observations  we show the claim  x  b g h    h is valid 
   assume that x  b g h    let y be any truth value assignment for the universally
quantified variables  and let  y  s  be the objection to x associated with y   in
particular   y   s    y   by construction  since x  b g h    there exists a valid
counterobjection  z  t   to  y  s   and we have seen above that its corresponding truthvalue assignment  t   is an extension of  y   s  to the set of all variables vars   
and that  t        it follows that h is valid 
   assume that x 
  b g h    then  there is a justified objection  y  s  against a  or
a   to x  it follows from the discussion above that there is no truth value assignment
that is able to extend the assignment  y   s  to all the variables vars    and to
satisfy   indeed  such an extension would be associated with a counterobjection to
 y  s   it follows that h is not valid 
claim b  c  g f   lc       if and only if f is valid 
proof 
   assume that x  c  g f   lc    i e   that s  n   there is no s feasible payoff vector
such that yi   xi for each i  s  we claim that  x  is a truth assignment to the
variables in  x            xn   witnessing the validity of f   indeed  assume  for the sake
of contradiction  that there is a truth assignment y to the variables in  y            yq  
such that  x   y       consider the coalition s such that s is consistent and
 s     x   y   by definition of the worth function  v s    n  moreover  observe
that x s    n holds  by definition of the assignment  x  and given that xyj     and
xyj      for each imputation x and variable yj     j  q   note  in fact  that if
xi  s then xi is true in  x  and then xxi      and if xi  s then xi is false in
minis   xi  
 x  and then xxi      because in this case xxi     holds   now  let   
n q
and notice that       since xi     is  in particular  prescribed by the definition of
 x   consider the vector y  rs such that yi   xi    for each i  s  note that
y s   n because  s    n   q  moreover  y  vlc  s  holds because v s    n and
because constraints are satisfied at y  just notice that s contains exactly one player
in  xi   xi    for each variable xi   which is associated with a payoff less than or equal
to   in y and that constraints xxi   xxi     do not play any role here because only
one player xi or xi is in s and hence given a variable yxi  resp   yxi   with yxi   
 resp   yxi     always exists a non negative value for yxi  resp   yxi   such that
yxi   yxi       since yi   xi   for each i  s  we then conclude that x 
  c  g f   lc   
which is impossible 
   assume that there is a truth assignment  to the variables in  x            xn   witnessing
the validity of f   and let x be an imputation such that  x  coincides with   where
in particular xxi      resp   xxi      if xi is false  resp   true  in   we claim
that x  c  g f   lc    indeed  assume for the sake of contradiction  that there is a
coalition s and an s feasible payoff vector y such that yi   xi for each i  s  since

v s   y s    x s  and since x s      given the definition of the worth function 
it is actually the case that s is consistent  and  thus   s  is a truth assignment 
and that  s  is not satisfying  in particular  recall that vlc  s     x  rs   x s  
v s     lc  s   thus  for each player xi  s  resp   xi  s   we have yxi     resp  
yxi      therefore  s cannot include any player in  x    x         xn   xn   getting a
worth   in x  it follows that  s  is an extension of  x   which is moreover not
satisfying  thus   x  would not witness the validity of f   which is impossible 
claim c  b g p   lc       if and only if p is valid 
proof  consider any imputation x where xa      and where xxi and xxi take distinct values
from the set         for each variable xi   x         xm    any objection  y  s  to x must be
such that v s       which is indeed the maximum available worth over each coalition s 
n   and there is no player i  s with xi      it follows that objections are necessarily of the
form  y  s  where w  s   s    n    and s is consistent w r t   y            yn    in other words 
any objection  y  s  to x is such that s contains w plus one universal player per universally
quantified variable  and thus it is uniquely associated with a truth value assignment to the
universally quantified variables y    y            yn    let  y   s  denote this assignment 
where we set yj   true if and only if yj 
  s  for any    j  n  we define also the converse 
given any truth value assignment y to the universally quantified variables  its associated
objection is the pair  y  s  such that s    yj   y  yj     false  yj   y  yj     true  w  
 
  for every k  s 
and yk    s 
now  if  y  s  is an objection against a player j 
   a  x            xm   x            xm    then
 z   j   with zj     is a trivial counterobjection  indeed  such a player j does not belong
to s and may be either an element of  y            yn   or an element of  z            zq    in either
cases  v  j     xj      on the other hand  if  y  s  is an objection against a player xi  or 
xi    then  z   xi   xi    with zxi   xxi and zxi   xxi is again a counterobjection  because
v  xi   xi      z  xi   xi        and  xi   xi    s     it follows that the set of objections
that are possibly justified has to be restricted to the objections against player a  let  y  s 
be an objection of i  s against player a to x  any counterobjection  z  t   must have
a  t   thus  in order to have za  xa      it must be the case that v t      and  actually 
that v t        due to the definition of the worth function  in particular  the latter entails
that for each player p    a with p  t   it holds that zp      thus  t  s must be empty
and  in particular  the only possibility is that t    a  is consistent  and  t        finally 
since t  s    and x p      for each p  t with p    a  we have that  t   is a satisfying
assignment for  where  xi is true in  t   if and only if xi is true in  x   yi is true in
 t   if and only if yi 
  s  and thus yi is true in  y   s   that is   t   is a complete
assignment for  that extends both partial assignments  x  and  y   s  
by exploiting the above observations  we can now prove the claim 
   assume that there exists x  b g p   lc    we have seen that such an imputation x
is associated with a truth value assignment  x  to the variables in  x            xm  
recall that an imputation x for which there is an index i     i  m  such that xxi    
and xxi     cannot belong to the bargaining set of g p   lc   moreover  we have seen
that every assignment y to the universally quantified variables corresponds to a

possible objection  y  s  to x  and since x belongs to the bargaining set there must
exist a valid counterobjection  z  t   to  y  s  associated with a satisfying truth value
assignment for  that extends both partial assignments  x  and y   this means
that x is a witness of the validity of p  
   if p is valid then there is an assignment x to the variables in  x            xm   that
witnesses its validity  consider the imputation x such that     i  m  xxi    
and xxi     if x  xi     true  and xxi     and xxi     otherwise  moreover 
xa     and all other players get    since  for every extension of x to the universally
quantified variables  corresponding to a possible objection  y  s  to x   there exists a
further extension to all variables that satisfies   corresponding to a counterobjection
to  y  s    it follows that x  b g p   lc

proof  the case where  lci j s   ys   and  lci j s t   ys    for each t   i 
  t  j  t   do not
contain integer variables has already been addressed in the proof of lemma      we next
show how to preprocess such integer variables  if they occur in the programs at hand 
recall first that  lci j s   ys   is bounded  since lci j s contains the  s      inequalities 
y s   v s  and yk   xk   k  s  this implies that we can assume  w l o g   that  lci j s  
is bounded in its turn  indeed  by standard arguments in linear programming it follows that
any point in  lci j s   ys   can be obtained as the projection of a point in  lci j s   whose
auxiliary components  i e   those not associated with the variables in ys   are bounded by a
polynomial in the size of lci j s   thus  this bound can be made explicit in the definition of
lci j s   without altering the projection  lci j s   ys   
second  we observe that we can also assume  w l o g  that  lci j s t   is bounded too 
for each t such that i 
  t  j  t   indeed  in the definition of lci j s t   we may constrain
each variable in ys to range within the minimum and maximum values it may assume in
 lci j s   ys  note that these extreme values can be represented with polynomially many
bits  since they are achieved s
