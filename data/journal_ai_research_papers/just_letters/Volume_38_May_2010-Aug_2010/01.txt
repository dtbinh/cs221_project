abstract
in this paper  we address the problem of change in an abstract argumentation system 
we focus on a particular change  the addition of a new argument which interacts with
previous arguments  we study the impact of such an addition on the outcome of the argumentation system  more particularly on the set of its extensions  several properties for this
change operation are defined by comparing the new set of extensions to the initial one  these
properties are called structural when the comparisons are based on set cardinality or setinclusion relations  several other properties are proposed where comparisons are based on
the status of some particular arguments  the accepted arguments  these properties refer to
the evolution of this status during the change  e g   monotony and priority to recency 
all these properties may be more or less desirable according to specific applications  they
are studied under two particular semantics  the grounded and preferred semantics 

   introduction
argumentation has become an influential approach to handle artificial intelligence problems
including defeasible reasoning  see e g   pollock        dung        bondarenko  dung 
kowalski    toni        chesnevar  maguitman    loui        prakken   vreeswijk       
amgoud   cayrol        nute         and modeling agents interactions  see e g   amgoud 
maudet    parsons        kakas   moratis         argumentation is basically concerned
with the exchange of interacting arguments  this set of arguments may come either from
a dialogue between several agents but also from the available  and possibly contradictory 
pieces of information at the disposal of one unique agent  usually  the interaction between
arguments takes the form of a conflict  called attack  for example  a logical argument
can be a pair hset of assumptions  conclusioni  where the set of assumptions entails the
conclusion according to some logical inference schema  a conflict occurs  for instance  when
the conclusion of an argument contradicts an assumption of another argument 
the main issue for any argumentation system is the selection of acceptable sets of arguments  called extensions  based on the way arguments interact  intuitively  an acceptable
set of arguments must be in some sense coherent and strong enough  e g   able to defend
itself against all attacking arguments   so  the outcome of an argumentation system is
often defined by the set of its extensions but  depending on the applications  it may be also
defined as the set of arguments that belongs to every extension  it is convenient to explore
the concept of extension through argumentation frameworks  and especially dungs

framework  which abstracts from the arguments nature  and represents interaction under
the form of a binary relation attack on a set of arguments 
recent works have considered the dynamics of such abstract argumentation frameworks
 cayrol  dupin de saint cyr    lagasquie schiex        rotstein  moguillansky  garca   
simari      b  boella  kaci    van der torre      a      b   the problem is to study how
the outcome changes when the set of arguments and or the set of attacks between them
are changed  in this paper  we focus on the case when a new argument and its interactions
are added to an argumentation system  we study the impact of such an addition on the
set of initial extensions  this leads us to identify some properties of the change operation
with respect to the modification it induces on the outcome  this study has two main
applications  the first one concerns computational issues  while the second one concerns the
definition of dialogue strategies  on one hand  the interest for computational processing
is that knowledge about the properties of the change may help to deduce what are the
modifications in the extensions  for instance  it is useful to know conditions under which
change will not modify the previous extensions  on the other hand  knowing the impact of
adding an argument may help choosing the good one in order to achieve a given goal  for
instance  in a multi agent setting  i e   when several agents may present several arguments 
the results presented in this paper will help one agent to determine which arguments she
should present in order that the outcome of the dialogue satisfies desired properties  for
example  if she wants to widen the debate  the argument that must be added should induce
a change producing larger extensions  i e  that contain more arguments  see section   and
section    
the paper is organized as follows  section   recalls the basic concepts in argumentation 
section   settles a definition of change in argumentation  many features can be taken into
account in order to characterize a change operation  we first propose a class of properties
based on the impact of the change on the structure of the resulting set of extensions  see
section       in a second step  we define several other properties regarding the arguments
themselves  particularly those which are accepted after change  see section       these
properties are defined regardless of the semantics 
then  we focus on a particular change  the addition of a new argument which may
interact with previously introduced arguments  section   is dedicated to the study of the
properties of this addition in the case of two particular semantics  the grounded and the
preferred semantics  we give conditions under which a given property is satisfied  section  
discusses the related approaches in the literature  all the proofs  and two important lemmas  are given in appendix a  some additional examples are presented in appendix b for
illustrating the other change operations 
note that this paper generalizes a previous work  cayrol et al          where argument
addition  called revision  was restricted to one argument having only one interaction
with the existing argumentation system  here  the added argument may interact with any
number of previous arguments  moreover  a broader analysis of this generalized addition
is provided by considering new properties such as  e g   monotony  and by establishing new
connections between the different properties

   basic concepts in argumentation frameworks
the present work lies in the frame of the general theory of abstract argumentation frameworks proposed by dung         such an abstract framework assumes that a set of arguments is given  as well as the different conflicts between them  and focuses on the definition
of the status of arguments 
definition    argumentation framework  an argumentation framework ha  ri is a
pair  where a is a non empty set and r is a binary relation on a  called attack relation 
let a  b  a   a  b   r or equivalently arb means that a attacks b  or b is attacked
by a 
in the following  ha  ri is an argumentation framework  and we assume that the set of
arguments a is finite  first  it is easy to extend the concept of attack to sets of arguments 
definition    attack from and to a set  let a  a and s  a  
 s attacks a iff x  s such that xra 
 a attacks s iff x  s such that arx 
the main issue of any argumentation system is the selection of acceptable sets of arguments  intuitively  an acceptable set of arguments must be in some sense coherent and
strong enough  e g   able to defend itself against every attacking argument   an argumentation semantics defines the properties required for a set of arguments to be acceptable  this
is a collective acceptability   the selected sets of arguments under a given semantics are
called extensions of that semantics  the set of extensions characterizes the outcome of an
argumentation system  we recall the basic concepts used for defining usual semantics 
definition    conflict free  defense  let a  a and s  a 
 s is conflict free iff a  b  s such that arb 
 s defends a iff s attacks each argument which attacks a  the set of arguments which
s defends will be denoted by f s   f is called the characteristic function of ha  ri 
the literature proposes an increasing variety of semantics  refining dungs traditional
ones  baroni  giacomin    guida        caminada        dung  mancarella    toni       
coste marquis  devred    marquis         in this paper  only the most well known traditional semantics are considered  the grounded  preferred and stable semantics 
definition    acceptability semantics  let e  a 
 e is admissible iff e is conflict free and defends all its elements  i e  e  f e   
 e is a preferred extension iff e is a maximal  w r t  set inclusion  admissible set 
   in this paper  we use  to denote strict inclusion and  to denote classical inclusion 

  

ficayrol  dupin de saint cyr   lagasquie schiex

 e is the grounded extension iff e is the least fixed point  w r t  set inclusion  of the
characteristic function f 
 e is a stable extension iff e is conflict free and attacks each argument which does not
belong to e 
an argumentation framework can be represented as a directed graph  called attack
graph  where nodes are the arguments and edges represent the attack relation  throughout
the paper  examples are using this graph representation 
example  
a    a  b  c  d  f   and r     a  b    b  a    b  c    c  d    d  f     f  c   
the admissible sets are      a    b  and  b  d  
b
c
d
the preferred extensions are  a  and  b  d  
the
grounded extension is    
a
f
 b  d  is the unique stable extension 
using the graph based representation of an argumentation framework  we extend the
definition of individual attack as follows 
definition    indirect attack and defense  let g denote the attack graph associated
with ha  ri  let a  b  a 
 a indirectly attacks b iff there is an odd length path from a to b in the attack graph
g 
 a indirectly defends b iff there is an even length path  with non zero length  from a
to b in the attack graph g 
note that the case when a attacks b is considered as a particular case of indirect attack 
dung        has proved the following results 
proposition   let ha  ri be an argumentation framework 
   there is at least one preferred extension  always a unique grounded extension  while
there may be zero  one or many stable extensions 
   each admissible set is included in a preferred extension 
   each stable extension is a preferred extension  the converse is false 
   the grounded extension is included in each preferred extension 
   each argument which is not attacked belongs to the grounded extension  hence to each
preferred and to each stable extension  
   if r is finite  the grounded extension can be computed by iteratively applying the
function f from the empty set

the presence of cycles in the attack graph has often raised some problems  namely for the
stable semantics  for which it may happen that no extension exists  note that some authors
only consider attack graphs without odd length cycles  arguing that an odd length cycle
carries counterintuitive information  the following results give properties of the preferred 
grounded and stable extensions depending on the existence of cycles in the attack graph 
proposition    dunne   bench capon              let g denote the attack graph associated with ha  ri 
   if g contains no cycle  ha  ri has a unique preferred extension  which is also the
grounded extension and the unique stable extension 
   if    is the unique preferred extension of ha  ri  g contains an odd length cycle 
   if ha  ri has no stable extension  g contains an odd length cycle 
   if g contains no odd length cycle  preferred and stable extensions coincide 
   if g contains no even length cycle  ha  ri has a unique preferred extension 
now that acceptable sets of arguments have been defined  it is possible to define a status
for an individual argument 
definition    argument status  let ha  ri be an argumentation framework and a 
a  given a semantics s 
 a is skeptically accepted under s iff a belongs to each extension of ha  ri under s 
 a is credulously accepted under s iff a belongs to at least one extension of ha  ri
under s 
 a is rejected under s iff a does not belong to any extension of ha  ri under s 
obviously  credulous and skeptical acceptance coincide under the grounded semantics 

   change in argumentation
we introduce a formal definition of change in argumentation which enables to distinguish
between four types of change  then we define properties for change in argumentation  first 
we consider the impact of a change operation on the structure of the set of extensions  and
we study how this structure is modified  this point of view leads to the definition of
structural properties  then  we consider the impact of a change operation on the set of
arguments which are accepted  finally  the connections between both classes of properties
are studied 
note that for most of the properties that we introduce  the definition is general in the
sense that it can be applied to any type of change  in section    where we give conditions
for satisfying these properties   we will focus on the particular case of the addition of an
argument and its interactions

    definition
in this section  we give a definition of change in argumentation  the change may concern
the set of arguments and or the set of attacks between them  so  at least four cases can be
encountered 
definition    change operations  let ha  ri be an argumentation framework 
 adding only one interaction i  between two existing arguments of a  i     x  y   with
x  a and y  a  is a change operation defined by 
ha  rii i    ha  r   i   i
 removing only one existing interaction i  of ha  ri  i   r  is a change operation
defined by 
ha  rii i    ha  r    i   i
 adding only one argument z   a and a set of interactions concerning z denoted by
iz is a change operation defined by 
a

ha  rii  z  iz     ha   z   r  iz i
here  iz is supposed to be a non empty set of pairs of arguments  either of the form
 x  z  or  z  x  with x  a  
 removing only one argument z  a which interacts with other arguments is a change
operation defined by 
a
ha  rii z   ha    z   r   iz i
here  iz denotes the set of all the interactions concerning z  that is the set   z  x   
 z  x   r     x  z   x  z   r  
note that the case of adding a new argument  resp  removing an existing argument 
which does not interact with any other argument is trivial  it has only to be added to  resp 
removed from  each extension  indeed  change is more interesting when the concerned
argument interacts with previous ones 
in a very recent work about dynamics of argumentation  boella et al       a      b  
the four types of change defined above have been introduced under different names  respectively attack refinement  attack abstraction  argument refinement and argument abstraction  however  only the operations of attack refinement  attack abstraction and argument
abstraction have been studied and in a more restricted context  see section   for a discussion  
in the following  we identify an argumentation framework ha  ri with its associated
attack graph g  we write x  g instead of x is an argument represented by a node of g 
the set of extensions of ha  ri is denoted by e  with e            en denoting the extensions  
   note that  by this definition  it is impossible to have  z  z  in iz  
   note that if z is removed  the set of interactions concerning z must be also removed

a change operation produces a new framework ha   r i represented by a graph g    with
a new set of extensions e  with e            ep denoting the extensions  
as explained above  changing an argumentation framework may modify the set of extensions  given a semantics  the modifications are more or less important  it depends on
the kinds of interactions that are added or removed and more precisely on the status of the
arguments involved in these interactions 
the impact of a change can be studied from two points of view 
 the first one concerns the structure of the set of extensions and it can address either
the comparison of the number of extensions before and after the change  or  if this
number remains unchanged  the comparison of the contents of the extensions before
and after the change 
 the second point of view concerns the status of some particular arguments 
so  in the next sections  we propose two classes of general properties for a change
operation  one for each point of view  the proposed properties characterize the relation
between a particular framework and the resulting framework after a change 
    structural properties
structural properties  presented in this section  are based on the impact of the change on
the structure of the set of extensions  note that for each property  the definition is general
in the sense that the type of change operation is not specified  it can consist in adding
one interaction  removing one interaction  adding an argument and a set of interactions
concerning this argument  or removing one argument  however  for sake of clarity  each
a
property will be illustrated in this section with examples for the change operation i   the
reader will find some examples for the other change operations in appendix b 
let ha  ri be an argumentation framework and e be the set of extensions of ha  ri
 under a given semantics s   various situations may be encountered in the general case 
e may be empty  implying that s is the stable semantics   may be reduced to a singleton
 e     where e  may be empty   or may contain more than one extension  e            en    the
situation with only one non empty extension is convenient for the determination of the
status of an argument  by contrast  when several extensions exist  different choices are
available  table   summarizes the various definitions presented below 
we first consider the decisive property for a change operation  meaning that g  has a
unique non empty extension  while it was not the case for g 
definition    decisive change  the change from g to g  is decisive iff e     or e  
      or e    e            en    n     and e    e     e

a weaker requirement is the decrease of the number of choices  a change such that g 
has strictly less extensions than g  but still has at least two  is called restrictive    note
that the restrictive property does not make sense under the grounded semantics  since there
is always a unique grounded extension 
definition    restrictive change  the change from g to g  is restrictive iff e    e

an opposite point of view enables to consider changes which raise ambiguity  by increasing the number of extensions  this is the case for instance when g has at least one
non empty extension and g  has strictly more extensions than g  a slightly different situation occurs when g has no extension or an empty one  while g  has more than one extension 
in that case  change brings some information  but is not decisive  such changes are called
questioning  as for the restrictive property  the questioning property does not make sense
under the grounded semantics 
definition     questioning change  the change from g to g  is questioning iff e  
 e            ep    with p     and either e     or e    e            en   and p   n

pursuing along the previous line  we consider changes leading to a kind of decisional
dead end  this is the case when g has at least one non empty extension and g  has no
extension  or an empty one    such a change is called destructive 
definition     destructive change  the change from g to g  is destructive iff e  
 e            en    n     ei       and e    or e        
example  
   these are two different cases but they have the same impact  there is no possible decision because no
argument is accepted

so far  the considered changes have an impact on the number of extensions  now  we
are interested in changes which may modify the content of extensions  without modifying
the number of extensions  the most interesting situation occurs when each extension of g 
strictly includes one extension of g  the number of extensions being the same  such changes
are called expansive 
definition     expansive change  the change from g to g  is expansive iff g and g 
have the same number of extensions and each extension of g  strictly includes an extension
of g

in the particular case when the set of extensions remains unchanged  the change is called
conservative 
definition     conservative change  the change from g to g  is conservative iff g and
g  have exactly the same extensions  that is e   e

otherwise  it may happen that g and g  have the same number of extensions but some
extensions  and sometimes all of them  are altered  this is called an altering change 
definition     altering change  the change from g to g  is altering iff g and g  have
the same number of extensions and there exists at least one extension ei of g such that ej
extension of g    ei   ej  
it is the case for instance when each extension of g  has a non empty intersection with
 but does not include  an extension of g

the above discussion can be summarized on table    in this table  it can be checked
that cells with  i correspond to situations which cannot occur 
   and    the only acceptability semantics in which an argumentation framework may
have no extension is the stable semantics  however  with the stable semantics  an
argumentation framework cannot have an empty extension when its set of arguments
is not empty  and  by assumption  the cases    and    correspond to argumentation
frameworks with non empty sets of arguments  because by assumption either iz    
or there exists one interaction i    x  y    so there is at least one x in g and this x
and eventually z belong to g     so these cases do not occur for any change operation
and any acceptability semantics considered in this paper 
note that the structural properties presented on table   are mutually exclusive  that is
a change operation cannot satisfy two of them

table    structural properties of a change operation
    status based properties
in this section  we are interested in the impact of a change operation on the status of some
particular arguments 
 first  we are interested in the status of the arguments which were accepted before
change  this leads to propose a property called monotony  which can be defined
for any type of change 
 another interesting issue concerns the status of the argument which is added in a
a
change  obviously  it concerns only the change operation i   this leads to propose a
property called priority to recency which only makes sense for one type of change 
      monotony
inspired by what has been done in the field of non monotonic inference  we define a property
of monotony for expressing that arguments accepted before change remain accepted after
change  since our aim is to define general properties  we make no assumption about the
number of extensions  and we have to consider different cases for acceptance of an argument
 credulously or skeptically accepted  
a monotony definition is straightforward under a semantics providing only one extension
 such as the grounded semantics  for instance   following definition    an argument a is
accepted  credulously or skeptically  in ha  ri iff it belongs to the  unique  extension of
g  so  in that particular case  monotony means that the extension of g is included in the
extension of g    when there are several extensions  monotony can take different forms  a
credulous form corresponds to the case where each argument credulously accepted from g
  

fichange in argumentation systems

is also credulously accepted from g    a skeptical form corresponds to the case when each
argument skeptically accepted from g is also skeptically accepted from g    so these ideas
lead to the following definition 
definition     monotony 
 the change from g to g  satisfies monotony iff each extension of g is included in at
least one extension of g   
 the change from g to g  satisfies credulous monotony  iff the union of the extensions
of g is included in the union of the extensions of g   
 the change from g to g  satisfies skeptical monotony iff the intersection of the extensions of g is included in the intersection of the extensions of g   
a

for the change operation i   examples                     illustrate the case when the
a
property of monotony holds  and  again for the change operation i   examples          
                                illustrate the case when the property of monotony does not
hold   
obviously  monotony implies credulous monotony  however  monotony does not imply
skeptical monotony  see example       and skeptical monotony does not imply monotony
 see examples                      under a semantics providing only one extension  the three
notions of monotony coincide 
the monotony property is defined at the level of extensions  a similar notion can be
defined at the level of arguments 
definition     partial monotony for an argument  let x be an argument 
the change from g to g  satisfies partial monotony for x iff when x belongs to an extension
of g  it also belongs to at least one extension of g   
it is easy to prove that monotony  resp  credulous monotony  implies partial monotony
for each argument of g  it is not the case with the property of skeptical monotony  see the
argument a in example      
      priority to recency
the next property concerns the status of the argument which is added in a change  inspired by what has been done in the field of belief revision  see alchourron  gardenfors   
makinson         and the postulate concerning the priority of the new piece of information 
we define a property for expressing that the new argument is accepted after change  this
a
property called priority to recency  makes sense only for the change operation i  
   credulous monotony is related to the well known decision problem of credulous acceptance in argumentation  see definition    
   in appendix b  the reader will find some examples illustrating the property of monotony for the other
change operations 
   this property is not a characteristic postulate in agms sense  it has just been inspired by the success
postulate proposed by alchourron et al

the following propositions enumerate results that hold for any type of change

 a conservative change always satisfies monotony and skeptical monotony

   characterizing argument addition under grounded or preferred
semantics
a

in this section  we focus on the change i   i e   the addition of exactly one argument z
that interacts with at least one argument belonging to a  indeed  adding an argument
which may interact with the existing ones is a very frequently encountered type of change
in real life situations  besides  this type of change is sufficiently complex to provide a rich
analysis of properties and results 
a
moreover  we consider the change i under the grounded and the preferred semantics 
we have chosen these two semantics because they are the most well known traditional
semantics for which the existence of extensions is guaranteed 
our purpose is to identify conditions under which a given property is satisfied for a
a
change operation i   these conditions concern the added argument and the associated
interactions  and may depend on the semantics 
arguably  some properties seem more desirable than others according to the context 
for instance  a decisive change operation will reduce ignorance  since after the change one
and only one extension remains  enabling to determine the status of each argument  which
was not always the case before the change   an expansive change will raise the number of
accepted arguments  which is interesting for achieving a goal of persuasion for instance  a
conservative change keeps the extensions unchanged  and so is interesting if we want to add
an argument without changing our state of knowledge  the properties of monotony and
priority to recency are desirable when we focus on some particular arguments  which we
want to get in the resulting extensions 
in constrast  a questioning or destructive operation will increase ignorance  which seems
to be less interesting 
an altering operation enforces to have a new look at the problem  since nothing is
kept from the state before change  the same number of extension remains but they are all
different from the previous ones   according to this discussion  we provide 
 sufficient conditions  cs  under which some interesting properties hold  e g   decisive 
expansive  conservative  monotonic  satisfying priority to recency  
 necessary conditions  cn  for some undesirable properties  e g   questioning  destructive  altering   in order to avoid those properties 
in the following subsections  we consider the change
ment z and the interactions iz   such that

   discussion and future works
in this paper  we study change in argumentation  we propose properties to characterize
the impact of a change operation on the outcome of an argumentation framework  then 
we focus on a particular type of change  the addition of a new argument that may interact
with previously introduced arguments     and we establish conditions under which a given
property is satisfied 
the study of change is an important issue in artificial intelligence  but it traditionally
concerns belief change  when an agent receives a new piece of information  she must
adapt her beliefs  this adaptation is not always easy because it may imply to drop some
previous knowledge  the seminal work of alchourron  gardenfors and makinson  agm 
       has settled a formal framework for reasoning about belief change and introduced
    we do not consider knowledge from which arguments and interactions could be built

the concept of belief revision together with two other types of belief change  namely
contraction and expansion  expansion consists only in adding information without
checking its consistency with previous beliefs  contraction is an operation designed for
removing information  revision consists in adding information while preserving consistency 
this last operation is the most interesting one since  in belief theory  inconsistency leads to
unexploitable information 
although the change operations defined in section   could be thought of as being related
to the agm theory     the comparison is not appropriate because of two main reasons 
 the basic underlying formalism is different  in standard belief revision  logical formulae are used for knowledge representation whereas  in this paper  an argumentation
framework represents the current knowledge  in the first case  the outcome is a new
set of logical formulae  whereas  in the second case  the outcome is a new argumentation framework which induces a new set of extensions  each extension being a set of
arguments 
 revision is a task in knowledge representation which is strongly related to concepts
such as inference and consistency  the postulates for standard belief revision  agm 
are built on the consistency notion  since revision aims at incorporating a new piece
    note that other important cognitive tasks linked to belief change theory have already been studied in
the field of argumentation  see for instance the work on merging of coste marquis  devred  konieczny 
lagasquie schiex  and marquis        

  

ficayrol  dupin de saint cyr   lagasquie schiex

of information while preserving consistency  however  in the framework of argumentation  the notion of consistency has not a clear and standard accepted meaning  even
if some authors propose to take into account a kind of degree of inconsistency in
the argumentation context as in the works of matt   toni        besnard   hunter 
      
moreover  revision has also been studied in the framework of non monotonic theories  witteveen   van der hoek        and argumentation theory is linked to nonmonotony  but postulates for non monotonic theories are also based on consistency
and inference notions that are not explicitly present in an abstract argumentation
system  so  these postulates are not suited for our problem  some of the belief revision postulates can be restated  this is the case for the property called priority to
recency which has been inspired by the agm success postulate    but other principles must be proposed  for instance  we have identified a property called monotony
which checks a kind of preservation of the existing extensions by the change process  
our work is an extension of a previous work  cayrol et al         which presented a
preliminary step towards a formal characterization of the notion of change in argumentation
frameworks  in the work of cayrol et al          a change was defined as the addition of
one argument and only one interaction and we studied only the structural properties and
priority of recency  called classicity by cayrol et al          in the new version of this
work  proposed in the current paper  we are further taking into account the addition of
several interactions  so some properties given by cayrol et al        do not hold here 
and defining new properties around the notion of monotony  we also look further into
the connections between all the proposed properties and into the conditions  necessary or
sufficient  for obtaining or avoiding these properties 
there are many other approaches that deal with adding new pieces of information
within an argumentation system  the point of view adopted in this family of works is
different from ours because of the status of the new piece of information that is added  for
instance  wassermann         as well as falappa  garca  and simari        and paglieri
and castelfranchi         define under which conditions  expressed in terms of arguments 
unjustified beliefs should become accepted  pollock and gilliess        approach studies the
properties of knowledge revision under the argumentation point of view  i e   the problem
is to generate a knowledge base in which each piece of information is justified by good
arguments  the same kind of problem is studied by amgoud and vesic        in the context
of argument based decision  argument based decision takes as input a set of options  a set of
arguments and a defeat relation among them  and returns a status for each option together
with a total preorder on the set of options  these authors study under which conditions an
option may change its status when a new argument is received and under which conditions
this new argument is useless 
recently  rotstein  moguillansky  falappa  garca  and simari      a  have proposed
a warrant prioritized revision operation  which consists in adding an argument to a theory
in such a way that this argument is warranted afterwards  even if the underlying ideas are
similar  this work differs from our approach in at least two points 
 first  in the work of rotstein et al       a   arguments are given a structure through
the sub argument relation  and properties such as minimality  consistency and atom  

fichange in argumentation systems

icity  and the definition of warranted arguments relies upon an evaluation of argumentation lines  in contrast  our approach remains at the most abstract level  and
our sets of accepted arguments are computed with the well known extension based
semantics 
 secondly  the warrant prioritized argument revision is designed in order to satisfy the
agm postulate  corresponding to our property of priority to recency  since the
added argument must be warranted in the revised theory  our work follows another
direction  we propose an extensive theoretical study of the impact of an addition
on the outcome of an abstract argumentation framework  which enables us to define
several properties for a change operation 
concerning the more general question of handling dynamics in argumentation  our proposal can be related to recent works of boella et al       a      b   and of rotstein et al 
     b  
 the work of boella et al       a      b  studies how the extensions of an argumentation system remain unchanged when the set of arguments or the attacks between
them are changed 
the four types of change we have proposed in definition   have been introduced under
different names  respectively attack refinement  attack abstraction  argument refinement and argument abstraction  however  only the operations of attack refinement 
attack abstraction and argument abstraction have been studied  and from a more
restrictive point of view 
 boella et al       a      b  consider only the case when the semantics provides
exactly one extension 
 the principles which are defined correspond to conditions under which a change
is conservative  in our terminology  no other property is considered 
as we focus on the addition of an argument and its interactions  the work of boella
et al       a      b  can be viewed as complementary to our work 
 rotstein et al       b  introduce the notion of dynamics by considering arguments
built from evidence  evidence is used to determine whether an argument is active  i e 
can be used to draw inferences  or inactive  the question addressed by rotstein et al 
     b  is  how a variation of the set of evidence affects the nature of arguments
 active or not    this question cannot be handled at a pure abstract level and
concerns internal dynamics  by contrast  we remain at an abstract level  we are
interested by the impact of a change of the abstract framework on the outcome of
that framework 
a promising application of our work could be to design dialogue strategies  indeed  a
dialogue may be defined as an exchange  called move  of arguments between two or more 
human or artificial  agents under a given protocol  the protocol is a program that defines
the set of allowed moves at each step of the dialogue  each agent has its own aim and
  

ficayrol  dupin de saint cyr   lagasquie schiex

may develop its own strategy  most of the works about dialogue strategies consider that
a strategy selects exactly one move  the move which must be done next   for instance 
bench capon        proposes a selection strategy  for agents  leading to more cooperative
dialogues  other approaches study strategies in the context of persuasion dialogues  where
two agents argue in order to persuade each other that a given initial argument is true  or
false according to the agent opinion   in that case  a strategy helps to choose which argument must be defeated in order that the initial argument should be accepted  or rejected  
amgoud and maudet        have proposed heuristics that select the less attackable arguments in a persuasion dialogue  in a similar way  riveret  prakken  rotolo  and sartor
       have proposed an optimal strategy in order to win a debate based on the probability
of success of the argument and on the cost of this argument for the agent  hunter        
with a more global approach  has defined a strategy which builds an optimal subtree of
arguments maximizing the resonance with the agent goals and minimizing their cost 
our approach takes another point of view  we do not define any protocol and we do not
restrict to a dialogue type  given a set of arguments which may interact  we are interested
in the outcome of the argumentation system  that is the set of extensions under a given
semantics  in other words  we study the impact of the addition of an argument with respect
to two points of view  first  the structural modification induced on the set of extensions 
second  the impact on the acceptability of arguments  although the concern of acceptability
evolution looks similar to the aim of the existing dialogue approaches presented above  our
proposal is more general  since in our work  we are not interested in finding strategies in
order to make accepted a precise argument but we are rather interested in establishing
general conditions for the preservation of acceptability  for instance  under the grounded
and preferred semantics  we provide a sufficient condition for maintaining an argument
accepted after the arrival of a new one  monotony property  and a sufficient condition for
a new argument to be accepted  priority to recency  
the structural point of view of our analysis is completely original with respect to the
existing literature  indeed  we analyze the impact of a new argument on the set of extensions
and this amounts to consider the addition of an argument as an operation performed in order
to modify the form of the change outcome  by doing an expansive change  or a decisive
change for instance   the work reported in this paper enables us to choose the right way of
changing  which argument must be affected by the change  with which kind of interaction 
in order to obtain the new outcome  this is why we plan to focus more on strategies for
directing a dialogue  i e   to be integrated in a protocol  than on strategies for taking part
in it  i e   concerning an agent   for instance  if a dialogue arbitrator wants the debate to
be more open then she should rather force the next speaker to use arguments appropriate
for an expansive change  if she wants the debate to be more focused then only arguments
appropriate for a restrictive  and even decisive  change should be accepted 
there are several directions of further research 

   we plan to study the other change operations defined in this paper  corresponding to
the removal of one argument with its interactions and to the addition or the removal
of an interaction  for instance  by exploiting properties of symmetry between all the
change operations  
  

fichange in argumentation systems

   we would like to generalize our change operations to the case of the addition or the
removal of a subgraph of arguments  which would be a kind of iterated change  
   we think that the decisive property is a desirable property for a change operation 
so  we intend to investigate the question how to make the minimal change   to a
given argumentation framework so that it has a unique non empty extension

preferred semantics  given an expansive change of g by z and iz   let us suppose that there
exists an extension ej of g  that does not contain z  then this extension is included in g 
as the change is expansive  there exists an extension ei of g strictly included in ej   ei is a
maximal admissible set for inclusion  since the inclusion of ei inside ej is strict  therefore
ej is not admissible in g  ej being an extension of g    it has no conflict  hence ej does not
defend each of its elements in g  it exists x  ej that is attacked by y in g  and thus in g   
and that is not defended by ej in g  this means that ej does not attack y   but  since ej is
included in g it can not attack y in g    if there is no edge between an element of ej and y in
g  there is neither such an edge in g     note that y can be attacked by z but z is not in ej  
stable semantics  assume that there exists an extension ej of g  that does not contain z  as
the change is expansive  there exists an extension ei of g strictly included in ej   since the
inclusion is strict  there exists y in ej   which does not belong to ei   and as we have assumed
that ej does not contain z  y is in g  ei is a stable extension of g  so ei attacks y   then 
as ei is included in ej there is a conflict in ej   which contradicts the fact that ej is a stable
extension 


proofs related to section      under the grounded semantics 
proof of proposition    e is the grounded extension of g  due to the fact that r is finite  we

 basic case  i       if x  f     then x is not attacked in g  since z does not attack x 
then x remains unattacked in g  and so belongs to f

prove that x  f p          f   f p         assume that x is attacked by y in g    as z does
not attack x  y is in g  as x  f p          f f p        f p      defends x by attacking
y   so there exists w  f p      which attacks y   which in turn attacks x  as z does not
indirectly attack x  we are sure that z does not indirectly attack w   using the induction
hypothesis for w   we have w  f p       so  we have proved that f p      defends x in g

 if e      then each argument of g is attacked  if z is attacked by g  then each argument of
g  is attacked and due to proposition     and proposition      e        if z is not attacked
by g  z is not attacked in g    then z belongs to e    which is not empty 
 if e      and z is not attacked by g  z  e    as f  is monotonic

 z   so f   s    s and s is a fixed point of f    we have proved that e     z  i  f i   z   

proof of corollary   
 it follows directly from proposition    due to definition    under the grounded semantics  the
change is decisive when e      and e        
 and as z interacts with g  if z is not attacked by g  z must attack g 

proof of proposition     due to the fact that r is finite  we have e   i  f i      and e   
i  f i       we prove by induction on i    that f i       f i      
 basic case  i       if y  f     then y is not attacked in g and due to the fact that z does
not attack e  y is not attacked in g  and y  f       
 induction hypothesis  for    i  p  f i       f i        let s   f p      and s    f p      
first  we prove that f s   f   s   let y  f s   obviously  f s   e  so y  e and
z does not attack y since z does not attack e  so  if y is attacked by a in g  then y is
attacked by a in g  as y  f s   s defends y by attacking a  and so s defends y in g   
that is y  f   s  
using the induction hypothesis  we have s  s    moreover  by definition f  is monotonic  so
f s    f p         f   s   f   s      f p         so  e  e   

proof of proposition     e  
     and z does not attack e  let us first notice that     if
y  f   e  and y  g  then y  f e    e  indeed  y  f   e  means that e defends y in g    so 
if y  g  e also defends y in g  i e   y  f e    e 
 due to proposition     we have e  e    so  we just have to prove that if e does not defend
z  then e   e  indeed  we will prove that f   e    e  then  by definition of e   least fixed
point   it will follow that e   e  let y  f   e   as e does not defend z  hence y  g 
according to      y  f e    e  conversely  let y  e   f e   and let a be an argument
that attacks y in g    as z does not attack e  a    z  so a  g  and e defends y by attacking
a  so  e defends y in g  and y  f   e  
 first  we prove that if e defends z then f   e    e  z   due to      if y  f   e  and y  g 
then y  f e    e  now  if e defends z  we have also z  f   e   so  f   e   e   z  
conversely  let y  f e    e  e defends y in g  as z does not attack e  z does not attack
y   and then e also defends y in g    so y  f   e   and z  f   e   so e   z   f   e  
in the particular case when z does not attack g  z cannot defend any argument  so  f   e 
 z     f   e  and then f   e   z     e   z   that means that e   z  is a fixed point of

f    and by definition of e    we have e   e   z   due to proposition     we have e  e   
so  we have also e   z   e    finally  e  reduces to e   z  
s
in the general case  z attacks g  let s denote e   z   i  f i   z    we will prove that
s
e    s  obviously  we have s  e  since e   z    f   e   e    and e  contains i  f i  e    
s
hence contains i  f i   z    since f  is monotonic  conversely  we will prove that s is a
fixed point of f  and by definition of e   least fixed point   it will follow that e   s 
since f  is monotonic  we have f   e   f   s   f    z    f   s  and for each i   
f i   z    f   s   so  as f   e    e   z   we have s  f   s   conversely  let y  f   s 
and assume that y 
  e   z    f   e   then  there exists an
s attacker a of y and a is not
attacked by e  as y  f   s   s must attack a  so  z   i  f i   z   attacks a  which
s
means that y  i  f i   z    so  we have proved that if y  f   s   either y  e   z  or
s
y  i  f i   z    that is y  s 

proof of corollary    it is a direct consequence of proposition    



proof of proposition     it is a direct consequence of the definitions  the restrictive and questioning changes need a number of extensions strictly greater than one  and there exists only one

proof of proposition     e  
      so there are unattacked arguments denoted by ai in g  ai  

ai is attacked in g and z is attacked in g    so there is no unattacked argument in g    so i   
f i           and e        so the change is destructive 
conversely  if the change is destructive  by definition we have e  
     and e        then  due to

proposition      there is no unattacked argument in g   so  z is attacked and each ai  unattacked
argument in g  is also attacked in g   


proofs related to section      under the preferred semantics

proof of proposition    
 ei is conflict free in g  so also in g    let a  ei being attacked in g    as z does not attack
ei   a is attacked in g and as ei is admissible in g  ei defends a  so  ei remains admissible in
g 
 z does not attack ei   and ei defends z  so ei does not attack z and then ei   z  is conflictfree in g    let a  ei   z  being attacked in g    either a  ei and as we have just proved
in the first item that ei is admissible in g    ei defends a  or a   z  and we have assumed
that ei defends z  in each case  ei   z  is admissible in g   


lemma   if ei is an extension of g  not containing z  then ei is admissible in g 
proof of lemma   
  

fichange in argumentation systems

as ei does not contain z  ei  g  ei is conflict free in g  so ei is also conflict free in g  let
y  ei being attacked by an argument a  a  g  as ei is admissible  it defends y   so  there is an
argument b  ei attacking a  as ei  g  b  g  so  we have proved that ei is admissible in g 

proof of corollary    from proposition     ei  e  ei   z  is admissible in g    so  there exists
j    such that ei   z   ej   from lemma    if ek is an extension of g  not containing z  then ek
is admissible in g  so  there exists i    such that ek  ei   so  we have ek  ei  ei   z   ej   as
a consequence  there would be a strict inclusion between two extensions of g    which is impossible 
so  there cannot exist ek extension of g  not containing z  and so each extension of g  contains z 

proof of proposition     if z is not attacked by g  then z is not attacked in g  and z belongs
to each preferred extension  moreover  if there is no even length cycle in g  due to lemma    there
is no even length cycle in g    so  due to proposition      g  has only one preferred extension which
is not empty  it contains at least z  


lemma   if z attacks no argument of g and ei is a non empty extension of g    then
ei    z  is admissible in g 
proof of lemma   
 ei is conflict free in g  so ei    z  is also conflict free in g  and in g 
 let y  ei    z   assume that there is an argument a attacking y   then a    z since z
attacks no argument of g  ei is a non empty preferred extension of g    so there is an argument
b  ei attacking a  and b    z  always because z attacks no argument of g   so  we have
b  ei    z   and ei    z  defends y   so  ei    z  is admissible in g 

proof of proposition     suppose that z attacks no argument of g and e        
 reductio ad absurdum   assume that there exists a non empty extension of g  denoted by e   
so there exists y such that y  e    either y   z  or y  g  in both cases  y is attacked  because
all arguments of g are attacked  since e         and z attacks no argument of g  so e  must
defend y   if y   z  e  cannot be reduced to y  because z attacks no argument and cannot defend
itself   so e     z         if y    z  y  e     z   and e     z   
      due to lemma    e     z  is
admissible in g and so e     z   e with e being a preferred extension of g  so g has a non empty
extension  which is in contradiction with the assumption 

proof of proposition    
 z attacks no argument of g  so due to proposition     i  ei is admissible in g    so there
exists a preferred extension ej of g  including ei   e          so i  ei       and so ej       
but z   ei   so ei  ej    z   due to lemma    ej    z  is admissible in g  so there exists
k    such that ei  ej    z   ek   using the definition of a preferred extension   maximal
among the admissible sets   we can conclude that ei   ej    z    ek   so  either ej   ei  if
z   ej    or ej   ei   z   if z  ej    in the first case  ei is an extension of g    in the second
case  ei   z  is an extension of g    moreover  if z  ej   ej defends z  which is attacked by
g  since it does not attack g  and as z attacks no argument  ei   ej    z  defends z  so  if

ei does not defend z  ei is an extension of g    on the other hand  if ei defends z  ei   z  is
conflict free in g    so  ei   z  is admissible in g  and it is the case when z  ej and ei   z 
is an extension of g   
 now  we prove that g and g  have the same number of extensions  from the first part of
the proof  we know that each extension of g is included in an extension of g    moreover  two
distinct extensions of g cannot be included in a same extension of g    indeed  the union of
two non empty preferred extensions defends all its elements and strictly contains each of these
extensions  so the union of two extensions cannot be conflict free 
so we know that g  has at least as many extensions as g and that g  has at least one nonempty extension  so  ej  e   ej        due to lemma    ej    z  is admissible in g  so 
for each ej   there exists ei   an extension of g such that ej    z   ei   from the first part of
the proof  we have 
 either ei defends z  and ei   z  is an extension of g    as ej    z   ei   we have
ej  ei   z   and as ej is maximal admissible in g    ej   ei   z  
 or ei does not defend z  ei is an extension of g    as ej is maximal admissible in g    we
have z   ej and ej   ej    z    ei  
so  g and g  have the same number of extensions 

proof of proposition    
 if e         obviously each change satisfies monotony 
 if g has a non empty extension  proposition    can be applied  so each extension of g
remains admissible in g  and is included in a preferred extension of g    so  the change satisfies
monotony 

proof of proposition     let e   i  ei and e    i  ei  
let eg  resp  eg   denote the grounded extension of g  resp g     due to proposition      we know
that eg  e and eg  e    dung        has proved that when there is no controversial argument 
the grounded extension is exactly the intersection of the preferred extensions  so  if g contains no
controversial argument  we have eg   e 
now  if z does not attack i  ei   z does not attack eg   so due to proposition     if e  
    
then we have eg  eg when e      then i  ei      and the inclusion trivially holds  so  we have

e   eg  eg  e    and then i  ei  i  ei  
proof of proposition     e         and there is no even length cycle in g  so there is no evenlength cycle in g  as a consequence  according to proposition     there is only one extension e in g 
moreover  e  
      since there is no even length cycle in g    we know that there is only one extension


e in g   assume that z and each unattacked argument ai in g are attacked in g    so there is no
unattacked argument in g   
assume that e         let x  e    x is attacked in g    let y  denote an attacker of x  as e 
is admissible  e  defends x  so e  contains x  which attacks y    as there is no even length cycle
in g    we know that x     x  and x  is not unattacked 
so we are able to built an infinite sequence of distinct arguments 
x is attacked by y  attacked by x        yp attacked by xp   attacked by yp        
the xi s  resp  yi s  are distinct due to the absence of even length cycles in g   
it contradicts the assumption that a is finite  so e       and the change is destructive
