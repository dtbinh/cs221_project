abstract
dungs abstract argumentation theory can be seen as a general framework for non monotonic
reasoning  an important question is then  what is the class of logics that can be subsumed as
instantiations of this theory  the goal of this paper is to identify and study the large class of
logic based instantiations of dungs theory which correspond to the maxi consistent operator  i e  to
the function which returns maximal consistent subsets of an inconsistent knowledge base  in other
words  we study the class of instantiations where every extension of the argumentation system
corresponds to exactly one maximal consistent subset of the knowledge base  we show that an
attack relation belonging to this class must be conflict dependent  must not be valid  must not be
conflict complete  must not be symmetric etc  then  we show that some attack relations serve as
lower or upper bounds of the class  e g  if an attack relation contains canonical undercut then it is
not a member of this class   by using our results  we show for all existing attack relations whether
or not they belong to this class  we also define new attack relations which are members of this
class  finally  we interpret our results and discuss more general questions  like  what is the added
value of argumentation in such a setting  we believe that this work is a first step towards achieving
our long term goal  which is to better understand the role of argumentation and  particularly  the
expressivity of logic based instantiations of dung style argumentation frameworks 

   introduction
a question whether dungs        abstract theory can be used as a general framework for nonmonotonic reasoning has drawn a particular amount of attention among researchers in artificial
intelligence  more precisely  the question is  can existing or new approaches to reasoning be seen
as instantiations of dungs theory  this is certainly a very general question  furthermore  different
approaches suppose that the available knowledge is represented in different form  this paper studies the problem setting when one is given a finite inconsistent set of classical propositional logic
formulae  which we refer to as a knowledge base  there are a number of approaches for dealing
with inconsistent information  a notable example are paraconsistent logics  priest        where one
is able to draw some  but not all  conclusions from an inconsistent set of formulae  indeed  each
paraconsistent logic allows for a subset of the inferences that could be obtained using classical logic
with the same knowledge  other examples of dealing with inconsistent knowledge include belief
revision  gardenfors         belief merging  konieczny   perez        or voting  arrow  sen   
suzumura         to be completely precise  note that there are approaches where one is given a
multiset instead of a set  for example where several voters can express their knowledge or preferences and the number of agents stating   voting for a proposition is important  however  in this
paper  we suppose that the information is represented in form of a set

generally speaking  we call an operator a function which provides a way to go from an inconsistent knowledge base to a set of subsets of that knowledge base  examples of operators are  a
function returning maximal for set inclusion consistent subsets of a knowledge base  called maxiconsistent operator  a function returning maximal for cardinality consistent subsets of a knowledge
base  called maxi card operator  a function returning all consistent subsets of a knowledge base   
to understand how and to which extent dungs theory can be used as a general framework for
reasoning  it is essential to study the link between the result obtained by applying an operator to a
knowledge base  and the extensions of the argumentation framework f    arg    r   where
for a set s    we denote by arg s  the set of all arguments that can be built from s  and by r
the relation used for identifying attacks between arguments  there are papers  cayrol        caminada   amgoud        amgoud   besnard              amgoud   vesic        gorogiannis
  hunter        studying the notions which are somehow related to a link between a knowledge
base and the corresponding argumentation framework  however  since the work of dung        
there are almost no papers studying the link between an operator and an instantiation of dungs theory  cayrol        showed that the instantiation of dungs theory using stable semantics and direct
undercut as attack relation  corresponds to maxi consistent operator  in argumentation community 
this one to one correspondence is sometimes identified as a main objection against pure logic based
argumentation  because the additional value of constructing the argumentation framework is then
said to be questionable  since computing the extensions does not do more than applying maxiconsistent operator   however  a recent work by vesic and van der torre        shows that there
exists a large class of logic based instantiations of dungs abstract theory having two interesting
features   i  it returns extensions that do not correspond to maximal consistent subsets of the initial
knowledge base  and  ii  its result satisfies basic argumentation postulates  caminada   amgoud 
       e g  consistency  closure    that paper shows that the space of logic based instantiations of
dungs theory is much larger than it was believed 
the previous result makes the question what is the class of operators that can be viewed as
instantiations of dungs theory  even more relevant as a research topic  we now aim only at
giving a broad overview of this class  first note that  interestingly  there is a rather big class of
instantiations of dungs theory returning inconsistent results  as showed by caminada and amgoud
        however  one would normally prefer to avoid this type of behaviour  and to study the class
of instantiations returning consistent results   thus  our long term goal is to identify the whole
class of instantiations of dungs theory that yield a consistent result  however  that is certainly a
hard task  we start by noticing that  given a set   the most common and a well known way to deal
with inconsistent information is to use the maxi consistent operator  i e  to select maximal consistent
subsets of   also  we conjecture that one of the biggest  sub classes of the class of instantiations
returning a consistent result is the class of instantiations corresponding to maxi consistent operator 
that is why our first goal  and the main goal of this paper  is to study this class   note that a more
general approach would consider the set of maxi consistent subsets of  and a selection function
f among the maxi consistent subsets  thus  only some maxi consistent sets would be used for
reasoning  however  the present paper studies the case when all the maxi consistent subsets of 
are taken into account since this already captures a significant number of systems  
   note that while there is no consensus regarding some of the postulates  e g  indirect consistency   some postulates
 e g  direct consistency  enjoy much wider acceptance 
   informally  but in the sense  in number of known instantiations

more particularly  the paper aims to answering the following questions  what are the properties
of attack relations and semantics used in instantiations of dungs theory that correspond to maxiconsistent operators  what are the necessary and sufficient conditions so that an attack relation
belongs to this class  under a given semantics   what properties do they satisfy  must  not  they be
conflict dependent  valid  symmetric        can we identify sub classes of attack relations belonging   not belonging to this class  can we find the lower and   or the upper bound  in terms of set
inclusion  of this class of attack relations  which existing  in the literature  attack relations belong
to this class under which semantics  are there new attack relations belonging to this class 
the paper is organised as follows  section   introduces the main notions of argumentation theory we use in the rest of the paper  section   formally defines the class of instantiations corresponding to maxi consistent operator  section   shows what properties are satisfied by attack relations
belonging to this class  section   identifies several classes of attack relations  not  corresponding to
maxi consistent operator  section   shows for all  to the best of our knowledge  existing attack relations from literature whether or not they belong to this class  and also defines a new attack relation
which is a member of this class  the last section concludes and discusses related work 

   basics of argumentation
as already mentioned  this paper supposes that one is given a set of classical propositional logic
formulae   we use the well known  e g  besnard   hunter        amgoud   cayrol       
gorogiannis   hunter        logic based approach for instantiating dungs theory  l denotes the
set of well formed formulae    stands for classical entailment  and  for logical equivalence  we
use the notation mc   for the set of all maximal consistent subsets of  
a logical argument is defined as a pair  support  conclusion  
definition    argument   an argument is a pair      such that    is a minimal  for set
inclusion  consistent set of formulae such that     
for an argument a         we use the function supp a     to denote its support and
conc a     to denote its conclusion 
example    let              a               b              and
c              are some of the arguments that can be constructed from   for example 
supp a           and conc a     
for a given set of formulae s  we denote by arg s  the set of arguments constructed from
s  formally  arg s     a   a is an argument and supp a   s   let arg l  denote the set of
all arguments that can be constructedsfrom the language of propositional logic  for a given set of
arguments e  we denote base e    ae supp a   we suppose that function arg is defined on l
and that function base is defined on arg l   by slightly abusing the notation  we sometimes write
arg  respectively base  for the restriction of these functions on any set of formulae  respectively
arguments  
definition    argumentation system   an argumentation system  as  is a pair  a  r  where a 
arg l  is a set of arguments and r  a  a a binary relation  for each pair  a  b   r  we say
that a attacks b  we also sometimes use notation arb instead of  a  b   r

in order to simplify notation  we do not explicitly mention an argumentation system when it
is clear from the context which argumentation system we refer to  since arguments are built from
formulae  we suppose that an attack relation is defined by specifying a condition such that for every
two arguments a and b  we have that a attacks b if and only if the condition from the definition of
attack relation is satisfied  for example  such a condition can be that the conclusion of a is logically
equivalent to the negation of the conclusion of b  we suppose that all attack relations are defined on
the set arg l   arg l   and that for every set a  arg l   we use the restriction of the attack
relation on the set aa  that is why  in order to simplify notation  we simply write r for an attack
relation defined on the set arg l   arg l  as well as for the restriction of that attack relation on
every set a  a  with a  arg l  
in order to determine mutually acceptable sets of arguments  different semantics have been
introduced in argumentation  we first introduce the basic notions of conflict freeness and defence 
definition    conflict free  defence   let f    a  r  be an as  e  a and a  a 
 e is conflict free if and only if there exist no arguments a  b  e such that a r b
 e defends a if and only if for every b  a we have that if b r a then there exists c  e such
that c r b 
let us now define the most commonly used semantics 
definition    acceptability semantics   let f    a  r  be an as and b  a  we say that a set b
is admissible if and only if it is conflict free and defends all its elements 
 b is a complete extension if and only if b defends all its arguments and contains all the
arguments it defends 
 b is a preferred extension if and only if it is a maximal  with respect to set inclusion  admissible set 
 b is a stable extension if and only if b is conflict free and for all a  a   b  there exists b  b
such that b r a 
 b is a semi stable extension if and only if b is a complete extension and the union of the set
b and the set of all arguments attacked by b is maximal  for set inclusion  
 b is a grounded extension if and only if b is a minimal  for set inclusion  complete extension 
 b is an ideal extension if and only if b is a maximal  for set inclusion  admissible set contained
in every preferred extension 
for an argumentation system f    a  r  we denote by extx  f   or  by a slight abuse of
notation  by extx  a  r  the set of its extensions with respect to semantics x  we use abbreviations
c  p  s  ss  g and i for respectively complete  preferred  stable  semi stable  grounded and ideal
semantics  for example  extp  f  denotes the set of preferred extensions argumentation system f 
example    let f    a  r  be an argumentation framework with a    a  b  c  d  and r  
  b  c    c  b    b  d    c  d    there are two preferred stable semi stable extensions   a  b  and  a  c  
three complete extensions   a    a  b  and  a  c   and one grounded ideal extension   a

   defining the problem setting
until now  we specified how to  from a knowledge base   construct an argumentation system f  
 arg    r   and then  using a chosen semantics  calculate extensions  since all the components
of the system except a semantics and an attack relation are fixed  then whether an instantiation
corresponds to maxi consistent operator depends exclusively on those two components  the next
definition provides a formal definition of what we mean by saying that an instantiation of dungs
framework corresponds to maxi consistent operator  the idea is that the function arg should be
a bijection between mc   and the extensions of the corresponding argumentation system 
definition    mc  ext   let x be an argumentation semantics  we say that attack relation r
satisfies  mc  extx   if and only if for every finite set of propositional formulae  we have that
arg is a bijection between mc   and extx  arg    r 
this means that for every set s  mc    it holds that arg s   ext arg    r  and for
every e  ext arg    r   there exists s  mc   such that e   arg s   for example  we say
that an attack relation r satisfies  mc  extc   if and only if for every finite   we have that arg
is a bijection between mc   and extc  arg    r   sometimes  when it is clear from the context
which semantics we refer to or when a semantics is not important  we use the simplified notation
 mc  ext   we say that an attack relation r falsifies  mc  extx   if and only if r does not satisfy
 mc  extx    the following example shows an attack relation that does not satisfy  mc  exts   
example    consider the attack relation known as defeating rebut  denoted by rdr and defined
as follows  for two arguments a and b  we say that a attacks b and write ardr b if and only if
conc a    conc b   this attack relation falsifies  mc  exts    to see why  it is sufficient to find
a set of formulae  such that arg is not a bijection between mc   and  arg    rdr    to that end 
consider             and denote f    arg    rdr    we see that mc      s    s   
with s         and s          denote e    arg s    and e    arg s     if exts  f    
 e    e    then rdr does not satisfy  mc  exts    consider argument a              
and note that a  e    observe that for every argument b  arg    we have that brdr a if and
only if conc b          in other words  for every argument b  arg    b attacks a if and
only if conc b        recall that from definition   we know that for every argument b 
supp b    conc b   thus  for every argument b  arg    if brdr a then supp b       
since             then there is no argument b  arg   such that supp b       
thus  argument a is not attacked by any argument of e    this means that e  is not a stable extension
of f  consequently  arg is not a bijection between mc   and exts  f   hence  rdr falsifies
 mc  exts   
    complete and incomplete systems
there are two ways to study the link between an instantiated argumentation system f  containing
arguments and attacks between them  and the corresponding knowledge base   containing formulae   the first scenario is as follows 
 choose an attack relation r and a semantics x
 start with a finite knowledge base 
  

fiv esic

 consider the system f    arg    r   containing all the arguments that can be built from 
 compare the result obtained by using an operator on  and the one obtained by calculating
the extensions of f
in this case  we say that the obtained argumentation system is complete  every complete system
has an infinite number of arguments  but for every complete system f  there exists a finite system
f   such that f and f   are equivalent  how to formally define equivalence between argumentation
systems is not the topic of the present paper  for more details the reader is invited to consult the
literature on this subject  amgoud  besnard    vesic        
the second possibility is to do the converse 
 for a given attack relation r and semantics x 
 start with an argumentation system f    a  r  
 define  as the set of all formulae used in the supports of arguments of f  that is  define
def
   base a 
 compare the result obtained by using an operator on  and the one obtained by calculating
the extensions of f
the obtained argumentation system may be incomplete  in the sense that a  
  arg base a   
there is an important difference between those two scenarios  namely  in the first case  all the
arguments that can be built from  are considered when calculating extx  f   in the second case  
contains all the formulae from a  but in f  not all formulae are equally represented  let us illustrate
this situation 
example    let r be defined as  for every a  b  arg l    a  b   r if and only if there exists
  supp b  such that conc a     let us use preferred semantics  let f    a  r  and
a    a  b  with a              and b           in this case  since b attacks a and not
vice versa  the only extension is e    b   note that the conclusion of the only accepted argument is
  however  if we take  to be the union of all formulae used in supports of the arguments of f 
we obtain              there are two maximal consistent subsets of this knowledge base 
mc                      
it is clear that in a setting similar to that in the previous example  or  more generally  in the
second scenario  one cannot expect arg to be a bijection between mc   and ext a  r   but  what
does an incomplete argumentation system stand for  how is it obtained  to conclude that a system
such that a    arg base a   is meaningless would certainly be too hasty  let us consider this
question in more detail  namely  we know that missing arguments can be added by an intelligent
agent  should we first add all the missing arguments and then calculate the extensions of the
complete version of our system  there are two possible answers      yes  we must add missing
arguments in order to take into account all available information      no  since we are given an
argumentation system and not all arguments have been constructed  in case of monological argumentation  or uttered  in the case of dialogical argumentation   both arguments     and     make
sense in different applications  the first possibility corresponds to a case when we want to simulate a
resource unbounded agent  and take into account all the information  where information is seen as
  

fii dentifying the c lass of m axi  c onsistent o perators in a rgumentation

formulae  known by agent s   note that this has its disadvantages since by doing so  we ignore the
argumentational representation of the problem  the second possibility is to be used when we want
to know what the output of an argumentation system is  where we do take into account the fact that
not all arguments are constructed  e g  because of the lack of computational resources  or since the
given argumentation framework is representing a dialogue in which not everything has been said  
note that numerous works in the     s  pollock        vreeswijk        loui        yield
conceptual and philosophical arguments supporting partial computation  i e  incomplete systems  
an important part of vreeswijks        work is devoted to defining and constructing complete
argumentation systems  loui        discusses the philosophical difference between demonstrative
reasoning and non demonstrative reasoning and claims that in a realistic  i e  resource bounded 
setting  not all reasons are demonstrative  and that process and disputation are essential to reasoning  note  however  that none of those frameworks is an instantiation of dungs system  and that
formalisations in those works differ a lot from the framework we studied in this paper  the goal of
the present paper is not to argue that complete systems are in any sense better than incomplete
ones  or vice versa   but only to study the possibilities and limits related to instantiating dungs abstract theory  we will not further analyse the difference between complete and incomplete systems 
but we find it necessary to point out that they exist  in order to make the context of our research
question clear  in the second scenario  it is not reasonable to expect any correlation between the
result obtained directly from  and from f  that is why  in the rest of the paper we suppose the
first scenario 

   properties of relations satisfying  mcext 
in this section  we analyse properties of attack relations satisfying  mc  ext   we first show that
if this condition is satisfied  then the function base   ext f   mc   is the inverse function of
the function arg   mc    ext f  
proposition    let r be an attack relation and x an acceptability semantics  if relation r satisfies
 mc  extx   then 
 for every s  mc    we have that s   base arg s   
 for every e  extx  f   we have that e   arg base e   
proof  let  be a finite set of propositional formulae and let f    arg    r  
 let s  mc   and e   arg s   since r satisfies  mc  ext   then e  extx  f   let
s     base e  and let us suppose that s    s     let us study two cases 
 let s   s       and    s   s     this means that there is an argument a  e such that
   supp a  with   
  s  contradiction 
 let s     s     and    s     s  this means that there is an argument a  e such that
   supp a   contradiction with   
  s 
since s   s      and s     s     then s   s     in other words  base arg s     s 
 let e  extx  f  and s   base e   since r satisfies  mc  extx    then there exists a
unique s    mc   such that arg s       e  let us prove that s   s    
  

fiv esic

 let us suppose that s   s       and let   s   s     this means that there is an argument
a  e such that   supp a   contradiction with the fact  
  s  
 suppose that s     s     and that    s     s  from    s     we conclude that there
exists a  e such that    supp a   contradiction with the fact that   
  s 
from s   s      and s     s     we conclude s   s     thus  arg base e     e 

let us illustrate this result by the following example 
example    consider the attack relation known as direct undercut  denoted by rdu and defined as
follows  for two arguments a and b  we say that a attacks b and we write ardu b if and only if there
exists   supp b  such that conc a     it is known that direct undercut satisfies  mc  exts  
 cayrol         from proposition    we see that for every   for every s  mc    it holds that
s   base arg s   and  more interestingly  that for every e  exts  arg    rdu    we have that
e   arg base e   
the previous result allows to easily show that if an attack relation satisfies  mc  ext   then
every extension has a consistent base and the union of its arguments conclusions is consistent 
corollary    let r be an attack relation and x a semantics  let r satisfy  mc  extx   and let 
be a finite set of formulae  denote f    arg    r   then  for every e  extx  f   we have 
 base e  is consistent
s
 ae conc a  is consistent
proof  let e  extx  f   since r satisfies  mc  extx    then there exists s  mc   such that
e   arg s   from proposition    we obtain e   arg base e    since arg is an injective function 
for every s    mc    if e   arg s     then s   s     thus  s   base e   consequently  base e  is
a consistent set  it is clear that
s for every argument a  e  we have that base e    conc a   since
base e  is consistent  then ae conc a  is consistent as well 
note that we can use the previous result to show that an attack relation does not satisfy  mc  ext  
namely  if an attack relation returns extensions having inconsistent bases  then it violates  mc  ext  
corollary    let r be an attack relation  and x an acceptability semantics  if there exists a finite
knowledge base  such that there exists an extension e  extx  arg    r  such that base e  is
inconsistent  then r does not satisfy  mc  extx   
    on conflict dependence and validity
in this subsection  we study the link between satisfying  mc  ext  and conflict dependence and
validity  an attack relation is conflict dependent if whenever an argument attacks another one  the
union of their supports is inconsistent  amgoud   besnard        
definition    conflict dependent   let r  arg l   arg l  be an attack relation  we say that r
is conflict dependent if and only if for every a  b  arg l   if  a  b   r then supp a   supp b

we now prove that conflict dependence is a necessary condition for satisfying  mc  ext   to
be completely precise  we here specify that we say that a semantics x returns conflict free sets if
and only if for every argumentation system  a  r   for every e  extx  a  r   it holds that e is
conflict free with respect to r  all the semantics from definition   return conflict free sets 
proposition    let r be an attack relation and x a semantics returning conflict free sets  if r
satisfies  mc  extx    then r is conflict dependent 
proof  let us suppose the contrary  i e  let r be an attack relation that is not conflict dependent  let
 be a knowledge base and let a  b  arg   with arb and supp a   supp b  being consistent 
thus  there exists a set s  mc   such that supp a supp b   s  since r satisfies  mc  extx  
then e   arg s  is an extension of the corresponding argumentation system f    arg    r  
this means that a  b  e  contradiction with the assumption that x returns conflict free extensions 
thus  r must be conflict dependent 
having proved this  we know that a relation satisfying  mc  ext  enjoys all the properties
of conflict dependent relations  for example  it was shown that if an attack relation is conflictdependent  then there are no self attacking arguments  amgoud   besnard        
corollary    let r be an attack relation and x a semantics returning conflict free sets  if r satisfies
 mc  extx   then for every argument a  arg l   we have that such that  a  a  
  r 
proof  from proposition    we have that r is conflict dependent  then  there are no self attacking
arguments  amgoud   besnard        prop     
this means that we have another way to identify  some of the  attack relations not satisfying
 mc  ext   namely  if for an attack relation there exists a self attacking argument  then the given
attack relation falsifies  mc  ext  for all semantics returning conflict free sets  let us now study
the notion of validity  amgoud   besnard        
definition    valid   let r  arg l   arg l  be an attack relation  we say that r is valid if
and only if for every e  arg l  it holds that if e is conflict free  then base e  is consistent 
let us now show that this property is incompatible with conflict dependence 
proposition    there exists no attack relation which is both conflict dependent and valid 
proof  let r be an attack relation and suppose that r is both conflict dependent and valid  let
a           b           c              and let e    a  b  c   since r is
valid and base e  is inconsistent  then e is not conflict free  since r is conflict dependent  then
 a  b  
  r   b  a  
  r   a  c  
  r   c  a  
  r   b  c  
  r   c  b  
  r  thus  e is conflict free 
contradiction 
this means that if an attack relation r satisfies  mc  ext  then there must exist a set e which
is conflict free with respect to r but whose base is inconsistent 
corollary    let r be an attack relation and x an acceptability semantics returning conflict free
sets and let r satisfy  mc  extx    then  r is not valid 
  

fiv esic

the proof of the previous fact is a consequence of proposition   and proposition    it is useful
since if an attack relation is valid  we can immediately conclude that it violates  mc  extx   for all
 possible  semantics returning conflict free sets 
on the more general level  we see that asking for every conflict free set to have a consistent base
is very demanding  roughly speaking  this is due the fact that attacks are binary whereas minimal
conflicts may be ternary  or of a greater cardinality   some authors argue that to obtain a consistent
result  one should concentrate on admissibility and not on conflict freeness  for example  caminada and vesic        claim that n ary attacks  for n     are simulated in dungs framework
throughout the notion of admissibility  thus  an idea for future work could be to study an alternative
condition  which is that every admissible set has a consistent base 
    satisfying  mcext  and different acceptability semantics
in this subsection  we study the properties related to particular semantics  we show that if an attack
relation satisfies  mc  ext  for stable semantics  then it satisfies it for semi stable semantics also 
then we identify conditions under which an attack relation satisfies  mc  ext  for stable semantics  we provide a similar result for preferred semantics  we also identify a sufficient condition so
that an attack relation falsifies  mc  ext  under complete semantics  then  we discuss the case of
single extension semantics  like grounded and ideal 
first  suppose that r satisfies  mc  exts    this means that for every finite set of formulae  
function arg is a bijection between mc   and exts  arg    r   since every finite set of formulae
has at least one maximal consistent subset  even if that is the empty set  then for every   it must
be that  arg    r  has at least one stable extension  since there are stable extensions  then stable
and semi stable semantics coincide  caminada         thus  we obtain the following proposition 
proposition    let r be an attack relation  if r satisfies  mc  exts   then 
 for every finite set of formulae  and f    arg    r   we have that exts  f    extss  f 
 r satisfies  mc  extss   
let us now prove that in the case of stable semantics  if the image with respect to arg of every
maximal consistent set is an extension and if the base of every extension is consistent  then the
attack relation in question satisfies  mc  ext  
proposition    let r be an attack relation  if for every set of formulae  and f    arg    r  
we have 
 for all s  mc    arg s   exts  f   and
 for all e  exts  f   base e  is consistent
then r satisfies  mc  exts   
proof  let us prove that r satisfies  mc  exts    we already know that for every s  mc   
arg s   exts  f   let us suppose that e  exts  f  and let us prove that there exists a unique set
s  mc   such that arg s    e  if we prove that such a set exists  then uniqueness is guaranteed
since for s  s      if s    s   then arg s     arg s     trivially holds  thus  let us prove that there
exists s  mc   such that arg s    e  let s     base e  and let us prove that s    mc

and arg s       e  by means of contradiction  suppose that s   is a consistent but not maximal
consistent set  then  there exists s     mc   such that s    s      from the assumptions of this
proposition  we have that e      arg s      is a stable extension of f  but we also have e   e      since
no stable extension is a proper subset of another stable extension  then e is not a stable extension 
contradiction  thus  it must be that s    mc    it is easy to see that e  arg base e    namely 
for every set of arguments  by applying the function arg on its base  we obtain its superset   let
us prove arg s       e  suppose the contrary  then  e   arg s      since s    mc   then
arg s      exts  f   thus  e is not a stable extension  since no stable extension is a proper subset
of another stable extension  
we prove that similar two conditions are sufficient to guarantee that r satisfies  mc  ext 
under preferred semantics 
proposition    let r be an attack relation  if for every set of formulae  and f    arg    r  
we have 
 for all s  mc    arg s   extp  f   and
 for all e  extp  f   base e  is consistent
then r satisfies  mc  extp   
proof of this property is similar to the proof of proposition   
as a consequence of the two previous results  we can identify a sufficient condition so that r
satisfies both  mc  exts   and  mc  extp   
corollary    let r be an attack relation  if for every set of formulae  and f    arg    r   we
have 
 for all s  mc    arg s   exts  f   and
 for all e  extp  f   base e  is consistent
then r satisfies both  mc  exts   and  mc  extp   
proof  since every stable extension is a preferred one  dung         it is clear that r satisfies both
conditions of proposition   and proposition    by applying those propositions  we have that r
satisfies  mc  exts   and  mc  extp   
let us now show that if an attack relation returns a stable extension having an inconsistent base 
then it violates  mc  ext  for stable  semi stable  preferred and complete semantics 
proposition    let r be an attack relation  if there exists a finite set of formulae  such that
f    arg    r  has a stable extension e such that base e  is inconsistent  then r falsifies
 mc  extx   for x   s  ss  p  c  
proof  we supposed that there exists a stable extension e  exts  f  such that base e      it
has been proved  dung        that every stable extension is a preferred and a complete one  we also
know  caminada        that e must be a semi stable extension  by using corollary    we conclude
that r does not satisfy  mc  ext  for stable  semi stable  preferred and complete semantics

let us now study the case of complete semantics  we show that it is not possible for an attack
relation to satisfy  mc  extc    the only condition we use in our result is that for every argument
a  if a has a formula  in its support  and     then there exists an argument b  arg   such
that b attacks a 
proposition    let r be an attack relation such that for every finite set of formulae   for every
a  arg    for every   supp a   if there exists    such that    then there exists
b  arg   such that  b  a   r  then  r does not satisfy  mc  extc   
proof  we prove that if an attack relation r satisfies the condition from this proposition  then it
falsifies  mc  extc    we use the proof by contradiction  in other words  the plan of the proof is as
follows  first  we suppose that r satisfies the given condition  second  by means of contradiction 
we suppose that r satisfies  mc  extc    third  we draw conclusions and obtain a contradiction 
fourth  by reductio ad absurdum  we conclude that it must be that r falsifies  mc  extc   
so  let us start by supposing the condition from the proposition and suppose that r satisfies
 mc  extc    thus  from proposition    we obtain the r is conflict dependent  since r satisfies
 mc  extc    then for every   arg is a bijection between mc   and extc  arg    r   consider
          and denote f    arg    r   it is clear that mc      s    s    with s        
and s          since r satisfies  mc  extc   then extc  f     e    e    with e    arg s   
and e    arg s    
let us now obtain a contradiction by proving that e    arg     is a complete extension  first 
prove that this set is conflict free  let a  b  e    since r is conflict dependent  then  a  b  
  r 
thus  e  is conflict free 
let us now prove that for all a  e    for all b  arg     e    we have that  a  b  
  r and
 b  a  
  r  by means of contradiction  suppose the contrary  again from conflict dependence  we
have that supp a   supp b      it must be that       supp a   supp b   since the support
of every argument is consistent  then supp a  contains either  or   contradiction with the fact
a  arg      thus  e  is an admissible set 
let us now prove that e  does not defend any arguments in arg     e    to show this  we only
need to prove that every argument in arg     e  is attacked by at least one argument  note that
for every a  arg     e    it holds that a  e    e  or a  e    e    without loss of generality 
let a  e    e    let us prove that a is attacked  note that in every argumentation system  every
non attacked argument is in all complete extensions  since a 
  e    then a must be attacked  to sum
up 
 e  is an admissible set
 e  does not attack any argument in arg     e 
 arg     e  does not attack any argument in e 
 every argument in arg     e  is attacked by at least one argument 
thus  e  is a complete extension  contradiction with the claim that extc  f     e    e     by
reductio ad absurdum  we conclude that r does not satisfy  mc  extc   
what about the semantics which always return a unique extension  like grounded and ideal
semantics  in such a case  it is not reasonable to expect that there is a bijection between mc   and
  

fii dentifying the c lass of m axi  c onsistent o perators in a rgumentation

the set of extensions  since there can be several maximal consistent subsets of   let us formally
state this fact 
proposition    if x is a semantics such that for every argumentation system f we have  extx  f    
  then there is no attack relation r which satisfies  mc  extx   
proof  let            denote f    arg    r   there are two maximal consistent subsets
of   i e   mc         since we supposed that every argumentation system has exactly one
extension under semantics x  then there is no bijection between mc   and extx  f  
the previous simple result is not surprising  the idea between those semantics is to have one
extension that contains all the arguments that should be accepted according to every point of view 
thus  we can expect a link between the set of formulae not belonging to any minimal inconsistent
set and those extensions  note that the sufficient conditions for r were identified  gorogiannis
  hunter        so that for every finite set  and f    arg    r  we have that the grounded
and the ideal semantics coincide and that the extension is exactly arg               k    where
             k   is the set of all minimal  for set inclusion  inconsistent subsets of  

   identifying classes of attack relations  not  satisfying  mcext 
the previous sections show how to identify properties that an attack relation satisfying  mc  ext 
must satisfy  they also provide several results closely related to the choice of a specific acceptability semantics  in this section  we identify classes of attack relations which satisfy  do not satisfy
 mc  ext   or serve as lower  upper  bounds  with respect to set inclusion  for  non  satisfying
 mc  ext  
we first show that the whole class of symmetric attack relations violates  mc  ext  for all
semantics from definition   
proposition     if r is a symmetric attack relation  then for every x   s  ss  p  c  g  i   r falsifies
 mc  extx   
proof  from proposition    we see that r violates  mc  extg   and  mc  exti    let us now
prove the same for other acceptability semantics 
if r is a symmetric attack relation  then every conflict free set is admissible  furthermore  it is
easy to see that in this case every maximal conflict free set is a stable extension  and vice versa  
since every finite argumentation system has at least one maximal conflict free set  then every finite
argumentation system using a symmetric attack relation has at least one stable extension  let r be
a symmetric relation and suppose that for at least one x   s  ss  p  c   r satisfies  mc  extx   
from corollary    we conclude that r is not valid  this means that there exists a finite propositional
knowledge base  and f    arg    r  such that there is a conflict free set e  arg   having
an inconsistent base  let e    arg   be a maximal conflict free set containing e  i e  such that
e  e     since e   is a maximal conflict free set  then it is a stable extension of f  since e   is a
stable extension  then it is also a semi stable  preferred and a complete one  since base e       
then corollary   implies that for all x   s  ss  p  c   r fails to satisfy  mc  extx   
we now identify another class of attack relations that do not satisfy  mc  ext   namely  we
show that every  possible  attack generating too many attacks falsifies  mc  ext   first  we

need to formally define what we mean by too many attacks  we do this by introducing the notion
of conflict completeness 
definition    conflict complete   let r  arg l   arg l  be an attack relation  we say that
r is conflict complete if and only if for every minimal conflict c  l  i e  for every inconsistent
set whose every proper subset is consistent   for every c    c   c such that c       c      
c   c    c  for every argument a  such that supp a      c    there exists an argument a  such
that supp a      c  and  a    a     r 
intuitively  an attack relation is conflict complete if when two sets form a minimal conflict  then
every argument built from one of the two sets can be attacked by an argument from the other set 
this notion is inspired by the desire to describe properties of a class of existing  and new  attack
relations  for example  canonical undercut is conflict complete 
we can show that if an attack relation is conflict complete  then it falsifies  mc  ext  for stable 
semi stable  preferred and complete semantics 
proposition     let r be an attack relation  if r is conflict complete then r does not satisfy
 mc  extx   for x   s  ss  p  c  
proof  let r be a conflict complete attack relation and let us use the proof by contradiction  thus 
suppose that there exist x   s  ss  p  c  such that r satisfies  mc  extx   and obtain a contradiction  from proposition    we have that r is conflict dependent  let              let
f    arg    r  and e   arg      arg        arg      we prove that e is a stable
extension of f  first  prove that e is conflict free  let a  b  e and suppose  a  b   r  from
conflict dependence  we obtain supp a   supp b      contradiction with the definition of e 
since there are no two arguments of e such that the union of their supports is inconsistent  now 
prove that e attacks every argument in arg     e  let a   arg     e  there are three cases 
case    supp a              in this case  since r is conflict complete  then a  is attacked by
at least one argument from the set arg    case    supp a            again from conflictcompleteness  such an argument is attacked by an argument from the set arg        case   
supp a             is also similar  since a  is then attacked by an argument having support
    we conclude that e  exts  f   it is easy to see that base e      proposition   now implies
that r does not satisfy  mc  extx   for every x   s  ss  p  c   contradiction 
the previous part of this paper studies classes of attack relations  let us now define

 rebut   direct undercut  arrdu b if and only if arr b or ardu b

the first seven items from the previous definition list are  to the best of our knowledge  all the
attack relations used in the logic based argumentation literature  finding the exact paper in which
each of them occurs for the first time would be quite a challenging task  we can say that rebut was
defined by pollock               direct undercut was introduced in the work of elvang gransson 
fox  and krause        and elvang gransson and hunter         undercut and canonical undercut were defined in this form by besnard and hunter               to the best of our knowledge 
conflicting attack was not used in the argumentation literature  a possibility to use such a relation
was mentioned  besnard   hunter        p       we show that it is not enough to capture the
presence of inconsistency to make a good attack relation  namely  we show later that this attack
relation may return inconsistent extensions  rebut   direct undercut is added by the author of the
present paper  as an attempt to investigate the possibility to use rebut to detect some conflicts not
detected by direct undercut  but to avoid using a symmetric relation  rebut   the name big argument
attack and the idea behind this attack relation are due to l  van der torre  personal communication 
june            this attack relation was coined with the goal to show that there are reasonable attack relations not taking into account the conclusion of an argument  we later show  proposition    
that this attack relation also satisfies  mc  ext    the idea behind the name of this attack relation
is that it is sufficient to use only one argument per support since the conclusions are not important 
those arguments are called big since one big argument plays a role of a whole class of normal
arguments  i e  all the arguments having the same support  the attack relation is called big since it
is to be used between big arguments  
the reader can easily check that canonical undercut is conflict complete  which leads to the
conclusion that every attack relation containing canonical undercut  in the set theoretic sense  is
also conflict complete 
proposition     let r  arg l   arg l  be an attack relation  if rcu  r then r is conflictcomplete 
thus  from proposition     we conclude that every attack relation containing canonical undercut
falsifies  mc  ext  for stable  semi stable  preferred and complete semantics 
corollary    let r be an attack relation  if rcu  r  then r does not satisfy  mc  extx   for
x   s  ss  p  c  
since rcu  ru  rd  rc   then we obtain that as soon as an attack relation r contains ru  
or rd or rc then it falsifies  mc  ext  for stable  semi stable  preferred and complete semantics 
corollary    let r be an attack relation  if ru  r  or rd  r or rc  r then r falsifies
 mc  extx   for x   s  ss  p  c

hence  there is a whole class of attack relations based on undercutting which do not satisfy
 mc  ext   we also identified another class of attack relations  this time based on rebutting 
which do not satisfy  mc  exts    namely  every attack relation contained in defeating rebut must
falsify  mc  exts    observe how the proof of the following proposition is based on the idea from
example   
proposition     let r be an attack relation  if r  rdr then r does not satisfy  mc  exts   
proof  let us suppose the contrary  i e  let r satisfy  mc  exts    let             and
f    arg    r   we have that mc      s    s     with s         and s          thus 
it must be that exts  f     e    e    with e    arg s    and e    arg s     it is obvious that for an
argument a               we must have a   e    since e  is a stable extension  then there
must exist an argument a   e  such that  a    a     r  thus  it must be that conc a         
consequently  conc a        recall that supp a           or supp a           
contradiction 
since rr  rdr then the previous conclusion holds for every relation contained in rr  
corollary    let r be an attack relation  if r  rr then r does not satisfy  mc  exts   
proof  let r  rr   since rr  rdr   then r  rdr   from proposition     r falsifies
 mc  exts   

   particular attack relations and  mcext 
in the previous section  we identified classes of relations which do not satisfy  mc  ext   in this
section  we examine in detail all the attack relations from definition   
by using the results presented until now  we prove that direct undercut  direct defeat and big
argument attack satisfy  mc  ext  for stable  semi stable and preferred semantics  and falsify it
for other semantics  whereas other attack relations fail to satisfy  mc  ext  for any semantics 
note that it has been proved  cayrol        that direct undercut satisfies  mc  ext  in the case
of stable semantics  from proposition    we conclude that direct undercut satisfies  mc  ext 
for semi stable semantics  so  we only need to prove that rdu satisfies  mc  ext  in the case of
preferred semantics 
proposition     attack relation rdu satisfies  mc  extx   for x   s  ss  p  
proof  we have already seen why rdu satisfies  mc  ext  under stable and semi stable semantics  we now study the case of preferred semantics  let  be a finite set of formulae and f  
 arg    rdu    since it was already proved  cayrol        that stable extensions of f are exactly
arg s   when s ranges over mc    and since every stable extension is a preferred one  then it
is clear that for every s  mc   we have that arg s  is a preferred extension of f  thanks to
proposition    we now only need to prove that the base of every preferred extension is consistent 
this result follows from prop     by gorogiannis and hunter         since relation rdu satisfies
all the conditions of that proposition  thus  direct undercut satisfies  mc  extp   
example    consider a relation   for inferring from an inconsistent knowledge base defined as
follows  given a set   we write     if and only if for every maximal consistent subset s of   it
  

fii dentifying the c lass of m axi  c onsistent o perators in a rgumentation

holds that s     where   stands for classical entailment  now  consider an argumentation system
using direct undercut as attack relation and stable semantics  from proposition     we conclude
that for every   arg is a bijection between mc   and exts  arg    rdu    roughly speaking  this
means that the set of formulae that can be inferred from  with respect to   is equal to the set of
formulae that are conclusions of all the extensions of the corresponding argumentation framework
based on direct undercut and stable semantics  more formally  for every   l  for every formula
  l we have that      if and only if for every extension e  exts  arg    rdu    there exists
a  e such that    conc a  
let us now show that rdd also satisfies  mc  ext  for stable  semi stable and preferred semantics 
proposition     attack relation rdd satisfies  mc  extx   for x   s  ss  p  
proof  let  be a finite knowledge base and f    arg    rdd    let s  mc    it is easy to
see that e   arg s  is a stable extension of f  namely  e is conflict free since rdd is conflictdependent  furthermore  for every argument a   arg     e  it must be that supp a    contains at
least one formulae      s  from this fact  it is easy to conclude that there exists an argument
a  e such that supp a   s and conc a     since s is a maximal consistent set   thus 
a attacks a  which ends this part of the proof and shows why e  exts  f   since every stable
extension is a semi stable and a preferred one  then e  extss  f  and e  extp  f   let us now
suppose that e is a preferred extension of f  since direct defeat satisfies conditions of prop     by
gorogiannis and hunter         then we conclude that base e  is consistent  from corollary   
we conclude that rdd satisfies  mc  ext  for stable and preferred semantics  now  proposition  
implies that rdd also satisfies  mc  extss   
we now show that it is not necessary to look at conclusions of arguments in order to satisfy
 mc  ext   namely  we can show that big argument attack satisfies  mc  ext  for stable  semistable and preferred semantics 
proposition     attack relation rba satisfies  mc  extx   for x   s  ss  p  
proof  let us first show that for every s  mc    it holds that e   arg s  is a stable extension in
f    arg    rba    since rba is conflict dependent  then e is conflict free  let a   arg     e
and let us prove that there exists a  e such that arba a    since a  
  e  then there exists  
supp a    such that  
  s  since s is a maximal consistent subset of   then s     let s    s
be a minimal with respect to set inclusion consistent set such that s       such a set exists since
s is consistent  and let a    s        a is an argument since s   is a minimal consistent set from
which  can be deduced  we see that  a  a     rba   this means that the image with respect to arg
of every maximal consistent subset of  is a stable extension of f  thus  it is also a semi stable
and a preferred extension of f  let us now prove that for every  and the corresponding f  
 arg    rba    the base of every preferred extension e of f is a consistent set  let e  extp  f 
and s   base e   aiming to a contradiction  suppose the contrary  i e  let s be an inconsistent set 
let s    s be a minimal  with respect to set inclusion  inconsistent set  denote s                  n   
let a  e be an argument such that n  supp a   and let a     s      n    n    it is clear that
 a    a   rba   since e is a preferred extension  it is conflict free  thus a  
  e  furthermore  e
is admissible  so there must exist b  e such that  b  a   rba   since  b  a   rba   then there

exists i              n     such that supp b    i   since i  s     then there exists an argument
c  e such that i  supp c   according to the definition of rba   that would mean that b attacks
c  contradiction with the fact that e is conflict free  so  s must be a consistent set  this shows that
for every  and the corresponding f    arg    rba    the base of every preferred extension e of
f is a consistent set  from corollary    we conclude that rba satisfies  mc  ext  for stable and
preferred semantics  now  proposition   implies that rba also satisfies  mc  extss   
we already know that no relation satisfies  mc  ext  for the grounded or ideal semantics  by
using proposition    it is easy to conclude that rdu   rdd and rba falsify  mc  extc   
let us now prove that the remaining attack relations from definition   do not satisfy  mc  ext 
for neither of semantics from definition   
proposition     attack relations rd   ru   rcu   rr   rdr   rrdu   rc falsify  mc  ext  for stable 
semi stable  preferred  complete  grounded and ideal semantics 
proof  note that we already showed that no attack relation satisfies  mc  ext  for grounded or
ideal semantics  so  in the rest of the proof  we only need to consider stable  semi stable  preferred
and complete semantics 
let us first consider the attack relations rcu   ru   rd and rc   by using proposition     we
conclude that those relations violate  mc  ext  for stable  semi stable  preferred and complete
semantics 
it is obvious that relations rr and rc are symmetric  note that rdr is also symmetric  this
comes from the fact that     if and only if       if and only if      thus  proposition
   yields a conclusion that they do not satisfy  mc  ext  for neither of the considered acceptability
semantics 
let us now study the relation rrdu   let             and f    arg    rrdu    let
us define a set e of arguments as follows  e    a  arg     conc a     and conc a   
     and conc a      
prove that e is conflict free  let a  b  e and let arrdu b  whether arr b or ardu b is not
important  since in both cases  we obtain supp a   supp b      contradiction  since there are no
two formulae in  whose union is an inconsistent set  so e is a conflict free set 
suppose that a   arg     e  so  conc a      or conc a          or conc a      
in any of those cases  a  is attacked by at least one argument from e  namely by         or by
            or by         so  e is a stable extension  and consequently  semi stable 
preferred and complete extension  it is obvious that base e  is an inconsistent set  so by corollary  
we conclude that rrdu does not satisfy  mc  ext  for stable  semi stable  preferred and complete
semantics 

   discussion  related and future work
this paper identified and studied the large class of instantiations of dungs abstract theory corresponding to the maxi consistent operator  in other words  we studied the instantiations where every
extension of the argumentation system corresponds to exactly one maximal consistent subset of the
knowledge base  we proved properties of attack relations belonging to this class  they must be
conflict dependent  must not be valid  must not be conflict complete  must not be symmetric etc 
we also identified some attack relations serving as lower or upper bounds of the class  by using our
  

fii dentifying the c lass of m axi  c onsistent o perators in a rgumentation

results  we showed for all existing attack relations from the argumentation literature whether or not
they belong to this class  we also showed for the first time that an attack relation not depending on
arguments conclusions can return reasonable results  furthermore  we showed that such a relation
is a member of  mc  ext  class 
practical benefits of the work reported in this paper  and more generally  any work devoted to
studying the link between a class of instantiations of dungs theory and an operator  can be resumed
as follows 
 i  a case when an instantiation of dungs theory is shown to correspond to an existing operator 
first  such a work can help to validate an argumentation based approach by showing in which
cases it returns a result comparable with that of a non argumentation based approach  the possible
criticism of such an instantiation is that it is useless  since one can obtain the same result without
using argumentation  but  this is far from being true  namely  argumentation can be used for explanatory purposes  for example  if one wants to know why a certain conclusion is accepted  an
argument having that conclusion can be presented  that argument can be attacked by other arguments and so on  also  it might be possible to construct only a part of the argumentation graph
related to the argument in question  thus having a better knowledge representation  i e  ignoring the
parts of the knowledge base unrelated to the argument one wants to concentrate on  
the second benefit of this type of work is that it can help to reduce computational complexity
by using the simpler approach in the cases when the result obtained by an argumentation based approaches and a non argumentation based approaches is the same  please note that the work in this
category  capturing an operator with an instantiation of dungs theory  is far from being limited to
the case of the maxi consistent operator  as it was shown by vesic and van der torre        that
there exists a large class of instantiations of the abstract argumentation theory returning a consistent
result substantially different from the one returned by the maxi consistent operator 
 ii  a case when an instantiation of dungs theory does not correspond to any existing operator 
working on the links between instantiations of dungs theory and operators can be even more
beneficial in the case when an instantiation of the abstract argumentation theory does not corresponding to any known operator happens to be found  we distinguish three possible situations 
 a  a case when an instantiation calculates a useful result which can be obtained by an operator  but that operator was unknown until now  in such a case  a new operator is discovered thanks to
argumentation  the question is then  in which situations to use argumentative approach  and when
to apply the operator  the answer depends on the balance between the need for computational
efficiency  which we conjecture is often on the side of the approach directly applying the operator 
and the need to represent knowledge in a format that is easy to grasp  argue and justify an accepted
piece of knowledge  which are the usual advantages of argumentation 
 b  a case when an instantiation of dungs abstract theory returns a useful result which cannot
be obtained by any operator  recall that an operator is a function that  for every finite knowledge
base  returns a set of its subsets  but  an argumentative approach could return a result that cannot
be represented in that form  for instance  if an argument      is in an extension  whereas      is
not  with       thus  the expressive power of the operator based approach might be not enough
to distinguish those subtleties  a very important question of how to define such an instantiation is
still open  another relevant issue is to see in which context such instantiations make sense and how
they can be applied

 c  a case when an instantiation returns a bad result  this class regroups a set of instantiations
representing a behaviour one would like to avoid  the general question  how to distinguish useful
from bad instantiations  is certainly a hard one  apart from a scientific debate  evaluation can
include tests on a set of benchmark examples  note that the limits of testing a reasoning formalism
on a set of benchmark examples have been pointed out by vreeswijk         another  more principled  and more demanding  way to proceed is to define a set of postulates to be satisfied by an
argumentation formalism  caminada   amgoud        caminada  carnielli    dunne        
as a remark  note that the fact that an instantiation may return an inconsistent result  does not
mean that it is completely useless  namely  there might be cases when arguments are constructed
from an inconsistent knowledge base  and when one resolves just some of the existing inconsistencies by an argumentative approach  and then applies another inconsistency tolerant approach 
also  inconsistency handling is not the only use of argumentation  thus  still in the same setting 
a drastic case would be to first use argumentation for another purpose  not dealing with at all with
inconsistencies  and then apply a different approach to reason with inconsistency 
we now review the related work  maxi consistent sets play a major role in the characterization of various forms of non classical logical reasoning  bochman        and in belief revision
 alchourron  gardenfors    makinson         the remainder of the section considers the papers
having a link with argumentation 
the paper by cayrol        is one of the early works relating the results obtained directly from
a knowledge base and by using an argumentative approach  in that paper  it was shown that direct
undercut satisfies  mc  ext  for stable semantics  but no results for other semantics or attack
relations were provided  we not only studied other attack relations and other semantics  but also
provided a general study of properties an attack relation satisfying  mc  ext  must also satisfy 
amgoud and vesic        generalised the result by cayrol        for the case of prioritised
knowledge base  by showing that arg is a bijection between preferred sub theories  brewka        
which generalise maximal consistent sets in case of prioritised knowledge base  and stable extensions of the corresponding preference based argumentation system using direct undercut as an
attack relation and the weakest link principle as a preference relation 
amgoud and besnard              also studied the link between a knowledge base and the corresponding argumentation system  those papers introduced some important notions like conflictdependence and validity of an attack relation and proved numerous results related to consistency in
the underlying logic  however  note that the criterion  mc  ext  was neither defined nor studied
in those papers  they provided  amgoud   besnard        corollary    a link between mc   and
maximal conflict free sets of f    arg    r   furthermore  this result is proved under hypotheses which are impossible to satisfy  the attack relation should be both valid and conflict dependent 
which is impossible  as proved in proposition     some other results in that paper  amgoud  
besnard        e g  prop     are proved only for an attack relation which is both conflict dependent
and conflict sensitive  which is not the case for any of the well known attack relations  consequently  the majority of the negative results of those papers are only applicable to a minority of
attack relations  furthermore  examples in those papers are often incomplete systems  thus  it is
not surprising that there is no link between mc base a   and ext a  r  in those examples 
a recent paper by gorogiannis and hunter        studied the properties of attack relations
in the case when a dung style argumentation system is instantiated with classical propositional
logic  our work is related to those ideas  however  the focus of our paper is different  our main
goal is to study to which extent dungs theory can be used as a general framework for reasoning 
  

fii dentifying the c lass of m axi  c onsistent o perators in a rgumentation

on the technical side  we concentrate on studying the properties of the class of attack relations
satisfying  mc  ext  and identifying attack relations serving as lower and upper bounds of classes
of relations non satisfying  mc  ext  
one of the open questions is to find a set of conditions such that an attack relation satisfies
those conditions if and only if it satisfies  mc  ext   until recently  direct undercut and direct
defeat were the only known attack relations satisfying this condition  vesic         consequently  it
seemed that the space of attack relations satisfying this condition is rather narrow  note the similarity
between direct undercut and direct defeat   however  the present paper shows that rba also belongs
to  mc  ext   this indicating that the class of instantiations corresponding to the maxi consistent
operator is much larger 
the formal framework studied in this paper is that of classical propositional logic based argumentation  the vast majority of ideas and considerations from the present paper hold for other
instantiations of dungs theory  for example in the setting studied by modgil and prakken        
in other words  the result obtained from those argumentation frameworks could also be compared
with that obtained by an operator  after slightly adapting the definition of an operator  one can study
the same questions  is there a link between the result obtained from an argumentation system and
that obtained by an operator  from the same strict and defeasible rules   can argumentation help us
find new operators  are there argumentation systems returning a result that cannot be captured by
an operator  answering those questions will certainly be a part of our future work
