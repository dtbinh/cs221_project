abstract
we introduce the framework of qualitative optimization problems  or  simply  optimization problems  to represent preference theories  the formalism uses separate modules to
describe the space of outcomes to be compared  the generator   and the preferences on outcomes  the selector    we consider two types of optimization problems  they differ in the
way the generator  which we model by a propositional theory  is interpreted  by the standard propositional logic semantics  and by the equilibrium model  answer set  semantics 
under the latter interpretation of generators  optimization problems directly generalize
answer set optimization programs proposed previously  we study strong equivalence of
optimization problems  which guarantees their interchangeability within any larger context  we characterize several versions of strong equivalence obtained by restricting the
class of optimization problems that can be used as extensions and establish the complexity
of associated reasoning tasks  understanding strong equivalence is essential for modular
representation of optimization problems and rewriting techniques to simplify them without
changing their inherent properties 

   introduction
we introduce the framework of qualitative optimization problems in which  following the design of answer set optimization  aso  programs  brewka  niemela    truszczynski        
we use separate modules to describe the space of outcomes to be compared  the generator  
and the preferences on the outcomes  the selector    in all optimization problems we consider  the selector module follows the syntax and the semantics of preference modules in
aso programs  and the generator is given by a propositional theory  when this propositional theory is interpreted according to the standard propositional logic semantics  that is 
outcomes to be compared are classical models of the generator  we speak about classical optimization problems  co problems  for short   when the generator theory is interpreted by
the semantics of equilibrium models  pearce         we speak about answer set optimization
problems  aso problems  for short   we use this terminology  as equilibrium models are

usually referred to as answer sets  ferraris        for historical reasons  in aso problems 
the answer sets of the generator are the outcomes used to determine the optimal outcomes 
representing and reasoning about preferences in qualitative settings is an important
research area for knowledge representation and qualitative decision theory  the main objectives are to design expressive yet intuitive languages to model preferences  and to develop automated methods to reason about formal representations of preferences in these
languages  the literature on the subject of preferences is vast  we refer the reader to articles in the special issue of the artificial intelligence magazine  goldsmith   junker       
and to a recent monograph by kaci        for a thorough discussion of the area and for
additional references 
understanding when optimization problems are equivalent  in particular  when one can
be interchanged with another within any larger context  is fundamental to any preference
formalism  speaking informally  optimization problems p and q are interchangeable or
strongly equivalent when for every optimization problem r  context   p r and qr define
the same optimal models  understanding when one optimization problem is equivalent to
another in this sense is essential for preference analysis  modular preference representation 
and rewriting techniques to simplify optimization problems into forms more amenable to
processing  without changing any of their inherent properties  let us consider a multi agent
setting  in which agents combine their preferences on some set of alternatives with the goal
of identifying optimal ones  can one agent in the ensemble be replaced with another so that
the set of optimal alternatives is unaffected not only now  but also under any extension of
the ensemble in the future  strong equivalence of agents optimization problems is precisely
what is needed to guarantee this full interchangeability property 
the notion of strong equivalence is of general interest  by no means restricted to preference formalisms  in some cases  most notably for classical logic  it coincides with equivalence 
the property of having the same models  however  if the semantics is not monotone  that is 
extending the theory may introduce new models not only eliminate some  strong equivalence
becomes a strictly stronger concept  and the one to adopt if theories being analyzed are to be
placed within a larger context  the nonmonotonicity of the semantics is the salient feature
of nonmonotonic logics  marek   truszczynski        and strong equivalence of theories in
nonmonotonic logics  especially logic programming with the answer set semantics  gelfond
  lifschitz         was extensively studied in that setting  lifschitz  pearce    valverde 
      turner        eiter  fink    woltran      b   preference formalisms also often
behave nonmonotonically as adding a new preference may cause a non optimal outcome
 model  to become an optimal one  thus  in preference formalisms  equivalence and strong
equivalence are typically different notions  accordingly  strong equivalence was studied for
logic programs with rule preferences  faber   konczak         programs with ordered disjunction  faber  tompits    woltran        and programs with weak constraints  eiter 
faber  fink    woltran      a  
we extend the study of strong equivalence to the formalism of qualitative optimization
problems  the formalism is motivated by the design of answer set optimization  aso  programs of brewka et al          it borrows two key features from aso programs that make it
an attractive alternative to the preference modeling approaches based on logic programming
that we mentioned above  first  following aso programs  optimization problems provide
a clear separation of hard constraints  which specify the space of feasible outcomes  and
   

fistrong equivalence of qualitative optimization problems

preferences  soft constraints  that impose a preference ordering on feasible outcomes  second  optimization problems adopt the syntax and the semantics of preference rules of aso
programs that correspond closely to linguistic patterns of simple conditional preferences
used by humans 
the separation of preference modules from hard constraints facilitates eliciting and representing preferences  it is also important for characterizing strong equivalence  when a
clear separation is not present  like in logic programs with ordered disjunctions  brewka 
niemela    syrjanen         strong equivalence characterizations are cumbersome as they
have to account for complex and mostly implicit interactions between hard constraints
and preferences  for optimization problems  which impose the separation  we have onedimensional forms of strong equivalence  in which only hard constraints or only preferences
are added  these one dimensional concepts are easier to study yet provide enough information to construct characterizations for the general case 
main contributions 

our main contribution can be summarized as follows 

 we propose a general framework of qualitative optimization problems  extending in
several ways the formalism of aso programs  we focus on two important instantiations of the framework  the classes of classical optimization  co  problems and
answer set optimization  aso  problems  the latter one directly generalizes aso
programs 
 we identify the problem of strong equivalence for theories in general preference formalisms  we point out that strong equivalence and equivalence do not coincide  in
general  in preference formalisms and that it is the concept of strong equivalence
that is fundamental for such issues as theory modularity  rewriting and simplification  strong equivalence was studied earlier in the context of logic programs and logic
programs extended with preferences on rules or on atoms in the heads of rules  and
was similarly motivated   however  to the best of our knowledge  this is the first
paper that studies strong equivalence for a more typical preference formalism that
represents preferences in terms of preferred properties  modeled by formulas  and
independently of constraints defining outcomes to compare  as such  it is of more
relevance to the mainstream preference research than the previous studies 
 we characterize the concept of strong equivalence of optimization problems relative
to changing selector modules  the characterization is independent of the semantics
of generators and so  applies both to co and asp problems  we also characterize
strong equivalence relative to changing generators  with preferences fixed   in this
case  not surprisingly  the characterization depends on the semantics of generators 
however  we show that the dependence is quite uniform  and involves a characterization of strong equivalence of generators relative to their underlying semantics  when
they are considered on their own as propositional theories  finally  we combine the
characterizations of the one dimensional concepts of strong equivalence into a characterization of the general combined notion 
 we develop our results for the case when preferences are ranked  in practice  preferences are commonly ranked due to the hierarchical structure of preference providers 
   

fifaber  truszczynski    woltran

the general case we study allows for additions of preferences of ranks from a specified interval  i  j   this covers the case when only some segment in the hierarchy of
preference providers is allowed to add preferences  top decision makers  middle management  low level designers   as well as the case when there is no distinction between
the importance of preferences  the non ranked case  
 we establish the complexity of deciding whether two optimization problems are strongly equivalent relative to changing selectors  generators  or both  our results show that
these problems range from being co np  to p   complete 
organization  in the following section  we introduce the concept of an optimization
problem and the necessary terminology  and define all equivalence problems we are interested
in here  we also discuss the relationship of optimization problems to further formalisms
from the literature  in particular to aso programs  in section   we provide our results for
the case where selectors may vary but no new hard constraints are allowed  section   in
turn characterizes the strong equivalence notion  where preferences are unaffected but the
generator parts are subject to change  in section   we finally show how the characterizations
obtained in the previous sections have to be combined in order to capture the general case
of strong equivalence  our complexity analysis is presented in section    followed by a
discussion of our results and considerations about future directions of research 
we present proof sketches and some of the simpler and not overly technical proofs in the
main text to facilitate understanding of the results at the intuitive level  detailed proofs
can be found in the appendix

   optimization problems
in this section we provide the basic definitions of optimization problems in section     
followed in section     by definitions of the strong equivalence notions on optimization
problems that are studied in the remainder of the paper  finally  in section     we provide
a discussion on related formalisms 
    basic definitions
a qualitative optimization problem  an optimization problem  from now on  is an ordered
pair p    t  s   where t is called the generator and s the selector  the role of the
generator is to specify the family of outcomes to be compared  the role of the selector s
is to define a relation  on the set of outcomes and  consequently  define the notion of an
optimal outcome  the relation  induces relations   and   we define i   j if i  j and
j   i  and i  j if i  j and j  i  for an optimization problem p   we write p g and p s
to refer to its generator and selector  respectively 
generators  as generators we use propositional theories in the language determined by
a fixed countable universe  or alphabet  u of propositional variables that form atomic
propositions  a boolean constant   and boolean connectives    and   and where we
define the constant    and the connectives  and  in the usual way as           
   

fistrong equivalence of qualitative optimization problems

    and                 respectively   models of the generator  as defined
by the semantics used  represent outcomes of the corresponding optimization problem 
we consider two quite different semantics for generators  the classical propositional logic
semantics and the semantics of equilibrium models  pearce         thus  outcomes are
either models or equilibrium models  depending on the semantics chosen  the first semantics
is of interest due to the fundamental role and widespread use of classical propositional logic 
in particular  as a means to describe constraints  equilibrium models generalize answer sets
of logic programs to the case of arbitrary propositional theories  pearce        ferraris       
and are often referred to as answer sets  the semantics of equilibrium models is important
due to the demonstrated effectiveness of logic programming with the semantics of answer
sets for knowledge representation applications  we use the terms equilibrium models and
answer sets interchangeably 
throughout the paper  we represent interpretations as subsets of u  which contain
exactly those atomic propositions that are interpreted as true  we write i     to state that
an interpretation i  u is a  classical propositional  model of a formula   furthermore 
we denote the set of classical models of a formula or theory t by mod  t   
equilibrium models arise in the context of the propositional logic of here and there  or
the logic ht for short  heyting         we briefly recall here definitions of concepts  as
well as properties of the logic ht that are directly relevant to our work  we refer to the
papers by pearce        and ferraris        for further details 
the logic ht is a logic located between the intuitionistic and the classical logics  interpretations in the logic ht are pairs hi  ji of standard propositional interpretations such
that i  j  we write hi  ji   ht  to denote that a formula  holds in an interpretation
hi  ji in the logic ht  the relation   ht is defined recursively as follows 
   hi  ji    ht 
   for an atom a  hi  ji   ht a precisely when a  i
   hi  ji   ht    if hi  ji   ht  or hi  ji   ht 
   hi  ji   ht    if hi  ji   ht  and hi  ji   ht 
   hi  ji   ht    if j        classical satisfiability   and hi  ji    ht  or
hi  ji   ht  
an equilibrium model or answer set of a propositional theory t is a standard interpretation i such that hi  ii   ht t and for every proper subset j of i  hj  ii    ht t   answer
sets of a propositional theory t are also classical models of t   the converse is not true in
general  we denote the set of all answer sets of a theory t by as  t    and the set of all
ht models of t by modht  t    that is  modht  t      hi  ji   i  j  hi  ji   ht t   
for each of the semantics there are two natural concepts of equivalence  two theories t 
and t  are equivalent if they have the same models  classical or equilibrium  respectively  
they are strongly equivalent if for every theory s  t   s and t   s have the same models
 again  classical or equilibrium  respectively  
   while the choice of primitive connectives is not common for the language of classical propositional logic 
it is standard for the of logic here and there which underlies the answer set semantics 

   

fifaber  truszczynski    woltran

for classical semantics  strong equivalence and equivalence coincide  it is not so for
the semantics of equilibrium models  the result by lifschitz et al         states that two
theories t  and t  are strongly equivalent for equilibrium models if and only if t  and t 
are equivalent in the logic ht  that is  modht  t      modht  t     we will now illustrate the
notions of ht models and equilibrium models  and relate the latter to the classical ones 
here and in all other examples  we consider only classical and ht models over the alphabet
consisting of atoms explicitly mentioned in the theories discussed  that is sufficient to
determine all equilibrium models on the one hand  which happen to consist only of atoms
that are mentioned  and  on the other  to show that they differ from classical ones 
example   let us consider the theory ta    a  a   the classical models of ta  under the
restriction mentioned above  are  and  a   so a being true and a being false are both possible
outcomes  the ht models  again  under the same restriction  are h  i  h   a i  and
h a    a i  hence  there is only one answer set  equilibrium model    the other possible
candidate   a   is not an answer set  while h a    a i   ht ta holds  also h   a i   ht ta
does  thus  intuitively  the theory does not contain any cause for a to hold 
next  let us consider the theory tb    ab   the classical models are  a    b  and  a  b  
and the ht models are h a    a i  h b    b i  h a    a  b i  h b    a  b i and h a  b    a  b i 
the answer sets are therefore  a  and  b   but not  a  b   again the intuition is that the
theory does not contain a cause for a and b to hold simultaneously 
finally  let us consider the theory tc     a  b    b  a    the classical models
are the same as for tb   that is  mod  tc       a    b    a  b    we also have modht  tc    
 h a    a i  h b    b i  h a    a  b i  h b    a  b i  h a  b    a  b i  h   a  b i    modht  tb  
 h   a  b i   the answer sets are again the same as for tb   as  tc       a    b   
we observe that tb and tc are equivalent for both the classical and equilibrium setting
 they have the same classical and equilibrium models   the former implies that they are
also strongly equivalent in the classical setting  however  they are not strongly equivalent in
the equilibrium setting because modht  tb      modht  tc    cf  the characterization of strong
equivalence under the equilibrium semantics by lifschitz et al           and indeed  for
s    a  b  b  a   we obtain as  tb  s      a  b    while as  tc  s     
we recall that optimization problems under the classical interpretation of generators
are referred to as classical optimization problems or co problems  and when we use the
answer set semantics for generators  we speak about answer set optimization problems or
aso problems 
selectors  we follow the definitions of preference modules in aso programs  brewka
et al          adjusting the terminology to our more general setting  a selector is a finite
set of ranked preference rules
j
         k  
   
where k and j are positive integers  and i      i  k  and  are propositional formulas
over u  for a rule r of the form      the number j is the rank of r  denoted by rank  r  
hd  r                 k   is the head of r and  is the body  the condition  of r  bd  r   moreover 
we write hd i  r  to refer to formula i  
if rank  r      for every preference rule r in a selector s  then s is a simple selector 
 
otherwise  s is ranked  we often omit   from the notation  for simple selectors  for
   

fistrong equivalence of qualitative optimization problems

a selector s  and i  j                        we define s i j     r  s   i  rank  r   j 
 where we assume that for every integer k  k     and write  i  j  for the rank interval
 k   k an integer  i  k  j   we extend this notation to optimization problems  for
p    t  s  and a rank interval  i  j   we set p i j     t  s i j     for some rank intervals we
use shorthands  for example   i for  i  i     i for     i       i for  i     and similar 
for an interpretation i  a satisfaction
degree of a preference rule r is vi  r    min i   i   
w
hd i  r    if i    bd  r  and i    hd  r   otherwise  the rule is irrelevant to i  and vi  r      
intuitively  the lower the satisfaction degree the better the outcome  thus  a preference
rule          k   can informally be read as follows  irrelevant outcomes  those
not satisfying   or not satisfying any i   and outcomes satisfying   are most preferred 
followed by outcomes satisfying     and then outcomes satisfying     etc  we note that
brewka et al         represented the satisfaction degree of an irrelevant rule by a special
non numeric degree  treated as being equivalent to    the difference is immaterial and the
two approaches are equivalent 
selectors determine a preference relation on interpretations  given interpretations i
and j and a simple selector s  i s j holds precisely when for all r  s  vi  r   vj  r  
therefore  i  s j holds if and only if i s j and there exists r  s such that vi  r    vj  r  
i s j holds if and only if for every r  s  vi  r    vj  r  
given a ranked selector s  we define i s j if for every preference rule r  s  vi  r   
vj  r   or if there is a rule r   s such that the following three conditions hold 
   vi  r      vj  r   
   for every r  s of the same rank as r    vi  r   vj  r 
   for every r  s of smaller rank than r    vi  r    vj  r  
moreover  i  s j if and only if there is a rule r  for which the three conditions above hold 
and i s j if and only if for every r  s  vi  r    vj  r   given an optimization problem
p    t  s   we often write p for s  and similarly for   and    furthermore  for a set
v   u and a relation   like      or   over  u   we write v for the restriction of  to
v   that is  v     a  b      a  b  v    the relationship between equalities of     
and  of two optimization problems is as follows 
lemma   for all optimization problems p and q  and every set v   u   pv   q

some aspects of aso selectors require additional discussion  first  a preference rule
may be irrelevant to an outcome  this is the case when the outcome does not satisfy the
condition of a rule or  when it does  if it does not satisfy any formula in the head of the
rule  in such cases  we define the outcome to be most desirable with respect to the rule 
in making this choice  we followed the original definition  brewka et al          modulo a
   

fifaber  truszczynski    woltran

minor simplification mentioned earlier   obviously  other choices could be considered  too 
for instance  we could define irrelevant outcomes to be the least desirable with respect to
the rule  we could also restrict attention only to selectors that do no permit irrelevance at
all  a preference rule does not allow irrelevance if it has no body and if the disjunction of
all options in the head is a tautology   this would eliminate the need to address that issue
altogether  however  at the price of a more constraining definintion of selector rules 
ultimately  the question what is the right design choice here is of secondary importance
as the semantics of preference rules we adopted provides us the flexibility to represent other
possible definitions  in particular  we note that the semantics of the rule
            n  
is the same as that of the rule
               n     
in other words  the conditions  the rule bodies  are only a modeling device making preference
rules better correspond to conditional preferences expressed in natural language  they can
be compiled away  as for the second type of irrelevance  the formalism of selectors allows
the user to override the default we adopted  we can make our adopted design choice explicit 
that is  making outcomes not satisfying any of the options in the head explicitly the most
desirable  intuitively  it is sufficient to rewrite the rule  without body  since bodies can be
removed  as shown earlier 
            n 
to
              n             n  
or  equivalently 
              n             n 
while the following rewriting makes them least desirable 
            n             n    
or  equivalently 
            n             n      
another question concerns rules with only one option in the head  intuitively  given
our semantics they should not be important  because their satisfaction degree is always   
indeed  corollary    later in the paper provides a formal result that confirms this statement 
optimal  preferred  outcomes  for an optimization problem p    p   denotes the set
of all outcomes of p   that is  the set of all models  under the selected semantics  of the
generator of p   thus   p   stands for all models of p in the framework of co problems
and for all answer sets of p   when aso problems are considered  a model i   p   is
optimal or preferred for p if there is no model j   p   such that j  p i  we denote the
set of all preferred models of p by  p   
the following lemma asserts that if the preference relation of two optimization problems
is equal on their sets of outcomes  then the preferred models coincide  this result follows
   

fistrong equivalence of qualitative optimization problems

immediately from the definitions and will be useful in the sequel  its statement brings up a
subtle notational issue  formally  a  strict  preorder is a pair  d      where d is a set  the
domain of the preorder  and   is a transitive acyclic binary relation on d  the preorder
relation   two preorders are equal if they have the same domain and the same relation on
that domain  typically  whenever the domain is understood  we refer to preorders just by
pointing to their relation symbols  often  however  we write  d for the preorder relation
symbol to make the domain explicit in the notation  this is what we do in the statement
of the result below 
lemma   let p and q be optimization problems with  p p      q
 q    then   p      q  
proof 
as observed above  the equality of preorders implies the equality of the domains  in our case  the equality  p p      q
 q  implies  p      q   hence  for each
p
q
i  j   p      q   i   j iff i   j  the result follows now directly from the definition
of preferred outcomes   
we also observe that eliminating rules of large ranks can only make unpreferred outcomes preferred  and never make preferred outcomes unpreferred  we recall that  for a
given optimization problem p    t  s   p i   p   i      t  s   i     is the corresponding
optimization problem with all rules with rank i or higher removed 
lemma   for every optimization problem p and every i      p i     p   
proof  let us assume that i 
   p i    in case i 
   p i    we have i 
   p    and i 
   p  
p
 i
follows  otherwise  there is an interpretation j   p i   such that j  
i  thus  there
s   say of rank j  such that  i  v  r    v  r    ii  for every r    p s with the
is a rule r  p i
j
i
 i
s with rank less then j  v  r       v  r     
rank j  vj  r     vi  r     and  iii  for every r   p i
j
i
we note that  since  p i      p    j   p    moreover  j   i and so the sets of rules
s coincide  thus  j  p i follows and 
with ranks less than or equal to j in p s and p i
consequently  i 
   p     

    notions of equivalence
we define the union of optimization problems as expected  that is  for p     t    s    and
p     t    s     we set p   p     t   t    s   s     two optimization problems p  and
p  are strongly equivalent with respect to a class r of optimization problems  referred
to as a class of contexts or simply contexts  if for every optimization problem r  r 
 p   r     p   r  
we consider three general classes of contexts  first and foremost  we are interested in
the class lu of all optimization problems over u  we also consider the families lgu and
lsu of all optimization problems of the form  t    and    s   respectively  the first class
consists of optimization problems which  when added to any other problem  can affect the
set of feasible outcomes but cannot affect the preference relation  we call such optimization
problems generator problems  the second class consists of optimization problems which 
when added to any other problem  do not change the set of feasible outcomes but change
   

fifaber  truszczynski    woltran

 in general  the preference relation  we call such optimization problems selector problems 
these one dimensional contexts provide essential insights into the general case  for these
two classes  we speak of strong gen equivalence  denoted g   and strong sel equivalence 
denoted s   respectively  for the general class lu of all optimization problems we simply
speak of strong equivalence  denoted sg  
we recall that the notion of strong equivalence is  by definition  underlying the replacement property  in fact  for an optimization problem p    t  s  containing a subproblem
q    t     s      i e  t    t and s    s  we can guarantee that q can be replaced in p
by another subproblem r without changing the optimal outcomes  if q sg r  indeed  if
q sg r holds  one can faithfully replace q by r in any optimization problem  otherwise
we would have  q  p         r  p     for some p    lu   
constraining ranks of rules in selectors gives rise to additional classes of contexts parameterized by rank intervals  i  j

the first class of contexts gives rise to strong sel equivalence with respect to rules of

in the class lu   lu simple optimization problems 
    relation to other preference formalisms
optimization problems are most closely related to aso programs  brewka et al         
the formalism of optimization problems extends aso programs in several ways  first 
the generators of optimization problems are arbitrary propositional theories  under the
semantics of equilibrium models  the generators properly extend logic programs with the
answer set semantics  which are used as generators in aso programs  second  the selectors
of optimization problems use arbitrary propositional formulas in the heads of preference
rules  as well as for conditions in their bodies  which again generalizes the selectors of
aso programs  finally  optimization problems explicitly allow for alternative semantics of
generators  a possibility mentioned but not pursued by brewka et al         
as we already noted in the introduction there is vast literature on preference representation and reasoning  the special issue of artificial intelligence magazine  goldsmith  
junker        and the monograph by kaci        are two comprehensive sources of relevant
references  for a survey on preference approaches on top of nonmonotonic formalisms  see
delgrande  schaub  tompits    wang         discussing it goes beyond the scope of the
present paper  especially as the problem that we focus on here  strong equivalence  has
not been considered much in the preference research before  and there are essentially no
relevant earlier results except those we already mentioned in the introduction  faber  
konczak        faber et al         eiter et al       a   nevertheless  since our work uses
the preference formalism of aso problems  an extension of the formalism of aso programs
by brewka et al         that has not received as much attention in the preference research
as some others  we will make a few comments on our choice 
   

fistrong equivalence of qualitative optimization problems

first  aso problems are explicit about the constraints that must not be violated  the
generator part  and preferences  that is  weaker constraints that only make some outcomes
more desirable than others  the selector part   in that aso problems match well with practical settings  as typically both kinds of constraints are at play  for instance  in a product
configuration problem there are physical constraints limiting the space of available possibilities  not every type of engine can be put in a small family sedan  moon roof is not available
with the basic engine option  etc    as well as user preferences that describe what the user
would like to have if possible  preferential reasoning  optimization  in the presence of  hard 
constraints has received substantial attention  a representative approach in which cp nets
 boutilier  brafman  domshlak  hoos    poole        are combined with constraints was
described in the paper by boutilier  brafman  domshlak  hoos  and poole        
the choice of propositional logic to represent constraints  the generator part in our formalism  is standard  however  in contrast with other approaches  in addition to the classical
semantics we also consider an appealing alternative  the semantics of answer sets  this is
important as the resulting formalism of answer set programming  marek   truszczynski 
      niemela        is steadily gaining on acceptance as a constraint language and is
supported by ever improving computational tools  calimeri  ianni  krennwallner    ricca 
      
on the other hand  our choice of the formalism for the selector part is less obvious 
there are several reasons that motivated us  the first  and the one we already mentioned
earlier  is that preference rules have a natural reading agreeing well with the linguistic
patterns that humans use when formulating qualitative conditional preferences  second 
as demonstrated in the original work where aso selectors were introduced  brewka et al  
       they can be used to approximate preference relations that are defined by cp nets
 boutilier et al          one of the most broadly studied qualitative preference systems 
but has better computational properties  for instance  the dominance problem is in p
as opposed to being np hard or even pspace complete for some generalized classes of
cp nets  goldsmith  lang  truszczynski    wilson        
third  individual preference rules are closely related to one of the standard approaches
to representing preferences based on possibilistic logic  in that approach  we only give the
most basic details here  for a more comprehensive discussion we refer to kaci        ch 
        a preference theory consists of formulas  each with a distinct rank  the assumption
that ranks are distinct is not limiting as formulas with repeating ranks can be conjuncted
into a single formula of that rank   the quality of an outcome is given by its score defined
as the minimum rank of a formula that the outcome does not satisfy    if all formulas are
satisfied   the higher the score  the better the outcome  let              n   be a preference
theory  with the index i in i representing the rank of i   it is clear that the preference
semantics of that theory as described above is precisely captured by our preference rule
n   n                  
where i             i   for i              n  thus  aso problems subsume the preference
formalism based on possibilistic logic 
finally  the selector part of aso problems typically consists of several preference rules
and these rules may have different ranks  that allows us to model preferences coming from
different sources and having different importance  in such cases  the main issue is that
   

fifaber  truszczynski    woltran

of integrating these individual preferences into a single order  there is no single broadly
accepted way to do so  the approach used by our formalism boils down to the pareto
principle  arguably the common core of all such integration principles  accordingly  our
formalism allows conflicting rules in the selector  for instance  a   b  and b   a   but
leaves such conflicts unresolved resulting in incomparability  as for the ranks  the lower the
rank  the more important the rule is  rules of less importance are used to compare outcomes
only if the rules of more importance do not distinguish them  this way of handling ranks
is natural and shows up in many preference formalisms 
one prominent example in this context is prioritized  propositional  circumscription
 lifschitz         where minimization  of certain atoms in models of a formula  is defined
with respect to classes of atoms of different priority  formally  let t be a theory over
atoms a and  p            pn   v  f   be a partition on a  then  a model m  mod  t   is called
 p            pn   v  f   minimal if there is no n  mod  t    such that  i  n   p       pi     
m   p       pi    and n  pi  m  pi for some   si  n  and  ii  n  f   m  f   the
intuition behind the definition is that atoms in p   i pi are to be minimized  with the
assignments to v allowed to vary  while assignments to f are to be kept fixed  atoms in p
are minimized such that those in p  have the highest priority followed by those in p    etc 
the relation to ranks is quite obvious  one can show that the  p            pn   v  f   minimal
models of a theory t coincide with the preferred outcomes of the co problem x    t  s  
where the selector s is given by
 

 

s    f   f      f  f     f   f      f  f  
i

  p   p      p  pi      i  n   
indeed preference rules in the first two sets ensure that only interpretations with the same
fixed part are comparable  and preference rules in the last group precisely reflect the prioritized process of minimization of atoms in p          pn  
let us just finally mention here that our formalism of optimization problems gives not
only a handle for classical prioritized circumscription  but also for circumscription put on
top of logic programs  this is not meaningless  as in the forms currently prevalent in answer
set programming  answer sets are not necessarily minimal models  see for instance simons 
niemela    soininen         to this end it suffices to apply the embedding using aso
problems instead of co problems 

   strong sel equivalence
we start by analyzing the case of strong sel equivalence that turns out to be the core case
for our study  indeed  characterizations of strong sel equivalence naturally imply characterizations for the general case thanks to the following simple observation 
proposition   let p and q be optimization problems  either under classical or answer set
s  i j 
semantics for the generators  and  i  j  a rank interval  then p g
q if and only if for
every generator r  lgu   p  r s  i j  q  r 
s  i j 

proof     let r  lgu   since p g

s  i j 

q  p  r g
   

q  r and so  p  r s  i j  q  r 

fistrong equivalence of qualitative optimization problems

 i j 

   let r be any optimization problem in lu   we have p r    p  rg        rs   and
qr    q rg        rs    moreover  by the assumption we have that p  rg     s  i j 
q   rg      thus 
  p   rg          rs        q   rg          rs    
s  i j 

it follows that  p  r     q  r  and  consequently  that p g

q   

furthermore  the set of outcomes of an optimization problem p is unaffected by changes
in the selector module  it follows that the choice of the semantics for generators does not
matter for characterizations of strong sel equivalence  thus  whenever in this section we
refer to the set of outcomes of an optimization problem p   we use the notation  p    and
not the more specific one  mod  p g   or as  p g    that applies to co and aso problems 
respectively 
to formally state the subsequent results  we need one more auxiliary notation  for an
optimization problem p   we define diff p  i  j  to be the largest k such that i p k j  if
for every k we have i p k j  then we set diff p  i  j      it is clear that diff p  i  j  is
well defined  moreover  as i p   j  diff p  i  j      the following lemma characterizes
the relation  p q for ranked optimization problems p and q 
lemma   let p and q be optimization problems  and i  j be interpretations  then 
i  p q j holds if and only if one of the following conditions holds 
   diff p  i  j    diff q  i  j  and i  p j 
   diff p  i  j    diff q  i  j  and i  q j 
   diff p  i  j    diff q  i  j   i  p j and i  q j 
proof  the if direction is evident  to prove the only if direction  we note that the
cases diff p  i  j    diff q  i  j  and diff p  i  j    diff q  i  j  are obvious  too  thus  let us
assume diff p  i  j    diff q  i  j    i  clearly  i     otherwise  i p q j  contrary to the
assumption   it follows that for every rule r  p s  qs of rank less than i  vi  r    vj  r  
next  for every r  p s  qs of rank i  vi  r   vj  r   finally  there are rules r  p s and
r   qs   each of rank i such that vi  r     vj  r  and vi  r       vj  r     since diff p  i  j    i
and diff q  i  j    i   it follows that vi  r    vj  r  and vi  r      vj  r     thus  i  p j and
i  q j  as needed   
our first main result concerns strong sel equivalence relative to selectors consisting of
preference rules of ranks in a rank interval  i  j   special cases for strong sel equivalence will
follow as corollaries 
considering strong sel equivalence means that preference rules may be added to optimization problems  there are three main effects of doing so  outcomes that are equally good
may become strictly comparable  strict comparability may be turned into incomparability 
and the order of strict comparability may be reversed  to illustrate these phenomena  we
show how they may affect strong sel equivalence using the forthcoming examples  importantly  they lead us towards conditions that are necessary for strong sel equivalence and
that motivate our characterization of that property that we formally state in theorem   
   

fifaber  truszczynski    woltran

example   let p     t    s     where t  is a theory generating exactly two outcomes  a 
and  b   for example  a  b   and s     is empty  clearly   p        a    b    because
 a  and  b  are equally good with respect to p    it is possible to make them comparable
i
by adding new preference rules  for example  let r        a   b     where i     now 
 a   p  r   b  and thus  p   r        a    it is evident that for any pair of equally good
interpretations i  j one can find a context consisting only of preference rules that will make
i strictly preferred to j  each new rule should have i at least as preferred as j and one of
them should strictly prefer i to j   and that the precise ranks in such a context are not of
importance 
example   let p     t    s     where t  is a theory generating exactly two outcomes  a 
i
and  b   and s     a   b   for some rank i     clearly   a   p   b  and therefore
 p        a    it is possible to make  a  and  b  incomparable by adding an appropriate
i
context  for example r        b   a     we obtain  a   
  p  r   b  and  b   
  p  r   a  
thus  p   r        a    b   
it is important to note that the rank of the context preference rule must be exactly equal
to the rank of the original preference rule in order to achieve this effect  otherwise one
preference rule would override the other  in general  for any pair of strictly comparable
interpretations i  j one can find an appropriate context that makes i and j incomparable 
but in contrast to example    the context must make use of rules of particular ranks 
example   let p     t    s     where t  is a theory admitting exactly two outcomes  a 
i
and  b   and s     a   b   for some rank i     clearly   a   p   b  and therefore
 p        a    it is possible to reverse the comparability of  a  and  b  by adding an
 
appropriate context  for example r        b   a     we obtain  b   p  r   a   thus
 p   r        b   
it is important to note that  in order to achieve this effect  the context must contain
preference rules of lower ranks than the preference rules that originally ordered i and j 
as that original ordering has to be overridden  this also means that the technique is not
applicable for preference rules of rank    in general  for any pair of strictly comparable
interpretations i  j  where the comparison stems from preference rules of rank      adding
any context consisting of preference rules of lower rank that reverse comparability of i and j
results in the reversed strict order  as in example    the context must make use of particular
ranks 
these three effects may be exploited in order to construct examples of problems that
are not strongly sel equivalent and suggest necessary conditions for strong sel equivalence 
the first effect can turn preferred outcomes into non preferred  while the second and third
can turn non preferred outcomes into preferred ones  the second and third effects imply
conditions that are more specialized  context that needs rules of particular ranks  
 

 

example   consider p     t     a   b    and q     t     a   b     where t  is a
theory admitting exactly two outcomes  a  and  b   we have  a   p   b    a   q   b  
and  p       q        a    the two problems are therefore equivalent  however  there is
   

fistrong equivalence of qualitative optimization problems

a discrepancy with respect to the ranks of the preference rules  which we can take advantage
of in order to show that the programs are not strongly sel equivalent 
 
let us consider the context r        b   a     this context exploits the second effect
mentioned above and makes  a  and  b  incomparable with respect to q  extended with
r    a    q  r   b  and  b    q  r   a   thus turning also  b  into a preferred outcome
 q   r        a    b    on the other hand  the new preference rule has no effect on p   
as its rank is weaker than that of the only preference rule of p    hence  p   r        a   
and therefore p   s    i  q  for all i    
analyzing this example  we can observe that what the context r  exploits is a difference
in the preferred outcomes when considering only preference rules of rank lower than   
indeed    p            a   and   q            a    b   
 

 

example   next  let us consider p    p     t     a   b    and q     t     a   b    
where t  is a theory admitting exactly two outcomes  a  and  b   we have  a   p   b  
 a   q   b   and  p       q        a    also here  we can observe that   p         
  a   and   q            a    b    the only difference to example   is that the preference
rule in q  is of rank   
also here it is possible to construct a context that witnesses that p  is not strongly sel 
 
equivalent to q    using only preference rules of rank    r        a   b   b   a    
here  we directly add conflicting preference rules that override the preference rule in q 
and are overridden by the preference rule in p    so  also here we get  p   r        a  
and  q   r        a    b    and p   s    i  q  for all i    
examples   and   motivate condition     of theorem    moreover  it is also rather easy
to see that any counterexample to p s  i j  q will involve only outcomes from  p i    
 q i    as no selector context in the rank interval  i  j  can make other outcomes preferred 
however  from a different point of view  condition     of theorem   is also fairly weak  as
it does not cover some easy cases of strong sel non equivalence  as shown in the following
example 
 

 

example   let us define p    p     t     a   b    and q     t     b   a     where t 
is a theory admitting exactly two outcomes  a  and  b   we have  a   p   b    b   q   a  
and  p        a       q        b    so p  and q  are not even equivalent  hence also
p   s  i j  q  for any rank interval  i  j   however    p            a    b   and   q         
  a    b    so condition     of theorem   is satisfied for rank intervals     j  
condition     of theorem   covers cases like the one in example    this example is
rather simple  as it does not even require a context in order to create a witness for strong
sel non equivalence  while in general one has to create a context in order to make certain
outcomes preferred  what remains to be considered are cases in which there is a discrepancy
stemming from preference rules inside the context rank interval 
 

 

example   let p     t     a   b    and q     t     a   b     where t  is a theory
admitting exactly two outcomes  a  and  b   this is the pair of problems p  and q  from
 
example     consider now the context r        b   a     unlike r  in example    this
   

fifaber  truszczynski    woltran

rule has rank    the context makes  a  and  b  incomparable with respect to the extended
p    a    p  r   b  and  b    p  r   a    thus turning  b  into a preferred outcome  and
keeping  a  as such  therefore   p   r        a    b    on the other hand  the new
preference rule overrides the one of q    turning  b  into a preferred outcome and making
 a  non preferred   q   r        b    therefore p   s    i  q  for all i    
unlike in example      p            q            a    b    so there is a different reason that allows for this counterexample  here  we observe that diff p    a    b         
diff q   a  b       which allows for adding an appropriate preference rule of rank    it is
important that we had to add a rule of one of the two differing ranks  indeed  there is
no context comprising only rules of rank one that can serve as a counterexample to strong
sel equivalence  and indeed p  s       q   
this finally motivates condition     of theorem    if there are two outcomes  as discussed
earlier  we can restrict ourselves to outcomes in  p i      q i   for a context rank interval
 i  j   which differ on ranks such that one of the ranks is inside the rank interval  we can use
constructions as in example   in order to obtain a counterexample to strong sel equivalence 
we can show that the three conditions of theorem   indeed do characterize strong selequivalence 
theorem   for all ranked optimization problems p and q  and every rank interval  i  j  
p s  i j  q if and only if the following conditions hold 
    p i      q i  
    p p i      q
 q i  
   for every i  j   p i   such that i   diff p  i  j  or i   diff q  i  j   diff p  i  j   
diff q  i  j  or both diff p  i  j    j and diff q  i  j    j 
the proof of this result is quite involved and requires several auxiliary properties  we
provide it in the appendix  together with proofs of our other main results  
next  we discuss some special cases of the characterization in theorem    first  we
consider the case i      which allows for a simplification of theorem   
corollary   for all ranked optimization problems p and q  and every rank interval     j  
p s    j  q if and only if the following conditions hold 
    p      q 
    p p      q
 q 
   for every i  j   p    diff p  i  j    diff q  i  j  or both diff p  i  j    j and diff q  i  j   
j 
proof  starting from theorem    we note that the selectors of p   and q   are empty and
hence  p        p   and  q        q   moreover  if the precondition i   diff p  i  j 
or i   diff q  i  j  in condition     of theorem   is not satisfied for i     and a pair
i  j   p    then one of diff p  i  j      and diff q  i  j      holds  and together with
   

fistrong equivalence of qualitative optimization problems

diff p  i  j    diff q  i  j  the consequent is satisfied in that case as well  which allows for
omitting the precondition   
if in addition j     we obtain the case of rank unrestricted selector contexts  and
condition     can be simplified once more  since diff p  i  j    j and diff q  i  j    j never
hold for j    
corollary   for all optimization problems p and q  p s q  equivalently  p s   q or
p s      q  if and only if the following conditions hold 
    p      q 
    p p      q
 q 
   for every i  j   p    diff p  i  j    diff q  i  j  
next  we note that if an optimization problem p is simple  all rules are of rank     then
diff p  i  j      if and only if diff p  i  j      which is equivalent to i p j  this observation leads to the following characterization of strong sel equivalence of simple optimization
problems 
corollary   for all simple optimization problems p and q  the following statements are
equivalent 
 a  p s q  equivalently  p s      q 
 b  p s    q  equivalently  p s       q 
 c   p      q  and p p    q

follows from conditions     and     of that corollary  indeed  let us consider i  j   p  
such that i p j and distinguish two cases  if  i  diff p  i  j      then i  p j and by
condition     of corollary    also i  q j  implying i q j  if  ii  diff p  i  j      then
by condition     of corollary    diff q  i  j       since p  q are simple  i q j  and
consequently i q j  by symmetry  we also have that i q j implies i p j  thus 
p p    q

diff p  i  j      for i  j   p    it follows that diff p  i  j     and thus i p p   j  since

for diff q  i  j      we reason analogously  in the last remaining case  diff p  i  j      and
diff q  i  j       thus  we directly obtain diff p  i  j    diff q  i  j   by corollary    p s q
follows

corollary   shows  in particular  that for simple problems there is no difference between
the relations s   and s      this property reflects the role of preference rules of rank  
and higher  they allow us to break ties among optimal outcomes  as defined by preference
rules of rank    thus  they can eliminate some of these outcomes from the family of optimal
ones  but they cannot introduce new optimal outcomes  therefore  they do not affect strong
sel equivalence of simple problems  this property has the following generalization to ranked
optimization problems 
corollary    let p and q be ranked optimization problems and let k be the maximum
rank of a preference rule in p  q  then the relations s k  equivalently  s  k     and
s  k  equivalently  s  k k    coincide 
proof  clearly  p s k q implies p s  k q  thus  it is enough to prove that if p s  k q
then p s k q  using the characterization of theorem    we observe that conditions    
and     for p s  k q and p s k q are the same  since p s  k q  we have that for
every i  j   p k   such that k   diff p  i  j  or k   diff q  i  j   diff p  i  j    diff q  i  j 
or both diff p  i  j    k and diff q  i  j    k  let us consider i  j   p k   such that
diff p  i  j    k  it follows that diff q  i  j    k  since k is the maximum rank of a preference rule in p or q  diff p  i  j     and diff q  i  j      thus  diff p  i  j    diff q  i  j  
the case diff q  i  j    k is similar and we obtain that for every i  j   p k   such that
k   diff p  i  j  or k   diff q  i  j   diff p  i  j    diff q  i  j   that property implies condition     for p s k q  thus  p s k q follows   
our observation on the role of preference rules with ranks higher than ranks of rules in
p or q also implies that p and q are strongly sel equivalent relative to selectors consisting
exclusively of such rules if and only if p and q are equivalent  have the same optimal
outcomes   and if optimal outcomes that tie in p also tie in q and conversely  formally 
we have the following result 
corollary    let p and q be ranked optimization problems and let k be the maximum
rank of a preference rule in p  q  then p s k   q if and only if  p      q  and
p p    q
 q   
proof  clearly  p k     p and q k     q and so   p k        p   and  q k      
 q   thus  the only if part follows by theorem    condition     of that theorem reduces
to  p      q  and condition     implies p p    q
 q     to prove the if part  we note
that condition     of theorem   holds by the assumption  moreover  the relations  p p   and
 q
 q  are empty and so  they coincide  thus  condition     of theorem   holds  finally  if
i  j   p    and diff p  i  j    k      then diff p  i  j     and so  i p j  by the assumption  i q j  that is  diff q  i  j       diff p  i  j   the case when diff q  i  j    k     is
similar  thus  condition     of theorem   holds  too  and p s k   q follows   
lastly  we give some simple examples illustrating how our results can be used to safely
modify or simplify optimization problems  that is rewrite one into another strongly selequivalent one 
   

fistrong equivalence of qualitative optimization problems

example   let p    t  s   where t    a  b  c   a  b    a  c    b  c   and s    a  
c   b   c    and p      t  s      where s      a  b   c    regarding these problems
as co problems  we have that  p      p         a    b    c    moreover  it is evident that
 
p p    p p       thus  by corollary    p and p   are strongly sel equivalent  in other words 
we can faithfully replace rules a   c   b   c  in the selector of any optimization problem
with generator t by the single rule a  b   c  
for an example of a more general principle  we note that removing preference rules with
only one formula in the head yields a problem that is strongly sel equivalent 
corollary    let p and q be two co or aso problems such that p g   qg and qs is
obtained from p s by removing all preference rules with only one formula in the head  i e  
rules r for which  hd  r         then p and q are strongly sel equivalent 
proof  conditions         of theorem   all follow from an observation that for every interpretation i and every preference rule r with  hd  r        vi  r        

   strong gen equivalence
we now focus on the case of strong gen equivalence  the semantics of generators makes
a difference here but the difference concerns only the fact that under the two semantics
we consider  the concepts of strong equivalence are different  other aspects of the characterizations are the same  specifically  generators have to be strongly equivalent relative to
the selected semantics  indeed  as the following example shows  if the generators are not
strongly equivalent  one can extend them uniformly so that after the extension one problem
has a single outcome  which is then trivially an optimal one  too  while the other one has
no outcomes and so  no optimal ones 
example    consider a co problem p     t    s     where t     a  b  and s     a  
b    there are two outcomes here   a  and  b   that is   p        a    b    let r be the
only preference rule in s    clearly  v a   r      and v b   r       thus   a   p   b  and so 
 p        a   
in addition  let q     t     s    be a co problem  where t      a  b  and s  is as
above  then   q        a   and  trivially   q        a    it follows that p  and q 
are equivalent  as they specify the same optimal outcomes  however  they are not strongly
gen equivalent  and so  also not strongly equivalent   indeed  let r      a      then
 p   r        b   and so   p   r        b    on the other hand   q   r       and 
therefore   q   r       
moreover  the preference relation   defined by the selectors of the problems considered
must coincide 
example    let p     t    s    be a co problem  where t     a  b  c   a  b    a 
c    b  c   and s     a   b   a   c    we have  p        a    b    c    and
 a   p   b    a   p   c   and  b  and  c  are incomparable  thus   p        a    let
   

fifaber  truszczynski    woltran

now q     t    s     be a co problem  where s      a   b   c    clearly   q       p     
  a    b    c    moreover   a   q   b   q   c   thus   q        a   and so  p  and q 
are equivalent  however  they are not strongly  gen  equivalent  indeed  let r      a     
then   p   r        b    c   but  p   r        b   
the main insight here is that differences in the preference relation may be hidden
by preferred outcomes but  if they are present  they can be exposed by eliminating the
preferred outcomes that obscure them with the appropriately selected generator context 
all of these considerations apply to both the co and aso problems  and therefore we
formulate a single theorem that handles both types of problems 
theorem    for all co  aso  respectively  problems p and q  p g q if and only if
p g and qg are strongly equivalent  that is  mod  p g     mod  q g   for co problems  and
modht  p g     modht  qg   for aso problems  and  pmod p g      q
mod q g    
in view of examples    and     the result is not unexpected  the two examples demonstrated that the conditions of the characterization cannot  in general  be weakened 
from corollary   and theorem     it follows that strong sel equivalence of co problems
is a stronger property than their strong gen equivalence 
corollary    for all co problems p and q  p s q implies p g q 
in general the implication in corollary    cannot be reversed  as shown in the following
example 
example    let us consider problems p      t     s     and q      t        where t    
 a  b  and s      a   b   b   a    we have  p        q         a    b   
moreover   a   p    b  and  b   p    a   thus   p         a    b    since qs    
  we also have  trivially  that  a  q    b   thus   q         a    b    too  and the
problems p   and q   are equivalent  they are not strongly sel equivalent  though  let
r         a   b     then  p    r     p   and so   p    r         a    b    on the
other hand   a   q   r    b   thus   q    r         a   
however  by virtue of theorem     they are strongly gen equivalent  indeed  trivially
g

mod  p  
    mod  q  
  and  writing m for mod  p  
    mod  q  
   the relations  pm   and
  
 q
m are both empty and therefore equal 
the relation between strong sel equivalence and strong gen equivalence of aso problem
is more complex  in general  neither property implies the other even if both problems p
and q are assumed to be simple  it is so because p s q if and only if as p g    
g

p
and  pmod p g     q
mod q g   does not imply as p g    as qg    
we conclude the section with one more corollary concerning strong gen equivalence of
problems with empty selectors 

   

fistrong equivalence of qualitative optimization problems

corollary    for all co  aso  respectively  problems p and q such that p s   qs    
p g q if and only if p g and qg are strongly equivalent under the respective semantics
 that is  mod  p g     mod  q g   for co problems  and modht  p g     modht  qg   for aso
problems  
the result is evident from the definitions  however  it is also an immediate consequence
of theorem     indeed  when optimization problems p and q have empty selectors  the cong
g
dition  pmod p g      q
mod q g   is equivalent to mod  p     mod  q    which is a consequence
of strong equivalence of p g and qg   thus  for problems with empty selectors the right
hand of the equivalence in the assertion of theorem    reduces to just strong equivalence
of the generators 

   strong equivalence  the combined case
finally  we consider the relation sg   which results from considering contexts that combine
both generators and selectors  since generators may vary here  as in the previous section 
the semantics of generators matters  but  as in the previous section  the difference boils
down to different characterizations of strong equivalence of generators 
we start with a result characterizing strong equivalence of co and aso problems
relative to combined contexts  both generators and selectors possibly non empty  with
selectors consisting of rules of rank at least i and at most j  respectively 
theorem    for all ranked co  aso  respectively  problems p and q  and every rank
s  i j 
interval  i  j   p g
q if and only if the following conditions hold 
   p g and qg are strongly equivalent  that is  mod  p g     mod  q g   for co problems 
and modht  p g     modht  qg   for aso problems 
    pmod p g      q
mod q g  
   for every i  j  mod  p g   such that i   diff p  i  j  or i   diff q  i  j   diff p  i  j   
diff q  i  j  or both diff p  i  j    j and diff q  i  j    j
p

q

 i
 i
    mod p
g      mod q g    

the corresponding characterizations for co and aso problems differ only in their respective conditions      which now reflect different conditions guaranteeing strong equivalence of generators under the classical and answer set semantics  moreover  the four conditions of theorem    can be obtained by suitably combining and extending the conditions
of theorem   and theorem     first  as combined strong equivalence implies strong genequivalence  condition     is taken from theorem     second  we modify conditions    
and     from theorem   replacing  p i   with mod  p g    and accordingly  q i   with
mod  qg     as each classical model of p g can give rise to an optimal classical or equilibrium
one upon the addition of a context  an aspect also already visible in theorem    
finally  we have to add a new condition stating that the relations  p i and  q i coincide
on the sets of models of p g and qg   when generators are allowed to be extended  one can
make any two of their models to be the only outcomes after the extension  if the two
   

fifaber  truszczynski    woltran

outcomes  say i and j  are related differently by the corresponding strict relations induced
by rules with ranks less than i  say i  p i j but not i  q i j  then i is optimal and j is
not optimal in the problem extending p no matter what preference rules of ranks from the
interval  i  j  we use  rules of rank i and higher have no effect on how i and j are ordered  
on the other hand  if i and j are incomparable by  q i   they remain incomparable after
q is extended  if i and j are equally good with respect to rules of rank   i  they can be
rendered incomparable by means of preference rules of rank i  in each case  j is optimal
after q is extended  finally  if j  q i i  then j remains optimal no matter what preference
rules of ranks i and higher we add  it follows that if the two relations  p i and  q i are
s  i j 
different  we cannot have p g
q and the condition     is necessary 
as in the previous section  the case when the selectors of p and q are empty reduces
to strong gen equivalence of the generators 
corollary    for all co  aso  respectively  problems p and q such that p s   qs  
s  i j 
  and for every rank interval  i  j   p g
q if and only if p g and qg are strongly
equivalent under the respective semantics  that is  mod  p g     mod  q g   for co problems 
and modht  p g     modht  qg   for aso problems  
the result is a simple consequence of theorem     the condition     in that theorem
implies that mod  p g     mod  q g   and so  since the selectors of p and q are empty  all the
remaining conditions become trivially true 
we conclude this section with observations concerning the relation sg for both co and
aso problems  the contexts relevant here may contain preference rules of arbitrary ranks 
we start with the case of co problems  where the results are stronger  while they can be
derived from the general theorems above  we will present here arguments relying on results
from previous sections  which is possible since for co problems equivalence and strong
equivalence of generators coincide 
we saw in the last section that for co problems s is a strictly stronger relation than
g   in fact  for co problems  s coincides with the general relation sg  
theorem    for all co problems p and q  p sg q if and only if p s q 
proof  the only if implication is evident  to prove the converse implication  we will
use proposition    which reduces checking for strong equivalence to checking for strong
sel equivalence  let r  lgu be a generator problem  since p s q  from corollary   we
have mod  p g     mod  qg    consequently  mod   p  r g     mod   q  r g    writing m
for mod  p g   and m   for mod   p  r g   we have m    m   thus  also by corollary   
qr
 pmr
    m     finally  condition     of corollary   for p and q implies condition     of
that corollary for p  r and q  r  as r has no preference rules and m    m    it follows 
again by corollary    that p  r s q  r  thus  by proposition    p sg q   
in the case of simple co problems and the ranked interval         the argument above
can be repeated using instead of corollary   the equivalence of  b  and  c  from corollary
   in this way  one can show that for simple co problems  the relations s   
and s   
g
coincide  thus  by corollary    the equivalence of  a  and  b   and theorem     for simple
co problems all four relations sg   s   
  s      and s coincide and we obtain the following
g
result 
   

fistrong equivalence of qualitative optimization problems

corollary    for all simple co problems p and q  all properties p sg q  p s   
q 
g
p s    q and p s q are equivalent 
for simple aso problems we still have that sg and s   
coincide but in general these
g
notions are different from s and s     cf  the subtle difference in condition  c  compared
to corollary    
corollary    for all simple aso problems p and q  the following conditions are equivalent
s

 b  p s   
q  equivalently  p g
g

q 

 c  modht  p g   modht  qg   and pmod p g     q
mod qg    
proof  the implication  a  b  is evident 
let us assume  b   by theorem     we have modht  p g   modht  qg    this identity
implies mod  p g     mod  qg    let us assume that for some i  j  mod  p g    i pmod p g   j 
q
if i  pmod p g   j then  by theorem     i  q
mod qg   j and so  i mod qg   j  otherwise 

i p j and so  diff p  i  j      by theorem     diff q  i  j       since q is simple 
diff q  i  j      thus  i q j and  also  i q
mod qg   j  the converse implication follows
by symmetry  thus   c  holds 
finally  we assume  c  and prove  a   to this end  we show that conditions        of
theorem    hold  directly from the assumptions  we have that condition     holds  condition     follows from lemma    moreover  we also have that mod  p g     mod  qg    to prove
condition      let us assume that i  j  mod  p g   and that diff p  i  j       since p is simple 
i p j  thus  i q j and  consequently  diff p  i  j       diff q  i  j   finally  condition

     i e   mod p
g      mod q g     obviously holds in case i     and mod  p     mod  q     

   complexity
in this section  we study the problems of deciding the various notions of strong equivalence 
typically the comparisons between sets of outcomes in the characterizations determine the
respective complexity  we start with results concerning strong sel equivalence 
theorem    given optimization problems p and q  deciding p s q is co np complete
in case of co problems and p   complete in case of aso problems 
proof   sketch  a detailed argument is provided in appendix b   for membership  we focus on
the complementary problem and consider pairs of interpretations i  j that violate at least
one of the conditions stated in corollary    clearly  if such a witness pair of interpretations
exists  there is also such a witness pair that is built only from atoms that occur in the
problems p and q  once such a pair is guessed  it can be verified in polynomial time  for
co problems  or in polynomial time using an np oracle  for aso problems  that it indeed
   

fifaber  truszczynski    woltran

violates the conjunction of the three conditions from corollary    the main observation is
that model checking is polynomial for the classical semantics  but co np complete for the
equilibrium semantics  see pearce  tompits    woltran        thm     
hardness follows from considering the equivalence problem for optimizations problems
with empty selectors  which is known to be co np hard  for classical semantics  and p  hard  for equilibrium semantics  see pearce et al         thm        
for the ranked case  we observe an increase in complexity  which can be explained by
the characterization given in theorem    instead of outcome checking  this characterization
involves optimal outcome checking  which is more difficult  unless the polynomial hierarchy
collapses  
theorem    given optimization problems p and q and a rank interval  i  j   deciding
p s  i j  q is p   complete in case of co problems and p   complete in case of aso
problems 
proof   sketch  a detailed argument is provided in appendix b   the membership part essentially follows the same arguments as the proof of theorem     but here the problem of
deciding i   p i   is in co np for co problems and in p  for aso problems 
for the hardness part  we reduce the following problem to sel equivalence of co problems  given two propositional theories s and t   decide whether they possess the same
minimal models  this problem is known to be p   complete  e g   eiter et al       b 
thm         and the problem remains hard if s and t are in negation normal form  nnf 
given over the same alphabet  we adapt a construction used by brewka et al          
given a negation normal form theory t   we construct a co problem pt by setting
ptg

  t  u u      u  u    u  u    and

pts

   u    u   u  u   

where u denotes the set of atoms occurring in t   and t  u u    stands for the theory
resulting from replacing all u by u  in t  we note that the ranks of rules in the selector
are    
the elements in  pt   are in a one to one correspondence to the minimal models of
t   for theories s and t over u it follows that s and t have the same minimal models if
and only if  ps      pt    since the problems ps and pt have the same selectors  that
latter condition is equivalent to ps s   pt  which can be shown directly or exploiting our
characterization of s     
concerning the hardness part for aso problems  we use the following problem  given
two open quantified boolean formulas  qbfs  y  x  y    y  x  y    decide whether they
possess the same minimal models  this problem is p   hard  see lemma    in appendix
a   for  x  y    we construct p as follows 
pg    z  z     z  x  y   
  y  y      w  w  y  w  y     y  y   
  z z      w  w  w  
ps    x    x   x  x  
   

fistrong equivalence of qualitative optimization problems

where  z z     stands for the formula obtained by replacing all z by z   in  x  y    again 
we stress that the ranks of rules in the selector are     the elements in  p   are in a
one to one correspondence to the minimal models of y  x  y    now we can reason as
above and show that for  and  over x  y   formulas y  x  y   and y  x  y   have
the same minimal models if and only if p s   p    
in theorem    the rank interval  i  j  is given as input  when fixing the interval  the
hardness results still hold  provided that i      in fact  the critical condition in corollary  
is  p i      q i    for rank intervals     j   the selectors become empty and the condition
is reduced to  p      q   which is easier to decide 
our characterizations imply that all the remaining problems are in co np  for strong
gen equivalence  co np hardness follows directly from theorem    and co np completeness
of deciding strong equivalence between two propositional theories  for both semantics  
theorem    given two co  aso  respectively  problems p and q  deciding p g q is
co np complete 
finally  for the combined case the hardness result follows from theorem    and co npcompleteness of deciding strong equivalence of propositional theories 
theorem    given ranked co  aso  respectively  problems p and q  and rank interval
s  i j 
 i  j   deciding p g
q is co np complete 
by construction  all hardness results hold already for simple optimization problems 

   discussion
we introduced the formalism of optimization problems  generalizing the principles of aso
programs  in particular  the separation of hard and soft constraints  brewka et al         
we focused on two important specializations of optimization problems  co problems and
aso problems  we studied various forms of strong equivalence for these classes of optimization problems  depending on what contexts are considered  specifically  we considered
the following cases  new preference information is added  but the hard constraints remain unchanged  strong sel equivalence   hard constraints are added but preferences remain
unchanged  strong gen equivalence   both hard constraints and preferences can be added
 strong equivalence   to the best of our knowledge  this natural classification of equivalences in preference formalisms has not been studied yet  in certain cases some of these
notions coincide  theorem     but this is no longer true when the underlying semantics is
changed or ranks in contexts are restricted 
in previous work  the notion of strong equivalence  both hard constraints and preferences
can be added  has been studied for logic programs with weak constraints by eiter et al  
     a  and logic programs with ordered disjunctions  lpods  by faber et al          
while for the former formalism  a separation of strong equivalence into different notions
 as suggested here for aso problems  would be possible  it is instructive to compare
eiter et al       a  lemma     to our results  e g   corollary      a similar separation for
strong equivalence is not straightforward for lpods  the reason is the syntactic nature of
lpod rules which act like hard constraints and preference rules at the same time  faber et
   

fifaber  truszczynski    woltran

al          considered strong equivalence with respect to contexts that are logic programs
 which is similar to strong gen equivalence  and the combined case of strong equivalence
 called strong equivalence for arbitrary contexts there   but they did not consider any
counterpart to the notion of strong sel equivalence  in fact  it is even unclear whether in
every lpod the generating and selecting modules can be cleanly separated 
in our paper  we established characterizations of all three types of strong equivalence 
they exhibit striking similarities  the characterizations of strong sel equivalence for co
and aso problems in theorem   are precisely the same  mirroring the fact that generators are not subject to change  theorem    concerns strong gen equivalence for co and
aso problems  in each case  the characterizations consist of two requirements  the strong
equivalence of generators  and the equality of the strict preference relations restricted to
the class of models of the generators  the only difference comes from the fact that strong
equivalence for classical and the equilibrium model semantics have different characterizations  theorem    which concerns the combined case of strong equivalence also does not
differentiate between co and aso problems other than implicitly  as before  the conditions
of strong equivalence are different for the two semantics   moreover  the characterizations
provided by theorem    arise in a rather systematic way from those given in theorems  
and     this being the case in each of the different semantics we used strongly suggests that
there are some abstract principles at play here  we are currently pursuing this direction 
conjecturing that this is an inherent feature of preference formalisms with separation of
logical and preferential constraints 
coming back to lpods  these comments suggest that identifying a split representation for that formalism might be of interest  it could lead to alternative characterizations of  combined  strong equivalence derived from the characterizations of the two
one dimensional variants 
next  we note that our results give rise to problem rewriting methods that transform
optimization problems into strongly equivalent ones  we provided two simple examples
illustrating that application of our results in example   and corollary     similar examples
can be constructed for our results concerning strong gen equivalence and  combined  strong
equivalence  a more systematic study of optimization problem rewriting rules that result
in strongly equivalent problems will be a subject of future work 
finally  we established the complexity of deciding whether optimization problems are
strongly equivalent  notably  in the general case of strong  combined  equivalence the problem is co np complete for both co and aso problems  the same holds true for the strong
gen equivalence problem  for the strong sel equivalence problem  the situation is more
complex  when contexts of the form     j  or       are considered  the problem of deciding
strong sel equivalence is co np complete for co problems and p   complete for aso problems  if any rank interval is allowed as part of input or if the rank interval is fixed to  i  j  
with i     the problem gets computationally harder  in case of aso problems  p   hard  in
case of co problems p   hard  the difference between co problems and aso problems in
the case of strong sel equivalence with respect to contexts consisting of preference rules with

fistrong equivalence of qualitative optimization problems

strong sel equivalence when arbitrary rank intervals  i  j  are allowed or if they are fixed so
that i    comes from the fact that in such cases  the concept depends on properties of the
class of outcomes that are optimal with respect to rules of ranks less than i  while in other
cases it depends on properties of the class of models  decision problems concerning optimal
outcomes  such as  do two theories have the same optimal models  are harder than the
corresponding versions of the problems for models  explaining the jump  the results for
strong sel equivalence also imply that ranked optimization problems cannot be efficiently
simulated by simple optimization problems

appendix a  useful lemmas
we provide here several lemmas that we use later in the proofs of the results discussed in
the main body of the paper 
the first two lemmas are given without proofs  as they are easy consequences of results

lemma    let p be a theory  i be a classical model of p   and let  i     a     a

proof  when proving      to simplify the notation  we write r for rj  i   since i   p j   
i   p    clearly   p  r     p   and so  i   p  r   to show that i   p  r  
let us consider an arbitrary interpretation j   p  r  and assume that j  p r i  in
particular  j    i and so  diff r  i  j    j  if diff p  i  j    j  then diff p r  i  j    j 
consequently  j   p r  j i  since all rules in r are of rank j  it follows that j  p j i  a
contradiction with the fact that i   p j    thus  diff p  i  j   j  since diff r  i  j    j 
we have diff p r  i  j    j  therefore  j  p r i implies j  r i  a contradiction again
 since  by definition of rj  i    r  i r j for each interpretation j   it follows that for
every j   p  r   j   p r i  that is  i   p  r  
the assertion     is evident  since by definition of rj  i    r  i  r j for each interpretation j    i   

lemma    let p be an optimization problem  i  j interpretations such that i  j   p j   
be the union of the following sets of rules 
where j     and let rj   i  j   ls j

then all of the following hold 
   for every r  rj   i  j   vi  r    vj  r      
   for every interpretation k 
   i  j   there is a rule r  rj   i  j  such that vk  r      
   i  p j if and only if j 
   p  rj   i  j   
proof  to simplify the notation  we write r  for rj   i  j  
the assertion     is evident  to prove the assertion      we note that the conjunction
of all formulas that appear as top options in the preference rules of r  is equivalent to

that formula has only two models  i and j  thus  for every other interpretation k  at
least one of the formulas that appears as top options in the preference rules of r  is not
satisfied by k  for the corresponding preference rule r  vk  r      
finally  to prove the assertion      let us assume that i  p j  together with      it
 
implies that i  p r j  thus  j 
   p  r     to prove the converse implication  let us
 
assume that i   p j  together with      it implies that i   p r j  next  we note that if
 
diff p  j  k    j  then since j   p j    k   p r j  if diff p  j  k   j  then property    
 
proved above implies that k   p r j  since k is an arbitrary interpretation different from
 
i and j  and since i   p r j  j   p  r    follows   

   

fistrong equivalence of qualitative optimization problems

next  we note a property that allows us to infer the strong sel equivalence of two problems treated as co problems from the strong sel equivalence of the same problems when
treated as aso problems  and conversely   the property relies on the fact that changing
selectors only does not affect the class of outcomes  the proof is simple and we omit it 
lemma    let p and q be optimization problems such that mod  p g     as  p g   and
mod  q g     as  qg    and  i  j  a rank interval  then  p s  i j  q when p and q are viewed
as co problems  if and only if p s  i j  q when p and q are viewed as aso problems 
the final results in this section will be useful for the complexity results 
lemma    deciding whether open qbfs y  x  y   and y  x  y    where  and  are
in negation normal form  have the same minimal models is p   hard 
proof  we show the result by a reduction from the p   hard problem of deciding satisfiability for qbfs of the form zxy   where  is in negation normal form  let  be a
qbf of such a form and consider the following formulas  where z      z     z  z   and u
and v are fresh atoms

it is clear that  and  are in negation normal form  the only difference between 
compared to  is that the latter uses u where the former uses v and vice versa  and the
only point of including the conjuncts v  v and u  u is to have occurrences of u and v
in both  and   we show that y  u  y   and y  u  y   have the same minimal models
 with open variables u   z  z    x   u  v   if and only if  is true 
we note that when considering models and minimal models of y  u  y   and y  u  y  
we can move the quantifier y so that it appears directly in front of   it is so because
there are no occurrences of atoms from y in  and in  outside of  
it is also clear that if m contains neither u nor v  then m is a model of y  u  y   if
and only if m is a model of y  u  y    consequently  for each such m it holds that m is
a minimal model of y  u  y   if and only if m is a minimal model of y  u  y   
only if direction  let us assume  is false  then  there exists an interpretation i  z
of atoms in z  such that for every interpretation j of atoms in x  y  is false  let us
consider mu   i   z   i    x   u   clearly  mu is a model of yv  if n is a model of
y  and n  mu   then i   z   i    n because of the conjunct zz  z  z      thus 
n  z   i  it follows that y  is false when atoms in z and x are interpreted by n and 
consequently  x   u   n   thus  n   mu   which implies that mu is a minimal model of
y   essentially the same argument shows that mv   i   z   i    x   v  is a minimal
model of y   since mu    mv   y  and y  have different minimal models 
if direction  let us assume that zxy  is true  let m be a minimal model of y  
clearly  v 
  m  as m    v  is also a model of y    let us assume that u  m   let us
assume in addition that x   m      these assumptions imply that for the interpretations

i   m z of atoms in z and j   m x of atoms in x  y  is true  it follows that m   u 
is a model of y   a contradiction  thus  x  m   let i   m  z  since zxy  is
true  there is an interpretation j  x of atoms in x such that y  is true  with atoms
in z interpreted by i and atoms in x interpreted by j  it follows that i   z   i    j
is a model of y   since i   z   i    j  m   this is a contradiction  it follows that
u
  m   consequently  by the comment above  m is a minimal model of   the converse
holds by the symmetry argument  thus  the two formulas have the same minimal models   

lemma    given a ranked preference rule r  and an interpretation i  calculating vi  r 
can be done in polynomial time 
proof  initialize a variable i with    check whether i     bd  r  and if so  halt  then  check
whether i    hd i  r  and if so  halt  otherwise increment i and continue checking  if no more
options in the head of r exist  set i      each of the checks is a model checking task for a
propositional formula and hence in polynomial time  upon halting  i is equal to vi  r    

lemma    given an optimization problem p and two interpretations i  j  calculating
diff p  i  j  can be done in polynomial time 
proof  initialize a variable x with   scan the rules in p s and for each ranked preference
rule r  p s   determine whether vi  r     vj  r   in polynomial time due to lemma      if so 
set x to rank  r  if rank  r    x  after having processed all rules  x is equal to diff p  i  j    

lemma    given an optimization problem p   and two interpretations i  j  deciding whether
i  p j holds can be done in polynomial time 
proof  first  sort the rules in p s by their ranks  starting from the lowest rank upwards 
do the following for each rank i  check for all rules of rank i whether vi  r    vj  r  or
vi  r   vj  r   if vi  r    vj  r  holds at least for one rule and vi  r   vj  r  for all other
rules of rank i  accept  if there are rules r and r  of the rank i such that vi  r    vj  r  and
vi  r      vj  r     reject  if all ranks have been processed  reject  by lemma     all steps are
doable in polynomial time   

lemma    given a classical optimization problem p and an interpretation i  deciding

proof  we show that a witness j for the complementary problem  deciding whether
i 
   p    can be verified in polynomial time  if j   i  verify in polynomial time that
i does not satisfy the propositional theory p g   which is well known to be feasible in polynomial time  otherwise  verify in polynomial time that j satisfies p g and that j  p i  both

in particular  i   q i   and  as  q i      q   i   q   since rg     we have
i   q  r   to show that i   q  r  we have to show that there is no j   q  r 
such that j  qr i  let us assume to the contrary that such a j exists  by lemma   
there are three possibilities 
first  we assume that diff q  i  j    diff r  i  j  and j  q i  the latter property
implies diff q  i  j   i  otherwise  we would have j  q i i  contrary to i   q i    
in particular  we have i q i j and  since i   q i    it follows that j   q i    by

next  let us assume that diff q  i  j    diff r  i  j  and j  r i  since r  lu

thus  j   q i   and  consequently  j   p i    if diff q  i  j   j then  by     
diff p  i  j    diff q  i  j  and so  diff p  i  j    diff r  i  j   if j   diff q  i  j  then  also
by      j   diff p  i  j   since diff q  i  j    diff r  i  j   diff r  i  j     and  consequently 
diff r  i  j   j  thus  diff p  i  j    diff r  i  j  in this case  too  since j  r i  j  p r i
follows 
finally  let us assume that diff q  i  j    diff r  i  j   j  q i and j  r i  since

r  lu   diff r  i  j   i  thus  diff q  i  j   i and  since i   q i    j   q i    by

proof     the first assumption implies strong equivalence of the generators p g and qg

the assumption that p g q  thus  p g and qg are strongly equivalent  that is  mod  p g    
mod  qg    in the case p and q are co problems  and modht  p g     modht  qg    in the
case p and q are aso problems

by      we have that  p  r     q  r   we recall that  p   denotes the set of outcomes of an optimization problem p    p     mod  p g   in the case of co problems  and
 p     as  p g   in the case of aso problems   moreover  for each type of problems  we also
have  p  r   mod  p g  r g    mod  p g   and  similarly   q  r   mod  q g  r g   
mod  q g    since all rules in r have rank at least i  by condition     it follows that
 p r 
 qr 
  p r  i    qr  i   by lemma    we have   p  r  i       q  r  i   and so  condition
    of theorem   holds for p  r and q  r  since   p  r  i     p  r   mod  p g   
and since the corresponding inclusions hold for q  too  conditions        of this theorem
for p and q imply conditions        from theorem   for p  r and q  r  thus  by
theorem    p  r s  i j  q  r 
s  i j 

   let us assume that p g
q  then  p g q follows and  by theorem     implies the
appropriate version of condition      since modht  p g     modht  qg   implies mod  p g    
mod  q g    for each of the two versions of the assertion we have mod  p g     mod  q g   
from now on in the proof  we write m for mod  p g   and  because of the equality  also for
mod  q g   
next  for interpretations i  j  m such that i    j  we define r     i  j      where
 i  j  is as in lemma     let us define p    p r and q    qr  we have p  s  i j  q   
moreover  by lemma     we also have that  p       q       i  j  
to prove condition      let us assume that i  p i j  it follows that i  p  j  we recall
that r contains no preference rules   since  p       i  j   j 
   p    and i   p     by
the assumption  j 
   q     since  q       i  j   we have that i  q  j  in particular 
i   q     if diff q  i  j    i then  since r has no preference rules  i  q i j  thus  let us
assume that diff q  i  j   i and let us define r       ri  j    where ri  j  is as in lemma
    since  i  i  p i j   ii  r has no preference rules  and  iii  all preference rules in r  have
 
rank i  it follows that i  p  r j  the generator module in r  is empty  it follows that
 p   r       q   r       i  j   thus  j 
   p   r    and  consequently  j 
   q   r    
q
q 
since diff  i  j   i  diff  i  j   i  moreover  i   q    and so  also i    q    i   
thus  j    q    i    by lemma     j   q   r     a contradiction  the argument shows
that i  p i j implies i  q i j  the converse implication follows by symmetry and so 
condition     holds 
to prove condition      let us assume that i  p j  if diff p  i  j    i  then i  p i j
and  by      i  q i j  thus  i  q j  let us assume then that diff p  i  j   i  since
 p       i  j  and since i  p j implies i  p  j  j 
   p     thus  j 
   q     since
 q       i  j   i  q  j and so  i  q j 
to prove condition      without loss of generality we assume that i   diff p  i  j   thus 
we also have i   diff p   i  j  and that i  j    p    i    the latter follows from the properties that  p       i  j  and that diff p   i  j    diff p  i  j    i  since p  s  i j  q   
condition     of theorem   holds for p    q    i and j  that is  diff p   i  j    diff q   i  j  or
both diff p   i  j    j and diff q   i  j    j  consequently  diff p  i  j    diff q  i  j  or both

theorem    given optimization problems p and q  deciding p s q is co np complete
in case of co problems and p   complete in case of aso problems 
proof  for membership  we consider the complementary problem  by corollary    it can
be specified as the problem to decide whether at least one of the conditions           below
holds 
    p       q   or equivalently  for some i  exactly one of the identities i   p   and

   for some i  j   p    diff p  i  j     diff q  i  j  
    p p       q
 q    or equivalently  for some i  j  we have i  j   p     q  and exactly
one of the properties i  p j and i  q j holds 
we show that the problem is in np for co problems and in p  for aso problems  we
say that a pair of interpretations i  j is a witness for an instance of that problem to be a
yes instance if it demonstrates one of the conditions           to hold  it is easy to see
that if a witness exists  then there is a witness i  j such that i and j consist only of atoms
that occur in p and q  once such a witness is guessed  condition     can be verified in
polynomial time for co problems  this is a model checking problem for an interpretation
and a theory  and  for aso problems  in polynomial time with the assist of two calls to
an np oracle  since model checking for the equilibrium model semantics is co np complete
 theorem    pearce et al           since condition     can be verified in polynomial time by
lemma     and condition     in polynomial time for co problems and in polynomial time
with the assist of four calls to an np oracle for aso problems  lemma    and the result
by pearce et al          mentioned above   the membership part of the assertion follows 
for hardness  we observe that in case of problems with empty selectors  s coincides
with equivalence of propositional theories in case of co problems  and with equivalence of
equilibrium theories in case of aso problems  the former is well known to be co np hard 
the latter is p   hard  theorem     pearce et al            
theorem    given optimization problems p and q and rank interval  i  j   deciding
p s  i j  q is p   complete in case of co problems and p   complete in case of aso

proof  to prove the membership part  we consider the complementary problem  by
theorem    that problem consists of deciding whether it is the case that at least one of the
following conditions holds 
    p i       q i    or equivalently  for some interpretation i  exactly one of the properties i   p i   and i   q i   holds

   for some i  j   p i     q i   such that i   diff p  i  j  or i   diff q  i  j  
diff p  i  j     diff q  i  j  and it holds that diff p  i  j   j or diff q  i  j   j

we call each pair of interpretations i  j that demonstrates that one of the conditions above
holds a witness  it is easy to see that if there is witness  there is also one that consists only
of atoms that occur in p and q  we show that the complementary problem is in p  for
co problems and in p  for aso problems by showing that a witness once guessed can
be verified in polynomial time  using an np oracle when dealing with a co problem and a
p  oracle when dealing with an aso problem 
consider a witness i  j of two interpretations  one can test whether i  j verifies
condition      only i matters here  in polynomial time with two calls to an np oracle for co problems  lemma      and with two calls to a p  oracle for aso problems
 lemma      to verify condition      we need four calls to the respective oracles to test
that i  j   p i     q i   and polynomial time computation to test that exactly one of
the properties i  p j or i  q j holds  lemma      similarly  for condition      we use
four calls to the respective oracles to test that i  j   p i     q i   and polynomial time
computation to test the condition involving diff p  i  j  and diff q  i  j   lemma     
for the hardness part  we start with the case of co problems  therefore  we reduce the
following problem to strong sel equivalence  given two propositional theories s and t   decide
whether they possess the same minimal models  this problem is known to be p   complete
 for instance  equivalence for positive disjunctive programs is known to p   complete  see
e g   eiter et al       b  thm        which means testing whether two propositional formulas
of a particular class have the same minimal models   the problem remains hard if s and t
are in negation normal form over the same alphabet  given a negation normal form theory
t we construct a co problem pt such that the elements in  pt   are in a one to one
correspondence to the minimal models of t   we adapt a construction used in  brewka
et al          specifically  we set
ptg   t  u u      u  u    u  u   
where u is the collection of atoms occurring in t   and t  u u    stands for replacing all u
by u  in t   and
pts    u    u   u  u   
our first observation is that each outcome of pt must be of the form i   y     y  u   i 
where i  u   for each interpretation i  u we write i     i   y     y  u   i   it is clear
that i    u if and only if i      u    and hence also i    t if and only if i      t  u u    
hence there is a one to one mapping between models m of t and outcomes m   of pt  
now let us assume that m     pt    then m    t   and for any n  m we we have
n     t   indeed if n    t   then n      ptg and for rules r  pts of the form u    u  where
u  m   n   we obtain vn    r            vm    r  and for all other rules r  in pts we have
vn    r          vm    r     that implies n    pt m     contradicting m     pt    thus  m
is a minimal model of t  
conversely  let us assume that m is a minimal model of t   then m     pt   and for
all n     pt   we have that n    pt m   does not hold  implying m     pt    indeed 
if n    pt m     then vn    r    vm    r  for at least one r  pts and vn    r     vm    r    for
all r   pts   the latter implies n  m and the former shows that n    m   since n    t it
contradicts the assumption that m is a minimal model of t   it follows that m     pt   
we thus have that m     pt   if and only if m is a minimal model of t   moreover 
for s and t over u it follows that s and t have the same minimal models if and only
   

fistrong equivalence of qualitative optimization problems

if ps s   pt   indeed  for any r  lus   it is easy to verify that  ps      ps  r 
and  pt      pt  r   that observation follows from the fact that there are no distinct
i  j   ps   such that i ps j and no distinct i  j   pt   such that i pt j  thus 
rules in r which  being of weaker rank  can only break ties  do not affect the sets of optimal
outcomes 
concerning hardness for aso problems  we can use a similar idea  however  we shall
use the following problem  given two open qbfs y  x  y    y  x  y    decide whether
these two qbfs possess the same minimal models  by lemma     this problem is p   hard
and  moreover  we can assume that  and  are in negation normal form  the reduction
then combines the idea from above with the reduction for general asp consistency  eiter
  gottlob         more precisely  for each z  x  y we introduce a new variable z     and
then we construct p for a given  x  y   as follows 
pg    z  z     z  x  y   
  y  y      w  w  y  w  y     y  y   
  z z      w  w  w  
where  z z     stands for replacing all z by z     and w is a globally new atom  for the
selector we set
ps    x    x   x  x  
any equilibrium model m of pg must contain w  otherwise w  w would be unsatisfied  
and it must also contain all of  y  y     y  y    otherwise w  y  w  y   would be
unsatisfied   we write w for  y  y     y  y     w   the set contained in each equilibrium
model  moreover  each equilibrium model m must be of the form v   z     z  x   v    w  
indeed  one of x and x  must hold for each x  x to satisfy xx    but not both  as otherwise
hm    x   m i   ht pg as well  contradicting the fact that m is an equilibrium model of pg  
for each interpretation i  x we write i     i   x    x  x   i   w of pg   one can show
that i is a model of y  x  y   if and only if i   is an equilibrium model of pg   indeed  if i
satisfies y  x  y    then hi     i   i   ht pg and for all j  i   it holds that hj  i   i    ht pg  
on the other hand  if i does not satisfy y  x  y   then there exists j  y such that
i  j      x  y    it follows that hi       y   y 
  j    y     y  j    w    i   i   ht pg  the
key element of the argument here is that  z z     contains no occurrences of negation  as 
is in negation normal form and so  i       y   y 
  j    y     y  j    w        z z      that
 
property allows one to show hi    y   y 
  j  y     y  j  w    i   i   ht  z z      w  
 
thus  i is not an equilibrium model of pg  
once the correspondence between models m of y  x  y   and outcomes  equilibrium
models  m   of p is established  we can handle the issue of minimality as in the case of co
problems  let us assume first that m     p    then  as we just demonstrated  m satisfies
y  x  y    moreover  we have that for any n  m   n does not satisfy y  x  y    indeed
if n would satisfy y  x  y    then we would have  i  n     p     ii  for rules r  ps of
the form u    u  where u  m   n   vn    r            vm    r   and  iii  for all other rules
r  in ps   vn    r          vm    r     these three properties would imply n    p m     contradicting m     p    conversely  let us assume that m is a minimal model of y  x  y   
then m     p   and for all n     p   we can show that n    p m   does not hold
   

fifaber  truszczynski    woltran

 implying m     p     to this end  we reason as follows  if n    p m   would hold 
then vn    r    vm    r  for at least one r  ps   and vn    r     vm    r     for all r   ps  
this of course implies n  m and  since n satisfies y  x  y    we recall that n   is an
equilibrium model of pg and so  n is a model of y  x  y     it contradicts the assumption
that m is a minimal model of y  x  y    we thus have that m     p   if and only if m
is a minimal model of y  x  y    from that fact  reasoning as in the case of co problems 
we obtain that that y  x  y   and y  x  y   have the same minimal models if and only
if p s   p    
theorem    given two co  aso  respectively  problems p and q  deciding p g q is
co np complete 
proof  deciding strong equivalence of propositional theories under the classical semantics
is co np hard as in such case  strong equivalence and equivalence coincide  it is also conp hard under the equilibrium model semantics  lin         thus  the hardness part of
the assertion follows from corollary    
to prove membership  we consider the complementary problem  by theorem     it
consists of deciding whether at least one of the conditions     and     below holds 
   p g and qg are not strongly equivalent or  equivalently  mod  p g      mod  q g    for co
problems  and modht  p g      modht  qg    for aso problems 
    pmod p g       q
mod q g   or  equivalently  for some interpretations i  j that are models
g
of both p and qg   exactly one of the properties i  p j and i  q j holds 
consequently  we consider a pair of interpretations i  j to be a witness for an instance
of that problem to be a yes instance if i is a model  for co problems  or hi  ji is an
ht model  for aso problems  of exactly one of the two theories p g and qg   or if i  j are
models of both p g and qg and exactly one of the properties i  p j and i  q j holds 
it is easy to see that if a witness exists  then there is a witness i  j such that i and
j consist only of atoms that occur in p and q  after such a witness is guessed  verifying
it  showing that condition     or     holds  can be done in polynomial time  it is well
known that checking whether i is a model  hi  ji is an ht model  of a propositional theory
can be done in polynomial time  and the same holds true for deciding i  p j and i  q j

proof  for membership  we consider the complementary problem  by theorem     it
consists of deciding whether at least one of the conditions           below holds 
   p g and qg are not strongly equivalent  that is  mod  p g      mod  q g   for co problems 
modht  p g      modht  qg   for aso problems  
   for some interpretations i  j that are models of both mod  p g   and mod  q g    exactly
one of properties i  pmod p g   j and i  q
mod q g   j holds

   for some i  j  mod  p g   such that i   diff p  i  j  or i   diff q  i  j   diff p  i  j

we prove that the complementary problem is in np  as in other proofs  we use for a
membership witness a pair of interpretations i  j that explicitly demonstrates that one of
the conditions           holds  as before  if such a witness exists  there is also one consisting
of atoms occurring in programs p and q only  for each condition  given such a pair i  j
 restricted to atoms from p and q   one can verify in polynomial time whether the condition
holds  for condition      we repeat the argument from the previous proof  for conditions    
and      we use lemma     and for condition      lemma     
hardness follows directly from co np completeness of deciding strong equivalence between two propositional theories under either of the semantics we consider and from corollary
