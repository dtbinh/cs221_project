systems known np hard  hence work aims investigating whether
variants proposed rules and or specific electorates problems
solved efficiently  variation rules  instead minimizing sum misrepresentations  considered minimizing maximal misrepresentation introducing effectively
two new rules  general case minimax versions classical rules appeared
still np hard 
investigated parameterized complexity winner determination two classical two new rules respect several parameters  mixture
positive negative results  e g   proved fixed parameter tractability parameter number candidates fixed parameter intractability number winners 
single peaked electorates results overwhelmingly positive  provide polynomial time algorithms considered problems  rule remains

   introduction
important conceptual difference purpose single winner multiwinner elections  single winner social choice rules used make final decisions  e g  
elect president choose certain course action  multi winner election rules
used elect assembly whose members authorized take final decisions
behalf society  result main property multi winner rules satisfy
elected assembly represents society adequately  this  particular  means

 brams   fishburn         see lu   boutilier       experimental evidence  
reason majoritarian logic dominates design single winner social
choice rules cannot provide balanced assembly membership 
standard solution problem electing assembly division
election single member districts approximately equal population  district
elects one member assembly using single winner rule  normally plurality 
although one might question whether districting instead based total adult

system proportional representationin fact family voting methods according
tideman richardson       that allows voters express order preference
candidates  levin   nalebuff         voters rank candidates order preference 
first preference votes first looked at  votes transferred

function  methods however different difference important  chamberlin courant impose restriction function assigns candidates
voters  may potentially lead different number voters represented
candidate  remedy chamberlin courant suggested use weighted voting
assembly elected candidate weight equal number voters
represent  monroe rejected approach insisted principle one member
assembly one vote  reason insisted difference numbers
voters assigned two representatives one 
reasons monroe rejected chamberlin courant approach quite
substantial  proportional allocation weights known result excessive voting powers
electorates larger constituencies much debate right
way allocating weights representatives  alternative chamberlin courants
method would give representatives weights proportional square root
number voters represent  justified fact  due square root

      relations facility location 
basic scenario problem company needs choose set facility locations
serve set customers little cost possible  fellows fernau       
investigated parameterized complexity variant problem closely related
cc multiwinner  basically  facility locations considered set
candidates  customers multiset voters goal find set facility
locations serve customers  difference cost function  addition
term resembles misrepresentation every voter  customer   every facility
location comes certain cost required install facility 
similar study  fellows fernau        studied parameter number k
winners selected facilities locations total cost  parameter k  w    hardness
cc multiwinner follows reduction given facility location problem 
regarding parameter total cost  results two papers directly comparable  due fact facility location problem stipulates
minimum cost   serving customer even best facility location  which
would analogue condition r v  c    misrepresentation function r  
case  considered problem fixed parameter tractable respect total
cost  might come surprise since total cost misrepresentation
least number voters fixed parameter tractability respect parameter
holds four voting problems considered  proposition     contrast 
condition r v  c    considered problems least w    hard respect
total misrepresentation cost  see table    
close connection facility location multi winner problems clearly seems
deserve attention future work  remark analogues several problems
considered work might make sense context facility location problem 
example  monroe model might apply sets facilities every facility
serve number customers  moreover  single peaked scenario translates 
example  setting potential facility locations along one main street
resident ranks cost using facility according distance facility
place residence 
      multiset candidates model 
may compromise solution two systems chamberlin courant
monroe  may still divide voters equal almost equal groups may assign
representative one group voters  say  n voters k
representatives elected may split voters groups sizes n k n k  
allow candidate represent one group  mathematically would
result selecting set representatives cardinality k multiset
cardinality  classic monroe        example considers subscription newspapers
common room fact better fit multiset model  indeed  demand  say
financial times  strong several copies newspaper subscribed to 
still need use weighted voting assembly case weights
integers

multiset point view natural multiset  a    c  answer
