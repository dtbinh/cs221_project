abstract
we investigate two systems of fully proportional representation suggested by chamberlin   courant and monroe  both systems assign a representative to each voter so that
the sum of misrepresentations is minimized  the winner determination problem for both
systems is known to be np hard  hence this work aims at investigating whether there are
variants of the proposed rules and or specific electorates for which these problems can be
solved efficiently  as a variation of these rules  instead of minimizing the sum of misrepresentations  we considered minimizing the maximal misrepresentation introducing effectively
two new rules  in the general case these minimax versions of classical rules appeared to
be still np hard 
we investigated the parameterized complexity of winner determination of the two classical and two new rules with respect to several parameters  here we have a mixture of
positive and negative results  e g   we proved fixed parameter tractability for the parameter the number of candidates but fixed parameter intractability for the number of winners 
for single peaked electorates our results are overwhelmingly positive  we provide polynomial time algorithms for most of the considered problems  the only rule that remains
np hard for single peaked electorates is the classical monroe rule 

   introduction
there is an important conceptual difference in the purpose of single winner and multiwinner elections  single winner social choice rules are used to make final decisions  e g   to
elect a president or to choose a certain course of action  the multi winner election rules
are used to elect an assembly whose members will be authorized to take final decisions on
behalf of the society  as a result the main property that multi winner rules have to satisfy
is that the elected assembly represents the society adequately  this  in particular  means
that when a final decision is taken all opinions existing in the society are heard and taken
into consideration  as black powerfully expressed it

a scheme of proportional representation attempts to secure an assembly whose
membership will  so far as possible  be proportionate to the volume of the different shades of political opinion held throughout the country  the microcosm is
to be a true reflexion of the macrocosm  black        p      
and although any single winner social choice rule can be easily extended to select an
assemblye g   by choosing candidates with best scores or applying the rule repeatedly until
the required quantity of representatives is electedthis is a wrong approach to the problem
 brams   fishburn         see also lu   boutilier       for some experimental evidence  
the reason is that the majoritarian logic which dominates the design of single winner social
choice rules cannot provide for a balanced assembly membership 
the standard solution to the problem of electing an assembly has been the division of
the election into single member districts with approximately equal population  each district
elects one member of the assembly using a single winner rule  normally the plurality  and
although one might question whether districting should be instead based on the total adult
population or on the number of registered voters  the current practice is well established and
entrenched by law in many countries  including the united states  brams         however
the main problem with this approach is not the districting but the fact that it also fails to
give a representation to minorities  a minority may comprise     of the population and be
not represented in the assembly  on the positive side the districting method provides for a
high level of accountability  voters who know who is their representative  can address them
on particular issues and can even recall them  if they fail to represent them to a decent
standard 
various voting systemse g   cumulative voting  single non transferable vote  multiwinner variants of single transferable vote  various party list systemshave been designed
to solve the problem of representation of minorities  brams   fishburn         however
none of them scored high on the accountability  it may even seem that we have a certain
trade off here and we cannot have both representation of minorities and accountability 
however this is not the case  an important idea was suggested by charles dodgson        
known also as lewis carroll  and considered in a different form by black         then the
idea was further developed by chamberlin and courant        and later by monroe        
the relative advantages of both methods from political science point of view have been
extensively discussed by brams         dodgson asserted that a representation system
should find the coalitions in the election that would have formed if the voters had the
necessary time and information and allow each of the coalitions to elect their representative 
if this is adopted  then a sizable minority can form a coalition and be represented 
the realization of this idea required a new concept which is the concept of misrepresentation  it is assumed that voters form individual preferences over the candidates based on
their political ideology and their judgement about the abilities of candidates to participate
in deliberations and decision making consistent with how the individuals would wish to act
were they present  chamberlin   courant        p        this was in a way a revolution 
indeed  in the single winner literature on voting rules it is widely accepted that
voters political preferences are more complex than their first choices alone  however 
in multi winner voting literature fixation on first preferences led researchers to think
about proportional representation exclusively in terms of first preferences  in list systems
   

fion the computation of fully proportional representation

of proportional representation  parties are assigned a number of seats in parliament that
is proportional to the number of votes  first preferences  they received  the systems like
single non transferable vote  block voting and cumulative voting also do not take second preferences in account  levin   nalebuff         only the single transferable vote
is a system of proportional representationin fact a family of voting methods according
to tideman and richardson       that allows voters to express the order of preference
of candidates  levin   nalebuff         voters rank the candidates in order of preference 
first preference votes are the first to be looked at  and the votes are then transferred  if
necessary  from candidates who have either been comfortably elected or who have done so
badly that they have been eliminated from the election  
so  if a voter is represented by a candidate who is her first preference it is reasonable to
say that she is represented optimally or that the misrepresentation in this case is zero  in
general  if a voter is represented by a candidate who is her ith preference we may assume
that she is misrepresented to the degree si   of course  it is reasonable to assume that
    s   s          sm   so in this case the rule for measuring the total misrepresentation
is fully defined by the vector s    s            sm    where m is the number of candidates 
using the analogy with positional scoring rules for single winner elections we may say that
this misrepresentation function is positional  in general  the problem of choosing a proper
misrepresentation function is far from being trivial  in the work of levin and nalebuff       
p     this difficulty is vividly illustrated  if the electorate is uniformly distributed on the
segment between   and    and we are to choose three representatives  should they be equally
spaced                    or should they be selected so as to minimize the average distance
traveled to the nearest legislator                    in the broadest possible framework the
misrepresentation function may be even voter dependent 
staying with the classical positional misrepresentation functions for the time being suppose that every voter is assigned to a representative in some way  measuring the total
misrepresentation for the whole society we may adopt either the harsanyi        approach
or the rawlsian one  assuming that the utility of being represented by the ith best candidate is si   i e   a nonpositive value   by harsanyi we will have to measure the total
misrepresentation as
m
x
ni si  
mh  
i  

where ni is the number of voters represented by their ith most preferred candidate  according to rawls        welfare is maximized when the utility of those society members
that have the least is the greatest  this leads to the total misrepresentation function

si  

both chamberlin and courant         and monroe        consider that the best set of
representatives must minimize the total misrepresentation which they both calculate using
the borda vector of scores  that is                    m     and harsanyis misrepresentation
   in northern ireland this is the voting system used for elections to local councils  the assembly  and the
european parliament  it is used for all elections in the irish republic  malta  and australia  although
single member constituencies are prevalent in australia  apart from state level elections in tasmania and
the act   several other countries have recently debated adopting it

function  their methods are however different and the difference is very important  chamberlin and courant did not impose any restriction on the function that assigns candidates
to voters  this may potentially lead to a different number of voters represented by each
candidate  to remedy this chamberlin and courant suggested to use weighted voting in
the assembly where each elected candidate has the weight equal to the number of voters
they represent  monroe rejected this approach and insisted on the principle one member
of assembly one vote  for this reason he insisted that the difference between the numbers
of voters assigned to any two representatives is at most one 
the reasons why monroe rejected the chamberlin and courant approach are quite
substantial  proportional allocation of weights is known to result in excessive voting powers
for the electorates of larger constituencies and there can be much debate on what is the right
way of allocating weights to representatives  an alternative to chamberlin and courants
method would be to give to representatives weights proportional to the square root of the
number of voters they represent  this is justified by the fact  that due to the square root
law of penrose         the a priori voting power  as defined by the penrose banzhaf index 
of a member of a voting body is inversely proportional to the square root of its size  on the
basis of this theory  for example  poland insisted that the eu allocate council of minister
votes according to the square root of each nations population  slomczynski   zyczkowski 
      
the computational problems which the harsanyi approach entails are known to be
np hard  lu   boutilier        procaccia  rosenschein    zohar        for several classical misrepresentation functions  in this paper we try to achieve tractability in multiwinner
elections in three different ways  firstly  we ask whether or not the problem of finding an optimal fully proportional representation becomes easier for these classical misrepresentation
functions if we adopt the rawlsian approach for measurement of total misrepresentation 
the second goal is to find the parameterized complexity of the aforementioned problems
for some natural choices of parameters  the third is to develop efficient algorithms for
achieving an optimal fully proportional representation in single peaked elections 
in the remainder of this section  we formally introduce the computational problems
considered in this paper  summarize the results in the extant literature  and describe our
approaches and results 
    computational problems considered
an election is a pair e    c  v   where c is a set of candidates  or alternatives  and v is an
ordered list of voters  each voter is represented by her vote  which is a strict  linear order
over the set of candidates  also called this voters preference order    we will refer to the
list v as a preference profile  and we denote the number of voters in v by n  the number
of alternatives will be denoted by m  if the order of voters is not important  the election
is anonymous   then v can be considered as a multiset  of votes  in this paper we will
consider only anonymous elections 
by posv  c  we will denote the position of the alternative c in the ranking of voter v  the
top ranked alternative has position    the second best has position    etc 
   this is not a set since two different voters may have the same preference order

definition    given a profile v over c  a mapping r   v  c   
  will be called a
misrepresentation function if for any v  v and any two candidates c  c  c the condition
posv  c    posv  c   implies r v  c   r v  c   
this is to say that if c is preferred to c in vs ranking  then the misrepresentation of v 
when she is represented by c will be at least as large as her misrepresentation  when she
is represented by c  in the classical framework the misrepresentation of a candidate for a
voter is a function of the position of the candidate in the preference order of that voter
given by s    s            sm    i e   the misrepresentation function in this case will be
r v  c    sposv  c   
an important particular case is the borda misrepresentation function defined by the vector
               m     
in the approval voting framework  if a voter is represented by a candidate whom she
approves  her misrepresentation is considered to be zero  otherwise it is equal to one  this
function is called the approval misrepresentation function  this misrepresentation function does not have to be positional since different voters may approve different number of
candidates  note that some misrepresentation functions  like borda  can be derived from
the preference lists of the voters  in contrast  an approval misrepresentation function cannot be obtained from a preference list without further information about the threshold
that separates approved candidates from disapproved ones  in the general framework the
misrepresentation function may be arbitrary 
by w   v  c we denote the function that assigns voters to representatives  or the
other way around   i e   under this assignment voter v is represented by candidate w v  
the total misrepresentation of the election under w is then given by
x
r v  w v   or max r v  w v  
vv

vv

in the harsanyis classical and rawls minimax versions  respectively  we say that a mapping w respects the m  criterion  or monroe criterion  if  w v      k and w assigns at least
n k and at most n k voters to every candidate from w v    where k is the total number
of representatives to be elected to the assembly  note that in case of the m  criterion a set
of more than k winners might lead to a higher misrepresentation than a set of k winners 
for example  consider an election such that all voters favour the same candidate but the
set of winners that has to be elected is greater than one 
based on the previous discussion  in this work we investigate the computational complexity of the following four combinatorial problems  the two classical ones described above
are named after chamberlin and courant  cc   for the case when a candidate can represent an arbitrary number of voters  and this number of voters will be his weight in the
elected assembly   and monroe  m   for the case when every candidate represents roughly
the same number of voters  and each representative has one vote in the assembly   the two
previously unstudied versions which adopt the rawlsian approach for measuring the total
misrepresentation are called the minimax versions of the classical ones

note that finding an assignment of voters to a fixed set of k winners can be accomplished in polynomial time for all four problems by applying network flow algorithms  see
section       hence  in what follows we assume that k   m and k   n since otherwise all
four problems can be decided in polynomial time  we also note that all problems considered
are contained in np since one can guess a set of k winners and a corresponding mapping
to the voters and check in polynomial time whether it satisfies the corresponding conditions 
the four problems above are stated for general misrepresentation functions  since some
of our algorithmic results hold even for this case  but the main focus of this work is on the
borda and the approval ones 
    previous computational complexity results
the study of the computational complexity of problems in the context of voting was initiated by bartholdi iii  tovey  and trick        about    years ago but has became an active

       investigate the computational complexity of strategic voting for several multiwinner
elections for which a winner can be determined in polynomial time  the systems considered
do not lead to any kind of proportional representation 
    our approach and results for general elections
our first result is that the minimax versions of the classical chamberlin courant and monroe problems are also np complete  in other words  adopting the rawlsian approach does
not make computation of the problems easier in general  but we will see that the situation changes completely for single peaked elections where the minimax version becomes
easier indeed   based on these negative results  this work aims at extending the previous
algorithmic approaches described above by an analysis whether or not there are settings
in which the problems become tractable  to this end  parameterized algorithmics is an
appropriate tool as it aims at identifying tractable special cases of np hard problems  the
cornerstone of this approach is the idea that the complexity of a problem is not only measured in the total size of an input instance i but also in an additional parameter p  usually
a nonnegative integer  but it can be a pair of integers or virtually anything   a problem is called fixed parameter tractable if there is an algorithm solving every instance of it
in f  p  poly  i   time  where f is a computable function  downey   fellows        flum
  grohe        niedermeier         for small values of p an algorithm with such running
time might represent an efficient algorithm for the np hard problem under consideration 
parameterized complexity also provides a tool of parameterized reductions by which one
can show that a problem is presumably not fixed parameter tractable  one of the most
important parameterized complexity classes for this purpose is w      see section   for more
details   we remark in passing that a parameterized complexity analysis has been employed for several other voting problems   e g   see brandt  brill    seedig        betzler

chen    niedermeier       for a survey  
in the context of multiwinner elections  a parameter that immediately attracts attention
is the number k of winners  which in many settings might be much smaller than the number
of candidates or the number of voters  another reasonable parameter is the misrepresentation bound r since in an ideal  or fully personalizable lu   boutilier        situation r is
equal to zero  that is  every voter is represented by one of her most preferred candidates 
we provide a parameterized complexity analysis of all four considered problems for the
borda and approval misrepresentation functions with respect to the parameters k and r

solvable in polynomial time for constant r  the corresponding parameterized complexity
class is called xp   note that the provided algorithm shows the containment in xp with
respect to r but not fixed parameter tractability  this problem remains open  this inspired
our analysis of the composite parameter  r  k   covering scenarios in which there is a small
set of winners that can represent all voters with a small total misrepresentation  while
for the approval misrepresentation function  this still leads to parameterized intractability  for the borda misrepresentation function  we show fixed parameter tractability for all
considered problems  to complete the picture of a multivariate complexity analysis  we
additionally provide fixed parameter tractability with respect to the parameters number

reasonable to assume this  he refers to a data collection containing    ranked ballot real life
elections  which he has access to  and claims that most of them are single peaked 
this single dominating issue is normally represented by an axis and each voter is characterized by a single point on this axis  see an example on figure    the misrepresentation
function for a fixed voter is then a function of a single variable defined on that axis  the
single peakedness of preferences implies that this function has exactly one local minimum 
we refer to section   for a formal proof of this statement

that for all condorcet consistent onesand these include dodgson  kemeny  and young
rulesthe winner determination problem becomes polynomial time solvable if we restrict
ourselves to single peaked profiles  brandt et al          the obvious reason for this is that
single peakedness eliminates the possibility of condorcet cycles in the election profile 
it is not that obvious that single peakedness must also simplify the winner determination
problem for methods of proportional representation  however  it seems natural to investigate this possibility  our results show that in many instances the winner determination
problem for methods of proportional representation does indeed become easier too 
our results are summarized in table    for cc mw and minimax cc mw the problems are solvable in polynomial time for an arbitrary misrepresentation function  more
specifically  for cc mw we provide a dynamic programming algorithm running in o nm   
time for n voters and m candidates  and minimax cc mw can be solved in o nm  time
by a greedy algorithm  for the monroe system and its variants  the results become more
diverse  while minimax m mw for the general misrepresentation function is still solvable
in polynomial time  m mw is np hard  however  on the positive side  we can still show
polynomial time solvability for m mw for the approval misrepresentation function  basically  the results are obtained as follows  for m mw for the approval misrepresentation

function we establish a close connection to a one dimensional rectangle stabbing problem with capacities  this allows to provide a dynamic programming algorithm based on a
decomposition property provided by even  levi  rawitz  schieber  shahar  and sviridenko
        this result can be transferred to minimax m mw  the np hardness of m mw
is established by a many one reduction from a restricted version of the exact   cover
problem  the np hardness holds for an integer valued misrepresentation function for which
the maximum misrepresentation value is still polynomial in the number of candidates  however  we need to allow situations in which a voter may be equally misrepresented by several
candidates  hence  it is not clear how to transfer the corresponding many one reduction
to m mw for the borda misrepresentation function  for this problem the computational
complexity is left open 
    organization of the paper
the paper is organized as follows  in section    we introduce the main concepts of parameterized complexity and some graph problems  section   contains basic observations about
the relations of the four problems under consideration and fixed parameter tractability results with respect to the number of voters and the number of candidates  the two main
contributions are proved in section   and section    in section    we present our main parameterized complexity results as well as the np hardness results for the minimax versions 
in section    the special case of single peaked elections is handled  finally  in section   we
conclude with a discussion of the relevance of our results and some related problems and
settings 

   preliminaries
we briefly introduce the framework of parameterized complexity followed by some basic
graph problems that are employed in this paper  for basic notions regarding classical
complexity theory we refer to garey and johnson        
    parameterized complexity
the concept of parameterized complexity was pioneered by downey and fellows         see
also the textbooks by flum and grohe        and niedermeier         the fundamental
goal is to find out whether the seemingly unavoidable combinatorial explosion  occurring in
exact algorithms for np hard problems  can be confined to certain problem specific parameters  the idea is that when such a parameter in a real life application is restricted to small
values only  then an algorithm with a running time that is exponential exclusively with
respect to the parameter may be efficient and practical  we now provide formal definitions 
definition    a parameterized problem is a language l       where  is a finite
alphabet  the second component is called the parameter of the problem 
basically  this means that an input to a parameterized problem is a pair  x  p   where x
can be considered as the main input and p is a parameter of the problem  we consider
parameters which are positive integers or composite parameters that are tuples of several

definition    a parameterized problem l is fixed parameter tractable if there is an algorithm that decides in f  p    x o    time whether  x  p   l  where f is an arbitrary
computable function that depends only on p  the complexity class of all fixed parameter
tractable problems is called fpt 
unfortunately  not all parameterized problems are fixed parameter tractable  to this
end  downey and fellows        developed a theory of parameterized intractability by
means of a completeness program with complexity classes  more specifically  they defined
the so called w  hierarchy by using boolean circuits  this hierarchy consists of the following
classes 
fpt  w     w            w sat   w p   xp
 we refer the reader to the book by downey   fellows        for their precise description  
in particular  we stress that the concept of fixed parameter tractability is different from
the notion of polynomial time solvability for constant p since an algorithm running in
o  x p   time does not imply fixed parameter tractability  all problems that can be solved
in the running time o  x f  p    for a computable function f form the complexity class called
xp 
the containment w     fpt would not imply p   np as such  it would imply 
however  the failure of the exponential time hypothesis  impagliazzo  paturi    zane 
       hence  it is commonly believed that w    hard problems are not fixed parameter
tractable  to show the w t  hardness of a problem for some positive integer t  the following
reduction concept was introduced 
definition    let l  l     be two parameterized problems  we say that l reduces
to l by a parameterized reduction if there are two computable functions h       and
h       and a function f          such that for each  x  p     

n q

    x  p   l  f  x  p   l and f is computable in time  x o     h    p   and
   if  x   p     f  x  p   then p   h   p  
analogously to the case of np hardness  for any positive integer t  it suffices to give a
parameterized reduction from one w t  hard parameterized problem x to a parameterized
problem y to show the w t  hardness of y   for more details about parameterized complexity theory we refer to the textbooks  downey   fellows        flum   grohe       
niedermeier        
in this work  we only provide results regarding the second level of  presumable  parameterized intractability captured by the complexity class w     several parameterized
reductions in this work are from the w    complete hitting set  hs  problem  given a
family f    f            fn   of sets over a universe u    u            um   and an integer k    
decide whether there is a hitting set u   u of size at most k by which we understand a
set u  such that fi  u      for every    i  n  hs is np hard  garey   johnson

    graph problems
some of our algorithmic results employ algorithms for basic graph problems defined in the
following  an undirected graph is a pair g    u  e   consisting of the set u of vertices
   

fibetzler  slinko    uhlmann

and the set e of edges  where an edge is an unordered pair  size two set  of vertices  two
vertices u  v  u are called adjacent if  u  v   e  for an undirected graph g    u  e  and
a vertex u  u   the neighborhood n  u  of u is the set of all vertices adjacent to u 
an undirected graph g    u  e  is called bipartite if the vertex set u can be partitioned
into two nonintersecting subsets u  and u  such that e    u  v    u  u  and v  u     a
matching is an edge set e   e such that e  e    for every two distinct edges e  e  e   
a maximum matching is a matching with maximum cardinality  in an undirected graph
where each edge  u  v  is associated
with a weight w  u  v   a maximum weight matching
p
is a matching e  such that  u v e  w  u  v   is maximal 
a directed graph or a directed network is a pair g    u  a   consisting of the set u
of vertices and the set a  u  u of directed edges  or arcs  where each directed edge
is an ordered pair of vertices  a flow network is a directed network g    u  a  with
two distinguished vertices s  u  the source  and t  u  the sink or target  where each
arc  u  v   a is associated with a nonnegative number c u  v   called capacity  roughly
speaking  a flow is a function f that assigns a real value f  u  v  with    f  u  v   c u  v 
to every arc  u  v   a and satisfies the constraints that for every vertex v except for the
source and the sink the total flow into v equals the total flow out of v  see the textbook
of cormen  leiserson  rivest  and stein        for details  a maximum flow is a flow such
that the total flow into the sink is maximal 
in this paper  we make use of the fact that a maximum weight matching in a bipartite
graph as well as a maximum flow in general graphs can be computed in polynomial time
by standard graph algorithms  e g   see cormen et al         

   basic results and observations
in this section  we shed light on the combinatorial relations between the problems and
investigate the parameterized complexity of the considered problems with respect to the
parameters number of voters and number of candidates  these results will also be
employed in the following sections  in particular  some of the algorithms showing fixedparameter tractability will be used as subroutines in section   to obtain fixed parameter
tractability with respect to other parameterizations 
    relations between the problems
although all four problems come with different properties in general  in some special cases 
some of them coincide  one such example is the so called fully personalizable setting  lu
  boutilier         that is  the case when the misrepresentation bound r is zero and hence
every voter has to be represented by one of her best alternatives  i e   one of those for which
the misrepresentation is zero   clearly  asking for a set of winners and an assignment for
which the sum of misrepresentations is zero is equivalent to asking for a set of winners and
an assignment for which the maximum misrepresentation value is zero  this leads to the
following observation 
observation    for r      minimax m multiwinner coincides with m multiwinner
and minimax cc multiwinner coincides with cc multiwinner 
   

fion the computation of fully proportional representation

moreover  for the two minimax versions of the problems  it only matters whether a
particular misrepresentation value exceeds the threshold r or not  hence  an instance of
a minimax version with an arbitrary misrepresentation function r can be reduced to an
equivalent instance of the same problem with the approval misrepresentation function r 
as follows  for every voter v and every candidate c  set r   v  c      if r v  c    r  and
r   v  c      if r v  c   r and  finally  set r      
observation    for a minimax m  cc multiwinner instance  c  v  r  r  k  with misrepresentation function r  there is an instance  c  v  r       k  with the approval misrepresentation function r  such that the new instance is a yes instance if and only if the original
instance is a yes instance 
as a direct consequence  for the minimax versions every algorithm for the approval misrepresentation function also applies to instances with general misrepresentation function 
moreover  hardness results for an arbitrary misrepresentation function transfer to the approval misrepresentation function  combining observations   and    we conclude that an
algorithm for m mw  cc mw  for instances with r     also solves the corresponding
minimax version for general misrepresentation function 
finally  observe that a hardness result established for the approval misrepresentation
function can be directly transferred to the minimax version of the same problem if the
misrepresentation function is such that a voter is allowed to give an arbitrary number of
candidates a misrepresentation value of at most r  note that this does not hold for the
borda misrepresentation function where every voter v must specify exactly r   candidates
that can represent v with misrepresentation at most r 
    the numbers of voters and candidates as parameters
we argue that all four problems considered are fixed parameter tractable with respect to
the number of candidates as well as with respect to the number of voters  our algorithms
are based on brute force search combined with maximum flow and matching techniques 
first  we consider the parameterization by the number of voters  then  we focus on the
parameterization by the number of candidates 
      the number of voters as parameter
we show that all considered multiwinner problems are fixed parameter tractable when parameterized by the number n of voters  the basic idea is that an assignment of candidates
to voters induces a partition of the set of voters such that all voters in any set of this
partition are represented by the same candidate  given a partition of the set of voters  the
best set of candidates for this partition can be found by the computation of a matching in
a bipartite auxiliary graph  since we may try all o kn    o nn   partitions of the set of
voters into k sets the resulting algorithm shows fixed parameter tractability 
proposition     minimax  cc multiwinner and  minimax  m multiwinner can
be solved in nn  poly n  m  time for an instance with n voters and m candidates 
proof  first  we present a solution strategy for minimax cc mw  to find a set of k
winners  try all o kn   partitions of the set of voters into k subsets  in the case of a yesinstance of minimax cc mw  there must be a partition v            vk of the multiset of voters
   

fibetzler  slinko    uhlmann

v as follows  for every vi   all voters of vi are assigned to the same candidate c of an optimal
set of k winners and no other voter is assigned to c  hence  for every partition  it remains to
select k candidates  one candidate ci for every subset vi   such that by assigning the voters
in vi to ci the misrepresentation of any voter is at most r  for minimax cc mw the
set of candidates can be determined by computing a maximum cardinality matching in the
following bipartite graph  one part of the graph represents the set of candidates and the
other part the set  v            vk    moreover  there is an edge between a vertex representing a
candidate c and a vertex representing a subset vi if and only if r v  c   r for all v  vi   it is
straightforward to verify that all voters can be represented with maximal misrepresentation
bound r if and only if there is a maximum cardinality matching of size k  all vertices
representing the subsets are matched  in the constructed graph 
regarding the running time  the computation of a maximum weight matching in a
bipartite graph with nv vertices and ne edges can be accomplished in o nv  ne   nv  log nv   
time  fredman   tarjan         since the number of edges and vertices in the constructed
bipartite graph are polynomial in the number of candidates and k  n  the claimed running
time follows 
next  we focus on cc mw  again  we try all partitions of the voters into k subsets 
for every such partition  we compute a maximum weight matching in the following edgeweighted bipartite graph  one part consists of vertices corresponding to candidates and
the other part of vertices corresponding to the subsets of the partition v            vk of the
multiset of voters 
pmoreover  there is an edge between every vertex c and every vertex vi
with weight t  vvi r v  c   where t is a positive integer that is large enough to ensure
that all weights are positive  the crucial observation is that in a maximum weight matching
every vertex from v            vk is matched since the edge weights are positive  here we assume
that k  m   hence  the computation of a maximum weight matching yields a set of k
candidates representing the subsets of voters as good as possible  more specifically 
let w denote the weight of the maximum weight matching  then  kt  w is the total
misrepresentation under the corresponding assignment 
finally  observe that for the two problems where the assignment of the voters to the
winners must fulfill the m  criterion we can proceed in the same way with the single exception
that we need only to consider partitions such that every subset contains at least n k and
at most n k voters  the running time bound follows in complete analogy to minimax
cc mw as discussed above 
      the number of candidates as parameter
for a fixed number of candidates all four considered multiwinner problems can be solved
efficiently  for  minimax  cc multiwinner parameterizedby the number m of candim
dates fixed parameter tractability is trivial  we can test all m
k    subsets of candidates
and report a set of candidates with minimum total misrepresentation  to this end  one
assigns every voter v to the candidate of the considered subset that represents v in the
best possible way and then directly obtains the sum of misrepresentations or maximum
misrepresentation 
clearly  such an assignment of the voters does not have to fulfill the m  criterion  however  for  minimax  m multiwinner  one can apply network flow algorithms to find an
   

fion the computation of fully proportional representation

optimal assignment of the voters to a size k subset c  of the set of candidates  see the
preliminaries in subsection     for basic definitions regarding network flows  
for minimax m multiwinner  construct a directed network with a vertex for every
candidate from c    one vertex for every voter  a source  and a sink vertex  there is an
arc with capacity n k and lower bound of n k from the source to every candidatevertex    moreover  there is a capacity one arc from a candidate vertex to a votervertex if and only if the corresponding candidate can represent the corresponding voter
with misrepresentation at most r  finally  there is an arc with capacity one from every
voter vertex to the sink vertex  it is straightforward to verify that there is a network
flow of size n if and only if there is an assignment from the voters to c  that satisfies the
m  criterion and every voter is represented with misrepresentation at most r 
for m multiwinner  the construction given for the minimax version can be further
extended  in particular  it follows from theorem   by procaccia et al          that finding
an m  criterion fulfilling assignment from v to c  with minimum total misrepresentation
can be accomplished in polynomial time by the computation of a transportation problem
or  equivalently  by the computation of a minimum weight maximum flow 
proposition     minimax  cc multiwinner and  minimax  m multiwinner can
be solved in o  m  nm  and o  m  poly n  m   time  respectively  for instances with m
candidates 

   the number of winners and the misrepresentation bound as
parameters
in this section  we show that all four problems for the approval and the borda misrepresentation functions are w    hard with respect to the number of winners  for both misrepresentation functions we provide one parameterized reduction that works for all four
problems  we further investigate the misrepresentation bound r as parameter  while for
the approval misrepresentation function np hardness for r     follows directly from the
parameterized reduction with respect to the number of winners  for the borda misrepresentation function  this parameter needs to be investigated separately  we show that cc mw
and m mw are in xp with respect to r  that is  they are solvable in polynomial time
when r is constant  however  the corresponding algorithm does not show fixed parameter
tractability with respect to r  the question whether or not our result can be extended
to fixed parameter tractability with respect to r is left open  we present  however  some
fixed parameter tractability results with respect to the composite parameter  r  k  at the
end of this section  an overview of the results can be found in table   
    the approval misrepresentation function
we provide a reduction from the w    complete hitting set problem to establish w   hardness for all four problems  before doing so  we discuss some related results  in the conference paper  procaccia  rosenschein    zohar        it was stated that the np hardness
for cc multiwinner and m multiwinner follows from a reduction from max k cover
   the problem variant with lower bounds  demands  can be solved in polynomial time by a simple reduction
to the normal flow problem  ahuja  magnanti    orlin        section      

   

fibetzler  slinko    uhlmann

 omitting the problem definition and the construction  but in the subsequent journal paper  procaccia et al         the reduction was given from exact   cover  although this
is sufficient to show np hardness  a reduction from exact   cover does not imply w   hardness  the reduction given here is conceptually similar but requires some additional
voters to deal with the fact that the sets of a hitting set instance might come with
different unbounded size 
theorem    for the approval misrepresentation function   minimax  cc multiwinner
and  minimax  m multiwinner are w    hard with respect to the number k of winners
even if r      minimax cc multiwinner and minimax m multiwinner are npcomplete 
proof  first  we show w    hardness for m multiwinner  then  we argue that the presented reduction works for the other three problems as well 
given an instance of hitting set  f    f            fn    u    u            um    k   build an
instance of m multiwinner with set c of candidates as follows  there is a candidate ci 
c for every element ui  u   the multiset of voters is vf  d  where vf     vf   f  f 
is the multiset of voters indexed by f and  d    n k     is a set of dummy voters 
furthermore  for every f  f and every ui  u   let r vf   ci        if ui  f and r vf   ci     
   otherwise  finally  for every d  d and every ui  u   set r d  ci         this completes
the construction  for the correctness we show the following 
claim  there is a hitting set of size k for f if and only if there is a winner set
of size k for m multiwinner that represents all voters with total misrepresentation r     
  let u  denote a size k hitting set for f and c      ci   ui  u     we show that one can
build a mapping w   v  c  that respects the m  criterion and with total misrepresentation
zero  first  for every f  f  set w vf      ci for an arbitrary chosen element ui  f  u   
clearly  r vf   ci        so far  the n voters from vf are assigned to the candidates from c 
and it remains to assign the n k   voters from d  since each candidate in c  can represent
each dummy voter in d with misrepresentation zero  we can easily extend this assignment
so that each candidate from c  is assigned to exactly n voters 
 plet c   c denote a size k winner set and let w be a mapping from v to c  such
that vv r v  w v        since a voter vf  vf can only be represented with cost zero by
a candidate ci if ui  f   the set u      ui   ci  c    is a size k hitting set for f 
this completes the proof for m multiwinner  it is straightforward to verify that
the same construction yields a parameterized reduction for cc multiwinner  finally 
the w    hardness for the minimax versions follows directly by observation   since the
reduction works for r      moreover  np hardness directly follows since the reduction can
clearly be carried out in polynomial time and containment in np is obvious 
    the borda misrepresentation function
we refine the reduction from the previous subsection to show that also for the borda misrepresentation function the considered problems are w    hard with respect to the number k of
   

fion the computation of fully proportional representation

winners as the parameter  however  in contrast to the case of the approval misrepresentation function the reduction does not hold for the case that r      hence  we investigate the
parameter total misrepresentation r as well as the composite parameter  r  k  subsequently 
      the number of winners as parameter
for the borda misrepresentation function  we also provide a many one reduction from
hitting set for m multiwinner and then argue that the presented reduction works
for the other three problems as well  for cc multiwinner w    hardness also directly
follows from the np hardness reduction  also from hitting set  provided by lu and
boutilier        thm       our reduction  however  can deal with the m criterion and can
be adopted to the minimax versions of the two rules  in particular  using some padding of
candidates and voters to deal with the m criterion 
theorem     minimax  cc multiwinner and  minimax  m multiwinner are w   hard with respect to the number k of winners for the borda misrepresentation function 
minimax cc multiwinner and minimax m multiwinner are np complete 
proof  first  we show w    hardness for m multiwinner by a parameterized reduction
from hitting set  given an hs instance  f    f            fn    u    u            um    k  build an
instance of m multiwinner as follows  let z    nmk  the set c of candidates is cu  b 
where cu     cu   u  u   and b     b i           bzi      i  nk   moreover  the multiset of
voters is vf  d  where vf     vi   fi  f  and d     d            dn k      for each voter his
misrepresentation function is given by his preference list  
each of the n set voters vi  vf has the following preference list 
 cu   u  fi     b i           bzi    cu   u  u   fi      b j           bzj      j  nk  j    i  
finally  for each i              n k       the voter di from d has the following preference
list 
c    c            cm   b n i           bzn i    b j           bzj      j  nk  j    n   i  
this completes the construction  for the correctness we show the following 
claim  there is a size k hitting set for f if and only if there is a size k winner
set for m multiwinner that represents all voters with total misrepresentation
at most z   nmk 
  let u  denote a size k hitting set for f and c      cu   u  u     we build a
mapping w   v  c  as follows  first  for every fi  f  set w vi      cu for an arbitrarily
chosen element u  fi u    clearly  r vi   cu    m since the elements in fi top the preference
list of vi and  fi    m  so far  the n voters from vf are assigned to the candidates from c   
   the proof is provided in the extended version that appeared at the third international workshop on
computational social choice  comsoc     under the title budgeted social choice  a framework for
multiple recommendations in consensus decision making  see thm    
   to improve the readability  we also use sets of candidates in the description of preference lists  such a
set can be fixed in an arbitrary order 

   

fibetzler  slinko    uhlmann

since each candidate in c  can represent each dummy voter in d with misrepresentation at
most m  one can extend the mapping so that exactly n voters are assigned to each cu  c 
with misrepresentation at most m for each voter  thus  the total misrepresentation of this
assignment is at most nm   nm k       nmk 
 plet c   c denote a size k winner set and w be a mapping from v to c  such
that vv r v  w v    mnk  first  we show that c  can contain no candidate bji from b 
every candidate from b can represent at most one voter with misrepresentation value better
than z  more specifically  if    i  n  then bji can represent only the voter vi with this
quality of representation and if  n   i  nk  then bji can present only the voter di   since
every candidate from c  must be assigned to exactly n voters and the misrepresentation
bound is z  we conclude that c   b    
it remains to show that u      u  u   cu  c    is a hitting set for f  a voter vi 
vf can be represented by a candidate cu  cu with misrepresentation at most z only
if u  fi since all candidates cu with u  u   fi occur in the preference list of vi after the
candidates b i           bzi   thus  u  is a hitting set for f of size k 
this completes the proof for m multiwinner  the same construction yields a parameterized reduction for cc multiwinner based on the same claim  the direction from
left to right follows in complete analogy  for the other direction  the only difference is
that here a solution set c  of the cc multiwinner instance might contain a candidate
from b  however  if there is such a candidate bji   then it can represent at most one voter
 that is  vi   within the required misrepresentation bound and hence can be replaced by a
candidate cu  fi that represents the corresponding voter even better 
for the proof of minimax m multiwinner and minimax cc multiwinner  it follows directly from the arguments above that there is a size k hitting set for f if and only
if there is a set of winners for minimax m cc multiwinner consisting of k candidates
that represent all voters with maximum misrepresentation at most r    m     hence 
w    hardness as well as np hardness follow 
      parameter misrepresentation bound
recall that for the approval misrepresentation function  all four problems are np hard even
in the fully personalized setting  that is  when r      in contrast  for cc mw and mmw for the borda misrepresentation function  we provide polynomial time algorithms for
every constant r while showing that the minimax versions are np hard for r    and
polynomial time solvable for r      first  by a simple exhaustive search strategy  one
obtains the following 
theorem    for the borda misrepresentation function  cc multiwinner and m multiwinner are solvable in polynomial time when the misrepresentation bound r is constant 
proof  in every solution  at most r voters can be represented with misrepresentation greater
than    thus  for constant values of r  one can try all o  v  r   subsets of at most r voters
to find a subset v   v of voters that are not represented with misrepresentation value
zero by an optimal winner set  for each such subset v    for each voter of v  v    one
further tries all possible misrepresentation values from   to r  that is  one tries o rr  
possibilities for each v    for each such possibility  the misrepresentation value of each
   

fion the computation of fully proportional representation

voter is determined  since for borda there is exactly one candidate that can represent
a voter with a specific value  this also implies a corresponding mapping of v  to a set
of candidates  every remaining voter is assigned to the candidate which represents him
with misrepresentation value zero  in the case of cc multiwinner  it remains to check
whether at most k candidates have become representatives and whether the corresponding
set of candidates can represent all voters with total misrepresentation at most r  in the case
of m multiwinner one additionally needs to check whether the corresponding assignment
satisfies the m  criterion  it follows that in both cases an optimal set of k winners can be
computed in o   v    r r   v   c   time 
note that theorem   does not imply fixed parameter tractability with respect to r 
which remains open in this work  however  we provide fixed parameter tractability results
with respect to the composite parameter  r  k  at the end of this section  now  we contrast
the results for cc mw and m mw by showing that the minimax versions become provably
more difficult  more specifically  we show the following 
theorem    for the borda misrepresentation function  minimax cc multiwinner and
minimax m multiwinner are solvable in polynomial time if the total misrepresentation
bound r     and are np hard for every r    
proof  for r     polynomial time solvability follows directly from the fact that every voter v
must be assigned to a candidate c with r v  c      and for the borda misrepresentation
function there is only one such candidate  hence  one only needs to check if there are less
than k such candidates and  for minimax m multiwinner whether the corresponding
assignment satisfies the m criterion 
now  we show np hardness for r     by a reduction from a special case of hitting
set  more specifically  hitting set is np hard even if every set consists of two elements
and every element appears in at most three sets  garey  johnson    stockmeyer       
thm        
given such a restricted hs instance  f    f            fn    u    u            um    k   build
an election as follows  identify every set from f with a voter and identify every element
from u with a candidate  moreover  define the following misrepresentation function  for
each f    u  v   f  let the misrepresentation of voter f be zero for the candidate u and
one for the candidate v  and the remaining misrepresentation values are assigned arbitrarily
to the remaining candidates  then  the following claim is easy to see 
claim  there is a hitting set of size k if and only if there is a set of k winners
such that the misrepresentation for each voter is at most   
this shows the theorem for minimax cc mw and r      for minimax m mw 
one can use the following observation showing np hardness for an even more restricted
setting  it follows directly from the hitting set instances constructed in the np hardness
proof  garey et al         thm       that for a yes instance there is always a hitting set
such that every element hits either two or three sets from f  more specifically  in case
of a yes instance there is a hitting set u   u such that every u  u  can be assigned
   the problem is vertex cover on cubic graphs

algorithm    branching strategy for cc multiwinner for borda misrepresentation
functions showing fixed parameter tractability with respect to the composite parameter  r  k   initially  the algorithm is invoked with the arguments  v  r     moreover  c
and k are provided as global variables 
either to two or three sets from f and every set is hit by exactly one element  such a
hitting set then one to one corresponds to a winner set fulfilling the m criterion and hence
the theorem also follows for minimax m mw and r      for every r      np hardness
can be proved by similar arguments  basically  extend the previous construction as follows 
for every voter  add r    new candidates that are placed at the first r    positions for
this voter and at a position higher than r for every other voter  since these new candidates
clearly cannot be part of any minimax m mw solution with misrepresentation bound r 
one can argue analogously for this case 
      composite parameter number of winners and misrepresentation
bound
in this paragraph  we focus on the scenario that one has a small set of winners that can
represent all the voters with small total misrepresentation  this is modeled by the composite
parameter  r  k   where k is the number of winners and r is the total misrepresentation 
we show that for the borda misrepresentation function  all four considered problems are
fixed parameter tractable 
theorem    for the borda misrepresentation function  cc multiwinner and minimax cc multiwinner are fixed parameter tractable with respect to the composite parameter  r  k   where k denotes the number of winners and r the misrepresentation bound 
proof  first  we provide a branching strategy for minimax cc mw  to find a size k
solution we proceed as follows  for an arbitrary voter v  v   branch according to all
   

fion the computation of fully proportional representation

candidates c with r v  c   r  for each possibility  create a subinstance by deleting each
voter w with r w  c   r from v and recursively solve the corresponding subinstance
for k     finally  report whether for at least one subinstance a solution of size k   
has been found  the recursion stops either if k      reporting no  or if all voters are
represented  reporting yes  
the correctness of the corresponding algorithm is obvious since a voter v must be represented by a candidate c with r v  c   r  regarding the running time  one branches
into r     possibilities for every considered voter and decreases the value of k by one for
every subinstance  hence  the algorithm investigates at most  r     k possibilities 
we show how to extend this branching strategy to work for cc mw  the branching
recursion is displayed in algorithm   and is invoked with the arguments  v  r     note
that c and k are provided as global variables 
the correctness of algorithm   can be seen as follows  the algorithm first checks
whether the misrepresentation bound or the solution size are exceeded  line     second 
the algorithm checks whether the current candidate set is already a winner set  that is 
whether all voters are represented and the assignment is within the misrepresentation bound
 line     otherwise  for an arbitrarily chosen voter v  line     the algorithm tries all
possible ways of representation without exceeding the misrepresentation bound  line    
for each possibility  it decreases r by the value needed for the representation of v by the
corresponding candidate  line     if this possibility implies that a new candidate is added
to the current solution  then we can clearly assign all voters that are optimally represented
by this candidate to it and hence delete the corresponding voters  line      finally  we
recursively invoke the branch procedure for the corresponding subinstance  line      since
all possibilities to represent v are considered at least one possibility must lead to a solution
 if one exists  
regarding the running time  we show that before each recursive call  line     the
algorithm decreases r or increases  c     or both   in the initial call one has c     and
hence  c    is increased by one  line      for every further call  the only case in which  c   
is not increased is that the considered candidate c is already in the current solution set c   
in this case  one cannot have r v  c      since then v would have been deleted from v  at
the point when c has been added to c    hence  r v  c      and r is decreased  line    
since the recursion ends when r     or  c      k  line     it follows that the recursion
depth is at most r   k  moreover  in each recursive call  one branches according to r    
possible candidates  line     hence  the algorithm can be executed in  r   r k poly n  m 
time 
we remark that the results from theorem   also hold for any instance with misrepresentation functions with nonnegative integer values and   c  c   r v  c   r    r     for
every voter v  v   moreover  fixed parameter tractability already follows when   c  c  
r v  c   r    f  k  r  for any computable function f   in contrast  the branching strategy
for cc mw from the theorem   cannot be directly transferred to m mw since due to the
m criterion one cannot assign a voter to a selected candidate even if it is her best alternative  this means that in an analogous approach the parameter could not be reduced
and  hence the size of the search tree could not be bounded  to show fixed parameter

tractability for m mw we apply a different approach that employ structural observations
based on the m criterion 
consider an instance  c  v  r  r  k  of m mw  let a zero candidate be a candidate c  c
with r v  c      for at least one voter v  v  
lemma    in a yes instance of m multiwinner with the borda misrepresentation function  there can be at most r   k zero candidates 
proof  we apply a proof by contradiction  assume that there are more than r   k zerocandidates and there is a size k winner set representing all voters with total misrepresentation at most r  for the borda misrepresentation function  for every voter v there is exactly
one candidate c with r v  c       if c is not part of the winner set  then v contributes by at
least one to the total misrepresentation since r v  c      for every c  c    c   since there
are more than r   k zero candidates  more than r of them are not part of a size k solution 
for each of them there is a corresponding voter which is represented by an other candidate
of the solution with misrepresentation at least one  hence  the total misrepresentation is
more than r  a contradiction 
to make use of the bounded number of zero candidates  we provide another observation
that exploits the m criterion of a solution 
lemma    consider an m multiwinner instance with the borda misrepresentation function  if the number n of voters is greater than  r     k  then every size k set of winners
consists of zero candidates 
proof  assume on the contrary that there are more than  r     k voters and a candidate c
in the solution set does not represent any of the voters with misrepresentation value zero 
due to the m criterion and since there are more than  r     k voters  c must represent at
least   r     k  k   r     voters with misrepresentation value at least one  respectively 
since the bound for the total misrepresentation is r  c cannot be part of a solution 
based on the two previous lemmas  we show the following 
theorem    for the borda misrepresentation function  the m multiwinner problem is
fixed parameter tractable with respect to the composite parameter  r  k  where k denotes the
number of winners and r the misrepresentation bound 
proof  an algorithm can be described by distinguishing two cases  n   r     k and
n    r     k  if the former  then fixed parameter tractability follows from proposition    showing fixed parameter tractability w r t  the number of voters   if the latter 
in a yes instance  by lemma   there are at most r   k zero candidates and by lemma  
the solution has to consist of zero candidates  after removing all but the zero candidates 
fixed parameter tractability follows from proposition    showing fixed parameter tractability w r t  the number of candidates  
regarding the running time  the first case leads to a running time of   r     k  r   k 
poly n  m  while the second case can be accomplished in  r k  poly n  m  time  hence  the
theorem follows 
   

fion the computation of fully proportional representation

finally  we show fixed parameter tractability with respect to  r  k  for minimax mmw with the borda misrepresentation function  the corresponding algorithm is based on
the same case distinction as the algorithm for m mw  theorem     while the basic idea of
bounding the number of zero candidates cannot be transferred from m mw to minimax
m mw  the following algorithm for minimax m mw works also for m mw but leads to
a worse running time bound for the case that the number of voters exceeds  r     k  more
specifically  for the case n    r     k  the exponential running time part is   r   k instead
of  r k  
theorem    for the borda misrepresentation function  minimax m multiwinner is
fixed parameter tractable with respect to  r  k  
proof  consider a minimax m mw instance  c  v  r  r  k  with r being a borda misrepresentation function  because the case r     is trivial for minimax m mw with the borda
misrepresentation function  we assume that r    in the following 
in the case that n   r     k  fixed parameter tractability follows from proposition  
 analogously to the proof of theorem     hence  we consider the case that n    r     k 
let c     c            cm   and ei     v  v   r v  ci    r  for every ci  c  moreover 
let c      ci  c    ei    n k   we show that  first  every solution has to consist
of candidates from c  and  second   c       r     k  then  after removing all but the
candidates in c    fixed parameter tractability follows from proposition   
first  due to the m criterion at least n k voters are assigned to every winning candidate in a solution and hence a candidate ci with  ei     n k cannot be part of a winner
set 
second  assume toward a contradiction that  c        r     k  note that for borda
misrepresentation functions every voter occurs in at most r     sets from e            em  
moreover  since  ei    n k for every ci  c 
n     r     k  n k     r         k n k        n   k 
since in the considered case n    r     k   k  this is a contradiction 
finally  based on proposition    for the case that n    r     k  one obtains a running
time bound of   r   k  poly n  m  

   single peaked elections
as discussed in the introduction  subsection       single peakedness is a central notion in
political science reflecting elections where a single issue dominates preferences of all voters 
let us now formally define this property 
definition    let v be a profile over a set of candidates c  and let  be a linear order over
c  the societal axis   we say that an order v  v is compatible with  if for all c  d  e  c
such that either c  d  e or e  d  c it holds that
posv  c    posv  d    posv  d    posv  e  

   

 we remind the reader that positions are counted from the top so that  if a is higher in a
linear order than b  then the position of a is lower   we say that v is single peaked with

figure    an election consists of three voters with the following preferences  c    c   
c    c    c    c    c    c    and c    c    c    c    its single peakedness is
witnessed by the societal order c   c   c   c    the diagram on the left hand
side shows  for every voter  the borda score that each alternative gets from this
voter marked by the solid line  dashed line and dotted line  respectively  note
that every preference order has one local maximum  if the voters express their
borda misrepresentations values instead  then one obtains the diagram on the
right  here  the misrepresentation function for an arbitrary fixed voter has one
local minimum 

respect to  if for each i              n the order vi is compatible with   a profile v is called
single peaked if there exists a linear order  over c such that v is single peaked with respect
to   we will say that  witnesses the single peakedness of v and refer to  as societal
order 
proposition    let v be a single peaked profile over a set of candidates c witnessed by
the societal order   let r be a misrepresentation function for v   then for every triple
 ci   cj   ck    c with ci  cj  ck or ck  cj  ci and for every v  v
r v  ci     r v  cj     r v  cj    r v  ck   
proof  by the definition of misrepresentation function  see definition    r v  ci     r v  cj  
implies posv  ci     posv  cj    now the result follows by     and again definition   
in this section  we investigate the computational complexity of determining proportional
representations using chamberlin and courant and monroe methods together with their
variants  when the input profile is single peaked  as discussed in the introduction  when
the input profile is single peaked all voters can be viewed as located on a certain axis where
their location is their bliss point  their most preferred candidate will be either the one
closest on the right or the one closest on the left  without loss of generality we may assume
that for each voter her bliss point is the location of one of the candidates  who is then most
preferred by her  
   

fion the computation of fully proportional representation

it is clear that the misrepresentation function r v  c  for a single peaked profile must
satisfy the following  if we fix the voter v and change c from one end of the societal axis to
the other the value r v  c  should decrease monotonically to vs most preferred candidate
at the bliss point and then increase again monotonically for all candidates beyond the bliss
point  that is  for each voter the function expressing the voters misrepresentation by
candidates is single troughed  that is  has exactly one local minimum  with respect to the
order that witnesses single peakedness of the profile 
before describing our results  we briefly outline the typical shapes of some prominent
misrepresentation functions in single peaked settings  the borda misrepresentation function is strictly ascending when moving away from the local minimum in both directions 
moreover  if from the candidate preceding the candidate at the local minimum the misrepresentation function drops by d     points  then  for the next d    candidates on the other
side of the local minimum  the misrepresentation function must ascend in size one steps 
in contrast  for the approval misrepresentation function  there is exactly one interval of
consecutive candidates on the societal axis for whom the misrepresentation is zero while for
all remaining candidates outside the interval the misrepresentation is one  for the minimax
variants one obtains a similar structure  in the sense that there can be only one interval in
which a particular voter can be represented without exceeding the given misrepresentation
bound  note that there is some remote similarity here between the last two cases and
preferences over intervals in the aggregating range values model introduced by farfel and
conitzer        
in the remainder of this section  we provide the following results summarized on table    we show that cc multiwinner  minimax cc multiwinner  and minimax mmultiwinner for single peaked elections can be solved in polynomial time for an arbitrary
misrepresentation function  theorem    proposition    and proposition    respectively   in
contrast to the three aforementioned problems  we present a reduction from an np hard version of the exact   cover problem which shows that m multiwinner is np hard even
when restricted to single peaked profiles  theorem      however  for the approval misrepresentation function  we still obtain polynomial time solvability for m multiwinner and
single peaked input profiles  theorem      we leave open the computational complexity
for m multiwinner for the borda misrepresentation function in the single peaked case 
     minimax  cc multiwinner
we show that on single peaked input profiles cc multiwinner and minimax cc multiwinner are polynomial time solvable for an arbitrary misrepresentation function  we first
provide a dynamic programming algorithm for the case of cc multiwinner  second  we
argue that minimax cc multiwinner can be solved optimally by a greedy algorithm 
      a dynamic programming procedure for cc multiwinner
for cc multiwinner the polynomial time solvability is established by presenting a dynamic programming algorithm leading to the following 
theorem    for a single peaked input profile and an arbitrary misrepresentation function
cc multiwinner can be solved in o nm    time

we define a dynamic programming table z  containing an entry z i  j  for all    i  m
and all    j  min i  k   informally speaking  the entry z i  j  gives the minimum total
misrepresentation for a set of j winners from  c            ci   including ci  
the dynamic programming procedure singlepeaked cc mw is provided in algorithm   
we show that it solves cc multiwinner in the claimed running time  regarding the
correctness  we will show that after the execution of singlepeaked cc mw the following
equation is satisfied

z i  j    min s c      c    c            ci     c      j  ci  c   

   

then  the minimum total misrepresentation of an optimal size k winner set is clearly given
by mini k     m  z i  k   see line     
   

fion the computation of fully proportional representation

the proof of equation   follows by induction on j  first  we argue that the entries z i    
satisfy equation      yielding the base for induction  to this end  observe that if there is
only one candidate ci in the winner
p set  then all voters must be assigned to ci   yielding the
misrepresentation sum s  ci      vv r v  ci    see line   
next  we show that an entry z i  j  with j      as computed in line     complies with
equation     provided that z p  j    does for all    p   i  consider a set c    c            ci  
with ci  c  and  c      j such that s c    is minimum among all such sets  we argue
that z i  j    s c     let p   i such that cp  c  and c   c  for all p      i 
this implies that p  j     the crucial observation is as follows  if for a voter v it
holds that r v  ci     r v  cp    then the single peakedness implies that r v  cq    r v  cp    
r v  ci   for all q   p  hence  if we consider a set c  of j    candidates from  c            cp  
with cp  c    then we can assume that the value r v  cp   is the contribution of voter v to
the total misrepresentation s c     hence  by adding ci to c  there is an improvement of
r v  cp    r v  ci   for each voter v with r v  cp     r v  ci    for every remaining voter v  it
holds that r v  ci    r v  cp   and hence onepcannot improve the representation by assigning
him to ci   it follows that s c      s c     vv max    r v  cp    r v  ci      s c     d p  i 
and by the induction assumption we have z p  j       s c     finally  since the algorithm
tries all possible choices of p  see line     we have that z i  j    s c    
it is straightforward to verify that the running time of algorithm   is o nm    
      a greedy algorithm for minimax cc multiwinner
for single peaked input profiles  the minimax version of cc multiwinner can be solved
by a simple greedy algorithm  the basic idea is to iterate over the candidates according to
the societal order and to put into the solution the first candidate for whom there is a voter
that cannot be represented by the previously selected candidates  the correctness is based
on the observation that for each candidate there is a representation range  or interval  of
consecutive candidates in which the voter must be represented  thus  we can choose the
latest possible candidate that can represent the voter with the representation range that
ends first since this candidate is at least as good as every previous candidate 
in other words  the basic combinatorial problem is to cover or stab a given set of intervals
 corresponding to the representation ranges of the voters  by k points  corresponding to
the candidates   this stabbing problem in turn corresponds to a clique cover problem in
interval graphs and can be solved in linear time  golumbic         in the next section  we
investigate the relationships between the considered voting problems and special  rectangle 
stabbing problems in more detail  here  we conclude with the following 
proposition    for a single peaked input profile and an arbitrary misrepresentation function minimax cc multiwinner can be solved in o nm  time 
     minimax  m multiwinner
we focus on the case when the assignment of the candidates to the winner set satisfies the
m criterion  that is  it is required that each winner represents about the same number of
candidates  this additional constraint makes the winner determination more involved  indeed  we can show that for an integer valued misrepresentation function m multiwinner
   

fibetzler  slinko    uhlmann

is np hard even if the input profile is single peaked  on the positive side  we show that mmultiwinner for single peaked input profiles and the approval misrepresentation function
and minimax m multiwinner for arbitrary misrepresentation functions are polynomialtime solvable  however  the solving strategies  that are also based on dynamic programming  are more intricate than for  minimax  cc multiwinner  for proving polynomialtime solvability we establish a close relationship to the so called   dimensional rectangle stabbing  even et al          we start with the polynomial time algorithms followed
by the np hardness proof  the computational complexity for m multiwinner for the
borda misrepresentation function for single peaked input profiles is left open 
      m multiwinner for approval and minimax m multiwinner
we use the notation of even et al         whenever possible  the input consists of a set u of
horizontal intervals and a set s of vertical lines with capacity c s                u    for every
line s  s  informally  the task is to cover  or stab  all intervals by a minimum number of
vertical lines from s  where each line s covers at most c s  intervals  a vertical line covers
a horizontal interval iff they intersect   since a line s  s can cover at most c s  intervals 
one has to specify which interval is assigned to which line in the solution  let u  s  denote
the set of intervals from u intersecting with s  s  an assignment is a function a   s   u  
where a s   u  s  
a set s   s is a cover if there is an assignment a with  a s    c s 
s
for all s  s  and ss  a s    u  
one dimensional rectangle stabbing with hard constraints  hard  rs  
input  a set u of horizontal intervals and a set s of vertical lines with capacities c s                u    for every line s  s 
task  find a minimum cardinality cover s   s  and the corresponding assignment  

now  consider a single peaked instance of m multiwinner with r     in which every
winner represents exactly the same number of voters  that is  n mod k     for n voters
and k winners  in this case  the problem can be reduced to hard   rs as follows  for
every candidate there is a vertical line according to its position on the societal axis  since
each voter v must be represented by a candidate c with r v  c      and all the candidates
with r v  c      are ordered consecutively on the societal axis  we can represent each voter
by a horizontal interval reaching from the leftmost candidate c with r v  c      to the
rightmost such candidate  finally  each vertical line is associated with a capacity of n k 
which is a whole number  clearly  there is a solution for the m multiwinner instance
with r     if and only if there is a size k cover for the constructed instance of hard   rs 
note that for the case  when n mod k       this transformation cannot be applied since
one does not know whether a candidate line has capacity n k or n k in an optimal
solution 
even et al         presented a dynamic programming algorithm for hard   rs with
running time o  u      s      u      s     since the transformation described above can be
easily accomplished in linear time  one directly obtains the following 

   

fion the computation of fully proportional representation

corollary    an instance of m multiwinner with a single peaked profile such that n mod
k      and r      and an arbitrary misrepresentation function  can be solved in o n  m   n 
m   time 
we show that for single peaked input profiles  m multiwinner for the approval misrepresentation function  and arbitrary misrepresentation bound r  can be solved in polynomial time  to this end  we show that these instances can be reduced to a version of
one dimensional rectangle stabbing where the goal is to stab a maximum number of horizontal intervals with k vertical lines  more specifically  we introduce the following problem
which to the best of our knowledge has not been studied before 
maximum balanced one dimensional rectangle stabbing  max bal  rs  
input  a multi set u    u            un   of horizontal intervals  a set s    s            sm  
of vertical lines  and a positive integer k 
task  find a size k set s   s and an assignment a such that each of the
following statements hold 
s
   ss  a s   is maximum 
 for every s  s     a s    n k  and
   s  s     a s     n k    n mod k  where n mod k is the remainder
on division of n by k 
the last two restrictions in the problem description can be considered as saying that we
have kc   n mod k lines with capacity n k and kf   k  kc lines with capacity n k  not
specifying which line has which capacity  while for hard   rs there is a specific capacity
for every line  the other difference between max bal   rs and hard   rs is that in the
latter all intervals must be covered by a minimum number of lines whereas in the former
the goal is to cover a maximum number of intervals with k lines 
we show that the dynamic programming algorithm of even et al         for hard   rs
can be adapted to work for max bal   rs  to this end  we employ the same decomposition
property  stated in observation   below  but the dynamic programming table and the
algorithm will be different 
we introduce the following notation to state the dynamic programming  for an interval u  u   let l u  denote the left endpoint of u and r u  denote the right endpoint of u
 that is  l u   r u    let x s  denote the coordinate of line s  s and s x  denote the
vertical line associated with a coordinate x  for two integers s and t let  s  t  denote the set
of all integers i with s  i  t 
for ease of presentation  we assume that the input has the following normalized form
that can easily be established  first  we assume that all endpoints of the intervals and the
coordinates of all lines are integers  second  we assume that  x s    s  s        m   third 
we assume that the endpoints of all intervals are from     m   in what follows  we do not
distinguish between a line s  s and its coordinate x s   that is  we identify the lines in s by
the elements of     m   and vice versa   finally  we assume that the intervals u    u            un
are ordered so that l u     l u            l un    we fix one such ordering  
the algorithm makes use of the fact that there is always an optimal solution that satisfies
the leftmost interval first property defined as follows  even et al         
   

fibetzler  slinko    uhlmann

definition    let s   s denote a size k set of lines and let a denote an assignment  we
say that  s    a  has the leftmost interval first property if the following holds  let s  s 
and let ui  a s   for every s   s  with l ui    s    s and for every uj with uj  a s    
either j   i or r uj     s 
note that the leftmost interval first property is defined with respect to the fixed ordering
of the intervals  any solution can be transformed into an equivalent one satisfying the
leftmost interval first property by simply swapping the assignments of conflicting interval
pairs   see  e g   even et al          hence  there is always an optimal solution satisfying the
leftmost interval first property and one can apply a dynamic programming procedure based
on the following decomposition  analogously to the work of even et al         section    
observation    let  s    a  be an optimal solution of max bal   rs that satisfies the
leftmost interval first property  for any range  x    x         m   let ui  u be the earliest
interval among the intervals covered by a line from  x    x     that is  for any uj covered by
lines in this range we have j   i   if ui is covered by line s   x    x       x     then the right
endpoint of all intervals covered by lines in the range  x    s     are to the left of s 
basically  observation   is used in the algorithm in the following way  consider the
range  x    m  and assume that x  is the leftmost line of the considered solution  moreover 
assume that ui is the earliest interval that is covered by a line s from  x    m   then  every
interval uj with j   i will not be covered by the solution  every interval u with    i
and r u     s can only be covered by lines from  x    s      and every interval ur with
s  r ur   can only be covered by lines from  s  m   this implies a decomposition of the
instance into two subinstances  the left instance contains the intervals ug with g   i
and r ug     s and the right instance contains the intervals ud with s  r ud    m 
theorem    maximum balanced one dimensional rectangle stabbing can be
solved in o m  n  k    time 
proof  we use the following definitions to state the dynamic programming algorithm  let
kc    n mod k and kf    k  kc   for ui  u and for any two coordinates x   x  such
that r ui     x    x     let
u  ui   x    x        uj  u   j  i  r uj     x    x     
note that ui  u  ui   x    x    and u   u  u       m  
the algorithm maintains a dynamic programming table with an entry
 ui   x    x    kc   kf   b   n
defined for every ui  u   for any two coordinates x   x  such that r ui     x    x   
and x   ui   for each    kc  kc and for each    kf  kf with kf   kc  k   
and   x    x      kc   kf      and for each    b  n k  informally  the table entry contains
the maximum number of intervals from u  ui   x    x    that can be covered by kc   kf     lines
from  x    x    under the assumption that x  is contained in the solution and covers at most b
intervals  ui is covered by a line from  x    x     and at most kc solution lines different from
x  are assigned to n k intervals   formally  the kc   kf     solution lines must satisfy the
conditions  c   to  c

next  we define subsets of intervals needed for the decomposition into left and right
subinstances  for ui  u   two coordinates    x   x   m such that r ui     x    x

algorithm  we state the algorithm which will be explained when discussing the correctness
below  basically  the algorithm works in three phases  in a first phase  the dynamic
programming table is initialized as follows  for each ui  u   for every two coordinates x  
x  such that r ui     x    x     x   ui   and for every integer b      n k   let
 ui   x    x          b     min b    u  u  ui   x    x      x   u    

   

in a second phase  the table is updated  the update of a table entry  ui   x    x    kc   kf   b 
is provided by algorithm    where the order in which the update is invoked is determined
by algorithm    in a third phase  the algorithm outputs the maximum value over all ui  u
and all x               m  with x   ui and   x    m    k of
 
 ui   x    m  kc     kf   n k 
   
max
 ui   x    m  kc   kf     n k  
correctness  we show that in every stage of the dynamic programming an entry contains
the value of a best assignment of a partial solution for the subinstance with interval set
u  ui   x    x    such that six conditions  c   to  c   hold  more specifically  we argue that
for every ui  u   for any two coordinates x   x  such that r ui     x    x    and x   ui   for
each    kc  kc and for each    kf  kf with kf   kc  k    and   x    x      kc   kf

algorithm    main loop after the initialization 

for every entry computed in the initialization step  equation     the algorithm stores the
maximum value of a partial solution s     x     satisfies  c   and  c     that covers ui
 c    which is possible since x   ui and b      and that satisfies  a x      b  c    clearly 
 c   and  c   hold as well 
regarding the update step  see algorithm     let us assume that the values of all entries
that are accessed in the update are correct and well defined  discussed below   to ensure  c   for an entry  ui   x    x    kc   kf   b   interval ui must be covered by one of the lines
of  x    x     we argue that all such possibilities that hold the conditions c    c  are considered systematically and the current maximum value is stored in the variable m   before
going into further details  we observe that algorithm   adds one to the overall maximum
value  line     to take into account that ui has been newly covered  this is correct
because there is at least one possibility to cover ui in the considered interval  namely  x 
can always cover u  since x   ui  line   of algorithm    and b     line   of algorithm    
lines   to    of algorithm   consider the possibility that x  is used to cover ui   here 
two possibilities are distinguished  the first investigated possibility  line   to line   of
algorithm    is that ui is covered by x  and x  can cover at least one more interval  that
is  b      in this case  we can compute the optimal value based on the value for the
subinstance not containing ui and in which x  is in the solution but can be assigned to
one interval less  to this end  b is decreased by one  that is   c   holds  and all possible
intervals in u  ui   x    x       ui    line    are checked to be the leftmost covered interval in
a corresponding subsolution  moreover  since kf and kc remain the same and we assume
that conditions  c     c    and  c   hold for  uj   x    x    kc   kf   b      they also hold for
 ui   x    x    kc   kf   b  
the second investigated possibility  lines   to    of algorithm    is that ui is covered
by x  and x  can cover at most one interval  that is  b      this case can be traced back
to the same subinstance without ui and x    to access the corresponding possibilities in the
dynamic programming table  algorithm   tries all possible lines to be new solution lines
 line    and leftmost intervals to be covered in the new subinstance  line     then  it
   

fibetzler  slinko    uhlmann

chooses the maximum of assigning a capacity of n k  line     or n k  line     to
x   note that since    kc   kf  line   of algorithm    at least one of these two cases must
be possible  if there is at least one further interval to be covered  that is  u  ui   x    x     
 ui    
     assume that we have a solution corresponding to a table entry  uj   x   x    kc 
   kf   n k    line     or  uj   x   x    kc   kf     n k    line      respectively  and hence 
fulfilling the conditions  c   to  c   for the corresponding subinstance  then  clearly
adding x  to this solution and assigning ui to x  gives a solution fulfilling all constraints
for  ui   x    x    kc   kf   b  for b     
the following loop of algorithm    lines    to     tries all possibilities to cover ui
by a line x    x    if x    x    according to observation    the instance can be divided
into two subinstances  all combinations of sizes of the subsolutions are tested by iterating
over kcl   kcr   kfl   and kfr  lines    and      in lines    to    algorithm   computes an
optimal solution for the left subinstance and in lines    to    it computes a solution
for the right subinstance obtained after assigning ui to x  the decomposition into the
subinstances defined by the interval sets ur  ui   x  x    x    and ul  ui   x  x    x    follows directly
from observation    moreover  since x  is part of the left subinstance with unchanged
capacity bound b  conditions  c     c   and  c   hold  it remains to show that  c   
 c   and  c   hold  that is  in addition to x  a considered subsolution consists of kc lines
that are assigned to at most n k intervals and kf lines that are assigned to at most n k
intervals  in any considered possibility  only x is newly specified as a solution line and
according to the decomposition  see observation   and the definitions of ul   ur   it is part of
the right subinstance  in lines    and     algorithm   chooses the maximum between the
possibilities that x can be assigned to at most n k or n k intervals  respectively  and
adapts the values or kcr and kfr accordingly when accessing the corresponding table entries 
hence  all conditions hold 
now  consider the output of the overall algorithm  see equation      the first maximum
function iterates over all intervals ui and possible leftmost solution lines and hence will find a
pair ui and x  as follows  the interval ui is the leftmost interval that is covered by a solution
with leftmost interval first property and x  is the leftmost line of the considered solution 
then  the second maximum function chooses the maximum of the two cases that x  is
assigned to at most n k or n k intervals  respectively  since
for the
s  c   to  c   hold

corresponding entries  the algorithm outputs the maximum   ss  a s   overall s      m 
and corresponding assignments a fulfilling the further constraints of the definition of maxbal  rs 
it remains to show that the algorithm only accesses well defined entries  that is  the
accessed entries have been computed before  this is ensured by iterating over the dynamic programming table as described in algorithm    regarding the computation of
 uj   x    x    kc   kf   b     in line   of algorithm    all parameters values except b are the
same as in the current entry  in line   algorithm   iterates over b in increasing order
and  hence   uj   x    x    kc   kf   b     has been computed before it is accessed  moreover 
the condition b     in line   of algorithm   ensures that  uj   x    x    kc   kf   b     is well
defined  in lines    and    of algorithm    the accessed range  x   x    is smaller than the
range from x  to x    since the algorithm iterates over ranges according to increasing size
 line   in algorithm    and the other parameter values have also been considered in former
iteration loops  the entry has been computed before  in line    of algorithm   the accessed
   

fion the computation of fully proportional representation

entry has a range from x  to x      x  in lines     and    the considered range  x  x   
is also strictly smaller than the range  x    x     again  according to line   in algorithm    
the entries have been computed before 
running time  regarding the running time  the update can be accomplished in o mk  n 
time  see algorithm    by iterating over at most m coordinates of the lines in s  line     
less than k  cases in lines    and     and less than n intervals in the inner loops in
lines        and     respectively  the overall loop  algorithm    gives an additional factor
of o m  n  k   by an appropriate implementation it can be accomplished by iterating over
less than m  coordinate ranges  line     less than k  possibilities in lines   and    n k 
 n      k values of b  line     and at most n intervals in line    this yields a running
time bound of o m  k n     n    o m  n  k   hence  the overall running time is bounded
by o n  k  m    
an instance with a single peaked input profile of m multiwinner for the approval
misrepresentation function reduces to max bal   rs by the same transformation as described in section        we have a vertical line for every candidate  and a horizontal interval
for each voter v reaching from the leftmost candidate with r v  c      and to the rightmost
such candidate  the crucial observation is  that minimizing the total misrepresentation for
m multiwinner is equivalent to maximizing the number of voters that are represented by
candidates with misrepresentation zero and  hence  to maximizing the number of covered
intervals in the max bal   rs instance  altogether  we arrive at the main result of this
section 
theorem     m multiwinner for the approval misrepresentation function and singlepeaked input profiles can be decided in o n  m  k    time 
recall that an instance of minimax m multiwinner with r     can be reduced to
an instance of m multiwinner with r     and approval misrepresentation function by
setting for each voter v and each candidate c the misrepresentation value to    if r v  c   r 
and to   otherwise  see observations   and     altogether  we arrive at the following 
proposition    an instance of minimax m multiwinner with a single peaked profile
 and an arbitrary misrepresentation function  can be solved in o n  m  k    time 
      np hardness of m multiwinner for a single peaked election
contrasting the polynomial time solvability results for the other three considered problems  we show that there is an integer valued misrepresentation function such that mmultiwinner is np complete even restricted to instances with a single peaked input profile  more specifically  we show that m multiwinner is np hard for single peaked input
profiles and integer valued misrepresentation functions such that the maximum misrepresentation value of a voter is bounded from above by a polynomial in the number of candidates 
note that for establishing the np hardness we have to allow that a voter can assign the
same misrepresentation value to several candidates 
the np hardness follows by a reduction from a restricted variant of exact   cover 
restricted exact   cover  rx c 
input  a family s     s            sm   of sets over elements e     e            en   such

that every set from s has size   and every element of e occurs in exactly three
sets 

question  is there a subset
s s  s such that every element of e occurs in

exactly one set of s and ss  s   e 

such a set s  is called an exact   cover of e  since in all yes instances n is a multiple of
   in what follows we assume that n is divisible by    the np hardness of rx c follows
from an np hardness reduction for the case that every element occurs in at most three
subsets  garey   johnson        and a construction to extend this np hardness result to
the case that every element occurs in exactly three subsets  gonzalez        
theorem     m multiwinner is np hard for single peaked input profiles and an integervalued misrepresentation function even if the maximum misrepresentation value of every
voter is polynomial in the number of candidates  and every winner represents exactly three
voters  
proof  we use the following notation  consider an rx c instance  s  e   for an element
e  e that occurs in the three subsets si   sj   and sk with i   j   k  we say that the first
occurrence of e is in si   the second occurrence is in sj   and the third occurrence is in sk  
for an rx c instance  s  e   define an m mw instance as follows  the set of candidates
is
c    e   sj   sj  s 
and the multiset of voters is
v     vix   ei  e and x               fi   ei  e  
that is  there is a candidate for each element and each subset and there are four voters for
each element  next  we specify the misrepresentation functions of the voters

r vix   sj       
r vix   sj       

finally  set the misrepresentation bound to r     n  and let the number of winners be
k    n     n  before showing the correctness of the reduction  we discuss three crucial
properties of the construction 
first  we verify that the profile is single peaked witnessed by the societal order
s       sm  e       en  
for every voter fi single peakedness is obvious since his misrepresentation is   for one
candidate and  n      for every other candidate  for every vix   within the candidate set e 
the misrepresentation function decreases monotonously when we move from en to e  along
the societal axis  for z   i  this is obvious since the misrepresentation remains constant at
the value  n     and for z  i the misrepresentation value is i z   and hence the function
   

fion the computation of fully proportional representation

clearly assumes smaller values for decreasing values of z  this settles the single peakedness
for the range from e  to en   to see the overall single peakedness  first note that for e 
the misrepresentation of every vix is at least    then  since the misrepresentation is   for
all but one of the candidates from  s            sm   and   for the remaining candidates  the
single peakedness for every vix follows 
second  since there are  n voters and k     n     exactly three voters have to be
assigned to every winning candidate of a solution 
third  we show that the four voters that can be best represented by candidate ei are
fi   vi    vi    vi    more specifically  we show the following 
observation    for every ei and x             r vix   ei     r y  ei   for every y  v    fi  
 vi      vi      vi     
to see the correctness  observe that for every fixed a              n   r vax   ea      a   
and for every x           


 for    b   a  r vbx   ea      n         a     


 for a   b  n  r vbx   ea     a   b       a     and
 for b    a  r fb   ea      n        a    
now  we show the following 
claim  there is an exact   cover for  s  e  if and only if there is a set of
k    n   candidates that can represent all voters with total misrepresentation
r    n  such that exactly three voters are assigned to one candidate 
 given an exact   cover s   s  we show that the set  sj   sj  s     e of candidates
is a winning set as required by the claim  the corresponding mapping is as follows 
 for every    i  n  the voter fi is assigned to the candidate ei  
 for    i  n and x             if ei occurs for the xth time in sj  s    then vix is
assigned to sj   else vix is assigned to ei  
since in the exact   cover every element is covered exactly once  it follows that every voter
is assigned to exactly one candidate and every winning candidate represents three voters 
more specifically  for the three voters vi    vi    and vi  corresponding to the three occurrences
of the element ei   one of them is represented by the candidate corresponding to the solution
set in which ei occurs and the two other voters by the candidate ei  the third candidate
represented by ei is fi    it remains to compute the total misrepresentation of this solution 
due to the definition  every candidate sj represents all three voters with misrepresentation
   moreover  every candidate ei represents fi with misrepresentation   and two voters from
 vi    vi    vi    with misrepresentation r vix   ei     i   i       i    for x             hence  the
total misrepresentation is

fibetzler  slinko    uhlmann

 consider a size k set c   c of winners that represent all voters with total misrepresentation r    n    since for every voter fi   the only candidate that can represent fi with
misrepresentation at most r is ei   it follows that e  c    recall that due to the m criterion 
every candidate must represent exactly three voters  thus  every candidate ei  e must
represent two further voters  besides fi    clearly  a lower bound for the total misrepresentation is achieved in the case when we assign to every ei  e two further voters which can be
represented by ei at least as good as any other voters  due to observation    two such voters
are from  vi    vi    vi     moreover  according to equation   the corresponding lower bound for
the total misrepresentation matches the total misrepresentation r    n    since assigning
ei to any voter other than  vi    vi    vi    would lead to a strictly higher misrepresentation  observation     this implies that ei is assigned to exactly two voters from  vi    vi    vi     finally 
for every    i  n  there remains one voter vix that must be represented by a candidate
from c    e with misrepresentation zero  since  c    e    n   and a candidate sj can only
represent a voter vix with misrepresentation   if the element ei occurs in sj   i e   the sets
corresponding to the candidates in c    e must form an exact   cover 

   conclusion and outlook
we start with summarizing the relevance of the results of this work  this will be followed
by a discussion of closely related problems and models that might be investigated in future
research  we conclude with several questions that directly follow from our results

in the extant literature is that the corresponding combinatorial problems are np hard  that
is  they cannot be solved efficiently in general  this raises the question whether these
approaches despite the theoretically proven advantages  see  e g   a detailed discussion of
those in brams        are useless in practice 
one approach is of course to try to escape high complexity by modifying the concept
while keeping it still meaningful  in this regard we tried to change the way the total
misrepresentation is calculated taking the minimax  or rawlsian  approach  this appeared
not to help in the general caseall problems remain computationally hardhowever  it
partially helped for single peaked elections  while the classical monroe scheme remains
np hard  its minimax version can be solved in polynomial time 
in general  there are several ways to deal with np hard problems  for example  nphardness is based on the worst case analysis and hence one might be able to develop algorithms that work efficiently for most instances  however  although unlikely  it still might
happen that the outcome of an election leads to a hard instance  then  this would lead to
the situation of political impasse with unpredictable consequences 
another common approach to tackle np hard problems is to invoke approximation algorithms  while for some scenarios like in the context of resource allocation with sharable
items a nearly optimal solution might be sufficient and approximation algorithms are meaningful  lu   boutilier        skowron  faliszewski    slinko         for other scenarios  like
political elections  the use of approximation algorithms is hard to imagine  a voting rule is
   

fion the computation of fully proportional representation

a constitutional matter  whatever it is  it must be adhered to  under the current legislation
any candidate or a party can ask for a recount and  if an approximation to a voting rule
was used  they may require using another approximation which they can argue give a better
representation  it is not hard to imagine prolonged court proceedings on such matters 
based on the previous discussion  it seems clearly desirable to identify well specified
settings for which an optimal solution can be computed efficiently  this will extend the
applicability of the fully proportional representation to such settings  in this regard  we
conducted an investigation in two different directions  the first was the class of settings in
which some parameters are small  parameterized complexity analysis   the second approach
was to restrict attention to single peaked domains 
regarding the parameterized complexity of the four studied problems  most of our results are negative  see table     in particular  for the natural and well motivated parameter
the number of winners  the corresponding problems turned out to be w    complete  if 
however  in addition there is a winner set that can represent all voters with a small total
misrepresentation  three of the four problems become tractable for the borda misrepresentation function  moreover  the fixed parameter tractability results with respect to the
number of voters and the number of candidates  respectively  are useful for such restricted
settings 
regarding single peaked elections  almost all of our results are positive and come with
polynomial time algorithms  see table     a possible critique of this approach is to claim
that single peakedness is in a way an idealized model which is not robust enough  a smallest
honest mistake of a voter in filling her ballot may result in election becoming not singlepeaked  also there may be a secondary issue in the election that is also important for some
voters which may lead to the election being almost single peaked but not exactly singlepeaked  in this regard it would be interesting to investigate how difficult is to find a singlepeaked profile closest to the given one  for this one might employ techniques of the socalled distance rationalizability approach  baigent        meskanen   nurmi        elkind 
faliszewski    slinko      a  elkind et al       b   it is thus not surprising that near singlepeakedness is now starting to be an active area of research  faliszewski  hemaspaandra 
  hemaspaandra        erdelyi  lackner    pfandler         since our algorithms show
polynomial time solvability for the important basic case of single peakedness  they might
be a basis for developing efficient algorithms for such extended settings 
summarizing  our work contributes to the important topic of making fully proportional
representation ideas practical and complements the analysis of this method by potthof and
brams         procaccia et al         and lu and boutilier        
    related problems and scenarios
before concluding the work with several open questions  we  first  describe some relations
of the considered problems to facility location problems and  second  describe a reasonable
alternative multi winner model  both topics might also lead to interesting questions for
future research 
   

fibetzler  slinko    uhlmann

      relations to facility location 
a basic scenario for this problem is that a company needs to choose a set of facility locations
to serve a set of customers with as little cost to them as possible  fellows and fernau       
investigated the parameterized complexity of a variant of this problem that is closely related
to cc multiwinner  basically  the facility locations can be considered as the set of
candidates  the customers as the multiset of voters and the goal is to find a set of facility
locations to serve these customers  the only difference is the cost function  in addition
to a term that resembles the misrepresentation for every voter  customer   every facility
location comes with a certain cost that is required to install the facility 
similar to our study  fellows and fernau        studied the parameter number k of
winners selected facilities locations and the total cost  for the parameter k  w    hardness
for cc multiwinner follows from the reduction given for the facility location problem 
regarding the parameter total cost  the results of the two papers are not directly comparable  this is due to the fact that the facility location problem stipulates that there
is a minimum cost of   for serving a customer even at the best facility location  which
would be an analogue of the condition r v  c     for the misrepresentation function r  
in this case  the considered problem is fixed parameter tractable with respect to the total
cost  this might not come as a surprise since here the total cost misrepresentation is at
least the number of voters and fixed parameter tractability with respect to this parameter
holds for all four voting problems that we considered  proposition     in contrast  with
the condition r v  c     all considered problems are at least w    hard with respect to the
total misrepresentation cost  see table    
the close connection between facility location and multi winner problems clearly seems
to deserve more attention in future work  we remark that analogues of several problems
considered in this work might also make sense in the context of the facility location problem 
for example  the monroe model might apply for sets of facilities such that every facility can
serve about the same number of customers  moreover  the single peaked scenario translates 
for example  to the setting that all potential facility locations are along one main street and
each resident ranks the cost of using the facility according to the distance from that facility
to the place of his residence 
      multiset of candidates model 
there may be a compromise solution between the two systems of chamberlin and courant
and monroe  we may still divide voters into equal or almost equal groups but we may assign
the same representative to more than one group of voters  say  if there are n voters and k
representatives are to be elected we may split voters into groups of sizes n k and n k  
but allow the same candidate to represent more than one group  mathematically this would
result in selecting not a set of representatives of cardinality k but a multiset of the same
cardinality  the classic monroe        example which considers subscription of newspapers
for the common room is in fact a better fit for the multiset model  indeed  if demand  say
for financial times  is strong several copies of this newspaper can be subscribed to  we
will still need to use weighted voting in the assembly but in this case all weights will be
integers 
   

fion the computation of fully proportional representation

to illustrate the difference let us consider six people electing a representative assembly
of three  suppose our candidates must come from the set a    a  b  c  d  and the preferences
of voters are as follows 
 
a
b
c
d

 
c
b
a
d

a set variant of monroe scheme will give us the set of representatives  a  b  c  while from
the multiset point of view it is more natural to have a multiset  a    c  as the answer which
could be interpreted to mean that two votes given to a and one to c  the multiset point of
view seems more natural here  indeed  b does not seem to represent anybody nicely  so the
misrepresentation will be nonzero in the set version and zero in the multiset one 
as far as we know the computational complexity for the computation of a winner in the
multiset model is unstudied so far  on a first glance  it seems conceivable that the computational complexity for the multiset model lies between the complexity for cc multiwinner
and m multiwinner  this leads to interesting questions such as whether a set of winners
according to the multiset model can be computed in polynomial time when the electorate
is single peaked 
    open questions
several questions arise from this work 
 for cc  and m multiwinner for the borda misrepresentation function we provided algorithms showing polynomial time solvability for a constant misrepresentation
bound r  are these problems fixed parameter tractable with respect to r 
 is minimax m multiwinner for the borda misrepresentation function fixed parameter
tractable with respect to the composite parameter  r  k  
 for m multiwinner for single peaked elections we have shown np hardness for
integer valued misrepresentation functions  is the problem fixed parameter tractable
with respect to the number of winners k or and with respect to the misrepresentation
bound r 
 is m multiwinner for the borda misrepresentation function polynomial time solvable for single peaked instances 
 can the results for single peaked elections be extended to generalized single peakedness
 e g   as defined by nehring   puppe        or to almost single peaked profiles  in
some sense   this might be of particular interest if the problem of finding the closest single peaked profile to a given one would turn out to be polynomial time solvable
 for some distance on the set of profiles
