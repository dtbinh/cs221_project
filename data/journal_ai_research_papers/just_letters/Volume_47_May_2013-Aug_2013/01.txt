abstract
we address a dynamic repair shop scheduling problem in the context of military aircraft
fleet management where the goal is to maintain a full complement of aircraft over the longterm  a number of flights  each with a requirement for a specific number and type of
aircraft  are already scheduled over a long horizon  we need to assign aircraft to flights
and schedule repair activities while considering the flights requirements  repair capacity 
and aircraft failures  the number of aircraft awaiting repair dynamically changes over
time due to failures and it is therefore necessary to rebuild the repair schedule online  to
solve the problem  we view the dynamic repair shop as successive static repair scheduling
sub problems over shorter time periods  we propose a complete approach based on the
logic based benders decomposition to solve the static sub problems  and design different
rescheduling policies to schedule the dynamic repair shop  computational experiments
demonstrate that the benders model is able to find and prove optimal solutions on average
four times faster than a mixed integer programming model  the rescheduling approach
having both aspects of scheduling over a longer horizon and quickly adjusting the schedule
increases aircraft available in the long term by     compared to the approaches having
either one of the aspects alone 

   introduction
the united states air force website outlines readiness as one of the vital elements to ensure
the operational effectiveness in defense strategies  schwartz         deficiency in resourcing
for operations and maintenance is stated as the common culprit for poor readiness  since
air forces are budget constrained and highly dynamic environments  the optimal allocation
of resources to activities to maintain readiness at an appropriate level is challenging  in this
paper  we study a problem in the context of military aircraft repair shop where readiness is
defined as the ability to effectively carry out the pre scheduled missions  we need to decide
when each failed aircraft should be repaired to guarantee the availability of aircraft at high
and steady level  however  high frequency of unexpected failures in military aircraft  safaei 
banjevic    jardine        and limited repair resources such as workforce  tools  and space
 kozanidis  gavranis    kostarelou        constrain consistent aircraft availability 
motivated by the work of safaei et al                we study the problem of scheduling
a military aircraft repair shop  where a number of flights are planned over a long horizon 
every flight  also called a wave  has a maximum requirement for a specific number of aircraft
of different types though it can be partially carried out without its maximum complement 
at the beginning of the time horizon  an aircraft is either ready for a pre flight check or is

awaiting repair in the repair shop  aircraft flow over a long horizon is illustrated in figure   
the goal is to determine an assignment of aircraft to waves and a schedule of repair jobs
that will maximize flight coverage  that is  the extent to which the aircraft requirements
of the flights are met  when an aircraft fails during a pre  or post flight check  it enters
the repair shop to be incorporated into the current repair schedule  each aircraft failure
requires a set of independent repair activities with known characteristics such as processing
times and resource requirements to be scheduled on repair resources with a limited capacity

the central idea of our solution approach is to view the dynamic repair shop as successive static sub problems over shorter time periods  a solution of the static sub problem
determines an assignment of aircraft to flights and a schedule of repair jobs maximizing
the flight coverage  when a failed aircraft enters the repair shop while the previous repair
schedule is still under execution  we reschedule the repair activities by solving a new static
sub problem 
after proving the np hardness of the static sub problem  we explore several techniques
to solve the problem  mixed integer programming  mip   constraint programming  cp  
logic based benders decomposition  lbbd  using either mip or cp  and a dispatching
heuristic motivated by the apparent tardiness cost  atc  dispatching rule  we then
design three different rescheduling policies based on the length of the scheduling horizon
and how frequently rescheduling is done 
we perform two separate empirical studies  the first indicates that the integration of
the dispatching heuristic and lbbd results in the lowest mean run time of the techniques
tested to optimally schedule the repair shop  the second experiment demonstrates that
both defining the static scheduling problem over a longer horizon and rescheduling more
frequently provide the flights with     higher coverage than either one of them alone 
the remainder of the paper is organized as follows  we define the problem  and provide
an overview of the relevant literature in section    section   proves the np hardness of the
static sub problem  defines a number of solution approaches for it  presents the details of
the proposed policies for rescheduling the dynamic repair shop  and describes our model of
the aircraft failures  the computational results on the performance of different scheduling
techniques and on how and when rescheduling should be done are described in section   
a discussion of our solution approach and results are presented in section    we end with
conclusion and directions for the future work in section

   background
in this section  the formal definition of the problem is given and the relevant literature is
reviewed 
    problem definition
figure   is a snapshot of the problem at time    where circles represent aircraft  a number
of flights  five are shown  and their corresponding pre  and post flight checks are already
scheduled over a long horizon  it is assumed that the total number of aircraft is constant
over a long horizon  a number of aircraft  three in the diagram  are ready for the pre flight
check while others are currently in the shop awaiting repair before they can proceed to a
pre flight check  failure is only detected during a check and we assume that a check will
always correctly assess the status of an aircraft at negligible cost and that the duration of
a check is incorporated in the length of the corresponding wave

figure    snapshot of the problem at time   over a long horizon 
the goal is to assign aircraft to waves to maximize coverage while at the same time
creating a feasible repair schedule  the scheduling problem is under the constraints that
the repair shop has limited capacity and the aircraft are subject to breakdown  we assume
that once an aircraft fails  it goes to the repair shop and waits until its repair operations
are performed 
we use the following notation to represent the problem 
 n is the set of aircraft  n is the failure rate of the aircraft n  n denoting the
frequency of failure per time unit  for example if the failure rate is     per day  it
means that the mean time to aircraft failure is   days 
 k is the set of aircraft types  ik denotes the set of aircraft type k  k where k
aircraft are ready  i e   not in the repair shop at time     let  ik   denote the number
of aircraft of type k   ik    k aircraft of type k are then in the repair shop at time   
k is the mean failure rate over all aircraft of type k 
 r is the set of repair resources  called trades   the maximum capacity of trade r  r
is cr  
 w is the set of waves  each wave  w  w   has a start time  stw   and an end time 
etw   each wave requires at most akw aircraft of type k 
 j is the set of existing jobs in the repair shop  each job is associated with a specific
aircraft type  mr is the set of jobs requiring trade r  each job might require more
  

fiaramon bajestani   beck

than one trade to be completed  the processing time of job j on trade r is pjr and
cjr is the capacity of trade r required by job j 
to model the deterioration of an aircraft  each time it flies a wave its failure rate  n  
increases by  percent  i e   its failure rate is             n after the flight  if an aircraft
fails  its failure rate after repair returns to what it was just before the failure  in the
other words  as in one of the standard repair models in the maintenance literature  repair
is minimal  wang         the probability of diagnosing aircraft n as failed in pre  and
post flight checks is a function of its failure rate right before the checks denoted as f pre  n  
and f post  n    the probability of failure detection in pre flight checks is smaller than the
post flight checks because an aircraft is either just released from the repair shop or has
already passed a previous post flight check successfully  safaei et al         
to find the probability of failure of an aircraft in pre  and post flight checks for a specific
wave  we need to track the complete history of the aircraft  for example  if we assume that
a given aircraft is repaired and assigned to the first wave  then there are three paths  the
aircraft fails the pre flight check  the aircraft passes the pre flight check  flies the wave  and
fails the post flight check  or the aircraft passes the pre flight check  flies the wave  and
passes the post flight check  therefore  the availability of the aircraft for the second wave
can be represented as a random variable whose expected value depends on the probability of
these three different paths and the scheduling decisions to repair the failed aircraft before
the second wave  similarly the availability of the aircraft for subsequent waves depends
on its entire path through the checks  repair shop  and waves  as the number of waves
and aircraft increase  the size of the state space will become prohibitive  furthermore  the
repair scheduling decisions themselves impact the aircraft histories  the probability that an
aircraft is available for the third wave is different depending on if it was repaired in time
for the first wave or only for the second wave  the details on approximating the failure
probabilities are presented in section       
as the complexity of the problem has not been shown  we prove that it is np hard in
section     
    literature review
this section provides necessary background on repair shop scheduling problem and the
logic based benders decomposition 
      repair shop scheduling
repair shops have been mainly studied as a machine repairman problem  haque   armstrong        stecke        which has a set of workers and a set of machines that are
subject to failures and therefore need repair  workers and machines respectively correspond to trades and aircraft  in our problem  as the number of workers is less than the
number of machines  it is necessary to allocate the repair jobs to the workers with the goal
of optimizing a given performance measure  e g   the total expected machine downtime 
over the long term  derman  liberman  and ross        did the early work on solving the
scheduling problem of a repair shop with a single repairman  they showed that repairing the failed machines in non decreasing order of failure rate stochastically maximizes the

number of working machines  the literature on the scheduling of a repair shop was then
extended by considering multiple repairmen  preemptive and non preemptive repair  and
different failure and repair distributions  a comprehensive review of the literature on the
scheduling of a repair system is provided by iravani  krishnamurthy  and chao        
the analytical models in the literature are mainly developed using markov decision
processes  dynamic programming  and guarantee the optimality of a given performance
measure in the long term  these models often do not consider the combinatorics of the
real scheduling problems such as different repair capacity limits  different due dates  and
different resource and processing requirements  therefore  they typically result in a static
dispatching type repair policy similar to that found by derman et al          however 
in our problem  the waves have different plane requirements and the processing times and
the resource requirements of the repair activities become known when they enter the repair
shop  therefore  we believe that a better performance can be achieved by dealing directly
with the combinatorics and explicitly scheduling the repair shop to meet the waves  to
handle the uncertain and combinatorial structure of the scheduling problems  we use a
dynamic scheduling approach 
dynamic scheduling is the methodology developed in the scheduling literature where
the operational uncertainties like machine breakdowns or the unexpected arrival of new
orders prevent the execution of the schedule as planned  aytug  lawley  mckay  mohan 
  uzsoy        odonovan  uzsoy    mckay         the dynamic scheduling problem
is often viewed as a collection of linked static sub problems  taking this view makes the
myriad of algorithms developed for the static scheduling problems applicable  the developed
algorithms can deal with the combinatorics of the scheduling problems and can optimize the
quality of the schedule at discrete time points  i e   for each static sub problem  however 
as they cannot completely deal with the operational uncertainties  a real time disruption
requires modification of the schedule to either permit the execution or to improve the
quality of the schedule considering the most recently revealed information  the process
of modifying the previous schedule is called rescheduling  vieira  hermann    lin       
aytug et al         bidot  vidal  laborie    beck         how to solve static sub problems
and how to connect them using rescheduling strategies are the main aspects of the dynamic
scheduling research  although we are not aware of using dynamic scheduling in a repair
system  it has been successfully applied to a variety of scheduling problems including single
machine  ovacik   uzsoy        odonovan et al         cowling   johansson        
parallel machines  vieira  hermann    lin        ovacik   uzsoy         and job shop
 sabuncuoglu   bayiz        liu  ong    ng        vinod   sridharan        
other areas of literature with similarities to our static problem are the operational
level maintenance scheduling problem  in general  and the flight and maintenance planning
problem of military aircraft  specifically  the former literature addresses the problem of
finding a schedule for given maintenance activities such that the sum of maintenance costs
is minimized  the focus is on the operational level  determining the maintenance activities
performed in each time period  budai  huisman    dekker         starting with the early
work of wagner  giglio  and glaser         this literature was extended through developing
mathematical models and effective solution approaches for a variety of applications  frost
  dechter        haghani   shafahi        budai et al         grigoriev  van de klundert 
  spieksma         the latter literature studies the problem of maintenance planning and
  

fiaramon bajestani   beck

mission assignment of military aircraft where the goal is to decide which aircraft to fly and
which one to perform maintenance on  maximizing their long term availability  similar to
the maintenance scheduling literature  mathematical programming is the common approach
to solve the problems of this literature  kozanidis  gavranis  and kostarelou        recently
proposed a mixed integer non linear programming model to optimize the joint flight and
maintenance plan of mission aircraft 
safaei et al         modeled the static problem addressed here as an operational level
maintenance scheduling problem using mip  their mip includes an assignment problem and
two network problems  the former assigns the aircraft to the waves and the latter calculates
the expected number of available aircraft for the waves as well as the expected number
of available workers for the repair jobs  they later extended their work by using slightly
different mip model where the time indexed approach is used to enforce the workforce
availability constraint and they verified the validity of their model by a number of instances
under different combinations of workforce sizes  safaei et al         
the difference between the static problem addressed in this paper and the previous
works on operational maintenance scheduling is that our objective function  flight coverage  depends not only on the scheduling decisions but also on the outcomes of the preand post flight checks  these two quite different components of the problem motivate the
decomposition approach  logic based benders decomposition  reviewed below 
      logic based benders decomposition
the classical benders decomposition  benders        geoffrion   graves        is a mathematical programming approach for solving large scale mixed integer programming models 
it partitions the problem into a mixed integer master problem  mp  which is a relaxation
of the global model and a set of linear sub problems  sps   solving a problem by classical
benders involves iteratively solving the mp to optimality and using the solution to generate the sub problems  the linear programming dual of the sps is then solved to derive
the tightest bound on the global cost function  if this bound is greater than or equal to
the current mp solution  assuming a maximization problem   the mp solution and the sp
solutions constitute a globally optimal solution  otherwise  a constraint  a benders cut  is
added to the mp to express the violated bound and another iteration is performed 
logic based benders decomposition  hooker   yan        hooker   ottosson        was
developed excluding the necessity that the mp should be a mixed integer model and the sps
should be linear  therefore  the inference duals  hooker        of the sps are solved rather
than the linear duals to find the tightest bound on the global cost function from the original
constraints and the current mp solution  although the logic based benders decomposition
has more flexibility in modeling the problems  there is no standard procedure to derive the
benders cuts 
representing the relaxation of sps in the mp  and designing a strong benders cut are of
great importance in decreasing the computational effort to identify the globally feasible and
optimal solution  the former results in mp solutions which are likely to satisfy the sps 
and the latter rules out a large number of mp solutions in each iteration  hooker        
logic based benders decomposition has been shown to be effective in a wide range
of problems including scheduling  hooker              beck         facility and vehicle

   solution approach
the main idea of our solution approach is to view the dynamic problem as linked successive
static sub problems  as noted above  this is a common approach in dynamic scheduling 
this view results in a rescheduling strategy based on scheduling static sub problems over
shorter time periods  therefore  we have two sub goals  how to solve and how to connect
the static sub problems  in this section  we first show that the static problem is np hard
and present different solution techniques for solving it  we then define three rescheduling
strategies designed to connect the static sub problems  finally  we describe our approach
for modeling the dynamic events  i e   aircraft failures 
    the complexity of the static repair shop problem
we establish the np hardness of the static repair shop problem by reduction from a single
machine scheduling problem with the objective ofp
minimizing the weighted number of tardy
jobs and with a common due date  i e     dj   d  wj uj   where dj   wj   and uj denote the
due date  the weight  and the variable representing whether a job is tardy or not for job j 
respectively  note that job j is tardy if its processing is not finished at or before its due date 
this problem is equivalent to a one dimensional knapsack problem with non uniform profit
which is shown to be np complete by reduction from the partition problem  pinedo 
      
theorem    the static problem is np hard 
proof  we show that an instance of the single machine scheduling problem  i  with a common due date and with the objective of minimizing the weighted number of tardy jobs
reduces to the static repair shop problem  in instance i  we assume that there are t jobs 
the jth having a processing time tj   a weight wj   and a common due date d  without
loss of generality  we further assume that the weights  wj   are in the interval         the
objective is to schedule the jobs such that the sum of the weights of the tardy jobs is minimized or equivalently the sum of the non tardy job weights is maximized  from instance
i  an instance of the static repair shop problem can be formulated such that there is one
wave  there are t failed aircraft in the repair shop   n     t    there are t aircraft types
  k    t    and there is one repair resource   r       with capacity c      the start time
of the wave is st    d  requiring all t aircraft  each failed aircraft  j  has a different type 
and corresponds to one repair job in the repair shop with the processing time pj    tj and
resource requirement cj      for the single resource  the probability of failure in the precheck of the wave for aircraft j is     wj    the repaired aircraft j contributes to the flight
coverage if it survives the pre check with probability wj   therefore  to maximize the flight
coverage  the goal is to schedule the failed aircraft so that the sum of the probabilities that
   the notation used for describing a problem in scheduling literature is    where  represents the
machine environment   describes the processing characteristics and constraints in detail  and  denotes
the objective function  pinedo

p
the repaired aircraft survives the pre check  i e  
wj is maximized  the goal is equivalent
to maximizing the sum of the non tardy job weights in instance i  as the single machine
scheduling problem with the objective
of the weighted number of tardy jobs and with a
p
common due date  i e     dj   d  wj uj   is np hard  pinedo         we conclude that the
static repair shop problem is also np hard 
    scheduling techniques
we investigate a number of approaches to solve the repair shop scheduling problem including
mixed integer programming  constraint programming  logic based benders decomposition 
a dispatch rule  and a simple hybrid approach  each of the approaches is described in detail
in this section 
      mixed integer programming
mixed integer programming  mip  is the default solution approach for many scheduling
problems  heinz   beck         in a mip formulation  the constraints are represented in the
form of linear equalities and or inequalities and polyhedral theory and linear programming
techniques such as relaxation and cutting planes embedded in the state of the art mip
solvers are applied to solve the problem  queyranne   schulz        heinz   beck        
we propose a novel mixed integer programming model where the uncertainty in the outcome
of the checks is modeled as expectation  this model is different from and  as we show below
in section        significantly faster than those of safaei et al                table  
summarizes the notation defined in section     and defines the decision variables of the
mip model 
in this section  without loss of generality  we interpret w as the set of waves in the
current static sub problem and consider the start times of the waves as due dates to finish
the repair of the aircraft  therefore  we define d    di  i               w     w        to be an
ordered set of due dates consisting of the wave start times plus a big value  b  sorted in
ascending order  more specifically  di equals to the start time of the i th wave  sti   because
of the limited repair capacity  it is possible that some of the failed aircraft cannot be repaired
in time for any of the waves  in such a case  the due date of the repair job is assigned to
d w       b  in our model  b equals the sum of the start time of the last wave and the
maximum processing times of all the jobs over all the trades  i e   d w     max pjr   and we
j r

do not enforce the repair resource capacity after d w    
as explained in section      the exact calculation of the aircraft failure probability and
consequently of the expected number of available aircraft is intractable since it depends
on the complete aircraft histories  therefore  we distinguish aircraft based on their type
and use a recursive equation  equation    to approximate the expected number of available
aircraft  the details of equation     are provided later in this section  for each aircraft type
of k  the average failure rate  k   is used to calculate the probability of failure during preand post flight checks  respectively  kpre   f pre  k   and kpost   f post  k    furthermore 
the failure rate of each aircraft is assumed to remain constant in the scheduling horizon of
the static problem and to not increase after flying a wave  therefore  our approximation is
likely to underestimate the number of actual aircraft failures

figure    the global mip model for the static repair shop scheduling problem 
 the objective function     maximizes the number of aircraft assigned to waves  although we have modeled the uncertain outcome of the flight checks as expectation 
the objective function is not the expected wave coverage because  i  each wave has
specific upper bounds on plane requirements and  ii  the maximum wave coverage for
each wave is    if the expected number of available aircraft  ekw   is more than the
requirement  akw   for a given wave  the extra aircraft do not fly the wave and so do
not contribute to the coverage  by not flying extra planes  we do not decrease the
probability that they will be available for the next wave 
 equation     calculates the number of aircraft of type k whose repair due date is stw  
in the other words  summing the decision variables xij where job j is an aircraft of
type k and where the i th due date corresponds to the start time of wave w gives the

summing over the capacity required by the set of jobs under repair at time t  since
the jobs after the start time of the last wave do not contribute to the coverage  the
capacity constraint is enforced only until the start time of the last wave  i e   st w    
the logical  constraint evaluates to   if and only if its two component constraints
both evaluate to   and to   otherwise  a logical inequality evaluates to   if and
only if it is true and   otherwise  for example  if job j is under repair at time t 
both logical inequalities   stjr  t  and  t   etjr   evaluate to   and the logical and
constraint  therefore  evaluates to    to linearize this constraint  we rely on the default
approaches in ibm ilog cplex for handling logical constraints  these approaches
translate the logical constraints into their equivalent linear counterparts by creation
of new variables and constraints  cplex        
 constraints      to      define the domains of the decision variables 
      constraint programming
constraint programming is a paradigm for solving combinatorial optimization problems 
the success of constraint programming  cp  in solving a wide variety of scheduling problems
is well established in the literature  beck  davenport  davis    fox        baptiste  pape 
  nuijten         the scheduling problems are usually defined as one or several instances
of the constraints satisfaction problem  csp   baptiste et al          an instance of csp
can be formally described as a triple of  v  d  c  where v    v    v         vn   is a set of
n variables  d    d    d         dn   is a set of the variable domains  di corresponding to
the possible values that vi can take  and c    c    c         cm   is a set of m constraints

each defined over a subset of variables  a constraint ck    vi        vj   is defined on the
cartesian product of the domains of the variables in its scope di       dj and is satisfied
if the assignment of the variables in its scope corresponds to one of the value tuples in the
constraint relation  beck         representing the scheduling problems using csps results
in more modeling flexibility compared to mixed integer programming models as there is no
restriction on the type of decision variables and constraints 
cp solves scheduling problems by applying three general tools of heuristic search  constraint propagation  and backtracking within a branch and bound search tree  beck       
beck   refalo         constraint propagation  one of the key principles contributing to
the success of cp  is exploited by representing the problem as a conjunction of global constraints  each of which embeds efficient inference techniques that reduce the solution space
within a branch and bound search tree  baptiste et al          the possibility of using two
global constraints  cumulative and global cardinality  to formulate the static repair shop
problem motivates the cp model shown in figure   
to formulate the problem using cp  we use the same decision variables as in table   
however  instead of xij   we define dj corresponding to the assigned due date for job j  the
cp model differs from mip in several constraints defined below 
the global cardinality constraint  gcc  has the syntax of gcc card  value  base  where
card  value  and base are arrays of variables  values  and variables  respectively  the gcc
constraint is satisfied if value i  is taken by card i  elements of base  in our cp model  for
each aircraft type k  constraint      enforces that ukw counts the number of times that the
start time of wave w is assigned as a due date to the jobs associated with a failed aircraft
of type k 
the cumulative constraint has the syntax of cumulative s  p  c  c  where s    s    s         sn   
p    p    p         pn    and c    c    c         cn   are vectors of the start time variables  the processing time values  and the amount of required resource of each job  respectively  and where
c is the total resource capacity value  the cumulative constraint ensures that the total
amount of resource capacity used at any time never exceeds c  hooker

we implement this model using ibm ilog cp optimizer      where the default search
is used  the start time variables  stjr   are defined by ilointervalvar objects  to implement
the global constraints  we use ilodistribute class for the gcc constraint and ilopulse and

      logic based benders decomposition
as the static problem requires making two different decisions  assigning aircraft to the waves
and scheduling repair jobs for failed aircraft  a decomposition approach may be well suited 
a logic based benders decomposition  lbbd  method can be formulated where the master
problem assigns aircraft to waves to maximize wave coverage and the sub problems create
the repair schedules given the due dates derived from the master problem solution  we
propose four variations  benders mip and benders mip t  where the master problems are
solved using mip  the latter with a tighter sub problem relaxation  t stands for tighter  
and benders cp and benders cp t with a constraint programming based master problem 
all models use cp for the scheduling sub problems 
the due date assignment master problem  damp   mip model to formulate
the master problem as a mip model  we use a binary variable xij for job j and the i th due
date with the same meaning as in the global mip model  a mip formulation of damp is
as follows

mip cuts

    

the master problem incorporates a number of the constraints in the global mip model 
it does not represent the start times of jobs nor does it fully represent the capacity of the
trades  as is common in benders decomposition  the master problem includes a relaxation
of the sub problems  constraints     and benders cuts  constraints     
the sub problem relaxation defining the area of job j as the area of a rectangle with height
cjr and width pjr   constraint      is the relaxation of the capacity of a trade  expressing a
limit on the area of jobs that can be executed  the limit is defined using the area bounded
by the capacity of the trade and the time interval     m   where m is the maximum due date
assigned to the jobs on the trade  this relaxation is due to hooker              
we tighten the relaxation of sub problems in the benders mip t approach by enforcing
an analogous limit on multiple intervals      stw   for each wave w  for each interval  the
sum of the areas of the jobs whose assigned due date is less than or equal to the end time
of the interval must be less than or equal to the available area  this relaxation is a special

case of the interval relaxation due to hooker               formally  the tighter relaxation
replaces constraint      with

where    i   xij di    stw   is a logical inequality evaluating to   if and only if the assigned
due date to job j is less than or equal to stw  
the benders cuts before defining the cut formally  we demonstrate the intuition with an
example  consider a due date set  d                     and  for a given trade with five
jobs  the current master solution  x        x        x        x        and x        job  
is assigned to the second due date      job   has the first due date      and so on  if the
current solution is infeasible due to the resource capacity of the trade  then we know that at
least one of the jobs must have a later due date than it has in the current master solution 
we can  therefore  constrain the sum of the consecutive xij up to and including the ones
currently assigned to   to be one less than the number of jobs  in our example  the cut
would be 

 x     x        x     
 x     x     x     x        x        x          
these variables represent the possible due dates less than or equal to those currently assigned
for all jobs  by constraining these variables to be at most one less than the number of jobs 
at least one job must be assigned a later due date 
formally  assume that in iteration h  the solution of the damp assigns a set  q  of due
dates to the jobs on trade r  assume further that there is no feasible solution on trade r
with the assignments in q  the cut after iteration h is

number of jobs on trade r  the validity of this cut is proved in section

cp cuts

    

the master problem modeled using cp includes several constraints of the global cp
model  constraint      represents the relaxation of repair capacity limit of the trades
guaranteeing that the sum of processing areas for the set of jobs on the same trade does
not exceed the maximum available area 
a tighter relaxation in a cp based damp replaces      with the following defining the
benders cp t approach where the logical inequality  dj  stw   evaluates to   if and only
if the due date of job j  dj   is less than or equal to the start time of wave w  stw

the cp cut is based on the same reasoning as the mip cuts  if the assigned set of due
dates to the jobs on trade r is not a feasible solution for the sp  the cut will guarantee
that in the next iteration at least one of the assigned due dates will have a greater value 
formally  the cut is

where djh is the due date assigned to job j in iteration h 
constraints and mr is the set of jobs on trade r 

    
w

represents the logical or

repair scheduling sub problem given a set of due dates assigned to the jobs on a
trade  the goal of the repair scheduling sub problem  rssp  is to assign start times to the
jobs to satisfy the due dates and the trade capacity  we use a cp formulation where the
rssp for each trade is modeled by the cumulative constraint

recall that  stjr  j  mr   is the tuple of the start time variables of the jobs on trade r 
djh is the value assigned to the due date for job j in master problem in iteration h  the
parameters pjr   cjr   cr are as defined in table    constraint      enforces the time windows
similar to constraint       it is worth mentioning that in the rssp  the due date of job j 
djh   is a value  however  it is a decision variable  dj   in the global cp model 
since cp approaches are shown to be significantly more efficient than mip for simple
scheduling problems with resource capacity constraints  hooker   ottosson        hooker 
             we do not experiment with mip formulations of the sub problems 
  

fiaramon bajestani   beck

to implement the master problems in benders mip and benders mip t  we use ibm
ilog cplex      solver  while benders cp and benders cp t master problems and the
rssp are implemented in ibm ilog cp optimizer       the details on the implementation
of the global constraints are similar to section       
      a dispatching heuristic
since the static problem is np hard  solving it to optimality may be prohibitively expensive 
we therefore investigate a heuristic approach  inspired by the apparent tardiness cost
 atc  heuristic  a composite dispatching rule that is typically applied to single machine
scheduling problem with the sum of weighted tardiness objective  pinedo         the
heuristic computes a ranking index for each job and sorts the jobs in ascending order of
the index  the heuristic then iterates through the jobs  scheduling each job at its earliest
available time  the ranking index we use is as follows 
ij   st  kj   exp 

f nj
  
f cj

j

if we let kj denote the type of aircraft j  then st  kj   is the start time of the first wave that
requires an aircraft of type kj   f nj is the fraction of the total number of aircraft of type
kj required by the first wave that requires kj   and f cj is the maximum proportion of the
capacity needed by job j over all its required trades  as follows 
f cj   max 
r

pjr cjr
 
st  kj  cr

intuitively  the earlier the start time of the first relevant wave  the higher proportion of
aircraft required by that wave  and the lower the proportion of capacity required before the
wave  then the sooner the job will be scheduled  the exponential function is used to place
more weight on the start time 
in preliminary experiments  three other dispatching heuristics were investigated  with
the chosen heuristic performing best  the first two heuristics rank the jobs with slightly
max pjr  

max pjr cjr  

different ranking indices equal to ij   st  kj    rf nj and ij   st  kj    r f nj  
respectively  the third heuristic is a two stage approach based on a decomposition  the
first stage finds the number of each aircraft type assigned to each wave and the second stage
schedules the jobs in increasing order of max pjr cjr   considering the values determined in
j r

the first stage as upper bounds on the number of jobs required before each wave  our
preliminary experiments demonstrated that our chosen dispatching rule results in on average
of    higher wave coverage compared to the first two heuristics and in the same coverage as
the third heuristic while having the advantage of being easy to understand and implement 
      hybrid heuristic complete approaches
a hybrid heuristic complete approach in which the heuristic solution provides a lower bound
for the maximization objective  equation    may improve the performance of the complete
approaches  therefore  a simple hybrid first runs the dispatching heuristic and then uses
the objective value as a starting lower bound for the complete approaches  assume that the
  

fischeduling a dynamic aircraft repair shop

heuristic finds a solution  s  with f  s  as the number of aircraft assigned to waves  any of
the complete approaches can now be modified by adding the following constraint 
 w    k 
x
x

zkw  f  s 

w   k  

for lbbd variations  the above constraint is added to the master problem 
      theoretical results
to guarantee the finite convergence of a lbbd model to a globally optimal solution  the
benders cuts must be valid and the master decision variables must have finite domains  a
benders cut is valid in a given iteration  h  if and only if     it excludes the current globally
infeasible assignment in the master problem without     removing any globally optimal
assignments  chu   xia         the former guarantees the finite convergence and the
latter guarantees the optimality  as the decision variables in damp have a finite domain 
it is sufficient to prove the satisfaction of the two conditions 
theorem    cut      is valid 
proof  for condition      for the sub problem in iteration h on trade r  by definition 
x x

xij    mr  

jmr ii h
jr

consequently  cut      excludes the current assignment of master problem 
for condition      consider a global optimal solution s that does not satisfy cut     
as generated in iteration h  as the cut states that at least one job must have a greater
due date than it had in h  to violate the cut  all jobs in s must have equal or lesser due
dates than they had in iteration h  however  because the sub problem was infeasible in
iteration h  any sub problem with only equal or lesser due dates must also be infeasible as
the available capacity on the trade is the same or less  therefore  s must be infeasible and
we contradict the assumption that s is globally optimal 
therefore  the cut is valid 
an analogous argument holds for cut      
    rescheduling strategies
the dynamic repair shop problem over the long horizon can be viewed as static scheduling
sub problems over successive time periods  lets assume that we start repairing the failed
aircraft and assigning them to the waves based on the computed schedule at time    a wave
might start while a repair is under way in the repair shop  if some aircraft fails the pre flight
check  it goes to the repair shop  each failed aircraft requires a set of independent repair
activities with known processing times and resource requirements  at the repair shop  some
of the previously failed aircraft might be already repaired  some might be under repair  and
others might be awaiting repair  once the failed aircraft enters the repair shop  we have
a new static repair scheduling sub problem where the set of existing jobs  j   the number
  

fiaramon bajestani   beck

of aircraft not in the repair shop for each aircraft type  k    and the failure rates of the
aircraft  n   are updated  the set of existing jobs includes the recently failed aircraft and
the previously failed aircraft whose repairs are still under way or are not yet started  the
new static sub problem has an added constraint  namely that the repairs currently under
way cannot be disrupted 
we connect the static sub problems using three different policies denoted as pij where i
and j define the length of scheduling horizon and the frequency of rescheduling in number
of waves  respectively  in all three policies  we schedule the repair activities  observe the
aircraft failures  and respond to failures by rescheduling the repair activities 
the three policies discussed here are as follows 
 p     in figure    we show that p   schedules one wave at a time  i      and reschedules
after each wave  j       p   is a myopic policy aiming at providing the next first
wave with the highest possible coverage 
 p     in contrast to p     for p    figure     the scheduling horizon is three waves but
rescheduling is still done after each wave  p   with a longer scheduling horizon than
p   trades off the coverage among the next three waves  it is worth mentioning that
we have chosen three as the length of the scheduling horizon because three waves are
usually scheduled daily based on the real data  safaei et al         
 p     this policy has a scheduling horizon with a length of three waves and reschedules
after every third wave  figure     p   might trade off the lower coverage of the next
first wave for higher coverages of the second and the third waves  however  it has a
lower frequency of rescheduling 

    modeling the aircraft failures
to model the dynamic events  we simulate the aircraft failures in pre  and post flight checks 
every aircraft either passes or fails each check  if the aircraft fails  a new set of repair
activities with known processing times and resource requirements is added to the repair
shop  if the aircraft passes  it flies the wave if required  as mentioned in section     
after repair the failure rate of the aircraft returns to what it was before the failure and it
increases by  percent each time it flies a wave due to deterioration  if n is the initial
failure rate of the aircraft n  n   its failure rate after flying w waves without failure will
be n             w  

   computational experiments
in this section  we present two separate empirical studies  the first study compares the
scheduling techniques experimentally and presents insights into each algorithms performance through a deeper analysis of the results  the second study investigates the impact
of using different scheduling techniques and rescheduling policies on the observed wave
coverage

repair jobs  eighty percent of the aircraft are in the repair shop at the beginning  resulting

such that the number of jobs per trade is equal to  j     each job requires at least one

using a smaller value for b  the resource capacity constraint is enforced in a shorter interval

the mean run time of the mip model given by safaei et al         over eight scenarios
with    aircraft and   waves is        seconds  however  our proposed mip model has
the run time of      seconds on average over ten of the instances with the same number of
aircraft and waves  indicating that it is significantly faster than safaei et al s model 
mip vs  cp the mip approach has a clear superiority over the cp  achieving a lower
run time on     of the problem instances  the cp model outperforms the mip only
on    of the instances where it can solve to optimality within the time limit  a further

best found solution across all the algorithms  therefore  the poor performance of cp is due
to its weakness in proving the optimality 
benders cp vs  mip the benders cp approach does better than mip in terms of runtime on     of the instances while performing worse on      however  table   favors mip
in terms of the overall performance  smaller mean run time  mainly because more instances
are solved to optimality within the time limit 
benders mip vs  benders cp the benders mip approach achieves a better runtime than benders cp on     of the test problems  performing worse on about     the
branching heuristics for benders cp often lead to an initial feasible master solution with
tighter due dates than the initial master solution in benders mip  the tighter  globally
infeasible initial solution means that the cp based master problem model requires more
iterations to find a globally feasible solution 
benders mip vs  mip the benders mip approach achieves a better run time than
mip on     of the test problems and a worse run time on     achieving a lower mean
run time and solving a higher proportion of the problem instances  when the time horizon
is short  the mip approach is faster  however  with longer horizons and more jobs  the
number of constraints and variables grows  substantially reducing its performance 
benders mip t vs  benders mip the tighter relaxation in benders mip t slightly
speeds up lbbd  benders mip t has a better run time than benders mip on     of
problems instances and worse on      the mean run time decreases by    and the tighter
relaxation solves one more instance to optimality  tightening the relaxation of sub problems
increases the mean number of iterations in spite of our expectation  a closer look to the
results shows that the mean number of iterations of the instances solved to optimality by
both approaches         of the instances  decreases        and       for benders mip t
and benders mip  respectively  however  the mean number of iterations of the instances
timed out by both approaches       of the instances  increases from         for bendersmip to         for benders mip t  therefore  the increase in the number of iterations
results from the timed out instances which does not support that the tighter relaxation
requires more iterations to optimality 
furthermore  the percentage of time solving the master problem decreases compared to
benders mip  while the sub problem percentage run time increases  this latter observation
is because the sub problems for benders mip that can be quickly proved insoluble by the
initial propagation of cp sub problem model  violate the tighter relaxation in the bendersmip t master problem  therefore  in the tighter model  the sub problem solver is not called
on these easy sub problems  increasing the percentage run time spend on sub problems 
benders cp t vs  benders cp the tighter relaxation in cp based master problem
results in a slightly lower mean run time  however  as shown in figure    their performance
comparison is more even 
incomplete and hybrid approaches the dispatching heuristic is fast  finding a feasible solution to all problems  however  it finds  but  of course  does not prove  an optimal
solution in only       of the instances and benders mip t finds and proves optimality for
  

fischeduling a dynamic aircraft repair shop

these instances in      seconds on average  it seems that the heuristic can find the optimal solution only when the problem instance is relatively easy  the mean quality of the
heuristic solution is     from optimal  in industries with expensive assets  such a reduction
in solution quality can translate to costly under use of a valuable resource  e g   a fighter
aircraft costs in the vicinity of     million dollars   however  finding a feasible solution almost instantaneously for large problem instances makes the heuristic approach compelling
in situations where the long run time might delay carrying out the waves  for example  if a
wave starts within a very short time  flying the wave with lower coverage  achieved by the
dispatching heuristic  is better than not carrying it out because of the long solving time of
the complete approaches 
to evaluate the effect of combining the dispatching heuristic with the complete approaches  we examine using the hybrid heuristic complete approach  a smaller feasible set
is the direct consequence of defining a bound on the cost function  as the mip model
searches the feasible set  while lbbd methods explore the infeasible space  one intuition is
that the mip model should benefit more from using the heuristic solution  however  solving
the master problem in lbbd requires searching in a relaxed feasible space and therefore
the heuristic starting solution may also speed solving 
table   shows a very marginal benefit for bounding the benders mip t approaches with
the dispatching heuristic solution  bootstrap paired t tests  cohen        also indicate that
there is no significant difference in mean run time at p       for either hybrid 
scalability figure   shows our results as the number of aircraft per wave increases  we
 n  
aggregate results by truncating  w
  and using the instances with three waves and both three
and four trades  note that each point represents    problem instances except x     which
has only    problems instances  we omitted x      as we only have    problem instances
for that point  the y axis is log scale 
the results show that the lbbd variations outperform the other techniques across all
ratios 
summary the following observations on the performance of scheduling techniques are
supported by this empirical study 
 the lbbd approach combining mixed integer programming and constraint programming outperforms the mixed integer programming model  the mean run time of
benders mip is almost   times lower than mip  furthermore  defining the time ratio for a given instance as the mip run time divided by benders mip run time  the
benders mip is almost    times faster than mip  on average  with a geometric mean
time ratio of        the time ratios range is                  with a median of       
 a tighter relaxation slightly speeds up lbbd  benders mip t and benders cp t 
both  have a run time about     times faster than benders mip and benders cp 
respectively 
 a dispatching heuristic can provide the optimal solution for the easy problem instances  however  the mean percent relative error of heuristic is almost     overall 
indicating that the dispatching rule by itself is not effective enough for industries with
high equipment cost

    experimental results on rescheduling strategies
this sub section describes experiment investigating the impact of applying different scheduling techniques and rescheduling policies in a dynamic repair shop 
      experimental setup
for our problem instances  the number of aircraft  the number of trades  and the total
number of waves are set to                            and      respectively  each combination
has   instances for a total of    instances  each instance is simulated    times  the
parameters of the problem instances are generated as in section     with the following
modifications 
aircraft  the failure rate of an aircraft is increased by      percent each time it is used 
repair jobs  repair jobs that entered repair shop after time   are randomly assigned to
the trades  the probability of assigning a job to each trade is considered as     
waves  the start time of each wave is generated as st    rand  h    h    for the first wave 
and stw   etw    rand        for     w      as mentioned earlier the total number of
waves is     the value of h is calculated as in section     
dynamic events  to simulate an aircraft failure  we generate a random value from the
uniform distribution        for each aircraft at each check  if the random value is less than
the aircrafts probability of failure  the aircraft fails  otherwise  it passes  the aircrafts
probability of failure in pre  and post flight checks are calculated using     en   and
    e n    respectively  recall that  n is the failure rate of aircraft  n  n   which
  

fischeduling a dynamic aircraft repair shop

increases by      percent each time the aircraft flies a wave  note that passing the
pre flight check of a wave does not necessarily mean that the aircraft flies the wave  if
the number of available aircraft is more than the requirements  the aircraft that fly are
randomly selected from those that passed the pre flight check to meet the requirements 
our latter assumption implies that all aircraft ready at the beginning of a wave are checked
regardless of the wave requirements  since we have assumed that the pre  and post flight
checks have negligible cost  our assumption is reasonable to discover the potential aircraft
failures sooner which is likely to increase their availability for the subsequent waves 
we experiment with three techniques including mip  benders mip t  and the dispatching rule discussed in section      the time limit to schedule the repair activities at each
decision time point is     seconds  we execute the best feasible schedule found before the
time limit if an algorithm times out  in the case that benders mip t times out  the schedule created by the dispatching heuristic is executed as benders mip t does not create a
feasible schedule when it times out 
as in the static problem  the scheduling uses ibm ilog cplex      and ibm ilog
cp optimizer       the simulation is implemented in c

in this section  we discuss our results to compare the performance of different scheduling

the repair activities  results in flights with lower coverage than the dispatching heuristic over
two of the rescheduling policies  p   and p     to understand the mip performance  we make
two conjectures 
our first conjecture is that the poor performance of mip algorithm is because it frequently times out on most of the static sub problems and the best found feasible solution or
the dispatching heuristic is then used to create the repair schedule  however  our results do
not support the conjecture  mip algorithm only times out on     of the scheduling subproblems and a feasible solution is found in each  implying that the dispatching heuristic is
never used to find a repair schedule 
our second conjecture is that the low coverage achieved by mip can be attributed to
its different way of scheduling the repair activities compared to the other two scheduling
techniques  a deeper look into the schedules of the static sub problems shows that the dispatching heuristic and benders mip t schedule the repair activities at the earliest possible
time  however  mip usually does not  repairing the aircraft earlier makes more aircraft
available which intuitively increases the coverage in the long run  even though the number
of pre flight checks that aircraft go through increases in expectation  the quick adjustment
of the schedule makes some of the failed planes again available before the start time of the
next flight  to investigate the impact of making the aircraft available earlier using a given
scheduling technique 
we define the mean percentage of available aircraft for the first flight

where kpl and s denote the percentage of aircraft available
p ls
at the beginning of the first flight of the k th static sub problem in the l th simulation of
instance p and the number of static sub problems in pij policy  respectively  for example 
in p   policy for a given p and l  the first static sub problem includes flights       and   
then   pl is the number of aircraft available for flight   divided by the total number of
aircraft  the second static sub problem schedules for flights       and    therefore   pl is
equal to the number of aircraft available for flight   divided by the total number of aircraft 
we follow the same procedure to find kpl for all    static sub problems in p   policy  we
can find  p     and  p     using the same argument considering that the number of static
sub problems are    and     respectively 
comparing any pair of the scheduling and the rescheduling techniques in table    there
is a positive relationship between making the aircraft available earlier and the wave coverage
in the long term which supports our conjecture  if the mean percentage of available aircraft
for the first flight    increases  the mean observed coverage in the long rum  o     also
increases 

the impact of rescheduling policies as illustrated in figures   and    the p   policy
with either benders mip t or mip in the short term  i e   for the first three flights  outperforms the other two policies  however  the p   policy then leads to consistently higher
coverage because it schedules over a longer horizon and adjusts the schedule as soon as
aircraft failures occur  although p   with the dispatching heuristic also responds quickly
to the aircraft failures  it does not incorporate the length of the scheduling horizon into the
ranking index for repair activities and always repairs the aircraft for the earliest possible
time  resulting in flights with the same coverage as p    
figure    displays the cumulative percentage of the flights with a coverage less than
or equal to  for benders mip t  the dispatching heuristic and mip where  denotes the

values on the x axis  the best performing approach will have fewer flights with a low
coverage and more flights with a high coverage  therefore  its curve will be closer to the
lower right hand corner  as illustrated  benders mip t using p   performs better than any
other combination  the p   rescheduling policy is computationally more expensive than
the other two policies  its run time per one static sub problem  however  is small compared
to the length of scheduling horizon being usually one day in the real applications  safaei
et al          the p   policy using benders mip t has a run time of on average    seconds
per one static sub problem and of less than     seconds on     of static sub problems

in summary  our analysis of the results identifies the benders mip t with p    bendersmip t p     as the best combination of the scheduling and the rescheduling techniques
providing the flights with a higher mean coverage over the long term  furthermore  it
has the lowest variance for the observed coverage compared to the other scheduling and
rescheduling techniques 
the impact of modeling the uncertainty in expectation because of the random
aircraft failures  the coverage achieved by any scheduling algorithm is a random variable 
the ultimate goal is to construct a repair schedule which is optimal for the specific realization of the uncertainty that actually occurs  however  since the complete information on the
aircraft failures is not known and the future uncertainty is dependent on the previous repair
decisions  it is impossible to find a repair schedule which is ideal under any realization of
uncertainty  as discussed earlier  we have modeled the aircraft failures using the expected
value to find the optimal repair schedule  since treating the uncertainty in the expectation form may be far from optimal for the actual realization of uncertainty  we perform a
sensitivity analysis on the failure rates of the aircraft to investigate how the optimal repair
schedule by benders mip t p   is hedged against various uncertain situations 
  

fischeduling a dynamic aircraft repair shop

using the same problem instances as in section        two other experiments are set up
where the failure rate of each aircraft  n   is increased to n       and n       our results
show that while the mean observed coverage up to flight    decreases to      and       the
variance of observed coverage does not change  indicating that modeling the uncertainty
using the expected probabilistic information is a reasonable approach 
to find a possible upper bound  tighter than    on the mean observed coverage up to
flight w under any scheduling algorithm  we define a policy called relaxed which relaxes
the repair capacity limit and repairs any failed aircraft after its maximum processing times
over all trades  although the relaxed policy makes the aircraft available for the waves
earlier than any other repair scheduling policy  we cannot guarantee that it results in the
upper bound on the observed coverage unless all waves have the same requirements  the
optimal decision might be to trade off the immediate low coverage for future higher coverage
when the plane requirements for the waves are different  applying the relaxed scheduling
policy on the same instances as in section        the mean observed coverage up to flight
    i e  ow   is     higher than the best identified algorithm  benders mip t p     more
specifically  the relaxed policy results in a mean coverage of      with the variance of       
the impact of longer scheduling horizon vs  more frequent rescheduling the
p   policy changes the repair schedule after each flight and trades off the coverage among
three consecutive flights by scheduling over a longer horizon  in contrast  the p   policy
schedules for one flight and reacts after each flight while the p   policy reasons over a longer
term without a quick response to the dynamic events  as already shown in figures   and
   the p   policy with any of the complete techniques results in a higher mean coverage 
the p   policy outperforms the p   for early waves  but the p   provides the later waves
with higher coverage 
the superiority of policy p   indicates that both features of quick response to the dynamic events and long term reasoning contribute to the overall performance  the contribution of each feature is significantly dependent on several parameters such as the aircraft
failure rates  the plane requirements  and the repair capacity  when the failure rate is high 
the probability of aircraft being diagnosed as failed in pre  and post  flight checks is higher 
therefore  the arrival rate of the aircraft to the repair shop is higher and the previously
constructed schedule is more likely not to be executed as is  in such a system  frequent
rescheduling is more likely to increase the coverage  when the plane requirements of the
waves are widely varying and the repair capacity limit is tight  trading off the coverage
among the flights through scheduling over a longer horizon significantly contributes to the
availability of the aircraft in the long term 
summary the following observations on how and when the scheduling and rescheduling
should be done are supported by the second empirical study 
 solving the dynamic repair shop problem using the benders mip t scheduling technique and the p   rescheduling policy results into an observed coverage with higher
mean and lower variance than any other combination tested 
 there is a positive relationship between making the failed aircraft available as early
as possible and achieving a higher coverage in the long term 
  

fiaramon bajestani   beck

 since the variance of the p   policy with the benders mip t is not sensitive to the
small changes in the aircraft failures  modeling the uncertainty with respect to the
mean is a reasonable approach to balance against different uncertain scenarios 

   discussion
the experimental results demonstrate that incorporating both probabilistic and execution
time reasoning into the schedule of repair activities results in a better system performance 
we showed that the decomposition technique  lbbd  and the rescheduling policy p   result
in a     higher mean observed coverage in the long term  increasing the utilization of the
valuable resources  the decomposition technique considers the mean of known probabilistic
information about uncertainty over a longer scheduling horizon and repairs the failed aircraft
at the earliest time  the p   rescheduling policy takes advantage of up to date information
more frequently  it is also shown that the variance of the coverage does not increase as the
aircraft failures increase  supporting the core idea of our solution approach  the dynamic
repair shop problem is viewed as a collection of static sub problems where the uncertainty
on aircraft failures is treated as expectation 
optimizing with respect to the mean and considering a specific class of scheduling problems are limitations of our solution approach  we address each in detail below and discuss
ideas to deal with them 
modeling the uncertainty optimizing with respect to the expected coverage can have
unfavorable consequences  the constructed repair schedule may have a remarkably poor
performance for particular realizations of uncertainty that might happen in actuality  birge
  louveaux         there are a number of other possible approaches for solving the dynamic
problem  we briefly discuss each method below 
leaving some availability slack on repair resources to make the schedule more robust
and flexible  branke   mattfeld              davenport  gefflot    beck        is the
first approach  for example  branke and mattfeld              propose an anticipatory
scheduling algorithm to predict the future job arrivals in a dynamic scheduling problem  a
secondary objective  called flexibility  is included within each static sub problem to penalize
the early idleness of the machines  they experimentally show that this approach improves
the system performance  their conclusion is consistent with our observation in section
      on the positive relationship between repairing the aircraft earlier and achieving a
higher coverage  it would be therefore interesting to adjust the mip model such that a
flexibility term is added in the objective function to quantify the value of making the repair
resources available as early as possible  however  it appears that none of the existing work
on such slack based techniques uses analytical reasoning to decide the amount of slack or
level of penalization of early slack that should be used for different levels of stochasticity 
modeling each static sub problem as a two stage stochastic programming is the second
approach  birge   louveaux         the first stage decision corresponds to constructing the
repair schedule and occurs before aircraft failures in pre  and post flight checks  the second
stage decision  which includes the allocation of aircraft to flights  occurs after the pre flight
s as the number of aircraft of type k assigned to fly in
checks  one approach is to define zkw
wave w under scenario s  each scenario s represents a possible realization of aircraft failures

in the horizon of the static sub problem
p s   therefore  the objective
p with probability
p p
s   the main modeling challenge
function  equation    can be written as s p s  k w zkw
is then to calculate the probability of each scenario  as already explained in section      the
uncertainty in our problem is not exogenous information and is dependent on the first stage
decisions which is hard to represent it in a closed and tractable form  computationally 
two stage stochastic programming models are substantially more challenging than most
discrete optimization problems  dyer   stougie        and therefore the ability to solve
such models of our problem to optimality is doubtful 
the third approach is to use multi stage dynamic programming for solving the dynamic
repair shop problem  iravani et al          the goal is to construct a repair schedule at
each decision epoch  marked by the arrival of newly failed aircraft to the repair shop 
such that the coverage is maximized over the long term  using the dynamic programming
framework  the state of the repair shop at each decision time point is a tuple of the aircraft
failure rates  the aircraft processing times  and the aircraft resource requirements  the
decision or action is to assign start times to the failed aircraft in the repair shop  there
are several challenges in modeling the problem as a classical dynamic program  first 
the expected wave coverage as a result of the current state and the action taken cannot
be represented in a closed form expression because of the combinatorics involved in the
scheduling problem  second  the probabilities with which the repair shop transitions to a
new state at the next decision epoch as a result of the current state  the action taken  and
the revealed uncertainty on the aircraft failures are not known and are hard to calculate
mainly  again  due to the combinatorics of the scheduling decisions and the fact that the
processing times and the resource requirements of the repair operations become known
upon aircraft failure  the challenges indicate that the analytical tools of the classical
dynamic programming methodology cannot be used in modeling our problem  however  ai
techniques which have a broader scope of applicability such as machine learning  sutton  
barto         online stochastic combinatorial optimization  van hentenryck   bent        
and hindsight optimization  burns  benton  ruml  yoon    do        can be investigated
as potential approaches in future work 
extending the scheduling problem although our results are demonstrated for a specific class of scheduling problems where the only constraint is the repair capacity limit  our
solution approach can be adapted for more complex scheduling problems  more specifically 
the proposed mip and cp algorithms for the static sub problem can be easily extended
to handle other types of scheduling constraints such as precedence constraints  however 
modeling the problem via the decomposition approach would require additional effort  the
existence of the precedence constraints among the repair activities of a failed aircraft makes
the scheduling of different repair resources dependent  therefore  a separate rssp for each
repair resource cannot be defined  one possible idea is to represent the scheduling problem
as a single sub problem where appropriate relaxation and benders cut can be developed 
taking another perspective  we decomposed the problem into stochastic long term planning and deterministic short term scheduling problems in damp and rssp  respectively 
in the long term plan  we deal with the uncertainty using the known information on the
probability of aircraft failures to trade off the coverage between the flights  in the short  

fiaramon bajestani   beck

term schedule  we construct a feasible repair schedule to achieve the coverage as decided
in the long term plan  we then designed different rescheduling policies to investigate how
the information revealed over time can be effectively used to adjust the repair schedule and
change the long term plan  we conclude that changing the long term plan based on shortterm information which cannot be completely incorporated in the long term plan from the
beginning significantly increases the utilization of the airplanes 
a typical hierarchical optimization approach does not deal with the interdependency between different levels of decision makings  however a communication technique as designed
in this paper  capable of utilizing the short term deterministic scheduling in the long term
stochastic planning is more likely to lead to higher system performance  in the problem
addressed here  the assignment of the aircraft to the flights and the scheduling of the repair
activities in the repair shop represent the long term and the short term reasoning  respectively  as a wide range of operational decisions can be viewed as integrated optimization
problems  the pattern of the algorithms designed here might be applicable  combining
maintenance or inventory planning with job production scheduling is an example of the
integrated operational problem where at the higher level of decision making  the maintenance or inventory policy is determined whereas at the lower level  the jobs are scheduled
 terekhov  dogru  ozen    beck        aramon bajestani         if the maintenance or
inventory policy leads to an infeasible scheduling problem at the lower level  then the higher
level needs to be informed with this information so that the inventory or maintenance decisions are adjusted  therefore  the overall approach demonstrated here has applications to
other problems typically solved with a hierarchical optimization approach 

   conclusion
in this paper  we address the problem of scheduling a dynamic repair shop in the context
of aircraft fleet management  the goal is to maximize the flight coverage over a longterm by considering the repair capacity and the aircraft failures  the number of failed
aircraft dynamically changes because of aircraft breakdowns  our proposed solution solves
the dynamic problem as successive static scheduling problems over shorter time periods 
several scheduling algorithms and different rescheduling policies are proposed to schedule
the repair activities online with dynamic reaction to the aircraft failures  the length of
the scheduling horizon and the frequency of rescheduling are the features defining our three
policies 
the computational results show that an optimization approach using logic based benders decomposition  scheduling over a longer horizon  incorporating the mean of known
information on aircraft failures  and adjusting the repair schedule as soon as new jobs enter
the repair shop yield higher mean coverage and is a reasonable approach to balance against
different uncertain scenarios 
developing richer solution approaches to better handle the uncertainty is a challenging
and interesting topic to pursue in future work  however  within our solution technique 
establishing a formal framework to exactly determine how long into the future we should
plan ahead and how quickly we should change our schedule based on the new information
is also a very interesting direction for the future work  the answer of these two questions
seems to be highly dependent on the arrival rate of the new information and the impact of
  

fischeduling a dynamic aircraft repair shop

the new information on the overall system performance  how to quantify these two values
can be the starting point to provide solid responses to these two questions
