   defining problem setting
now  specified to  knowledge base   construct argumentation system f  
 arg    r   then  using chosen semantics  calculate extensions  since components
system except semantics attack relation fixed  whether instantiation
corresponds maxi consistent operator depends exclusively two components  next
definition provides formal definition mean saying instantiation dungs
framework corresponds maxi consistent operator  idea function arg
bijection mc   extensions corresponding argumentation system 
definition    mc ext   let x argumentation semantics  say attack relation r
satisfies  mc extx   every finite set propositional formulae
arg bijection mc   extx  arg    r 
means every set mc    holds arg s  ext arg    r 
every e ext arg    r   exists mc   e   arg s   example  say
attack relation r satisfies  mc extc   every finite   arg
bijection mc   extc  arg    r   sometimes  clear context
semantics refer semantics important  use simplified notation
 mc ext   say attack relation r falsifies  mc extx   r satisfy
 mc extx    following example shows attack relation satisfy  mc exts   
example    consider attack relation known defeating rebut  denoted rdr defined
follows  two arguments b  say attacks b write ardr b
conc a    conc b   attack relation falsifies  mc exts    see why  sufficient find
set formulae arg bijection mc    arg    rdr    end 
consider         denote f    arg    rdr    see mc      s    s   
s        s         denote e    arg s    e    arg s     exts  f    
 e    e    rdr satisfy  mc exts    consider argument           
note e    observe every argument b arg    brdr
conc b         words  every argument b arg    b attacks
conc b      recall definition   know every argument b 
supp b    conc b   thus  every argument b arg    brdr supp b     
since         argument b arg   supp b     
thus  argument attacked argument e    means e  stable extension
f  consequently  arg bijection mc   exts  f   hence  rdr falsifies
 mc exts

   a  b             b           case  since b attacks
vice versa  extension e    b   note conclusion accepted argument
  however  take union formulae used supports arguments f 
obtain           two maximal consistent subsets knowledge base

second scenario  one cannot expect arg bijection mc   ext a  r   but

need formally define mean many attacks  introducing notion
conflict completeness 
definition    conflict complete   let r arg l  arg l  attack relation  say
r conflict complete every minimal conflict c l  i e  every inconsistent
set whose every proper subset consistent   every c    c  c c       c      
c  c    c  every argument a  supp a      c    exists argument a 
supp a      c   a    a    r 
intuitively  attack relation conflict complete two sets form minimal conflict 
every argument built one two sets attacked argument set 
notion inspired desire describe properties class existing  and new  attack
relations  example  canonical undercut conflict complete 
show attack relation conflict complete  falsifies  mc ext  stable 
semi stable  preferred complete semantics 
proposition     let r attack relation  r conflict complete r satisfy
 mc extx   x  s  ss  p  c  
proof  let r conflict complete attack relation let us use proof contradiction  thus 
suppose exist x  s  ss  p  c  r satisfies  mc extx   obtain contradiction  proposition    r conflict dependent  let           let
f    arg    r  e   arg     arg      arg      prove e stable
extension f  first  prove e conflict free  let a  b e suppose  a  b  r 
conflict dependence  obtain supp a  supp b      contradiction definition e 
since two arguments e union supports inconsistent  now 
prove e attacks every argument arg     e  let a  arg     e  three cases 
case    supp a            case  since r conflict complete  a  attacked
least one argument set arg    case    supp a            conflictcompleteness  argument attacked argument set arg       case   
supp a            similar  since a  attacked argument support
    conclude e exts  f   easy see base e      proposition   implies
r satisfy  mc extx   every x  s  ss  p  c   contradiction

attack relation satisfies  mc ext    the idea behind name attack relation
sufficient use one argument per support since conclusions important 
arguments called big since one big argument plays role whole class normal

used big arguments  
reader easily check canonical undercut conflict complete  leads
conclusion every attack relation containing canonical undercut  in set theoretic sense 
conflict complete 
proposition     let r arg l  arg l  attack relation  rcu r r conflictcomplete 
thus  proposition     conclude every attack relation containing canonical undercut
falsifies  mc ext  stable  semi stable  preferred complete semantics 
corollary    let r attack relation  rcu r  r satisfy  mc extx  
x  s  ss  p  c  
since rcu ru rd rc   obtain soon attack relation r contains ru  
rd rc falsifies  mc ext  stable  semi stable  preferred complete semantics 
corollary    let r attack relation  ru r  rd r rc r r falsifies

hence  whole class attack relations based undercutting satisfy
 mc ext   identified another class attack relations  time based rebutting 
satisfy  mc exts    namely  every attack relation contained defeating rebut must
falsify  mc exts    observe proof following proposition based idea
example   
proposition     let r attack relation  r rdr r satisfy  mc exts   
proof  let us suppose contrary  i e  let r satisfy  mc exts    let        
f    arg    r   mc      s    s     s        s         thus 
must exts  f     e    e    e    arg s    e    arg s     obvious
argument a            must a  e    since e  stable extension 
must exist argument a  e   a    a    r  thus  must conc a       
consequently  conc a        recall supp a          supp a          
contradiction 
since rr rdr previous conclusion holds every relation contained rr  
corollary    let r attack relation  r rr r satisfy  mc exts   
proof  let r rr   since rr rdr   r rdr   proposition     r falsifies
