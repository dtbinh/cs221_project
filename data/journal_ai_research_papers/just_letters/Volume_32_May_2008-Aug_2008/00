invested consumed searching opportunities environment  sarne   kraus       
 e g   searching opportunity buy product context electronic marketplace  
scenario search costs common mas agent needs  for decision
making process  immediate information concerning market opportunities  given richness
opportunities dynamic open nature environments  central mechanisms usually incapable supplying information level completeness accuracy required
agent  certainly without cost  thus agent needs spend resources
search related activities  despite reduction magnitude search costs electronic commerce era  continuous growth number retailers virtual stores

context  cooperative search offers advantage sharing  reusing re allocating
opportunities among coalition members  sarne   kraus         example  using cooperative
search agents exploit opportunities would discarded otherwise
