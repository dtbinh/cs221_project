abstract
in this paper we show how taking advantage of autonomous agents capability to maintain
parallel interactions with others  and incorporating it into the cooperative economic search model
results in a new search strategy which outperforms current strategies in use  as a framework for
our analysis we use the electronic marketplace  where buyer agents have the incentive to search
cooperatively  the new search technique is quite intuitive  however its analysis and the process of
extracting the optimal search strategy are associated with several significant complexities  these
difficulties are derived mainly from the unbounded search space and simultaneous dual affects of
decisions taken along the search  we provide a comprehensive analysis of the model  highlighting 
demonstrating and proving important characteristics of the optimal search strategy  consequently 
we manage to come up with an efficient modular algorithm for extracting the optimal cooperative
search strategy for any given environment  a computational based comparative illustration of the
system performance using the new search technique versus the traditional methods is given  emphasizing the main differences in the optimal strategys structure and the advantage of using the
proposed model 

   introduction
coalition formation is well recognized as a key process in a multi agent systems  mostly desirable in
environments where a group of agents can perform a task more efficiently than any single agent can
 lermann   shehory         in recent years many coalition formation models have been suggested 
for various domains  talukdar  baerentzen  gove    de souza        dias         particularly for
electronic commerce  tsvetovat  sycara  chen    ying        yamamoto   sycara        sarne
  kraus         in the latter context  the most common coalition is a coalition of buyers  derived
mainly from the potential of obtaining volume discounts  tsvetovat et al   sarne   kraus       
and the ability to search cooperatively for market opportunities in a more efficient manner  sarne

the cooperative economic search  incentive derives principally from the existence of search
costs found in mas  these costs reflect the resources  not necessarily monetary  that need to be
invested or consumed while searching for opportunities in the environment  sarne   kraus       
 e g   searching for an opportunity to buy a product in the context of the electronic marketplace  
the scenario of having search costs is common in mas where the agent needs  for its decision
making process  immediate information concerning market opportunities  given the richness of
opportunities and the dynamic and open nature of these environments  central mechanisms are usually incapable of supplying such information with the level of completeness and accuracy required
by the agent  certainly not without a cost  thus the agent needs to spend some of its resources on
search related activities  despite the reduction in the magnitude of these search costs in the electronic commerce era  the continuous growth in the number of retailers and virtual stores over the
internet  followed by a phenomenal increase in the number of opportunities available  makes the
overall search cost an important parameter affecting buyers search strategy  choi   liu       
kephart   greenwald        sarne   kraus        bakos        
in this context  the cooperative search offers the advantage of sharing  reusing and re allocating
opportunities among the coalition members  sarne   kraus         for example  using cooperative
search agents can exploit opportunities which would have been discarded otherwise if each of the
agents would have conducted an alternative separate search  nevertheless  the process of forming
and maintaining the coalition induces some overhead  derived mainly from the communication and
coordination activities  sarne   kraus         thus the coalition should set its search strategy in a
cost effective manner 
a classic example of the above in traditional markets is the procurement management officer
of a corporation  instead of having each individual in the cooperation spend time and resources
on locating its specific requested supplies  the task is delegated to the procurement management
officer  here  in addition to the price discounts obtained for aggregated demands of identical items 
the procurement management officer becomes highly updated with the different offers and specific
supplies available by the different merchants in the markets  as a result the cost of locating the
best deal for each request becomes significantly smaller  in comparison to the equivalent search
conducted by each of the individuals  
the basic concepts by which a coalition should manage the cooperative search  including an
analysis and computational means for extracting its optimal search strategies  are given by sarne
and kraus         nevertheless  the assumption used in that model for constructing the coalitions
strategy is that the coalition interacts with one seller agent at a time  such an assumption ignores
the inherent strength of autonomous agents  which is their capability to efficiently interact with
several other agents in parallel  this capability derives primarily from their improved communication capabilities and their ability to process an enormous amount of information in a short time
compared to people  in this paper  we take advantage of this capability and incorporate it into the
cooperative economic search model  supplying a comprehensive analysis of the resulting parallel
cooperative search variant  as we show throughout the paper  the parallel model weakly dominates
the existing sequential cooperative search model described by sarne and kraus  it has the potential
of significantly improving the searchers performance in various environments  and always guarantees reaching at least the performance of the existing cooperative search model  in particular  the
parallel interaction is preferable whenever an agents search cost is non linear or combines fixed
   as opposed to the classical ai search  hart  nilsson    raphael        in which an agent seeks a sequence of actions
that will bring it from an initial state to a desired goal state

components  e g  operational costs   depending on the number of interactions maintained  e g  advantage of size   in such cases  the adoption of the parallel technique by the coalition suggests a
reduction in the average cost per interaction with seller agents 
moreover  the improvement achieved using the parallel technique increases when there is a finite decision horizon  i e   whenever the coalition has a deadline for finishing its search   in addition
to the advantage of reducing the average cost per interaction  in finite horizon settings the coalition
benefits from the fact that it can increase the intensity of the search and  thus  scan more opportunities  in comparison to the sequential search model described by sarne   kraus        prior to
reaching the deadline 
while the integration of parallel interactions technique into a single agents search process is
quite intuitive  finding the optimal  overall utility maximization  strategy for the cooperative search
case is not trivial at all  the major difficulty derives from the fact that different coalition members
may have heterogeneous multi attribute utility functions  therefore  extracting the value encapsulated in future streams of opportunities is complex  we overcome this difficulty and present an
algorithm for extracting the coalition strategy  our algorithm facilitates the calculation process of
the coalition strategy and it is polynomial in the number of parallel interactions  this is a significant improvement over the brute force algorithm which is exponential in the number of parallel
interactions 
similar to the model introduced by sarne and kraus         we apply the multi attribute utility
theory  maut   keeney   raiffa        to analyze preferences with multiple attributes in our agent
based search mechanism  this enables a set of preferences to be represented by a numerical utility
function  we consider the agents to be heterogeneous  i e  each having its own utility function  the
model is general  though we emphasize several specific implementation aspects relating to the b c
market  businesses selling products or services to end user consumers   where sellers can supply
almost any demanded volume  and to the c c market  transactions between consumers   where
sellers offer single items for sale  based on the proposed analysis  the coalition can calculate its
optimal strategy given the utility functions of the coalition members and the specific environment
in which it operates 
three basic stages are common to all coalition formation models  sandholm  larson  andersson  shehory    tohme        tsvetovat et al          coalition structure generation  where the
agents form join the coalition   executing the coalition task  and dividing the generated value among
the coalition members  among these three stages our focus is on finding the optimal search strategy
for the coalition  given its structure and the opportunity distribution  as suggested by sarne and
kraus         the coalition operates in its environment alongside many other coalitions differing in
their size  their members utility functions and the products they are seeking  these other coalitions 
as well as the different individual utility functions play an important role when studying the stability
of a coalition and the issue of revealing the true utility function  truth telling   the analysis of these
important issues is based on the ability to properly derive the coalitions utility given any specific
self structure and the environment within which it operates    this paper aims to supply this functionality  laying the foundation and enabling research of many of the important aspects of coalition
formation given above in the context of cooperative search  truth telling  stability  payoff division 
etc   
   the utility considered is the agents reported  not necessarily true  utility function  since the goal is to extract the
optimal strategy for a given input

the main contributions of this work are fourfold  first  we formally model and analyze the
parallel cooperative search problem of agents operating in a costly environment  the parallel cooperative search model is a general search model and can be applied in various domains in addition
to the electronic marketplace that is used as a framework for our work  second  we show that in
many environments the parallel cooperative search outperforms the previous search strategies  either
when each agent searches by itself or when using a cooperative sequential search   furthermore 
we draw attention to scenarios where sequential cooperative search is proven to be non beneficial 
however parallel cooperative search is a favorable technique  third  we supply an algorithm that
facilitates the calculation of the coalitions optimal strategy  and significantly reduces the complexities associated with the attempt to extract this strategy from an appropriate set of equations  finally
we provide a comprehensive analysis of the parallel model for a finite decision horizon  we draw
attention to the significant improvement that can be achieved by integrating the parallel technique
into cooperative search in the finite decision horizon 
the rest of the paper is organized as follows  section   reviews the related work  emphasizing
the uniqueness of the proposed parallel cooperative search model  the model description and its
underlying assumptions are given in section    in section    we formally describe the performance
of the coalition when using the parallel cooperative search as a function of the strategy used and
present the complexities associated with extracting the optimal search strategy  by exploring the
unique characteristics of the coalitions optimal strategy when using the cooperative parallel search
we manage to overcome this computational complexity  this process is described in section    consequently  we present an efficient algorithm for extracting the optimal cooperative search strategy 
some interesting properties of the new search model  with regard to the market in which it takes
place  are illustrated in section    in section    a finite decision horizon variant of the model is
discussed  the parallel cooperative search performance and its advantages over the current search
models  both in infinite and finite decision horizons  are illustrated in section    finally  we conclude
with a discussion and suggested future research directions in section

in many scenarios autonomous agents in multi agent environments may cooperate in order to perform tasks  the need for cooperation may arise either when an agent is incapable of completing a

traditionally  the majority of this research effort has focused on issues concerning the optimal
division of agents into disjoint exhaustive coalitions  sandholm et al         yamamoto   sycara 
       division of coalition payoffs yamamoto and sycara and enforcement methods for interaction
protocols  only a few authors have considered the coalitions problem of determining its strategy
in the electronic commerce domain  once the coalition is formed  ito  ochi    shintani        
nevertheless  other than a single exception  sarne   kraus         none of the proposed models
have considered a coalition search in a costly environment  and in particular none of them  including
sarne   kraus        have made use of its capabilities to maintain parallel interactions 
the problem of a searcher operating in a costly environment  seeking to maximize his long term
utility is addressed in classical search theory  lippman   mccall        mcmillan   rothschild 
      and references therein   there are three main search models that can be found in the literature 
the first search model is the fixed sample size  fss  model  introduced by stigler         in this
model the searcher first chooses the sample size and then draws a single sample where all observations are made simultaneously  the second model is the single agent sequential search  sass 
strategy  rothschild        lippman and mccall   in this model the searcher draws exactly one observation at a time  based on the value of the observations drawn till that time  the searcher decides
whether to draw another observation  his decision depends upon what he observed  attempts to
adopt the sequential search model for agent based electronic trading environments associated with
search costs are suggested by choi and liu         and kephart and greenwald         though the
main focus is on establishing the appropriate characteristics of the environment and search strategy
rather than the computational aspects of extracting it  the last search method  single agent parallel search  saps   benhabib   bull        gal  landsberger    levykson        morgan       
morgan   manning         encompasses the above search models as special cases  in this model
the searcher may choose both the number of samples taken and the sample size in each period  this
latter method  which outperforms the other two  is in fact the single agents equivalent to our parallel
cooperative search model considered in this paper  nevertheless  search theory has mainly focused
on a single searcher  looking for a single opportunity  either as a one sided  taking the environments
reaction to the search strategy used by the agent to be static  or two sided  as a matching model 
analyzed from the equilibrium perspective  model  the analysis of a cooperative search is lacking 
this  is in spite of the fact that cooperative search has been proven  sarne   kraus        to be
inherently different from a single agents search in relation to its complexity  strategy structure and
solution methodology 
several extensions of economic search theory have been suggested for the case of a consumer
searching for multiple different commodities  while facing imperfect information about prices  gatti 
      carlson   mcafee        burdett   malueg         here  we can find different variants
where the consumer visits one or more stores in order to minimize the total expenditure  nevertheless  the attempt to adjust the proposed methods suggested in these models to support our parallel
cooperative search process results in a solution complexity that is exponential in the number of parallel interactions  in contrast our algorithm for extracting the optimal search strategy is polynomial
in the number of parallel interactions 

   the parallel cooperative search model
we base our model description and formulation on the definitions given by sarne and kraus       
and extend them to reflect the agents parallel search capabilities  we consider an electronic mar

ketplace where numerous buyer and seller agents can be found  each agent is interested in buying
or offering to sell a well defined product  a product can be offered by many different seller agents
under various terms and policies  including price   we assume that while buyer agents are ignorant
of individual seller agents offers  they are acquainted with the overall distribution of opportunities
 where an opportunity is defined as the option to buy the product under specific terms and policies 
in the marketplace 
assuming there are no central mechanisms or mediators which can supply the agents with full
immediate information concerning current market opportunities  each agent needs to search for
appropriate opportunities to buy its requested product  throughout the search the buyer agents
locate seller agents and learn about their offers by interacting with them  each buyer agent evaluates
opportunities using its own multi attribute utility function  buyer agents may have heterogeneous
preferences and thus the utility from a given opportunity differs according to the evaluating buyer
agent 
in its most basic form  each buyer agent interacts with several sellers in parallel at each stage of
its search thus learns about a new set of opportunities  based on the agents evaluation of the utility
that can be gained from each opportunity in the set  the agent makes a decision whether to exploit
any of the opportunities it encountered throughout its search  i e  buy from any of the sellers  or
resume its search in a similar method  a decision to resume the search is always accompanied by
the number of parallel interactions to be conducted next 
the search activity is assumed to be costly  choi   liu        kephart   greenwald       
sarne   kraus        bakos         for each search stage in which the buyer agent locates  interacts
and evaluates seller agents  the process induces a search cost  this cost is a function of the number
of parallel interactions initiated and maintained by the agent  the search cost structure is principally
a parameter of the markets liquidity and volatility  and thus it is assumed to be shared by all buyer
agents operating in the specific marketplace  recognizing the benefits of a cooperative search 
buyer agents  interested in similar products or interchangeable products  may form coalitions  sarne
  kraus         there are various methods by which the coalition members can coordinate their
cooperative search  e g  assign a representative agent to search on behalf of the coalition or simply
take turns searching   each deriving a different search cost overhead structure  the coalitions search
costs are assumed to increase both as a function of the number of parallel interactions it forms
and the number of buyer agents in the coalition    we assume a buyer agents utility from a given
opportunity may be interpreted into monetary terms  thus the utilities are additive and the total
search utility can be obtained by subtracting the search cost that the process induces from this
value 
as part of its search process  the coalition needs to set a strategy for determining  given any set
of known opportunities  whether to terminate or resume its search  in the latter case  the coalition
also needs to determine the number of parallel interactions to be used in the next search round 
the optimal strategy is the one maximizing its expected total search utility  opportunities utility
minus search costs   as discussed in detail in the cooperative search model  sarne   kraus        
given the option of side payments the overall utility maximization strategy taken by the coalition
is always the preferred one by all coalition members  i e  no conflict of interests   regardless of
the pre set coalitions payoff division protocol  given the coalitions goal of maximizing the overall coalition utility  its decision is not influenced by the payoff division protocol  nor by coalition
   the reason for correlating the coalitions search cost with the number of coalition members is mainly associated with
some coordination overhead  sarne   kraus

stability considerations  but rather influences these two factors  sarne   kraus         any of the
agents pre determined portion of the coalitions utility will increase in its absolute value along with
the increase of the net coalition utility  thus the overall utility maximization strategy is the preferred
strategy by all agents at every stage of the search 

   parallel cooperative search  pcs  analysis
the following section formally defines the search environment and the coalitions search strategy 
for convenience  all the notations given  and their meanings  are summarized in a table at the end
of the paper 
let b    b    b         bk   be the set of the attributes defining any of the potentially available
opportunities in the market  where each attribute b i can be assigned a value from the finite set
 bimin        bimax    an opportunitys type is defined by the vector  o i    b    b       bk    assigning a value
bi to each specific attribute bi    we use o p to denote the space of potential opportunity types the
coalition may encounter  the opportunity types distribution in the marketplace is denoted by the
probability function p  o    oo p p  o       we consider a coalition a    a     a         a a    of a general
size  where a j is the j th buyer agent in the coalition  each buyer agent  a j   evaluates opportunities
using a utility function u j   o p  r  where u j   o  is the agents utility from opportunity type  o  we
denote the search cost associated with having a coalition of n agents maintaining w simultaneous
interactions with seller agents over a search round by the function c w  n  
let  be the collection of all possible sets of opportunities in the environment in which the
agents reside  given a set of known opportunities  known   the coalition needs to determine
its strategy  whether to terminate resume the search and the number of parallel interactions in the
later case   similar to the analysis suggested for the sequential cooperative search  scs  model
 sarne   kraus        we can reduce the large number of world states in which a coalition can
be  by adopting a representation of states through sets of effective known opportunities  for that
purpose we consider a function alloc     o np that maps a given set of opportunities  to the
coalition members in a  i e  an allocation  in a way that the aggregated agents utility when using
this allocation is maximized   in b c markets the same opportunity may be allocated to more than
one agent  while in c c markets each opportunity is restricted to only one agent  given a coalition

  to represent the allocation resulting from applying
a  we use alloc       y       
yn     yi         
the function alloc over the set   where  y i denotes the opportunity associated with agent a i  yi     
denotes that no opportunity was allocated to agent a i   
the computation method used by the function alloc is market dependent  while in b c markets
the function assigns each agent the opportunity that maximizes its utility   y j    arg max y u j   y   j  
        n  in c c markets alloc can be computed by solving a maximum weighted matching in a
bipartite graph  avis   lai         specifically for a set of opportunities    found in the c c
market we construct a graph g    v   v    e   where each vertex of v  corresponds to an agent in a
and each vertex in v  corresponds to an opportunity  o    an edge connects an agent a j in v  and
an opportunity  o in v   each member in the two groups has edges connecting it to all the members
   notice that  o is noted as a vector since it assigns a specific value to each of the different attributes  terms and
conditions associated with a specific opportunity  for example  a specific opportunity to buy a calculator can be
represented by the vector  o    scienti f ic       small display  pocket   y r warranty  
   if there is more than one allocation that maximizes the overall coalition utility then the function alloc chooses one of
them according to a pre defined order

of the other group   the weight of such an edge is the utility for agent a j from opportunity  o  u j   o  
here alloc       y        y n    where   a    y           an   y n    is a maximum weighted matching in g    to
illustrate the computation used by the function alloc  we use the following example 
example    consider the following environment 
environment    there are three agents  a     a  and a    searching for a product  e g   memory chip 
characterized by two attributes  b    e g   quality  and b   e g   store rating   each attribute can have
either the value   or    with an equal probability of      this means that there are four possible
opportunities  o            both attributes values are equal to      o              o            and  o   
        the utility function of agents a     a  and a  are u    o     b    b    u    o     b     b    and

table    agents utilities for the four opportunities in environment

we first calculate alloc known   for the coalition operating in the b c market  in this market

in c c markets the above allocation is impossible  since opportunity  o   can be assigned only to

notice that up to this point  the world state space upon which the coalition defines its strategy
is defined by the set of opportunities  known known to the coalition  this space is potentially very
large  in order to reduce the strategys space  we introduce the concept of equivalence between
different sets of opportunities within the context of cooperative search  we consider two sets of
opportunities          to be equivalent           if the following hold   a  vt         vt       and
 b  vt         vt        for any set of opportunities    that the coalition may encounter in the
future  for any two equivalent sets           the coalition is indifferent to knowing the opportunities
in   or the opportunities in      this is because any set of opportunities the coalition will encounter
in the future results in a similar utility  thus the coalitions overall utility will be the same in both
cases  moreover  since the coalitions decisions are merely determined by its overall utility and
in both cases similar utilities are reached with similar probabilities  the coalition uses the same
search strategy  either terminates the search or uses the same number of parallel interactions in the
subsequent search stage  for both opportunities sets 
notice that according to the definition above equivalent is a transitive relation              
   
            moreover        implies that                    given an allocation
      y         y n   of a set   we use     to denote the set of opportunities that appear in   
similar to former cooperative search models  sarne   kraus        manisterski        the
following theorem holds in our cooperative search model  and can be proven in a similar manner  
theorem    any set of opportunities  is equivalent to the set of opportunities returned by the
function alloc    formally stated     alloc    
theorem   enables us to reduce the set of known opportunities that affect the coalitions strategy 
the immediate implication of the theorem   is that the coalitions strategy is affected only by the
subset of known defined by  alloc known     thus the coalition does not need to keep all its known
opportunities  it can reduce its set of known opportunities with which it determines its strategy
to a subset  s  given this result  we define state to be the set s of opportunities that are members
of  alloc known     formally  we can calculate the state s of a coalition a acquainted with a set
known of known opportunities by using the function s   state  known      alloc known     we use
sa to denote the set of all possible states of a coalition a  this definition significantly simplifies our
analysis and enables the coalition to calculate its optimal strategy exclusively based on the sets of
opportunities that are in sa   the following example illustrates the computation of a state 
example    consider the environment and the set of known opportunities described in example
   as computed in example    the allocation that maximizes the coalitions overall utility in the
b c market is alloc known       o    o    o     thus the coalitions current state in the b c market is
state known       o     as a result the coalition can ignore the other opportunities it encountered
  o    o    o    and its strategy  terminate or resume the search and the number of parallel interactions
in the later case  is the same as its strategy when  known     o     similarly  the coalitions state in
the c c market includes the opportunities in alloc  known   thus state known       o    o    o    
the coalitions transition from one state to another during the search in the b c and the c c
markets can be described as a directed acyclic graph  dag   the vertices of this graph present
all potential coalition states  a directed edge  s  s     connects two states  s and s    if there is an
opportunity  o  o p that changes the current coalitions state from s to s    i e  o  s t state s  o    s    
to better understand the use of the dag in these markets  we use the following two environments

figure   a  and figure   b  show the dag of states for environment    the b c market  and
environment    the c c market  described below  respectively  notice that it is possible to have
opportunities that do not change the coalitions current state  since these opportunities do not increase the coalitions overall utility   to simplify the graph we did not mark these opportunities  it
is notable that in the c c market all sets that include up to n opportunities are feasible states  state
s is feasible if it belongs to sa   i e  there is a set  such that state     s   this does not hold in
the b c market  for example  the set   o     o    is not a feasible state since  o  maximizes all agents
utility  thus if the coalition encounters this opportunity all other opportunities can be ignored 
any coalition a that reaches a state s along its search can change its state to s   only if there is a
sequence of directed edges from state s to state s     the coalition can conduct parallel interactions 
thus can transition within a single search round to a state s   which is not directly connected to
state s  for example  in environment    when in state s      the coalition can change its state to
s      o    o    after one search round  even though there is no a directed edge between them   this
can happen when the coalition conducts two or more parallel interactions in which it encounters
opportunities  o  and  o    the transition to a new state suggests that in the new state the coalition has
a termination utility equal to or higher than the utility at its current state 
we define a strategy as a function x   s a  n  where x s      if the agent decides to terminate
its search  otherwise x s  is the number of parallel interactions the coalition should maintain next 
when in state s  we denote the optimal strategy by x   
we define v  s  w  as the coalitions expected utility when using w parallel interactions when
in state s  assuming any search decision taken at a future state s      s will make use of the optimal
number of parallel interactions   the term v  s     denotes the immediate utility obtained  if the

the coalitions expected utility from this point onwards when using its optimal strategy  denoted
v   s   can be expressed as 
v   s    maxwv  s  w    v  s  x  s  

   

in order to formulate the appropriate equation for v  s  w   from which x   s  and v   s  can be
derived  we make use of several additional notations and definitions  consider a search round in
which the coalition interacts simultaneously with w seller agents  yielding a set  w     
o         o w   
 oi  o p of opportunities  let w be the collection of all w sized sets of opportunities that can be
produced in the environment in which the coalition operates  we denote by p w  w   the probability
of encountering a specific set of opportunities  w   when maintaining w random interactions with
seller agents 
similar to the basic cooperative search  sarne   kraus        we divide the w sized opportunities space  w   into two sub spaces  containing improving and non improving w sized sets of opportunities for the coalitions utility  respectively  nevertheless  this definition needs to be extended
to fit the scenario of parallel search as follows  given the number of simultaneous interactions 
w  and a state s  let simprovew be the collection of all w size sets of opportunities   w   that change
the coalitions current state  formally stated as   simprovew    w  w  w and state s  w      s   
we denote the complementary set of  simprovew by sstayw  the set that includes all w size sets of
opportunities w that do not change the coalitions current state  
therefore when the coalition encounters the set of opportunities  w   we can distinguish two
possible scenarios 
    w belongs to sstayw and the coalitions current state is still s  in this case the coalitions future
expected utility  i e   from this point on  remains v  s  w   this is derived from the stationary nature  
   stationary strategy is a strategy in which each player chooses the same moves in every structurally equivalent subgame

of the problem   if no better state has been reached  the search resumes using the same number of
parallel interactions w  yielding the same expected utility 
    w belongs to simprovew and the coalitions current state changes to s     state s  w      s  since
we assume that the coalitions decision taken at a future state s      s will make use of the coalitions
optimal strategy x  s     the coalitions expected utility can be expressed as v   state s  w    
by using the above analysis  the expected utility when using w parallel interactions while in
state s  v  s  w   can now be expressed as  w      
v  s  w   c w  n

where s  is the coalitions new state after it encounters a set of opportunities  w   s    state s  w   
after applying some basic mathematical manipulations on the above term we obtain 
v  s  w

notice that in the case where no new better state can be reached  the denominator becomes zero  and
v  s  w      this is quite straightforward since the coalition maintains an endless costly search
 trying to reach a better state that actually does not exist   here  inevitably the coalitions optimal
strategy is to terminate the search  this important characteristic is used later to design the proposed
algorithms for extracting the optimal search strategy 
at this point  one may attempt to compute the coalitions strategy x  by solving a set of equations
of types      and    nevertheless  this straightforward solution approach is accompanied by many
inherent complexities  derived from the structure of the equations  first  notice that equation  
is a recursive equation and one needs to know the optimal strategy taken in future states s   when
extracting the optimal strategy of a given state s  second  the computation of v  s  w  in equation
  is exponential in the number of parallel interactions  w  used  affecting the number of sets in
simprovew   both in the denominator and numerator   last  according to the above formulation  the
potential number of parallel interactions that may be used is not bounded     thus reaching a local
maximum does not guarantee that a higher utility cannot be obtained  therefore  an algorithmic
approach that can reduce the complexity of extracting the optimal cooperative parallel search is
favorable 

   algorithmic approach
in this section we present a comprehensive analysis of the problem  emphasizing some unique
characteristics of the coalitions optimal strategy  these findings lead to an algorithm for computing
v  s  w  with a polynomial complexity in the number of potential interactions  w  which is the key
component for computing x  s  and v   s   
   the number of opportunities is theoretically infinite due to the high arrival rate of new opportunities as derived from
such a dynamic environment

    reducing calculation complexity
recall that when attempting to solve the problem as a set of equations  see section    the potential
number of parallel interactions that may be used is unbounded  nevertheless  in order to extract
x  s  it is essential to supply the coalition with an upper bound  w smax   for the optimal number of
parallel interactions to be used when in state s  in order to overcome this difficulty and to suggest
an upper bound for wsmax we make use of the following notation  we use s s    s       s sa     to denote
the states constituting sa   sorted by their termination utilities vt  s     where s  is the state with the
highest expected utility vt  s  in sa  
the following proposition suggests an efficient upper bound for x   s  
i
i
proposition    for each state si an upper bound wsmax
  to x  si   can be calculated using wsmax
  dwe 
where w is the solution to the following equation 

   

c w  n    vt  s    vt  si  

i
the suggested bound is valid simply because for every value of w greater than w smax
the search cost
associated with the following immediate search round c w  n  is greater than any possible future
improvement in the coalitions utility vt  s    vt  si    since the maximum additional utility that the
coalition can gain is bounded by the difference between the coalitions overall maximum utility
vt  s    and its immediate utility from its current state vt  si     later on  we show that the above upper
bound value is a byproduct of the main loop in our proposed algorithm  thus it does not even need
to be directly calculated 
having an upper bound for x  s  is an important step towards a solution  however the calculation
of v  s  w   from which x  s  can be derived  is still exponential in the number of parallel interactions
used  w  our analysis  which is based on the restructuring of the different elements composing
v  s  w   allows us to bypass this complexity through the introduction of a finite algorithm with a
polynomial computational complexity in w that will inevitably identify the optimal strategy for the
coalition 
in order to reduce the complexity of computing the coalitions best strategy  we make use of the
following notations and definitions 

 we use pstay  s  w  to denote the probability the coalition will remain in the same state s after
conducting w parallel interactions  this can be calculated as the probability of none of the
encountered w opportunities changing the coalitions state 
pstay  s  w     pstay  s         
w



p  o  w

   

  o sstay 

the term   pstay  s     w can now be used as a better structured representation of the element
w simprovew pw  w   in equation   
 we use v new  s  k  to denote the coalitions expected utility obtained from potentially reaching
new states  e g  different than s  after maintaining k parallel interactions  while using the
optimal strategy x  s    for each new future state s    the term v new  s  k  does not take into
account the cost associated with the current k interactions  however it does consider the
   if there are several states with equal utility they are sorted according to a pre defined order 

  

fim anisterski   s arne     k raus

search costs associated with any further search stages  originating in new states  notice that
v new  s  k  is equal to zero if the coalition remains in state s after k interactions  the term
v new  s  k  can be expressed as

note that v new  s  w  is actually one of the elements in equation    therefore  equation   can
now be formulated as  w      
v  s  w   

c w  n   v new  s  w 
   pstay  s    w

    

the calculation of v new  s  w  using equation   is still exponential in the number of the parallel
interactions  in order to efficiently compute v new  s  w  in equation    we consider the w simultaneous interactions as w sequential interactions  associated with no search costs  this fully complies
with the definition of v new  s  w  as given above  as the cost of the w interactions is already considered   the justification for the above representation method is given in the lemma   which follows
directly from theorem   
lemma    a new state reached by obtaining a new set of opportunities is equivalent to a state
reached by sequentially obtaining pairwise disjoint subsets of this set  formally stated  given a set

and        alloc          state        from the transitive characteristic of the equivalence
relation it follows that state       state       
let s be a state and let w be a set of opportunities  we prove lemma   by induction on the
number of disjoint sets r  for r      let   w  and   w   be any sets that satisfy  w     w     w and
  from theorem   and the state definition we obtain 
 w     w

from    and lemma   it follows that
state s  w     state s   w     w      state state s   w       w    

    

we assume that for any number of disjoint sets r  m and r        w         rwr   iwi  w   iwi  wj j  
  i    j   w        rwr   w equation    holds and we prove that equation    holds for r m

given w and sets  w         rwr   we can decompose w to two disjoint sets wwr and rwr   where
wwr   w   rwr   therefore as we proved for r     the following holds 
state s  w    state state s  wwr    rwr   

    

in addition we can decompose the set  wwr to r     m sets  w         r

a specific case of the above lemma   is when each subset consists of a single opportunity  thus
the calculation of v new  s  k  can recursively rely on the values v new  s    k      where s  represents
any of the new states reached after obtaining one additional opportunity from o p   therefore in
order to compute v new  s  k   we merely consider the expected utility after conducting one interaction
from the planned k interactions  here  with a probability of p stay  s     the coalition remains in the
same state s  where the expected utility  having k    additional interactions to go  is v new  s  k    
 recall that v new  s         according to equation     otherwise  if a new state s   is reached after
a single interaction  then there is the possibility of reaching further new states in the remaining
k    interactions  taking these states utility into consideration by the term v new  s    k      or with a
probability of pstay  s    k     remaining in the new state s  even after the additional k    interactions
 in which case the utility is the one obtained by resuming the search from this state and on using the
optimal strategy  v   s      the above description is encapsulated in the following recursive equation

where s    state s  o    notice that when repeating the calculation using the above equation with
an increasing k value starting from k      each iteration includes only a single unknown parameter 
 v new  s  k    in addition  the values v new  s    k     and v   s    do not depend on values that were
computed for state s  s  precedes s in the set ss

   properties of the parallel cooperative search  pcs  model
prior to extending the above analysis to scenarios where the coalition faces a finite decision horizon 
we emphasize some interested unique characteristics of the parallel cooperative search derived from
the general analysis  first we wish to emphasize that the pcs model is a generalization of both the
single agent parallel search  saps  and the sequential cooperative search  scs  model as stated
in the following proposition 
proposition    the cooperative parallel search is a generalization of both the single agent parallel
search and the cooperative sequential search models     
proof  from the analysis given in section   it is clear that algorithm   results in the same strategy
used in the cooperative sequential search and in the single agents parallel search  for the specific
i
cases in which si wsmax
    parallel interactions or n     agents  respectively    
furthermore  we emphasize that the coalitions expected utility never decreases when using our
proposed mechanism in comparison to the sequential cooperative search  indeed in the case where
maintaining more than a single interaction is not a favorable strategy algorithm   results in one
interaction at a time strategy  as used in the sequential cooperative search  obviously if using the
parallel interaction does not decrease the search cost  i e  the search cost of conducting any number
of interactions sequentially is equal or smaller than conducting the interactions in parallel   then the
sequential cooperative search is the dominating strategy as stated in the next proposition 
proposition    if the cost of conducting any number of parallel interactions is equal or higher than
the cost of conducting these interactions sequentially  i e w  w  c    n   c w  n   then the use of
the parallel search can at most match the expected utility of the sequential cooperative search 
proof  consider an optimal cooperative parallel search strategy x par   obviously there is a state
s  sa satisfying      the coalitions strategy in s is to conduct more than one interaction  x par  s     
    for any future state s  of s the coalition conducts at most one interaction  or terminates search  
i e   xpar  s        if we replace the parallel search strategy when in state s with the sequential
search from this state on then the expected utility can only increase  this is because in the worst
case scenario the coalition will execute w interactions incurring at most the same cost as in x par  
ending up with the same expected termination utility  for any other case  whenever the coalition
reaches state s  where its strategy according to xpar is to terminate its search prior to completing w
interactions  the expected utility is at least the expected utility achieved by using x par  otherwise
the coalitions strategy in s  according to xpar will be to resume the search    therefore the use of
the new strategy can only improve the expected utility  using backward induction we can apply
the same logic to all former states for which x par implies more than one interaction in parallel 
    the extent of the achieved improvement is highly correlated with the specific environment in which the coalition
operates 
    notice that in this context the single agent sequential search is a specific case of the single agent parallel search 
where the agent interacts with a single seller agent at a time 
    assuming similar cost structures in all three models

consequently  we obtain that the sequential strategy results in at least as large an expected utility as
xpar  
next we consider the case where the agents are fully homogeneous  in terms of their utility
functions  and operate in b c markets  here  we can prove that the optimal strategy of the coalition
is stationary  i e  does not change according to the current state   furthermore  we show that
the stationary strategy characteristic holds not only for fully homogeneous agents but also when
the agents have correlated preferences  two agents a i and a j have correlated preferences when
agent ai prefers  o  over  o   if and only if agent a j prefers opportunity  o  over  o    i e  o    o    o p  
u j   o     u j   o      ui   o     ui   o      and vice versa 
theorem    in the b c market  if all the agents have correlated preferences  the search strategy
is based on a reservation value   urv   in such a scenario the number of parallel interactions the
coalition uses according to the optimal strategy  in case it resumes the search  is fixed during the
search  s  sa such that vt  s    urv exists x  s    w f ixed   
proof  in the above scenario  the search problem is equivalent to the problem of a single agent
with a utility function equal to the sum of the different agents utilities  u   u    u         un   in
this case after terminating the search  all of the coalition members are always assigned the same
opportunity  therefore  the search strategy is reservation value based  and the search is terminated
upon reaching such an opportunity with a utility exceeding a pre set reservation value u rv   since
the probability of reaching such an opportunity does not depend on the coalitions state  the number
of parallel interactions used throughout the search is fixed 
nevertheless theorem   does not hold in the c c market even when the agents are homogeneous as the next lemma states 
lemma    in the c c market even for fully homogeneous agents  all agents have the same utility
functions  the search strategy is not always stationary and the optimal number of parallel interactions can be changed during the search according to the coalitions current state 
proof  in order to prove this lemma  we consider a coalition that operates in a c c market in the
following environment 
environment    assume a coalition of two agents  a   and a    searching for a product  e g   a used
book  characterized by one attribute  e g   indicating whether the book is signed by the author  with
two possible values     signed  and    not signed   this results in two opportunity types  o         
and o          assume opportunity o   is rare and can be found with a probability of        while
opportunity o   is very common  a probability of          both agents utilities are     for the rare
opportunity and   for the common opportunity  consider that the cost of conducting w parallel
interactions is equal to the cost of conducting w interactions sequentially  c w  n    wc    n   where
the cost of conducting a single interaction is c    n              n   n       table   summarizes
environments setting 
we consider the two following states      the coalition starts its search  the coalitions current
state is its initial state s           the coalition encounters opportunity o     the coalitions current
    a reservation value is a value that the coalition sets a priori and terminates the search if reached an opportunity
associated with a utility greater than or equal to this value  sarne   kraus

in order for the coalition to terminate its search all its members should exploit opportunity o     otherwise the expected utility from resuming the search exceeds the search cost   thus in order for the
coalition to terminate the search in the former case  the coalitions state is s       it must encounter
opportunity o   twice and in the latter case  the coalitions state is s       
o     it has to encounter
opportunity o   once  thus we expect that the number of optimal interactions  where the coalitions
state is s  to be different from the number of optimal interactions  where its state is s     indeed
the computation of the coalitions optimal number of interactions  using algorithm    results in
x  s        and x  s          

   finite decision horizon
an important variant of the cooperative parallel search is the one where the agents forming the
coalition are restricted by a deadline for finalizing their search  for example  consider a coalition
that searches for costumes for its members to wear to a costume party  in this case the coalition
can not search for the costumes forever since the customs have a value for the coalition members
only if purchased prior to the party  this type of environment is often referred to in search theory as
a finite decision horizon environment  specifically  within the context of this paper we consider
finite decision horizon environments where the coalition as a whole should terminate its search prior
to or within the next r search rounds  note that in the sequential search this definition is equivalent
to the definition stating that the coalition can conduct at most r additional interactions 
in addition to the general advantages recognized in the parallel cooperative search  in finite decision horizon environments the model can enable the coalition to conduct more than the maximum
r interactions facilitated by the sequential model  whenever necessary   moreover  in some environments where the coalition cannot improve its performance by interacting with several sellers in
parallel  e g   in cases such as those described in proposition     the introduction of a finite decision
horizon constraint creates a strong incentive to interact with more than a single seller at a time  this
is illustrated in the following example 
example    consider a coalition that operates in a b c market  having the same characteristics
as in environment    which was introduced in section    in this environment the coalitions optimal
strategy when having an infinite decision horizon is to search sequentially  see proposition     nevertheless  for various finite decision horizon values the coalition can benefit from using the parallel
search technique  the most trivial example in this case is when the coalition has to terminate its
search within the next search round  in this case  if the coalition conducts several interactions in
the next round  its probability to encounter opportunity o   increases in comparison to the case in
which it conducts only a single search  for example if the coalition conducts     interactions it
has a probability of         to encounter only opportunity o   during its search and a probability of
  

fie nhancing c ooperative s earch

with

c oncurrent i nteractions

           to encounter opportunity o   during its search and its expected utility can be expressed
as                 vt    
o              vt    
o      c                                             
                   this value is significantly greater than its expected utility when using the sequential cooperative search which is      vt    
o           vt    
o      c              
in order to compute the coalitions strategy in a finite decision horizon model variant we extend
our definitions to include the number of remaining search rounds  r  we use v  s  w  r  to denote the
coalitions expected utility  when it conducts w interactions in the next round and has to terminate
its search within the next r rounds  the term v  s     r  denotes the immediate utility obtained  if the
coalition decides to terminate the search at state s  thus  v  s     r    vt  s   we denote by x  s  r  and
v   s  r  the coalitions optimal strategy and its expected utility  when using its optimal strategy  at
state s  if it should terminate its search within the next r rounds 
the v   s  r  and x  s  r  calculation is similar to the infinite decision horizon case  except that
whenever the coalition reaches its decision deadline it inevitably terminates its search  namely  if
r      then x  s         and the coalitions expected utility v   s     is equal to vt  s

we begin by computing v  s  w  r   when r      since v  s  w          w   here  we can apply the
same analysis methodology used in section    however  the expected utility of the coalition when
resuming its search following the current search stage should reflect the change in the decision
horizon  therefore  instead of using equation    we should use the following modification

pw  w  v   s    r       pstay  s  w v   s  r

where   state s  w   
the computation of equation    is exponential in the number of parallel interactions  in order
to reduce the complexity of v s w r  for r     we consider the two following cases 
s 

 w      the coalition encounters a single opportunity thus equation    can be expressed as

in this case  no additional computational complexity is introduced  in comparison to the scs
model  sarne   kraus        
 w      here we attempt to find a computational means for extracting the value of the term
w simprovew v   s    r       pstay  s  w v   s  r      in equation     in complexity polynomial
in w  this expression denotes the coalitions expected utility when it conducts w interactions
without considering the cost associated with conducting the w interactions  in order to efficiently compute this value we consider the coalitions expected utility after conducting one of
its w interactions and obtaining opportunity  o  in this case  the coalitions expected utility is

equal to the coalitions expected utility when starting from state state s  o  and conducting
w    interactions plus a cost equivalent to the cost of maintaining these w    interactions 
c w     n   these are added since they were already subtracted from the expected utility in

to find the coalitions optimal strategy  the efficient bound for the optimal number of interactions
given in equation   is also valid for the finite decision horizon variant 
the above analysis leads to algorithm   which is a modification of algorithm    this algorithm
computes the coalitions strategy and expected utility for all states in s a   in order to compute
v   s  r   this algorithm uses backward induction  it starts by computing v   si      for all states 
here  the coalition is forced to terminate its search thus the algorithm sets the expected utility to be
equal to the termination utility  v   si        vt  si    then  the algorithm computes v  s i   r  w  for r    
using equation    and    starting from w     till c w  n   vt  s    vt  sinit    the algorithm sets the
coalitions optimal strategy to be the number of interactions w that maximizes v  s i   r  w  
similar to the infinite decision horizon case  algorithm   reuses components computed in earlier
stages in each stage of its execution  nevertheless  in this case in order to store the results in the
memory for reuse later  we need a three dimensional matrix v of size  s a     winit

where rmax is the initial decision horizon  the corresponding v  s  w  r  values are stored for each
triplet  s  w  r   representing a coalitions state  the number of simultaneous interactions used and
the limit on the number of rounds that the coalition can conduct  additionally  we store v   s  r

in step     according to equation   
in the following section we illustrate some properties of the pcs model both for the infinite and
finite decision horizons model variants 

   illustrative examples of the pcs model
with an efficient means for calculating the coalitions optimal strategy when using parallel cooperative search  we can now demonstrate some specific properties of this search method  as a reference
we use the single agents parallel search  saps   the single agents sequential search  sass 
and the sequential cooperative search  scs  models 
    infinite decision horizon
we begin by illustrating the parallel cooperative search with an infinite decision horizon  first we
demonstrate the influence of the level of heterogeneity in the utility functions of the different coalition members on the coalitions performance  in terms of the expected utility achieved   in order
to demonstrate this we use the following environment  which was used originally for evaluating the
performance of the scs model  sarne   kraus        
environment    a coalition of two agents  a   and a    searching for opportunities defined by two
attributes  b   e g   quality  and b   e g   store rating   where each attribute can have a value from
the discrete range of             with an equal probability for each of the values  the agents are
heterogeneous in respect to the way they evaluate each potential opportunity  agent a   is associated with the utility function u    o    b    b    while agent a  is associated with the utility function
u    o          b     b    thus  the parameter  indicates the level of the agents similarity heterogeneity  the search cost of any single agent for conducting a single interaction is c base for
w parallel interactions  w       c w       c base   c parallel   w      the search cost of a coalition
of size n is c w  n    c w    ln n        n      
figure   depicts the expected utility per agent when using the different search methods    in the
c c market  left hand side  and the b c market  right hand side  as a parameter of the similarity
level    between the utility functions of the agents constituting the coalition 

    the algorithm uses winit
max as an upper bound for the optimal number of interactions x  si    i            sa    this bound
si
is valid since according to equation   the value of wmax increases as vt  si   decreases and the coalitions termination
utility reaches its minimum in the initial state  vt           
    for the cooperative models the average expected utility per coalition member measure is used

figure    average expected utility per buyer agent as a function of similarity level for different models in
different markets

curve   in each graph depicts the average expected utility when the two agents form a coalition as a function of the similarity level  between the agents utility functions  making use of
the suggested parallel cooperative search  here  the search cost of conducting a single interaction
was set at      cbase        and the search cost to conduct additional interactions was set to     
 c parallel          as expected our model  represented by curve    outperforms the scs model  represented by curve    in terms of the expected utility for the agents  the other two curves describe
the average expected utility of the agents when each searches separately using the single agent
parallel search  saps   represented by curve    and the single agent sequential search  sass 
 represented by curve    models  in this specific environment the use of the cooperative parallel
search also outperforms the single agent parallel search model though this is not always the case 
notice that the results obtained for the cooperative parallel search are consistent with a general
characteristic of cooperative search  sarne   kraus        by which the use of the method in the
b c market results in a better expected utility than in the c c market  in the case of the separated
single searches  saps and sass models  the market type does not affect the strategy structure nor
the expected utility since each agent searches only for a single opportunity for its own benefit 
figure   also reflects an interesting insight which contradicts an important strategy domination
relationship found between single and cooperative sequential search techniques of fully homogeneous agents  i e  with the same utility function  as in the case where        in our example 
operating in c c markets  while for the sequential search the use of the single agent search always outperforms the cooperative search in the c c markets  when considering fully homogeneous
agents   sarne   kraus         here we have actual evidence that where parallel search is concerned 
the cooperative search technique may outperform the aggregated result of the single homogeneous
agents search 
figure   shows the expected utility per agent when using the different search methods in the
c c market  left hand side  and the b c market  right hand side  as a parameter of the cost of
conducting an additional interaction c parallel  notice that the agents performance is not affected by
this value in the sass and the scs models   the results are based on environment    the same

decreases the average expected utility using the parallel models  psc and saps models  increases
 and thus the greater the improvement in comparison to the sequential models   note that whenever
c parallel  cbase the performance converges to the one achieved by obtaining one observation at a
time  as used in the sequential models  this behavior is correlated with proposition

cost of parallel interaction

figure    average expected utility per buyer agent as a function of c parallel when using the different search
methods in different markets

the cost of conducting an additional interaction c parallel also influences the optimal number
of interactions that the coalition should conduct  figure   shows the optimal number of parallel
interactions that the coalition should conduct at the beginning of its search  x        as a function
of c parallel in the same environment that we used for figure    environment     as expected  the
optimal number of interactions  x       increases as c parallel decreases and is equal to    when
c parallel  cbase  
in figure   the coalitions optimal number of interactions using the pcs model is higher when
the coalition operates in the c c market than when in the b c market  while this can have an
intuitive explanation  in the c c market each opportunity can be exploited by only one of the agents
so the coalition needs to encounter more opportunities in the c c market  it cannot be generalized 
the following example illustrates a scenario in which the optimal number of interactions is actually
greater when operating in a b c market 
environment    a coalition of two agents  a   and a    searching for a product  e g   a computer
game  associated with   types of opportunities   o     o    o    o     e g   representing different configurations   the agents utilities and opportunities distribution are given in table    the search cost
of any single agent to conduct a single interaction is c base        and the search cost of conducting
an additional search is c parallel        c w       cbase   c parallel   w      the search cost for a
coalition is c w  n    c w    ln n        n      
figure   shows the optimal number of interactions used by the coalition  in the scs model 
or the agent  in the saps model  at the beginning of the search  when operating in environment

table    agents utilities for the four opportunities in environment  
market      is larger than the coalitions optimal number of parallel interactions in the c c market
     moreover this figure contradicts two additional hypothesis that one may presume about the
optimal number of a coalitions parallel interactions  the first is that the coalitions optimal number
of parallel interactions is at most equal to the overall number of parallel interactions  when each of
the agents conducts the search autonomously  as can be seen in figure    the optimal number of
parallel interactions in the b c market is greater than the total number of parallel interactions  when
each of the agents conducts its search autonomously                      the second hypothesis
suggests that the coalitions optimal number of parallel interactions is at least the number of parallel
interactions  when each of the agents conducts the search autonomously  this  again is proven
wrong in figure    where the coalitions optimal number of parallel interactions in the c c market
    is smaller than the number of parallel interactions of agent a         and the number of parallel
interactions of agent a       
next we introduce and make use of a simpler sample environment for demonstrating some
additional properties of the cooperative parallel search 
environment    a coalition of two agents  a   and a    searching for opportunities defined by two
attributes  b   e g   quality  and b   e g   store rating   where each attribute can have a value from
the discrete range of        with an equal probability for each of the values  the utility functions
used are u    o       b       b  and u    o       b       b    the search cost of a single agent

of parallel interactions  x  s   here  we can see the effect of two conflicting forces  as the number of
parallel interactions the coalition uses in this stage increases  the probability of associating a better
opportunity with any of the two coalition members increases  however the overall search cost
associated with the search stage increases  from the figure  we conclude that the optimal number of
parallel interactions to be used in this stage is x           
an additional important characteristic of the cooperative parallel search we wish to emphasize
concerns the number of parallel interactions used as part of the optimal search strategy along the
search  while in a single agents parallel search the search strategy is stationary  i e  the number
of parallel interactions used does not change along the search process  in our model the number of
parallel interactions along the search that needs to be maintained depends on the coalitions state
 i e  the set of opportunities known to the coalition   this is demonstrated in the directed acyclic
graph  dag  given in figure    which describes the search process in environment    the vertices
of this graph present potential coalitions states  the state is determined according to the relevant
set of known opportunities  correlated with the definition given in section     an edge connects
two states s and s  only if there is a possibility to reach state s over the following search round if
the coalition conducts the search according to the optimal search strategy  for example a directed
edge connects between s      and s                      since the coalition can proceed from s to s  
if it conducts the five parallel interactions according to the optimal search strategy and encounters
opportunities        and         notice that when reaching states                  and                 
the optimal strategy of the coalition is to terminate the search  therefore there is no edge originating
in these states  as illustrated in figure    the number of parallel interactions the coalition should
use according to the optimal search strategy  denoted by x   s   depends on the coalitions state  for
comparison purposes  notice that in any of the single agents separate search  i e  the single agent
parallel search model  the optimal strategy is to constantly use   parallel interactions  as long as the
agents strategy is to resume the search

another factor that affects the expected utility is the decision horizon  represented by the value
of the parameter r  figure   presents the coalitions expected utility as a function of r  in this figure
we used the same environment that we used in figure    where we set the cost of each additional
search  c parallel        as observed in figure    in all search models  the earlier the coalition should
terminate its search the smaller its expected utility  moreover  the expected utility improvement
obtained in the pcs  in comparison to the scs  and saps  in comparison to the sass  models
increases as r decreases  in this case the ability to conduct parallel interactions compensates for the
small number of search rounds that the coalition can conduct  note that as r increases  the average
expected utility per buyer agent converges to the average expected utility per buyer agent in the
infinite decision horizon model 
finally  figure    depicts the optimal number of interactions for a coalition  in the pcs model 
or an agent  in the saps model  at the beginning of the search  as a function of r  for this figure
we used the same environment parameters that were used in figure    as expected the number of
parallel interactions increases as r decreases 
as we have demonstrated throughout this section  the pcs outperforms the sequential cooperative search  generally  the magnitude of improvement depends on the size of the domain  the search
cost structure  and the different utility functions used

   discussion and conclusions
the capability of using parallel interactions as part of a search process is inherent in the infrastructure of autonomous information agents  when using the cooperative parallel search  the coalition
should use a new strategy  different in its structure in comparison to the optimal strategy used in the
cooperative sequential search and in a single agents parallel search  as expected  the use of the new
model has the potential of significantly improving the coalitions expected utility as demonstrated
in the previous section  furthermore  we emphasize that the coalitions expected utility will never
decrease when using our proposed mechanism in comparison to pure sequential cooperative search 
this is mainly because the suggested algorithm will converge to one interaction at a time strategy 
as used in the sequential cooperative search  which is a specific case of our model  in the case where
  

fim anisterski   s arne     k raus

maintaining more than a single interaction in some of the world states is not favorable  obviously
if the search cost is linear and depends solely on the number of interactions being maintained  then
there is no use for the coalition to increase the number of sellers with whom it interacts in a given
search round  nevertheless  scenarios in which the coalitions search cost combines additional fixed
components or non linear dependency on the number of interactions maintained are much more realistic  sarne   kraus         in these scenarios the parallel cooperative search yields large benefits
for searchers 
while the parallel cooperative search weakly dominates the sequential cooperative search  it
does not necessarily dominate autonomous search  where the agents search by themselves instead
of cooperatively   the decision of whether to use the parallel cooperative search autonomously
depends on the amount of coalition overhead costs induced by the cooperative search  therefore 
having the computational means developed in this work enables the agents to identify fruitful opportunities for searching cooperatively  generally  the introduction of the parallel cooperative search
model substantially increases the number of scenarios in which agents will prefer to search cooperatively 
the novelty of the analysis given in this paper is threefold  first it supplies us with a better
understanding of the space of opportunities  dividing it into improving and non improving areas 
thus  instead of having dual simultaneous dependencies between states we can now define a single
directional dependency for each pair of states  second  it supplies a bound for the optimum number
of parallel interactions that the coalition uses in each state in its optimal strategy  third we represent the parallel search as a sequential process  without breaching any of the model assumptions 
these three features allow us to overcome the main complexity associated with the attempt to solve
the problem as a set of equations and proffer a finite algorithm that is polynomial in the number
of parallel interactions  rather than the brute force algorithm which is exponential in the number
of parallel interactions  and inevitably reaches the optimal strategy  moreover  we provide a comprehensive analysis of the parallel model for extracting the optimal search strategy given a finite
decision horizon  here  as we illustrate  the coalition can benefit significantly more than the infinite
decision horizon from the integration of parallel interactions into the cooperative search  the pcs
model  both in its finite and infinite decision horizon forms  is general and can be applied to any
coalition regardless of the cost function and the preferences used by its agents  further adaptation
to additional markets  other than c c and b c  can be achieved by appropriately modifying the
allocation function used for assigning each agent with one of the opportunities found along the
search 
the focus of this research is on finding the optimal search strategy for the coalition  given its
structure  the opportunity distribution  and the reported members preferences  it treats the coalition as a unified entity sharing a common goal  to maximize the sum of its members utilities  
nevertheless  there are various  important aspects of coalition formation  in the context of cooperative search  that do not always correlate with the assumptions used and should therefore be further
addressed  for example  there may be an incentive for coalition members to misreport their preferences when side payments are used  alternatively  agents may be able to form side coalitions 
and free ride actively searching coalitions by having only a single agent as a member of the actively
searching coalition  that member would act as a spy for the side coalition   moreover  there
can be environments where agents may face tight budget constraints that could be violated within
coalition side payments  the analysis of these important issues is based on the ability to properly
derive the coalitions utility given any specific setting  this paper supplies this functionality  laying

the foundation and enabling such research  future work should encompass and extend the scope of
research to include these additional topics associated with the coalition formation process  such as
the coalition stability and the division of payoffs between the coalition members  other important
extensions should include the relaxation of some assumptions in the underlying opportunity model
 e g   different deadlines on different opportunities
