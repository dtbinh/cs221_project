abstract
ontologies and automated reasoning are the building blocks of the semantic web initiative  derivation rules can be included in an ontology to define derived concepts  based on
base concepts  for example  rules allow to define the extension of a class or property  based
on a complex relation between the extensions of the same or other classes and properties 
on the other hand  the inclusion of negative information both in the form of negation asfailure and explicit negative information is also needed to enable various forms of reasoning 
in this paper  we extend rdf graphs with weak and strong negation  as well as derivation
rules  the erdf stable model semantics of the extended framework  extended rdf  is
defined  extending rdf s  semantics  a distinctive feature of our theory  which is based
on partial logic  is that both truth and falsity extensions of properties and classes are
considered  allowing for truth value gaps  our framework supports both closed world and
open world reasoning through the explicit representation of the particular closed world assumptions and the erdf ontological categories of total properties and total classes 

   introduction
the idea of the semantic web is to describe the meaning of web data in a way suitable
for automated reasoning  this means that descriptive data  meta data  in machine readable form are to be stored on the web and used for reasoning  due to its distributed and
world wide nature  the web creates new problems for knowledge representation research 
berners lee        identifies the following fundamental theoretical problems  negation and
contradictions  open world versus closed world assumptions  and rule systems for the semantic web  for the time being  the first two issues have been circumvented by discarding
the facilities to introduce them  namely negation and closed world assumptions  though the
web ontology language owl  mcguinness   van harmelen         which is based on description logics  dls   baader  calvanese  mcguinness  nardi    patel schneider        
includes a form of classical negation through class complements  this form is limited  this

is because  to achieve decidability  classes are formed based on specific class constructors
and negation on properties is not fully considered  rules constitute the next layer over the
ontology languages of the semantic web and  in contrast to dl  allow arbitrary interaction
of variables in the body of the rules  the widely recognized need of having rules in the semantic web  demonstrated by the rule markup initiative    has restarted the discussion of
the fundamentals of closed world reasoning and the appropriate mechanisms to implement
it in rule systems 
the rdf s   recommendation  klyne   carroll        hayes        provides the basic constructs for defining web ontologies and a solid ground to discuss the above issues 
rdf s  is a special predicate logical language that is restricted to existentially quantified conjunctions of atomic formulas  involving binary predicates only  due to its purpose 
rdf s  has a number of special features that distinguish it from traditional logic languages 
   it uses a special jargon  where the things of the universe of discourse are called resources  types are called classes  and binary predicates are called properties  like
binary relations in set theory  properties have a domain and a range  resources are
classified with the help of the property rdf  type  for stating that a resource is of type
c  where c is a class  
   it distinguishes a special sort of resources  called literal values  which are denotations
of lexical representations of strings  numbers  dates  or other basic datatypes 
   properties are resources  that is  properties are also elements of the universe of discourse  consequently  it is possible to state properties of properties  i e   make statements about predicates 
   all resources  except anonymous ones and literal values  are named with the help of
a globally unique reference schema  called uniform resource identifier  uri     that
has been developed for the web 
   rdf s  comes with a non standard model theoretic semantics developed by pat hayes
on the basis of an idea of christopher menzel  which allows self application without
violating the axiom of foundation  an example of this is the provable sentence stating
that rdfs class  the class of all classes  is an instance of itself 
however  rdf s  does not support negation and rules  wagner        argues that a
database  as a knowledge representation system  needs two kinds of negation  namely weak
negation   expressing negation as failure or non truth  and strong negation   expressing
explicit negative information or falsity  to be able to deal with partial information  in
a subsequent paper  wagner        makes also this point for the semantic web  as a
framework for knowledge representation in general  in the present paper  we make the
same argument for the semantic web language rdf and show how it can be extended
to accommodate the two negations of partial logic  herre  jaspars    wagner         as
well as derivation rules  we call the new language extended rdf and denote it by erdf

fiextended rdf as a semantic foundation of rule markup languages

the model theoretic semantics of erdf  called erdf stable model semantics  is developed
based on partial logic  herre et al         
in partial logic  relating strong and weak negation at the interpretation level allows to
distinguish four categories of properties and classes  partial properties are properties p that
may have truth value gaps and truth value clashes  that is p x  y  is possibly neither true
nor false  or both true and false  total properties are properties p that satisfy totalness 
that is p x  y  is true or false  but possibly both   coherent properties are properties p that
satisfy coherence  that is p x  y  cannot be both true and false  classical properties are total
and coherent properties  for classical properties p  the classical logic law applies  p x  y  is
either true or false  partial  total  coherent  and classical classes c are defined similarly  by
replacing p x  y  by rdf  type x  c  
partial logic also allows to distinguish between properties  and classes  that are completely represented in a knowledge base and those that are not  the classification if a
property is completely represented or not is up to the owner of the knowledge base  the
owner must know for which properties there is complete information and for which there
is not  clearly  in the case of a completely represented  closed   property p  entailment of
p x  y  allows to derive p x  y   and the underlying completeness assumption has also
been called closed world assumption  cwa  in the ai literature 
such a completeness assumption for closing a partial property p by default may be
expressed in erdf by means of the rule p  x   y   p  x   y  and for a partial class
c  by means of the rule rdf  type  x  c   rdf  type  x  c   these derivation rules are
called default closure rules  in the case of a total property p  default closure rules are
not applicable  this is because  some of the considered interpretations will satisfy p x  y 
and the rest p x  y     preventing the preferential entailment of p x  y   thus  on total
properties  an open world assumption  owa  applies  similarly to first order logic  in
order to infer negated statements about total properties  explicit negative information has
to be supplied  along with ordinary  positive  information 
as an example  consider an erdf knowledge base kb that contains the facts 
interestedin anastasia  semanticweb 

interestedin grigoris  robotics 

indicating that anastasia is interested in the semanticweb area and grigoris is interested
in the robotics area  then  the statement interestedin anastasia  robotics  is not satisfied
in the single intended model of kb   thus  kb entails interestedin anastasia  robotics  
assume now that the previous list of areas of interest is not complete for anastasia or
grigoris  then  we should add to knowledge base kb the statement 
rdf  type interestedin  erdf  totalproperty 
indicating that interestedin is a total property  in this case  an open world assumption is made for interestedin and kb does not entail interestedin anastasia  robotics  
any longer  in particular  there is an intended model of the revised kb that satisfies
interestedin anastasia  robotics   of course  if it is known that anastasia is not interested
in robotics then interestedin anastasia  robotics  should be added to kb  
assume now that we add to kb the following facts 
   on total properties p  the law of excluded middle p x  y p x  y  applies

hascar  anastasia  suzuki  

hascar  grigoris  volvo 

and assume that kb has complete knowledge on the property hascar   as far as it concerns
elements in the herbrand universe of kb   then  the default closure rule hascar   x    y  
hascar   x    y  can be safely added to kb   as a result  hascar  anastasia  volvo  is
satisfied in all intended models of kb   thus  kb entails hascar  anastasia  volvo  
the previous example shows the need for supporting both closed world and open world
reasoning in the same framework  damasio et al         and analyti et al         provide
further examples and arguments for this need  unfortunately  classical logic and thus also
owl support only open world reasoning 
specifically  in this paper 
   we extend rdf graphs to erdf graphs with the inclusion of strong negation  and
then to erdf ontologies  or erdf knowledge bases  with the inclusion of general
derivation rules  erdf graphs allow to express existential positive and negative
information  whereas general derivation rules allow inferences based on formulas built
using the connectives          and the quantifiers    
   we extend the vocabulary of rdf s  with the terms erdf  totalproperty and
erdf  totalclass  representing the metaclasses of total properties and total classes  on
which the open world assumption applies 
   we extend rdfs interpretations to erdf interpretations including both truth and
falsity extensions for properties and classes  particularly  we consider only coherent
erdf interpretations  imposing coherence on all properties   thus  in this paper 
total properties and classes become synonymous to classical properties and classes 
   we extend rdf graphs to erdf formulas that are built from positive triples  using
the connectives          and the quantifiers     then  we define erdf
entailment between two erdf formulas  extending rdfs entailment between rdf
graphs 
   we define the erdf models  the herbrand interpretations  and the minimal herbrand
models of an erdf ontology  since not all minimal herbrand models of an erdf
ontology are intended  we define the stable models of an erdf ontology  the definition
of a stable model is based on the intuition that 
 a  assertions stating that a property p or class c is total should only be accepted  if
the ontology contains some direct support for them in the form of an acceptable
rule sequence  and
 b  assertions   p s  o  and   rdf  type o  c  should only be accepted  if  i  the ontology contains some direct support for them in the form of an acceptable rule
sequence  or  ii  property p and class c are total  respectively 
   we show that stable model entailment on erdf ontologies extends erdf entailment
on erdf graphs  and thus it also extends rdfs entailment on rdf graphs  moreover  we show that if all properties are total   boolean  herbrand model reasoning and
stable model reasoning coincide  in this case  we make an open world assumption for
all properties and classes 
  

fiextended rdf as a semantic foundation of rule markup languages

a distinctive feature of the developed framework with respect to partial logic  herre
et al         is that properties and classes are declared as total on a selective basis  by
extending rdf s  with new built in classes and providing support for the respective ontological categories  in contrast  in partial logic  herre et al          the choice of partial or
total should be taken for the complete set of predicates  thus  the approach presented here
is  in this respect  more flexible and general

the paper 

   extending rdf graphs with negative information
in this section  we extend rdf graphs to erdf graphs  by adding strong negation  moreover  we extend rdf graphs to erdf formulas  which are built from positive erdf triples 
the connectives           and the quantifiers    
according to rdf concepts  klyne   carroll        hayes         uri references
are used as globally unique names for web resources  an rdf uri reference is a unicode string that represents an absolute uri  with an optional fragment identifier   it
may be represented as a qualified name  that is a colon separated two part string consisting of a namespace prefix  an abbreviated name for a namespace uri  and a local
name  for example  given the namespace prefix ex defined to stand for the namespace uri http   www example org   the qualified name ex riesling  which stands for
http   www example org riesling  is a uri reference 
a plain literal is a string s  where s is a sequence of unicode characters  or a pair of
a string s and a language tag t  denoted by s t  a typed literal is a pair of a string
s and a datatype uri reference d  denoted by sd  for example    xsd integer is
a typed literal 
a  web  vocabulary v is a set of uri references and or literals  plain or typed   we
denote the set of all uri references by uri  the set of all plain literals by pl  the set of
all typed literals by t l  and the set of all literals by lit   it holds  uri  lit    
  

fianalyti  antoniou  damasio    wagner

in our formalization  we consider a set var of variable symbols  such that the sets var  
uri  lit are pairwise disjoint  in the main text  variable symbols are explicitly indicated 
while in our examples  variable symbols are prefixed by a question mark symbol   
an rdf triple  klyne   carroll        hayes        is a triple s p o   where s 
uri  var   p  uri  and o  uri  lit  var   expressing that the subject s is related
with the object o through the property p  an rdf graph is a set of rdf triples  the
variable symbols appearing in an rdf graph are called blank nodes  and are  intuitively 
existentially quantified variables  in this paper  we denote an rdf triple s p o  by
p s  o   below we extend the notion of rdf triple to allow for both positive and negative
information 
definition      erdf triple  let v be a vocabulary  a positive erdf triple over v
 also called erdf sentence atom  is an expression of the form p s  o   where s  o  v  var
are called subject   and object  respectively  and p  v  uri is called predicate or property 
a negative erdf triple over v is the strong negation p s  o  of a positive erdf triple
p s  o  over v   an erdf triple over v  also called erdf sentence literal   is a positive or
negative erdf triple over v   
for example  ex likes ex gerd   ex riesling  is a positive erdf triple  expressing that
gerd likes riesling  and ex likes ex carlos  ex riesling  is a negative erdf triple  expressing that carlos dislikes riesling  note that an rdf triple is a positive erdf
triple with the constraint that the subject of the triple is not a literal  for example 
ex denotationof  grigoris  ex grigoris  is a valid erdf triple but not a valid rdf triple 
our choice of allowing literals appearing in the subject position is based on our intuition
that this case can naturally appear in knowledge representation  as in the previous example   prudhommeaux   seaborne        and de bruijn et al         also consider literals
in the subject position of rdf triples 
based on the notion of erdf triple  we define erdf graphs and erdf formulas  as
follows 
definition      erdf graph  an erdf graph g is a set of erdf triples over some
vocabulary v   we denote the variables appearing in g by var  g   and the set of uri
references and literals appearing in g by vg   
note that as an rdf graph is a set of rdf triples  klyne   carroll        hayes        
an rdf graph is also an erdf graph 
definition      erdf formula  let v be a vocabulary  we consider the logical factors
                where     and  are called strong negation  weak negation  and
material implication  respectively  we denote by l v   the smallest set that contains the
positive erdf triples over v and is closed with respect to the following conditions  if
f  g  l v   then  f  f  f g  f g  f  g  xf  xf    l v    where x  var  
an erdf formula over v is an element of l v    we denote the set of variables appearing
   opposed to pure rdf  klyne   carroll         we allow literals in the subject position of an erdf
triple 

  

fiextended rdf as a semantic foundation of rule markup languages

in f by var  f    and the set of free variables  appearing in f by fvar  f    moreover  we
denote the set of uri references and literals appearing in f by vf   
for example  let 
f    x  y  rdf  type  x  ex person   ex haschild   y   x    rdf  type  z  ex person 
then  f is an erdf formula over the vocabulary v    rdf  type  ex person  ex haschild  
with var  f       x   y   z  and fvar  f       z  
we will denote the sublanguages of l v   formed by means of a subset s of the logical
factors  by l v  s   for example  l v      denotes the set of  positive and negative  erdf
triples over v  

   erdf interpretations
in this section  we extend rdf s  semantics by allowing for partial properties and classes 
in particular  we define erdf interpretations and satisfaction of an erdf formula  based
on the notion of partial interpretation 
    partial interpretations
we define a partial interpretation as an extension of a simple interpretation  hayes        
where each property is associated not only with a truth extension but also with a falsity
extension allowing for partial properties  the notation p s   where s is a set  denotes the
powerset of s 
definition      partial interpretation  a partial interpretation i of a vocabulary v
consists of 
 a non empty set of resources resi   called the domain or universe of i 
 a set of properties p ropi  
 a vocabulary interpretation mapping iv     v  uri  resi  p ropi  
 a property truth extension mapping pt i   p ropi  p resi  resi   
 a property falsity extension mapping pf i   p ropi  p resi  resi   
 a mapping ili   v  t l  resi  
 a set of literal values lv i  resi   which contains v  pl 

we define the mapping  i   v  resi  p ropi   called denotation  such that 
 i x    iv  x   x  v  uri 
 i x    x   x  v  pl 
 i x    ili  x    x  v  t l  
   without loss of generality  we assume that a variable cannot have both free and bound occurrences in
f   and more than one bound occurrence 
   in the symbol iv   v stands for vocabulary 

  

fianalyti  antoniou  damasio    wagner

note that the truth and falsity extensions of a property p according to a partial interpretation i  that is p ti  p  and p fi  p   are sets of pairs hsubject  objecti of resources  as
an example  let 
v    ex carlos  ex grigoris  ex riesling  ex likes  ex denotationof   grigorisxsd string 

and consider a structure i that consists of 
 a set of resources resi    c  g  r  l  d  grigoris  
 a set of properties p ropi    l  d  
 a vocabulary interpretation mapping iv   v  uri  resi  p ropi such that 
iv  ex carlos    c  iv  ex grigoris    g  iv  ex riesling    r  iv  ex likes    l  and
iv  ex denotationof     d 
 a property truth extension mapping pt i   p ropi  p resi  resi   such that 
p ti  d     hgrigoris  gi  
 a property falsity extension mapping pf i   p ropi  p resi  resi   such that 
p fi  l     hc  ri  
 a mapping ili   v  t l  resi such that  ili  grigorisxsd  string    grigoris 
 a set of literal values lv i    grigoris  

it is easy to see that i is a partial interpretation of v   expressing that   i  grigoris
is the denotation of grigoris and  ii  carlos dislikes riesling 
definition      coherent partial interpretation  a partial interpretation i of a vocabulary v is coherent iff for all x  p ropi   pt i  x   pf i  x      
coherent partial interpretations enforce the constraint that a pair of resources cannot
belong to both the truth and falsity extensions of a property  i e   all properties are coherent   intuitively  this means that an erdf triple cannot be both true and false 
continuing our previous example  note that i is a coherent partial interpretation 
consider now a partial interpretation j which is exactly as i  except that it also holds 
p tj  l     hc  ri   expressing that carlos likes riesling   then  hc  ri belongs to both
the truth and falsity extension of l  i e   hc  ri  p tj  l   p fj  l    thus  j is not coherent 
to define satisfaction of an erdf formula w r t  a partial interpretation  we need first
the following auxiliary definition 
definition      composition of a partial interpretation and a valuation  let i be
a partial interpretation of a vocabulary v and let v be a partial function v   var  resi
 called valuation   we define   i   i   v  x    v x   if x  var   and  ii   i   v  x    i x  
if x  v   
definition      satisfaction of an erdf formula w r t  a partial interpretation
and a valuation  let f  g be erdf formulas and let i be a partial interpretation of a
vocabulary v   additionally  let v be a mapping v   var  f    resi  
 if f   p s  o  then i  v    f iff p  v  uri  s  o  v  var   i p   p ropi   and
h i   v  s    i   v  o i  pt i  i p   
  

fiextended rdf as a semantic foundation of rule markup languages

 if f   p s  o  then i  v    f iff p  v  uri  s  o  v  var   i p   p ropi   and
h i   v  s    i   v  o i  pf i  i p   
 if f   g then i  v    f iff vg  v and i  v     g 
 if f   f  f  then i  v    f iff i  v    f  and i  v    f   
 if f   f  f  then i  v    f iff i  v    f  or i  v    f   
 if f   f   f  then  i  v    f iff i  v    f  f   
 if f   x g then i  v    f iff there exists mapping u   var  g   resi such that u y    v y  
y  var  g    x   and i  u    g 
 if f   x g then i  v    f iff for all mappings u   var  g   resi such that u y    v y  
y  var  g    x   it holds i  u    g 
 all other cases of erdf formulas are treated by the following demorgan style rewrite rules
expressing the falsification of compound erdf formulas 
 f  g   f  g   f  g   f  g   f    f    f    f    
 x f    x f   x f    x f   f  g   f g  

continuing our previous example  let v     x   y   z   resi such that v  x    c 
v  y    r  and v  z    g  it holds 
i  v    ex likes  x   y   ex denotationof  grigorisxsd string   z  
definition      satisfaction of an erdf formula w r t  a partial interpretation 
let f be an erdf formula and let i be a partial interpretation of a vocabulary v   we say
that i satisfies f   denoted by i    f   iff for every mapping v   var  f    resi   it holds
i  v    f  
continuing our previous example  i     x ex likes ex carlos   x  
below we define erdf graph satisfaction  extending satisfaction of an rdf graph
 hayes         see also appendix a  
definition      satisfaction of an erdf graph w r t  a partial interpretation  let
g be an erdf graph and let i be a partial interpretation of a vocabulary v   let v be a
mapping v   var  g   resi   we define 
 i  v   graph g iff t  g  i  v    t 
 i satisfies the erdf graph g  denoted by i   graph g  iff there exists a mapping
v   var  g   resi such that i  v   graph g  
intuitively  an erdf graph g represents an existentially quantified conjunction of
erdf triples  specifically  let g    t         tn   be an erdf graph  and let var  g   
 x         xk    then  g represents the erdf formula formula g     x          xk t        tn  
this is shown in the following lemma 
   material implication is the logical relationship between any two erdf formulas such that either the first
is non true or the second is true 
   this transformation expresses that if it is false that f does not hold then f holds 

  

fianalyti  antoniou  damasio    wagner

lemma     let g be an erdf graph and let i be a partial interpretation of a vocabulary
v   it holds  i   graph g iff i    formula g  
following the rdf terminology  klyne   carroll         the variables of an erdf
graph are also called blank nodes and intuitively denote anonymous web resources  for
example  consider the erdf graph 
g    rdf  type  x  ex europeancountry   rdf  type  x  ex eu member   
then  g represents the erdf formula formula g   
 x  rdf  type  x  ex europeancountry   rdf  type  x  ex eu member   
expressing that there is a european country which is not a european union member 
notational convention  let g be an erdf graph  let i be a partial interpretation of
a vocabulary v   and let v be a mapping v   var  g   resi   due to lemma      we will
write  by an abuse of notation  i  v    g and i    g instead of i  v   graph g and
i   graph g  respectively 
    erdf interpretations and entailment
in this subsection  we define erdf interpretations and entailment as an extension of rdfs
interpretations and entailment  hayes         first  we define the vocabularies of rdf 
rdfs  and erdf 
the vocabulary of rdf  vrdf   is a set of uri references in the rdf   namespace  hayes 
       as shown in table    the vocabulary of rdfs  vrdf s   is a set of uri references in
the rdfs  namespace  hayes         as shown in table    the vocabulary of erdf   verdf  
is a set of uri references in the erdf   namespace  specifically  the set of erdf predefined
classes is cerdf    erdf  totalclass  erdf  totalproperty   we define verdf   cerdf  
intuitively  instances of the metaclass erdf  totalclass are classes c that satisfy totalness 
meaning that each resource belongs to the truth or falsity extension of c  similarly  instances
of the metaclass erdf  totalproperty are properties p that satisfy totalness  meaning that
each pair of resources belongs to the truth or falsity extension of p 
we are now ready to define an erdf interpretation over a vocabulary v as an extension
of an rdfs interpretation  hayes         see also appendix a   where each property and
class is associated not only with a truth extension but also with a falsity extension  allowing
for both partial properties and partial classes  additionally  an erdf interpretation gives
special semantics to terms from the erdf vocabulary 
definition      erdf interpretation  an erdf interpretation i of a vocabulary v
is a partial interpretation of v  vrdf  vrdf s  verdf   extended by the new ontological

    i satisfies the rdf and rdfs axiomatic triples  hayes         shown in table   and table  
of appendix a  respectively 
    i satisfies the following triples  called erdf axiomatic triples 
rdfs subclassof  erdf  totalclass  rdfs class  
rdfs subclassof  erdf  totalproperty  rdfs class  

note that while rdfs intepretations  hayes        imply a two valued interpretation
of the instances of rdf  property  this is no longer the case with erdf interpretations 
specifically  let i be an erdf interpretation  let p  cti  i  rdf  property    and let hx  yi 
resi  resi   it may be the case that neither hx  yi  p ti  p  nor hx  yi  p fi  p   that is
p x  y  is neither true nor false 
semantic conditions of erdf interpretations may impose constraints to both the truth
and falsity extensions of properties and classes  specifically  consider semantic condition   of
definition     and assume that hx  yi  pt i  i rdfs subclassof     then  i should not only
satisfy ct i  x   ct i  y   as an rdfs interpretation i does   but also cf i  y   cf i  x  
the latter is true because if it is certain that a resource z does not belong to the truth
extension of class y then it is certain that z does not belong to the truth extension of class
x  thus  the falsity extension of y is contained in the falsity extension of x  similar is the
case for semantic condition    semantic conditions    and    represent our definition of
total classes and total properties  respectively  semantic condition    expresses that the
denotation of an ill typed xml literal is not a literal value  therefore  see semantic condition     it is certain that it is not contained in the truth extension of the class rdfs literal 
thus  it is contained in the falsity extension of the class rdfs literal 
let i be a coherent erdf interpretation of a vocabulary v   since i rdf  type   p ropi  
it holds  x  clsi   ct i  x   cf i  x      thus  all properties and classes of coherent
erdf interpretations are coherent 
convention  in the rest of the document  we consider only coherent erdf interpretations 
this means that referring to an erdf interpretation  we implicitly mean a coherent
one  moreover  to improve the readability of our examples  we will ignore the example
namespace ex  
according to rdfs semantics  hayes         the only source of rdfs inconsistency is
the appearance of an ill typed xml literal l in the rdf graph  in combination with the
derivation of the rdf triple x rdf  type rdfs literal  by the rdf and rdfs entailment
rules  where x is a blank node allocated to l     such a triple is called xml clash  to
    in rdf s   literals are not allowed in the subject position of rdf triples  whereas blank nodes are  for
this reason  before the rdf and rdfs entailment rules are applied on an rdf graph  each literal is
replaced by a unique blank node  this way inferences can be drawn on the literal value denoted by this
literal  without concern for the above restriction  hayes

understand this  note that from semantic condition   of definition a    rdf interpretation 
appendix a   it follows that the denotation of an ill typed xml literal cannot be a literal
value  now  from semantic conditions   and   of definition a    rdfs interpretation 
appendix a   it follows that the denotation of an ill typed xml literal cannot be of type
rdfs literal  therefore  the derivation of an xml clash from an rdf graph g through
the application of the rdf and rdfs entailment rules  indicates that there is no rdfs
interpretation that satisfies g 
an erdf graph can be erdf inconsistent     not only due to the appearance of an
ill typed xml literal in the erdf graph  in combination with semantic condition    of
definition       but also due to the additional semantic conditions for coherent erdf
interpretations 
for example  let p  q  s  o  uri and let g    p s  o   rdfs subpropertyof  p  q   q s  o   
then  g is erdf inconsistent  since there is no  coherent  erdf interpretation that satisfies g 
the following proposition shows that for total properties and total classes of  coherent 
erdf interpretations  weak negation and strong negation coincide  boolean truth values  
proposition     let i be an erdf interpretation of a vocabulary v and let v    v 
vrdf  vrdf s  verdf   then 
   for all p  s  o  v  such that i p   tprop i   it holds 
i    p s  o  iff i    p s  o   equivalently  i    p s  o   p s  o   
   for all x  c  v  such that i c   tcls i   it holds 
i    rdf  type x  c  iff i    rdf  type x  c 
 equivalently  i    rdf  type x  c   rdf  type x  c   
below we define erdf entailment between two erdf formulas or erdf graphs 
definition      erdf entailment  let f  f  be erdf formulas or erdf graphs  we
say that f erdf entails f   f   erdf f    iff for every erdf interpretation i  if i    f
then i    f    
for example  let 
f    x  y  rdf  type  x  person   hasfather   x   y    rdf  type john  person  
additionally  let f     y hasfather  john   y   rdf  type hasfather   rdf  property  
then f   erdf f   
the following proposition shows that erdf entailment extends rdfs entailment  hayes 
       see also appendix a  from rdf graphs to erdf formulas  in other words  erdf
entailment is upward compatible with rdfs entailment 
proposition     let g  g be rdf graphs such that vg verdf    and vg verdf    
then  g   rdf s g iff g   erdf g  
it easily follows from proposition     that an rdf graph is rdfs satisfiable iff it is
erdf satisfiable  thus  an rdf graph can be erdf inconsistent only due to an xml
clash 
    meaning that there is no  coherent  erdf interpretation that satisfies the erdf graph

   erdf ontologies   herbrand interpretations
in this section  we define an erdf ontology as a pair of an erdf graph g and a set
p of erdf rules  erdf rules should be considered as derivation rules that allow us to
infer more ontological information based on the declarations in g  moreover  we define the
herbrand interpretations and the minimal herbrand models of an erdf ontology 
definition      erdf rule  erdf program  an erdf rule r over a vocabulary v
is an expression of the form  g  f   where f  l v     true  is called condition and
g  l v        false  is called conclusion  we assume that no bound variable in f
appears free in g  we denote the set of variables and the set of free variables of r by var  r 
and fvar  r      respectively  additionally  we write cond r    f and concl r    g 
an erdf program p is a set of erdf rules over some vocabulary v   we denote the set
of uri references and literals appearing in p by vp   
recall that l v      denotes the set of erdf triples over v   therefore  the conclusion
of an erdf rule  unless it is false  it is either a positive erdf triple p s  o  or a negative
erdf triple p s  o  
for example  consider the derivation rule r 
allrelated   p   q    p rdf  type  p   p     q  rdf  type  q   q   related   p   q   

then  r is an erdf rule  indicating that between two classes p and q  it holds allrelated  p 
q  if for all instances p of the class p   there is an instance q of the class q such that it
holds related  p  q   note that var  r      p   q   p   q  and fvar  r      p   q  
when cond r    true and var  r        rule r is called erdf fact  when concl r   
false  rule r is called erdf constraint  we assume that for every partial interpretation
i and every function v   var  resi   it holds i  v    true  i    true  i  v     false  and
i     false 
intuitively  an erdf ontology is the combination of  i  an erdf graph g containing
 implicitly existentially quantified  positive and negative information  and  ii  an erdf
program p containing derivation rules  whose free variables are implicitly universally quantified  
definition      erdf ontology  an erdf ontology  or erdf knowledge base  is a
pair o   hg  p i  where g is an erdf graph and p is an erdf program  
the following definition defines the models of an erdf ontology 
definition      satisfaction of an erdf rule and an erdf ontology  let i be an
erdf interpretation of a vocabulary v  
 we say that i satisfies an erdf rule r  denoted by i    r  iff for all mappings
v   var  r   resi such that i  v    cond r   it holds i  v    concl r  
 we say that i satisfies an erdf ontology o   hg  p i  also  i is a model of o  
denoted by i    o  iff i    g and i    r   r  p

in this paper  existentially quantified variables in erdf graphs are handled by skolemization  a syntactic transformation commonly used in automatic inference systems for removing existentially quantified variables 
definition      skolemization of an erdf graph  let g be an erdf graph  the
skolemization function of g is an     mapping skg   var  g   uri  where for each
x  var  g   skg  x  is an artificial uri  denoted by g x  the set skg  var  g   is called
the skolem vocabulary of g 
the skolemization of g  denoted by sk g   is the ground erdf graph derived from g after
replacing each variable x  var  g  by skg  x   
intuitively  the skolem vocabulary of g  that is  skg  var  g    contains artificial uris
giving arbitrary names to the anonymous entities whose existence was asserted by the
use of blank nodes in g 
for example  let  g    rdf  type  x  europeancountry   rdf  type  x  eu member   
then 
sk g     rdf  type skg   x   europeancountry   rdf  type skg   x   eu member   

the following proposition expresses that the skolemization of an erdf graph has the
same entailments as the original graph  provided that these do not contain uris from the
skolemization vocabulary 
proposition     let g be an erdf graph and let f be an erdf formula such that
vf  skg  var  g       it holds  g   erdf f iff sk g    erdf f  
below we define the vocabulary of an erdf ontology o 
definition      vocabulary of an erdf ontology  let o   hg  p i be an erdf ontology  the vocabulary of o is defined as vo   vsk g   vp  vrdf  vrdf s  verdf  

note that the vocabulary of an ontology o   hg  p i contains the skolemization vocabulary of g 
let o   hg  p i be an erdf ontology  we denote by resh
o the union of vo and the set
of xml values of the well typed xml literals in vo minus the well typed xml literals 
the following definition defines the herbrand interpretations and the herbrand models
of an erdf ontology 
definition      herbrand interpretation  herbrand model of an erdf ontology 
let o   hg  p i be an erdf ontology and let i be an erdf interpretation of vo   we say
that i is a herbrand interpretation of o iff 
 resi   resh
o 
 iv  x    x  for all x  vo  uri 
 ili  x    x  if x is a typed literal in vo other than a well typed xml literal  and
ili  x  is the xml value of x  if x is a well typed xml literal in vo  
  

fianalyti  antoniou  damasio    wagner

we denote the set of herbrand interpretations of o by i h  o  
a herbrand interpretation i of o is a herbrand model of o iff i    hsk g   p i  we denote
the set of herbrand models of o by mh  o   
note that if i is a herbrand interpretation of an erdf ontology o then i x    x  for
each x  vo other than a well typed xml literal 
it is easy to see that every herbrand model of an erdf ontology o is a model of
o  moreover  note that every herbrand interpretation of an erdf ontology o is uniquely
identified by  i  its set of properties and  ii  its property truth and property falsity extension
mappings 
however  not all herbrand models of an erdf ontology o are desirable  for example 
let p  s  o  uri  let g    p s  o    and let o   hg  i  then  there is a herbrand model
i of o such that i    p o  s   whereas we want p o  s  to be satisfied by all intended
models of o  this is because p is not a total property and p o  s  cannot be derived from
o  negation as failure     
before we define the minimal herbrand interpretations of an erdf ontology o  we need
to define a partial ordering on the herbrand interpretations of o 
definition      herbrand interpretation ordering  let o   hg  p i be an erdf ontology  let i  j  i h  o   we say that j extends i  denoted by i  j  or j  i   iff
p ropi  p ropj   and for all p  p ropi   it holds pt i  p   pt j  p  and pf i  p   pf j  p  

it is easy to verify that the relation  is reflexive  transitive  and antisymmetric  thus 
it is a partial ordering on i h  o  
the intuition behind definition     is that by extending a herbrand interpretation  we
extend both the truth and falsity extension for all properties  and thus  since rdf  type is a
property   for all classes 
the following proposition expresses that two herbrand interpretations i  j of an erdf
ontology o are incomparable  if the property truth or property falsity extension of a total
property p w r t  i and j are different 
proposition     let o   hg  p i be an erdf ontology and let i  j  i h  o   let p 
tprop i  tprop j   if pt i  p     pt j  p  or pf i  p     pf j  p  then i   j and j   i 
definition      minimal herbrand interpretations  let o be an erdf ontology and
let i  i h  o   we define minimal i     i  i     j  i   j  
  i and j  i   
we define the minimal herbrand models of o  as 
mmin  o    minimal mh  o   
however minimal herbrand models do not give the intended semantics to all erdf rules 
this is because erdf rules are derivation and not implication rules  derivation rules are
    on the other hand  if p is a total property then p o  s p o  s  should be satisfied by all intended models 
therefore  in this case  there should be an intended model of o that satisfies p o  s  

  

fiextended rdf as a semantic foundation of rule markup languages

often identified with implications  but  in general  these are two different concepts  while
an implication is an expression of a logical formula language  a derivation rule is rather a
meta logical expression  there are logics  which do not have an implication connective  but
which have a derivation rule concept  in standard logics  such as classical and intuitionistic
logic   there is a close relationship between a derivation rule  also called sequent  and the
corresponding implicational formula  they both have the same models  for non monotonic
rules  e g  with negation as failure   this is no longer the case  the intended models of such
a rule are  in general  not the same as the intended models of the corresponding implication 
this is easy to see with the help of an example  consider the rule p  q whose model set 
according to the stable model semantics  gelfond   lifschitz              herre   wagner 
      herre et al          is   p    that is  it entails p  on the other hand  the model set
of the corresponding implication q  p  which is equivalent to the disjunction p  q  is
  p    q    p  q    consequently  it does not entail p 
similarly  let o   h  p i  where p    p s  o   q s  o   and p  q  s  o  uri  not
all minimal herbrand models of o are intended  in particular  there is i  mmin  o 
such that i    q s  o   p s  o   whereas we want q s  o   p s  o  to be satisfied by all
intended models of o  as q is not a total property and q s  o  cannot be derived by any rule
 negation as failure  
to define the intended  stable  models of an erdf ontology  we need first to define
grounding of erdf rules 
definition      grounding of an erdf program  let v be a vocabulary and let r
be an erdf rule  we denote by  r v the set of rules that result from r if we replace each
variable x  fvar  r  by v x   for all mappings v   fvar  r   v  
let p be an erdf program  we define  p  v  

s

rp  r v  



note that a rule variable can naturally appear in the subject position of an erdf triple 
since variables can be instantiated by a literal  a literal can naturally appear in the subject
position of an erdf triple in the grounded version of an erdf program  this case further
supports our choice of allowing literals in the subject position of an erdf triple 

   erdf stable models
in this section  we define the intended models of an erdf ontology o  called stable models
of o  based on minimal herbrand interpretations  in particular  defining the stable models
of o  only the minimal interpretations from a set of herbrand interpretations that satisfy
certain criteria are considered 
below  we define the stable models of an erdf ontology  based on the coherent stable
models   of partial logic  herre et al         
definition      erdf stable model  let o   hg  p i be an erdf ontology and let
m  i h  o   we say that m is an  erdf  stable model of o iff there is a chain of
herbrand interpretations of o  i        ik   such that ik   ik     m and 
    note that these models on extended logic programs are equivalent  herre et al         to answer sets of
answer set semantics  gelfond   lifschitz

   i   minimal  i  i h  o    i    sk g    
   for successor ordinals  with       k     
i  minimal  i  i h  o    i  i  and i    concl r   r  p i   m       where
p i   m      r   p  vo   i    cond r   i  i h  o  s t  i   i  m   
the set of stable models of o is denoted by mst  o   
note that i  is a minimal herbrand interpretation of o   hg  p i that satisfies sk g  
while herbrand interpretations i         ik   correspond to a stratified sequence of rule applications  where all applied rules remain applicable throughout the generation of a stable
model m   in our words  a stable model is generated bottom up by the iterative application
of the rules in the erdf program p   starting from the information in the erdf graph g 
thus  erdf stable model semantics  as a refinement of minimal model semantics  captures
the intuition that 
 assertions rdf  type p  erdf  totalproperty  and rdf  type c  erdf  totalclass  should only
be accepted if the ontology contains some direct support for them in the form of an
acceptable rule sequence  that corresponds to a proof  
 assertions p s  o  and p s  o  should only be accepted if the ontology contains some
direct support for them in the form of an acceptable rule sequence  or
rdf  type p  erdf  totalproperty  is accepted 
 assertions rdf  type o  c  and rdf  type o  c  should only be accepted if the ontology
contains some direct support for them in the form of an acceptable rule sequence  or
rdf  type c  erdf  totalclass  is accepted 
wine selection example  consider a class wine whose instances are wines  and a
property likes x  y   indicating that person x likes object y   assume now that we want
to select wines for a dinner such that  for each guest  there is on the table exactly one wine
that he she likes  let the class guest indicate the persons that will be invited to the dinner
and let the class selectedwine indicate the wines chosen to be served  an erdf program
p that describes this wine selection problem is the following  commas   in the body of
the rules indicate conjunction   
id  x   x   rdf  type  x  rdfs resource  
rdf  type  y  selectedwine   rdf  type  x  guest   rdf  type  y  wine   likes  x   y  
 z  rdf  type  z  selectedwine   id  z   y   likes  x   z   

consider now the erdf graph g  containing the factual information 
g     rdf  type carlos  guest   rdf  type gerd   guest   rdf  type riesling  wine  
rdf  type retsina  wine   rdf  type chardonnay  wine   likes gerd   riesling  
likes gerd   retsina   likes carlos  chardonnay   likes carlos  retsina    

then  according to definition      the erdf ontology o   hg  p i has two stable models 
m  and m    such that 
  

fiextended rdf as a semantic foundation of rule markup languages

m     rdf  type riesling  selectedwine   rdf  type chardonnay  selectedwine  
 rdf  type retsina  selectedwine  
m     rdf  type retsina  selectedwine    rdf  type riesling  selectedwine  
 rdf  type chardonnay  selectedwine  

note that  according to stable model m    the wines selected for the dinner are riesling
and chardonnay  this is because   i  gerd likes riesling but does not like chardonnay 
and  ii  carlos likes chardonnay but does not like riesling 
according to stable model m    only retsina is selected for the dinner  this is because 
both gerd and carlos like retsina 
stable model m  is reached through the chain i   m   m    where i  is the single
herbrand interpretation in minimal  i  i h  o    i    sk g     to verify this  note that 
p i   m      p m   m     
 id  x   x   rdf  type  x  rdfs resource  vo 
 rdf  type riesling  selectedwine   rdf  type gerd   guest  
rdf  type riesling  wine   likes gerd   riesling  
 z  rdf  type  z  selectedwine   id  z   riesling   likes gerd    z    
 rdf  type chardonnay  selectedwine   rdf  type carlos  guest  
rdf  type chardonnay  wine   likes carlos  chardonnay  
 z  rdf  type  z  selectedwine   id  z   chardonnay   likes carlos   z    

similarly  stable model m  is reached through the chain i   m   m    to verify this 
note that 
p i   m      p m   m     
 id  x   x   rdf  type  x  rdfs resource  vo 
 rdf  type retsina  selectedwine   rdf  type gerd   guest

 z  rdf  type  z  selectedwine   id  z  retsina   likes gerd    z    
 rdf  type retsina  selectedwine   rdf  type carlos  guest  
rdf  type retsina  wine   likes carlos  retsina  
 z  rdf  type  z  selectedwine   id  z  retsina   likes carlos   z    

assume now that retsina should not be one of the selected wines  because it does not
match with the food  to indicate this  we add to p the erdf constraint 
false  rdf  type retsina  selectedwine  
then  m  is the single model of the modified ontology 
it is easy to verify that if o is an erdf ontology and o is exactly as o  but without
the erdf constraints appearing in o  then mst  o   mst  o    in other words  the erdf
constraints appearing in an erdf ontology eliminate undesirable stable models 
paper assignment example  consider a class paper whose instances are papers submitted to a conference  a class reviewer whose instances are potential reviewers for the
  

fianalyti  antoniou  damasio    wagner

submitted papers  and a property conflict r  p   indicating that there is a conflict of interest between reviewer r and paper p   assume now that we want to assign papers to
reviewers based on the following criteria   i  a paper is assigned to at most one reviewer 
 ii  a reviewer is assigned at most one paper  and  iii  a paper is not assigned to a reviewer 
if there is a conflict of interest  the assignment of a paper p to a reviewer r is indicated
through the property assign p  r   the erdf triple allassigned  paper   reviewer   indicates that each paper has been assigned to one reviewer  an erdf program p describing
the assignment of papers is the following

we would like to note that  in contrast to the previous examples  given an erdf
ontology o   hg  p i  it is possible that  minimal   i  i h  o    i    sk g          due
to the declaration of total properties and total classes  specifically  the number of the
interpretations i  in item   of definition     is more than one iff g contains erdf triples
of the form rdf  type p  erdf  totalproperty  or rdf  type c  erdf  totalclass   for example  let
o   hg  i  where 
g    authorof  john  book     authorof  peter   book     rdf  type authorof   erdf  totalproperty   

then  there are i    i   minimal   i  i h  o    i    sk g    such that 
i     authorof  john  book    and i     authorof  john  book    
note that both i  and i  are stable models of o  however  i  satisfies authorof  john  book    
even though there is no evidence that john is an author of book   
the following proposition shows that a stable model of an erdf ontology o is a herbrand model of o 
  

fiextended rdf as a semantic foundation of rule markup languages

proposition     let o   hg  p i be an erdf ontology and let m  mst  o   it holds
m  mh  o  
on the other hand  if all properties are total  a herbrand model m of an erdf ontology
o   hg  p i is a stable model of o     obviously  this is a desirable result since  in this
case  an open world assumption is made for all properties  thus  there is no preferential
entailment of weak negation  for any of the properties  of course  the term stable model
is not very descriptive  for this degenerative case 
proposition     let o   hg  p i be an erdf ontology such that
rdfs subclassof  rdf  property  erdf  totalproperty   g  then  mst  o    mh  o  
a final note is that  similarly to stable models defined by gelfond   lifschitz             
and herre et al          erdf stable models do not preserve herbrand model satisfiability 
for example  let o   h  p i  where p    p s  o   p s  o   and p  s  o  uri  then 
mst  o      whereas there is a herbrand model of o that satisfies p s  o  

   erdf stable model entailment   stable answers
in this section  we define stable model entailment on erdf ontologies  showing that it extends erdf entailment on erdf graphs  moreover  we define the skeptical and credulous
answers of an erdf formula  query  f w r t  an erdf ontology o 
definition      stable model entailment  let o   hg  p i be an erdf ontology and
let f be an erdf formula or erdf graph  we say that o entails f under the  erdf 
stable model semantics  denoted by o   st f iff for all m  mst  o   m    f   
for example  let o   h  p i  where p    p s  o   q s  o   and p  q  s  o  uri  then 
o   st q s  o   p s  o  
now  let g    rdfs subclassof  rdf  property  erdf  totalproperty   and let p be as in
the previous example  then  hg  p i   st q s  o   p s  o   but hg  p i    st q s  o  and
hg  p i    st p s  o   note that this is the desirable result  since now q is a total property
 and thus  an open world assumption is made for q  
as another example  let p  s  o  uri  let g    p s  o    and let p    p  x   y  
p  x   y    then  hg  p i   st p o  s   p o  s   note that p contains a cwa on p  
now  let g    rdf  type p  erdf  totalproperty   p s  o   and let p be as in the previous
example  then  hg  p i   st  x  y  p  x   y  p  x   y    see proposition       but
hg  p i    st p o  s  and hg  p i    st p o  s   indeed  the cwa in p does not affect the
semantics of p  since p is a total property 
eu membership example  consider the following erdf program p   specifying some
rules for concluding that a country is not a member state of the european union  eu  
 r   
 r   

rdf  type  x  eumember  
rdf  type  x  eumember  

rdf  type  x  americancountry  
rdf  type  x  europeancountry  
rdf  type  x  eumember  

    note that  in this case  m  minimal  i  i h  o    i    sk g    and m  minimal  i  i h  o    i 
m and i    concl r    r  p m m      

  

fianalyti  antoniou  damasio    wagner

a rather incomplete erdf ontology o   hg  p i is obtained by including the following
information in the erdf graph g 
rdf  type russia  eumember  
rdf  type austria  eumember  
rdf  type  x  europeancountry  

rdf  type canada  americancountry  
rdf  type italy  europeancountry  
rdf  type  x  eumember  

using stable model entailment on o  it can be concluded that austria is a member of eu 
that russia and canada are not members of eu  and that it exists a european country
which is not a member of eu  however  it is also concluded that italy is not a member of eu  which is a wrong statement  this is because g does not contain complete
information of the european countries that are eu members  e g   it does not contain
rdf  type italy  eumember    thus  incorrect information is obtained by the closed world
assumption expressed in rule r    in the case that rdf  type eumember  erdf  totalclass 
is added to g  that is  an open world assumption is made for the class eumember  then
rdf  type italy  eumember  and thus  rdf  type italy  eumember  are no longer entailed 
this is because  there is a stable model of the extended erdf ontology o that satisfies
rdf  type italy  eumember   moreover  if complete information for all european countries
that are members of eu is included in g then the stable model conclusions of o will also
be correct  the closed world assumption will be correctly applied   note that  in this case 
g will include the erdf triple rdf  type italy  eumember  
the following proposition follows directly from the fact that any stable model of an
erdf ontology o is an erdf interpretation 
proposition     let o   hg  p i be an erdf ontology and let f  f  be erdf formulas 
if o   st f and f   erdf f  then o   st f   
for erdf graphs g  g   it can be proved that hg  i   st g iff g   erdf g  see
below   now the question arises whether this result can be generalized by replacing the
erdf graph g by any erdf formula f   the following example shows that this is not
the case  let g    p s  o   and let f   p o  s   where p  s  o  uri  then hg  i   st f  
whereas g    erdf f   however  g can be replaced by any erdf d formula f   defined as
follows 
definition      erdf d formula  let f be an erdf formula  we say that f is an
erdf d formula iff  i  f is the disjunction of existentially quantified conjunctions of erdf
triples  and  ii  fvar  f       
for example  let 
f     x rdf  type  x   vertex    rdf  type  x   red    
  x rdf  type  x   vertex    rdf  type  x   blue   
then  f is an erdf d formula  it is easy to see that if g is an erdf graph then formula g 
is an erdf d formula 
  

fiextended rdf as a semantic foundation of rule markup languages

proposition     let g be an erdf graph and let f be an erdf formula such that
vf  skg  var  g       it holds 
   if f is an erdf d formula and hg  i   st f then g   erdf f  
   if g   erdf f then hg  i   st f  
let g be an erdf graph and let f be an erdf d formula or an erdf graph such
that vf  skg  var  g       a direct consequence of proposition     is that 
hg  i   st f iff g   erdf f  
the following proposition is a direct consequence of proposition     and proposition
     and shows that stable model entailment extends rdfs entailment from rdf graphs
to erdf ontologies 
proposition     let g  g be rdf graphs such that vg  verdf     vg  verdf    
and vg  skg  var  g       it holds  g   rdf s g iff hg  i   st g  
recall that the skolem vocabulary of g  that is  skg  var  g    contains artificial uris
giving arbitrary names to the anonymous entities whose existence was asserted by the
use of blank nodes in g  thus  the condition vg  skg  var  g      in proposition     is
actually trivial 
definition      erdf query  erdf stable answers  let o   hg  p i be an erdf
ontology  an  erdf  query f is an erdf formula  the  erdf  stable answers of f
w r t  o are defined as follows 

if fvar  f      and m  mst  o    m    f
 yes
st
no
if fvar  f      and m  mst  o    m     f
ans o  f    

 v   fvar  f    vo   m  mst  o   m    v f   

if fvar  f       

where v f   is the formula f after replacing all the free variables x in f by v x   
for example  let p  q  c  s  o  uri  let g    p s  o   rdf  type s  c   rdf  type o  c    and
let p    q  x   y   rdf  type  x  c   rdf  type  y  c   p  x   y    then  the stable
answers of f   q  x   y  w r t  o   hg  p i are ans st
o  f        x   o   y   o     x  
s   y   s     x   o   y   s   
let o   hg  p i  where q  s  o  uri  g    rdf  type p  erdf  totalproperty   q s  o   
st
and p    p  x   y   p  x   y    then  it holds ans st
o  p  x   y    ans o  p  x   y    
st
ans o  p  x   y       this is because  in contrast to the above example  p is a total
property  thus  for all mappings v     x   y   vo   there is a stable model m of o
such that m    v p  x   y   p  x   y    and another stable model m  of o such that
m     v p  x   y   p  x   y   
consider the erdf ontology o of the paper assignment example  below definition
st
     then  ans st
o  assign p    r     yes and ans o  assign p    r     no  though
st
ans o  assign p    r     no  that is assign p    r   is not satisfied by all stable models of o  there is a stable model  m    that satisfies assign p    r    indeed the answers of
the query assign  x   y  w r t  the stable models m  and m  are of particular interest since
  

fianalyti  antoniou  damasio    wagner

both m  and m  satisfy allassigned  paper   reviewer    indicating that the desirable paper
assignment has been achieved 
the following definition defines the credulous stable answers of a query f w r t  an
erdf ontology o  that is the answers of f w r t  the particular stable models of o 
definition      credulous erdf stable answers  let o   hg  p i be an erdf ontology  the credulous  erdf  stable answers of a query f w r t  o are defined as follows 

 yes if fvar  f      and m  mst  o    m    f
st
no if fvar  f      and m  mst  o    m     f
c ans o  f    

 ans m  f         m  mst  o  
if fvar  f       

where ans m  f      v   fvar  f    vo   m    v f     

continuing with the paper assignment example  consider the query 
f   allassigned  paper   reviewer   
st
then  although ans st
o  f    no  it holds c ans o  f    yes  indicating that there is at
least one desirable assignment of the papers p    p    p   to reviewers r   r   r  
consider now the query f   allassigned  paper   reviewer    assign  x    y   then 

c ans st
o  f         x   p     y   r      x   p     y   r      x   p     y   r    
   x   p     y   r      x   p     y   r      x   p     y   r     

indicating all possible desirable assignments of papers  obviously  the credulous stable
answers of a query f can provide alternative solutions  which can be useful in a range of
applications  where alternative scenarios naturally appear 
closing this section  we would like to indicate several differences of the erdf stable
model semantics w r t  first order logic  fol   first  in our semantics a domain closure assumption is made  this is due to the fact that the domain of every herbrand interpretation
of an erdf ontology o is resh
o   that is the union of the vocabulary of o  vo   and the
set of xml values of the well typed xml literals in vo minus the well typed xml literals 
this implies that quantified variables always range in a closed domain  to understand the
implications of this assumption  consider the erdf graph 
g    rdf  type x  c     x   c   c    v    

where v     vrdf   rdf   i   i  in     vrdf s  verdf   additionally  consider the erdf
program 
p     rdf  type  x  c    rdf  type  x  rdfs containermembershipproperty  
rdf  type  x  c    true   

let f    x rdf  type  x  c    rdf  type  x  c    it holds that hg  p i   st f   however 
g  p    f ol f   this is because  there is a fol model m of g  p with a domain d
and a variable assignment v   x   d such that m  v    rdf  type  x  c   and m  v    
rdf  type  x  c   
another difference is due to the fact that in the definition of the erdf stable model
semantics  only minimal herbrand interpretations are considered  let
  

fiextended rdf as a semantic foundation of rule markup languages

g    teaches anne  cs       teaches peter   cs       rdf  type cs      gradcourse   

let f    x teaches peter    x   rdf  type  x  gradcourse   then  hg  i   st f  
however  g    f ol f   this is because  there is a fol model m of g with a domain d
and a variable assignment v   x   d such that m  v    teaches peter    x  and m  v    
rdf  type  x  gradcourse   in other words  fol makes an open world assumption for
teaches 
consider now g   g   rdf  type teaches  erdf  totalproperty    then  similarly to
fol  it holds o   hg   i    st f   this is because now teaches is a total property  thus 
there is a stable model m of o and a variable assignment v    x   resh
o such that
m  v    teaches peter    x  and m  v     rdf  type  x  gradcourse   in other worlds  now an
open world assumption is made for teaches  as in fol  thus  there might exist a course
taught by peter   even if it is not explicitly indicated so in g  
this example also shows that  in contrast to fol  stable model entailment is nonmonotonic 
note that the previous erdf graph g can also be seen as a description logic a box
a  baader et al          where
a    teaches anne  cs      teaches peter   cs      gradcourse cs     
consider a t box t     since description logics  dls  are fragments of first order
logic  it holds that l   ha  t i    dl teaches gradcourse peter    meaning that l does not
satisfy that all courses taught by peter are graduate courses  an interesting approach for
supporting non monotonic conclusions in dls is taken by donini et al          where dls of
minimal knowledge and negation as failure  mknf dls  are defined  by extending dls with
two modal operators k  a  intuitively  k expresses minimal knowledge and a expresses
weak negation  it holds that l   mknf dl kteaches kgradcourse peter    expressing that all
courses known to be taught by peter are known to be graduate courses  note that this
conclusion is non monotonic  and thus it cannot be derived by classical dls  however 
compared to our theory  mknf dls do not support rules and closed world assumptions on
properties  i e   p  x   y   p  x   y   

   an xml based syntax for erdf
a natural approach to define an xml syntax for erdf is   i  to follow the rdf xml
syntax  beckett         as much as possible  and  ii  to extend it in a suitable way  where
necessary  following this approach  we briefly present here an xml syntax for erdf 
details are going to be given in a subsequent paper 
classes and properties are defined with the help of the rdfs class and rdf property
elements of the rdf xml syntax  similarly  total classes and total properties are defined with the help of the erdf totalclass and erdf totalproperty elements of the
erdf xml syntax 
example     the following erdf xml statements 
 rdf property rdf about   likes  
 rdfs domain rdf resource   person   
  

fianalyti  antoniou  damasio    wagner

  rdf property 
 erdf totalproperty rdf about   authorof  
 rdfs domain rdf resource   person   
 rdfs range rdf resource   book   
  erdf totalproperty 

correspond to the erdf graph 
g     rdf  type likes  rdf  property   rdfs domain likes  person  
rdf  type authorof   erdf  totalproperty   rdfs domain authorof   person  
rdfs range authorof   book    

erdf triples  and sets of erdf triples sharing the same subject term  are encoded
by means of the erdf description element  each description contains a non empty list of
 possibly negated  property value slots about the subject term 
 uri references  blank node identifiers  and variables that appear in the subject position
of an erdf triple are expressed as values of the erdf about attribute  using the
sparql syntax  prudhommeaux   seaborne        for blank node identifiers and
variables  on the other hand  literals that appear in the subject position of an erdf
triple are expressed as the text content of the erdf about subelement 
 uri references  blank node identifiers  and variables that appear in the object position of an erdf triple are expressed as values of the attributes rdf resource 
rdf nodeid  and erdf variable  respectively  on the other hand  literals that appear in the object position of an erdf triple are expressed as the text content of the
corresponding property subelement 
example     the following erdf description statements 
 erdf description erdf about   gerd  
 ex authorof rdf nodeid  x   
 ex likes rdf resource   chicken   
 ex likes erdf negationmode  sneg  rdf resource   pork   
  erdf description 
 erdf description 
 erdf about rdf datatype   xsd string  grigoris  erdf about 
 ex denotationof rdf resource   grigoris   
  erdf description 

correspond to the erdf graph 
g     authorof  gerd    x    likes gerd   chicken   likes gerd   pork   
denotationof  grigorisxsd  string  grigoris    

now  in order to express erdf rules with xml  we use the rule markup language r ml
 rewerse rule markup language   wagner  giurca    lukichev               which
is a general xml based markup language for representing derivation rules and integrity
constraints  this is demonstrated in the following example 
  

fiextended rdf as a semantic foundation of rule markup languages

example     the following erdf derivationrule statement 
 r ml derivationrule r ml ruleid  r   
 r ml conditions 
 erdf description erdf about   x

expresses that a main dish is selected for dinner  if there is a guest who likes it and no guest
who dislikes it  specifically  it corresponds to the erdf rule 
rdf  type  x  selectedmaindish   rdf  type  x  maindish   rdf  type  y  guest   likes  y   x  
   z rdf  type  z  guest   likes  z   x   

   undecidability of the erdf stable model semantics
the main difficulty in the computation of the erdf stable model semantics is the fact that
vrdf is infinite  and thus the vocabulary of any erdf ontology o is also infinite  note
that  rdf   i   i  in    vrdf  vo    due to this fact  satisfiability and entailment under
the erdf stable model semantics are in general undecidable 
the proof of undecidability exploits a reduction from the unbounded tiling problem  the
unbounded tiling problem consists in placing tiles on an infinite grid  satisfying a given set
of constraints on adjacent tiles  specifically  the unbounded tiling problem is a structure
d   ht   h  v i  where t    t         tn   is a finite set of tile types and h  v  t  t specify
which tiles can be adjacent horizontally and vertically  respectively  a solution to d is a
tiling  that is  a total function    in  in  t such that     i  j     i      j    h and
   i  j     i  j        v   for all i  j  in   the existence of a solution for a given unbounded
tiling problem is known to be undecidable  berger        
let d   ht   h  v i be an instance of the unbounded tiling problem  where t    t         tn   
we will construct an erdf ontology od   hg  p i and an erdf formula fd such that d
has a solution iff od does not entail fd under the erdf stable model semantics

false  above  x   y   type  x   t    type  y   t     vconstraint  t   t    

note that in all stable models of od   hg  p i  the class tile contains exactly the
 infinite in mumber  rdf   i terms  for i  in   this is because  computing the stable models
of o  only the minimal models of sk g  are considered  see definition      step     thus 
each tile on the infinite grid is represented by an rdf   i term  for i  in  
intuitively  rule set     expresses that each tile should have exactly one associated type
in t   rule set     expresses that two tiles are either horizontally adjacent on the grid or not

horizontally adjacent  rule set     expresses that two tiles are either vertically adjacent on
the grid or not vertically adjacent  rule set     expresses that each tile should have exactly
one tile right next to it and exactly one tile right above it  rule set     expresses that the
types of horizontally and vertically adjacent tiles should respect the h and v relations of
d  respectively 
to finalize the reduction  we define 
fd    x   y   x    y     x right  x   y   above  y   y     right  x    y     above  x    x   
id   x   x   

formula fd expresses that there is a tile x such that  starting from x  if we move 
one step right  one step up  one step left  one step down

then we will meet a tile x different than x 
proposition     let d be an instance of the unbounded tiling problem  it holds 
   d has a solution iff od   false  fd   has a stable model 
   d has a solution iff od    st fd  
since the unbounded tiling problem is undecidable  berger         it follows directly from
proposition     that satisfiability and entailment under the erdf stable model semantics
are in general undecidable 
the previous reduction shows that both problems remain undecidable for an erdf ontology o   hg  p i  even if  i  the body of each rule in p has the form t         tk   tk          tn  
where ti is an erdf triple and  ii  the terms erdf  totalclass and erdf  totalproperty do
not appear in o  that is   vg  vp    verdf     note that since each constraint false  f
that appears in an erdf ontology o can be replaced by the rule t  f   where t is an
rdf  rdfs  or erdf axiomatic triple  the presence of constraints in o does not affect
decidability 
future work concerns the identification of syntactic restrictions for an erdf ontology
o such that erdf stable model entailment is decidable 

   erdf model theory as tarski style model theory
tarski style model theory is not limited to classical first order models  as employed in the
semantics of owl  it allows various extensions  such as relaxing the bivalence assumption
 e g   allowing for partial models  or allowing higher order models  it is also compatible
with the idea of non monotonic inference  simply by not considering all models of a rule as
being intended  but only those models that satisfy certain criteria  thus  the stable model
semantics for normal and  generalized  extended logic programs  gelfond   lifschitz       
      herre   wagner        herre et al         can be viewed as a tarski style modeltheoretic semantics for non monotonic derivation rules 
a tarski style model theory is a triple hl  i    i such that 
 l is a set of formulas  called language 
  

fianalyti  antoniou  damasio    wagner

 i is a set of interpretations  and
    is a relation between interpretations and formulas  called model relation 
for each tarski style model theory hl  i    i  we can define 
 a notion of derivation rule g  f   where f  l is called condition and g  l is
called conclusion 
 a set of derivation rules drl    g  f   f  g  l  
 an extension of the model relation    to include also pairs of interpretations and
derivation rules  and
 a standard model operator m kb      i  i   i    x  x  kb    where kb 
l  drl is a set of formulas and or derivation rules  called a knowledge base 
notice that in this way we can define rules also for logics which do not contain an
implication connective  this shows that the concept of a rule is independent of the concept
of implication 
typically  in knowledge representation theories  not all models of a knowledge base are
intended models  except from the standard model operator m  there are also non standard
model operators  which do not provide all models of a knowledge base  but only a special
subset that is supposed to capture its intended models according to some semantics 
a particularly important type of such an intended model semantics is obtained on the
basis of some information ordering   which allows to compare the information content of
two interpretations i    i   i  whenever i   i    we say that i  is less informative than
i    an information model theory hl  i      i is a tarski style model theory  extended by
an information ordering  
for any information model theory  we can define a number of natural non standard
model operators  such as the minimal model operator 
mmin  kb     minimal  m kb   
and various refinements of it  like the stable generated models  gelfond   lifschitz       
      herre   wagner        herre et al         
for any given model operator mx   p l  drl    p i   knowledge base kb 
l  drl   and f  l  we can define an entailment relation 
kb   x f

iff i  mx  kb    i    f

for non standard model operators  like minimal and stable models  this entailment
relation is typically non monotonic  in the sense that for an extension kb   kb it may
be the case that kb entails f   but kb  does not entail f  
our  erdf  stable model theory can be seen as a tarski style model theory  where
l   l uri  lit    i is the set of erdf interpretations over any vocabulary v 
uri  lit   and the model relation    is as defined in definitions     and      in our
theory  the intended model operator  mst   assigns to each erdf ontology a  possibly
empty  set of stable models  definition

in this section  we briefly review extensions of web ontology languages with rules 
ter horst      b        generalizes rdf graphs to generalized rdf graphs  by allowing variables in the property position of rdf triples  additionally  the author extends the
rdfs semantics with datatypes and part of the owl vocabulary  defining the pd semantics  which extends the if semantics of rdfs and is weaker than the iff semantics of
d entailment  hayes        and owl full  patel schneider  hayes    horrocks         a
sound and complete set of entailment rules for pd entailment is also presented 
in a subsequent work  ter horst      a  considers the extension of the previous framework with the inclusion of rules of the form if g then g   where g is an rdf graph without
blank nodes but possibly with variables and g is a generalized rdf graph  possibly with
both blank nodes and variables  intuitively  rule variables are universally quantified in the
front of the rule  like the free variables of our rules  and blank nodes in the head of the rule
correspond to existentially quantified variables  this feature is not supported in our model  
based on a set of rules r and a datatype map d  r entailment   is defined between two
generalized rdf graphs g and g  g   r g    and a set of sound and complete rules for
r entailment is presented  to relate our work with that of ter horst      a   we state the
following proposition 
let d be a datatype map  containing only rdf  xmlliteral   and let r be a set of rules of the form
if g then g  with the constraints   i  all terms appearing in property position are uris   ii  if
g       then no blank node appears in g   and  iii  vr   vpowl  verdf       where vpowl
denotes the part of the owl vocabulary  included in the pd semantics  let g  g be rdf graphs
such that  vg  vg     vpowl  verdf       then based on g and r  we can define  by a simple
transformation  an erdf ontology o such that g   r g iff o   st g  

however  in this work  weak and strong negation are not considered  thus  closed world
reasoning is not supported  additionally  in our theory  the condition of a rule is any erdf
formula over a vocabulary v    thus  involving any of the logical factors            
and    and not just a conjunction of positive triples 
triple  sintek   decker        is a rule language for the semantic web that is
especially designed for querying and transforming rdf models  or contexts   supporting
rdf and a subset of owl lite  its syntax is based on f logic  kifer  lausen    wu 
      and supports an important fragment of first order logic  a triple is represented by
a statement of the form s p  o  and sets of statements  sharing the same subject s  can
be aggregated using molecules of the form s p   o    p   o           all variables must be
explicitly quantified  either existentially or universally  arbitrary formulas can be used in
the body  while the head of the rules is restricted to atoms or conjunctions of molecules 
an interesting and relevant feature of triple is the use of models to collect sets of related
sentences  in particular  part of the semantics of the rdf s  vocabulary is represented as
pre defined rules  and not as semantic conditions on interpretations   which are grouped
together in a module  triple provides other features like path expressions  skolem model

owl dl  mcguinness   van harmelen        is an ontology representation language
for the semantic web  that is a syntactic variant of the shoin  d  description logic and
a decidable fragment of first order logic  horrocks   patel schneider         however  the
need for extending the expressive power of owl dl with rules has initiated several studies 
including the swrl  semantic web rule language  proposal  horrocks  patel schneider 
boley  tabet  grosof    dean         horrocks   patel schneider        show that this
extension is in general undecidable  al log  donini  lenzerini  nardi    schaerf       
was one of the first efforts to integrate description logics with  safe  datalog rules  while
achieving decidability  it considers the basic description logic alc and imposes the constraint that only concept dl atoms are allowed to appear in the body of the rules  whereas
the heads of the rules are always non dl atoms  additionally  each variable appearing in
a concept dl atom in the body of a rule has also to appear in a non dl atom in the body
or head of the rule  carin  levy   rousset        provides a framework for studying the
effects of combining the description logic alcn r with  safe  datalog rules  in carin 
both concept and role dl atoms are allowed in the body of the rules  it is shown that the
integration is decidable if rules are non recursive  or certain combinations of constructors
are not allowed in the dl component  or rules are role safe  imposing a constraint on the
variables of role dl atoms in the body of the rules      motik et al         show that the
integration of a shiq d  knowledge base l with a disjunctive datalog program p is decidable  if p is dl safe  that is  all variables in a rule occur in at least one non dl atom in the
body of the rule  in this work  in contrast to al log and carin  no tableaux algorithm
is employed for query answering but l is translated to a disjunctive logic program dd l 
which is combined with p for answering ground queries 
in this category of works  entailment on the dl  that has been extended with rules  is
based on first order logic  this means that both the dl component and the logic program
are viewed as a set of first order logic statements  thus  negation as failure  closed worldassumptions  and non monotonic reasoning cannot be supported  in contrast  our work
supports both weak and strong negation  and allows closed world and open world reasoning
on a selective basis 
a different kind of integration is achieved by eiter et al       a   in this work  a
shoin  d  knowledge base l communicates with an extended logic program p  possibly
with weak and strong negation   only through dl query atoms in the body of the rules  in
particular  the description logic component l is used for answering the augmented  with
input from the logic program  queries appearing in the  possibly weakly negated  dl query
atoms  thus allowing flow of knowledge from p to l and vice versa  the answer set semantics of hl  p i are defined  as a generalization of the answer set semantics  gelfond
  lifschitz        on ordinary extended logic programs  a similar kind of integration is
achieved by eiter et al       b   in this work  a shoin  d  knowledge base l communicates with a normal logic program p  possibly with weak negation   through dl query
atoms in the body of the rules  the well founded semantics of hl  p i are defined  as a
    a rule is role safe if at least one of the variables x  y of each role dl atom r x  y  in the body of the
rule  appears in some body atom of a base predicate  where a base predicate is an ordinary predicate that
appears only in facts or in rule bodies 

  

fianalyti  antoniou  damasio    wagner

generalization of the well founded semantics  gelder et al         of ordinary normal logic
programs  obviously  in both of these works  derived information concerns only non dlatoms  that can be possibly used as input to dl query atoms   thus  rule based reasoning
is supported only for non dl atoms  in contrast  in our work  properties and classes appearing in the erdf graphs can freely appear in the heads and bodies of the rules  allowing
even the derivation of metalevel statements such as subclass and subproperty relationships 
property transitivity  property and class totalness 
rosati        defines the semantics of a disjunctive al log knowledge base  based on
the stable model semantics for disjunctive databases  gelfond   lifschitz         extending
al log  donini et al          a disjunctive al log knowledge base is the integration of an
alc knowledge base t with a  safe  disjunctive logic program p that allows concept and
role dl atoms in the body of the rules  along with weak negation on non dl atoms   the
safety condition enforces that each variable in the head of a rule should also appear in the
body of the rule  additionally  all constants in p should be dl individuals  similarly to
our case  in defining the disjunctive al log semantics  only the grounded versions of the
rules are considered  by instantiating variables with dl individuals   however rule based
reasoning is supported only for non dl atoms  and dl atoms in the body of the rules
mainly express constraints 
in a subsequent work  rosati        defines the r hybrid knowledge bases  in r hybrid
knowledge bases  dl atoms are allowed in the head of the rules and the dl component
t is a shoin  d  knowledge base  additionally  constants in p are not necessarily dlindividuals  however  a stronger safety condition is imposed  as each rule variable should
appear in a  positive  non dl atom in the body of the rule  additionally  weak negation is
allowed only for non dl atoms and rule based meta reasoning is not supported  in general 
we can say that for non dl atoms  a closed world assumption is made  while dl atoms
conform to the open world assumption  as shoin  d  is a fragment of first order logic 

    conclusions
in this paper  we have extended rdf graphs to erdf graphs by allowing negative triples
for representing explicit negative information  then  we proceeded by defining an erdf
ontology as an erdf graph complemented by a set of derivation rules with all connectives
  weak negation     strong negation     material implication          in the body
of a rule  and with strong negation  in the head of a rule  moreover  we have extended
the rdf s  vocabulary by adding the predefined vocabulary elements erdf  totalproperty
and erdf  totalclass  for representing the metaclasses of total properties and total classes 
on which the open world assumption applies 
we have defined erdf formulas  erdf interpretations  and erdf entailment on
erdf formulas  showing that it conservatively extends rdfs entailment on rdf graphs 
we have developed the model theoretic semantics of erdf ontologies  called erdf stable
model semantics  showing that stable model entailment extends erdf entailment on erdf
graphs  and thus it also extends rdfs entailment on rdf graphs  the erdf stable model
semantics is based on partial logic and  in particular  on its generalized definition of stable
models  herre   wagner        herre et al          which extends answer set semantics
on extended logic programs   we have shown that classical  boolean  herbrand model
  

fiextended rdf as a semantic foundation of rule markup languages

reasoning is a special case of our semantics  when all properties are total  in this case 
similarly to classical logic  an open world assumption is made for all properties and classes
and the two negations  weak and strong negation  collapse  allowing  a  the totality of
properties and classes to be declared on a selective basis and  b  the explicit representation
of closed world assumptions  as derivation rules  enables the combination of open world
and closed world reasoning in the same framework 
in particular  for a total property p  the open world assumption applies  since each
considered herbrand interpretation i  in the computation of erdf stable models  satisfies
p x  y p x  y   for each pair  x  y  of ontology vocabulary terms  for a closed property p 
a default closure rule of the form p  x   y   p  x   y  is added  which allows to infer
the falsity of p x  y   if there is no evidence that p x  y  holds  however  this method only
works for partial properties  for a total property p  it may happen that there is a stable
model  where p x  y  holds  even though there is no evidence for it  see the example in
section    above proposition       in fact  if p is a total property  the existence or not of
the corresponding default closure rule does not affect the ontology semantics 
the main advantages of erdf are summarized as follows 
 it has a tarski style model theory  which is a desirable feature for logic languages for
the semantic web  bry   marchiori        
 it is based on partial logic  herre et al          which is the simplest conservative
extension of classical logic that supports both weak and strong negation  partial
logic also extends answer set programming  asp     gelfond   lifschitz         by
allowing all logical factors              in the body of a rule 
 it enables the combination of open world  monotonic  and closed world  non monotonic 
reasoning  in the same framework 
 it extends rdfs ontologies with derivation rules and integrity constraints 
satisfiability and entailment under the erdf stable model semantics are in general undecidable  in a subsequent paper  we plan to identify syntactic restrictions for the erdf
ontologies that guarantee decidability of reasoning and to elaborate on the erdf computability and complexity issues 
in this work  we consider only coherent erdf interpretations  however  due to the
semantic webs decentralized and distributed nature  contradictory information is frequent
 schaffert  bry  besnard  decker  decker  enguix    herzig         though partial logic
allows for truth value clashes  handling inconsistency in the semantic web is a topic that
deserves extended treatment  which is outside the scope of this paper  it is in our future
plans to consider general erdf interpretations and extend the vocabulary of erdf with
the terms erdf  coherentproperty and erdf  coherentclass  whose instances are properties
and classes that satisfy coherence  thus  coherence will be decided on a per property and
    asp is a well known and accepted knowledge representation formalism that allows  through credulous
reasoning  the definition of concepts ranging over a space of choices  this feature enables the compact
representation of search and optimization problems  eiter  ianni  polleres    schindlauer        

  

fianalyti  antoniou  damasio    wagner

per class basis  admitting incoherent models will only be interesting in combination with
a second preference criterion of minimal incoherence  herre et al         
our future work also concerns the support of datatypes  including xsd datatypes  and
the extension of the predefined erdf vocabulary by adding other useful constructs  possibly
in accordance with the extensions of ter horst      b   we also plan to formally define the
erdf xml syntax  briefly presented in section    moreover  we plan to implement an
erdf inference engine 
finally  we would like to mention that the success of the semantic web is impossible without support for modularity  encapsulation  information hiding  and access control 
modularity mechanisms and syntactic restrictions for merging knowledge bases in the semantic web are explored by damasio et al          however  in this work  knowledge bases
are expressed by extended logic programs  our future plans include the extension of erdf
with mechanisms allowing sharing of knowledge between different erdf ontologies  along
the lines proposed by damasio et al

appendix b  proofs
in this appendix  we prove the lemmas and propositions presented in the main paper  in
addition  we provide lemma b    which is used in some of the proofs  to reduce the size of
the proofs  we have eliminated the namespace from the uris in vrdf  vrdf s  verdf  
lemma b   let f be an erdf formula and let i be a partial interpretation of a
vocabulary v   let u  u be mappings u  u   var  f    resi such that u x    u  x  
x  fvar  f    it holds  i  u    f iff i  u    f  
proof  we prove the proposition by induction  without loss of generality  we assume that
 appears only in front of positive erdf triples  otherwise we apply the transformation
rules of definition      to get an equivalent formula that satisfies the assumption 
let f   p s  o   it holds  i  u    f iff p  v   s  o  v  var   i p   p ropi   and
h i   u  s    i   u  o i  pt i  i p   iff p  v   s  o  v  var   i p   p ropi   and h i  
u   s    i   u   o i  pt i  i p   iff i  u    p s  o  
let f   p s  o   it holds  i  u    f iff p  v   s  o  v  var   i p   p ropi  
and h i   u  s    i   u  o i  pf i  i p   iff p  v   s  o  v  var   i p   p ropi   and
h i   u   s    i   u   o i  pf i  i p   iff i  u    p s  o  
assumption  assume that the lemma holds for the subformulas of f  
we will show that the lemma holds also for f  
let f   g  it holds  i  u    f iff i  u    g iff vg  v and i  u     g iff vg  v and

i  u    f  and i  u    f  iff i  u    f  f  iff i  u    f  
let f   x g  we will show that  i  if i  u    f then i  u    f and  ii  if i  u    f
then i  u    f  
 i  let i  u    f   then  i  u    xg  thus  there exists a mapping u    var  g   resi
s t  u   y    u y   y  var  g    x   and i  u     g  let u  be the mapping u   
var  g   resi s t  u   y    u  y   y  var  g    x   and u   x    u   x   since u z   
u  z   z  fvar  f   and x  fvar  g   it follows that u   z    u   z   z  fvar  g  
thus  i  u     g  therefore  there exists a mapping u    var  g   resi s t  u   y    u  y  
y  var  g    x   and i  u     g  thus  i  u    x g  which implies that i  u    f  
 ii  we prove this statement similarly to  i  by exchanging u and u  
let f   f  f  or f   f   f  or f   xg  we can prove  similarly to the above
cases  that i  u    f iff i  u    f   
lemma      let g be an erdf graph and let i be a partial interpretation of a vocabulary
v   it holds  i   graph g iff i    formula g  
proof  let g    t         tn   and f   formula g  
  assume that i   graph g  we will show that i    f   since i   graph g  it follows that
v   var  g   resi such that i  v    ti   i           n  thus  v   var  g   resi such
that i  v    t     tn   this implies that u   var  g   resi such that i  u    f   since
fvar  f       it follows from lemma b   that u   var  g   resi   it holds that i  u    f  
thus  i    f  
  assume that i    f   we will show that i   graph g  since i    f   it follows that
v   var  g   resi it holds that i  v    f   thus  v   var  g   resi such that
i  v    f   this implies that u   var  g   resi such that i  u    t     tn   thus 
u   var  g   resi such that i  u    ti   i           n  therefore  i   graph g  
proposition      let i be an erdf interpretation of a vocabulary v and let v   
v  vrdf  vrdf s  verdf   then 
   for all p  s  o  v  such that i p   tprop i   it holds 
i    p s  o  iff i    p s  o   equivalently  i    p s  o   p s  o   
   for all x  c  v  such that i c   tcls i   it holds 
i    rdf  type x  c  iff i    rdf  type x  c 
 equivalently  i    rdf  type x  c   rdf  type x  c   
proof 
   it holds  i    p s  o  iff i     p s  o  iff hi s   i o i   pt i  p  iff  since p  tprop i  
hi s   i o i  pf i  p  iff i    p s  o   therefore  i    p s  o  iff i    p s  o  
we will also show that i    p s  o   p s  o   it holds i    p s  o  or i    p s  o   this
implies that i    p s  o  or i    p s  o   and thus  i    p s  o   p s  o  
   the proof is similar to the proof of    after replacing p s  o  by type x  c  and tprop i by
tcls i

proof 
  let g   erdf g   we will show that g   rdf s g   in particular  let i be an rdfs
interpretation of a vocabulary v s t  i    g  we will show that i    g  
since i    g  it holds that v   var  g   resi s t  i  v    g  our goal is to construct
an erdf interpretation j of v s t  j    g  we consider an     mapping res   verdf  r 
where r is a set disjoint from resi   additionally  let v    v  vrdf  vrdf s  verdf  
based on i and the mapping res  we construct a partial interpretation j of v as follows 
 resj   resi  res verdf   
 jv  x    iv  x   x   v   verdf    uri and jv  x    res x   x  verdf  
 we define the mapping  ilj   v   t l  resj such that  ilj  x    ili  x  
 we define the mapping  j   v   resj such that 
 j x    jv  x   x  v   uri 
 j x    x   x  v   pl 
 j x    ilj  x    x  v   t l 
 we define the mapping pt j   resj  p resj  resj   as follows 
 pt   if x  y  z  resi and hx  yi  pt i  z  then hx  yi  pt j  z  
 pt   hres totalclass   j class i  pt j  j subclassof    
 pt   hres totalproperty   j property i  pt j  j subclassof    
starting from the derivations of  pt     pt    and  pt    the following rules are
applied recursively  until a fixpoint is reached

 pt    if hx  j property i  pt j  j type   then hx  xi  pt j  j subpropertyof    
 pt    if hx  yi  pt j  j subpropertyof    and hy  zi  pt j  j subpropertyof   
then hx  zi  pt j  j subpropertyof    
 pt    if hx  j datatype i  pt j  j type   then

after reaching fixpoint  nothing else is contained in pt j  x   x  resj  
 p ropj    x  resj   hx  j property    pt j  j type    
 the mapping pt j   p ropj  p resj  resj   is defined as follows 
pt j  x    pt j  x   x  p ropj  
 lv j    x  resj   hx  j literal i  pt j  j type    
 the mapping pf j   p ropj  p resj  resj   is defined as follows

before we continue  we prove the following lemma 
lemma  for all x  y  x  resj   hx  yi  pt j  z  iff hx  yi  pt j  z  
proof  
  if hx  yi  pt j  z   then from the definition of pt j   it follows immediately that
hx  yi  pt j  z  
  let hx  yi  pt j  z   then  from the definition of pt j   it follows that it holds  i 
z  p ropi or  ii  w  resj   s t  hw  zi  pt j  j subpropertyof    
 i  assume that z  p ropi   then  hz  i property i  pt i  i type    this implies that
hz  j property i  pt i  j type    from  pt    it now follows that hz  j v i  pt j  j type   
therefore  z  p ropj   from the definition of pt j   it now follows that hx  yi  pt j  z

 ii  assume that w  resj s t  hw  zi  pt j  j subpropertyof     then  from  pt    
it follows that hz  j property i  pt j  j type    therefore  z  p ropj   from the definition
of pt j   it now follows that hx  yi  pt j  z  
end of lemma
though not mentioned explicitly  the above lemma is used throughout the rest of the
proof 
to show that j is a partial interpretation of v    it is enough to show that v  pl  lv j  
let x  v   pl  then  x  lv i   thus  hx  i literal i  pt i  i type    due to  pt   
this implies that hx  j literal i  pt j  j type    thus  x  lv j  
now  we extend j with the ontological categories 
clsj    x  resj   hx  j class i  pt j  j type    
tcls j    x  resj   hx  j totalclass i  pt j  j type     and
tprop j    x  resj   hx  j totalproperty i  pt j  j type    
we define ct j   cf j   clsj  p resj   as follows 
x  ct j  y  iff hx  yi  pt j  j type    and
x  cf j  y  iff hx  yi  pf j  j type   
we will now show that j is an erdf interpretation of v   specifically  we will show that
j satisfies the semantic conditions of definition      erdf interpretation  and definition
     coherent erdf interpretation  
first  we will show that j satisfies semantic condition   of definition      we will start
by proving that resj   ct j  j resource    obviously 
ct j  j resource    resj   thus  it is enough to prove that resj  ct j  j resource   
let x  resj   then  we distinguish the following cases 
case    x  resi   since i is an rdfs interpretation  it holds that hx  i resource i 
pt i  i type    thus  it holds hx  j resource i  pt j  j type    which implies that x 
ct j  j resource   
case    x  res verdf    from the definition of pt j   it follows that
hx  j resource i  pt j  j type    thus  hx  j resource i  pt j  j type    which implies
that x  ct j  j resource   
thus  resj   ct j  j resource   
additionally  it is easy to see that it holds p ropj   ct j  j property    clsj  
ct j  j class    lv j   ct j  j literal    tcls j   ct j  j totalclass    and
tprop j   ct j  j totalproperty   
we will now show that j satisfies semantic condition   of definition      let hx  yi 
pt j  j domain   and hz  wi  pt j  x   then  from  pt   and the definition of ct j   it
follows that z  ct j  y  
we will now show that j satisfies semantic condition   of definition      let hx  yi 
pt j  j range   and hz  wi  pt j  x   then  from  pt   and the definition of ct j   it
follows that w  ct j  y  
we will now show that j satisfies semantic condition   of definition      let x 
clsj   thus  it holds  hx  j class i  pt j  j type    from  pt    it now follows that
hx  j resource i  pt j  j subclassof    
  

fianalyti  antoniou  damasio    wagner

we will now show that j satisfies semantic condition   of definition      let hx  yi 
pt j  j subclassof     then  from  pt     pt    and the definition of ct j   it follows that
x  y  clsj  
let hx  yi  pt j  j subclassof     we will show that ct j  x   ct j  y   in particular 
let z  ct j  x   then  from  pt   and the definition of ct j   it follows that z  ct j  y  
let hx  yi  pt j  j subclassof     we will show that cf j  y   cf j  x   in particular 
let z  cf j  y   then  from  pf   and the definition of cf j   it follows that z  cf j  x  
in a similar manner  we can prove that j also satisfies the semantic conditions         
    and    of definition     
to continue the rest of the proof  we need to make a few observations 
consider the mapping h   resj  resi   which is defined as follows 

if x  resi
 x
i class 
if x   res totalclass 
h x   

i property  if x   res totalproperty 

observation    if hx  yi  pt j  z  and y  res verdf   then x   y 
observation    if x  res verdf   and x  p ropj then pt j  x     
observation    if hx  yi  pt j  z  then hh x   h y i  pt i  h z   
observation    if x  y  z  resi and hx  yi  pt j  z  then hx  yi  pt i  z     
the proof of these observations is made by induction  it is easy to see that all observations
hold for the derivations of  pt     pt    and  pt    assume now that the observations
hold for the derivations obtained at a step k of the application of the fixpoint operator for
pt j   then  the observations also hold for the derivations obtained at step k     
we will now show that j satisfies semantic condition    of definition      let x 
tcls j   thus  hx  j totalclass i  pt j  j type    from observation    it follows that x  
j totalclass   from  pf    it now follows that ct j  j totalclass  cf j  j totalclass    
resj   thus  ct j  x   cf j  x    resj  
we will now show that j satisfies semantic condition    of definition      let x 
tprop j   thus  hx  j totalproperty i  pt j  j type    from observation    it follows
that x   j totalproperty   from  pf    it now follows that pt j  j totalproperty   
pf j  j totalproperty     resj  resj   thus  pt j  x   pf j  x    resj  resj  
we will now show that j satisfies semantic condition    of definition     
let srdf  xmlliteral be a well typed xml literal in v then ilj  srdf  xmlliteral  
  ili  srdf  xmlliteral   is the xml value of s  additionally  since i is an rdfs
interpretation of v   it holds  hili  srdf  xmlliteral    i xmlliteral  i  pt i  i type   
therefore  from  pt    it follows that hilj  srdf  xmlliteral    j xmlliteral  i 
pt j  j type   
we will now show that j satisfies semantic condition    of definition      let
srdf  xmlliteral  v s t  s is not a well typed xml literal string  assume now
that ilj  srdf  xmlliteral    lv j   then  hilj  srdf  xmlliteral    j literal i 
pt j  j type    from observation    it follows that hilj  srdf  xmlliteral    j literal i
 pt i  j type    therefore  it follows that hili  srdf  xmlliteral    i literal i 
    note that observation   implies observation   

  

fiextended rdf as a semantic foundation of rule markup languages

pt i  i type    thus  ili  srdf  xmlliteral    lv i   which is impossible since i is an
rdfs interpretation of v   therefore  ilj  srdf  xmlliteral    resj  lv j  
additionally  from  pf    it follows that hilj  srdf  xmlliteral    j literal i 
pf j  j type   
j also satisfies semantic condition    of definition      due to  pt    finally  j satisfies
semantic condition     due to  pt   and  pt   
thus  j is an erdf interpretation of v  
now  we will show that j is a coherent erdf interpretation  definition       assume
that this is not the case  thus  there is z  p ropj s t  pt j  z   pf j  z       assume that
hx  yi  pt j  z   pf j  z   for such a z  we distinguish the following cases 
case    z  res verdf    then  from observation    it follows that pt j  z      which
is a contradiction 
case    y  res verdf   and z  resi   then  it holds 
 i  hz  res totalproperty i  pt j  j subpropertyof     or
 ii  hz  j type i  pt j  j subpropertyof    and hx  yi  pf j  j type   
now  from observation   and since z  resi    i  is impossible  thus  hz  j type i 
pt j  j subpropertyof    and hx  yi  pf j  j type    this implies that
y   res totalclass   from observation    it follows that x   res totalclass   which is
impossible since  due to  pf    hres totalclass   res totalclass i   pf j  j type   
case    x  res verdf   and y  z  resi   then  it holds 
 i  hz  res totalproperty i  pt j  j subpropertyof     or
 ii  hz  j type i  pt j  j subpropertyof    and hx  yi  pf j  j type   
now  from observation   and since z  resi    i  is impossible  thus  hz  j type i 
pt j  j subpropertyof    and hx  yi  pf j  j type    this implies that
y   res totalclass   which is impossible  since y  resi  
case    x  y  z  resi   then  x   ilj  s   where s is an ill typed xml literal in
v   hz  j type i  pt j  j subpropertyof    and hy  j literal i  pt j  j subclassof    
since hx  yi  pt j  z   it follows that hx  yi  pt j  j type    since hy  j literal i 
pt j  j subclassof     it follows that hx  j literal i  pt j  j type    from observation   
it follows that hilj  s   j literal i  pt i  j type    therefore 
hili  s   i literal i  pt i  i type    but this implies that ili  s   lv i   which is impossible since i is an rdfs interpretation of v  
since all cases lead to contradiction  it follows that

let o   hg  i  based on i  we construct a partial interpretation j of vo as follows 
 resj   resh
o 
 jv  x    x  for all x  vo  uri 
 we define the mapping  ilj   vo  t l  resj such that 
ilj  x    x  if x is a typed literal in vo other than a well typed xml literal  and
ili  x  is the xml value of x  if x is a well typed xml literal in vo  
 we define the mapping  j   vo  resj such that

 j x    x   x  vo  pl 
 j x    ilj  x    x  vo  t l 
 p ropj    x  resj   x  vo   j x     x and i x    p ropi   
 the mapping pt j   p ropj  p resj  resj   is defined as follows 
x  y  z  vo   it holds 
hj x   j y i  pt j  j z   iff hi x   i y i  pt i  i z   
 we define the mapping pf j   p ropj  p resj  resj   as follows 
x  y  z  vo   it holds

to show that j is a partial interpretation  it is enough to show that vo  pl  lv j  
let x  vo  pl  then  x  lv i   thus  hx  i literal i  pt i  i type    this implies that
hx  j literal i  pt j  j type    thus  x  lv j  
now  we extend j with the ontological categories 
clsj    x  resj   hx  j class i  pt j  j type    
tcls j    x  resj   hx  j totalclass i  pt j  j type     and
tprop j    x  resj   hx  j totalproperty i  pt j  j type    
we define the mappings ct j   cf j   clsj  p resj   as follows 
x  ct j  y  iff hx  yi  pt j  j type    and
x  cf j  y  iff hx  yi  pf j  j type   
we will now show that j is an erdf interpretation of vo   first  we will show that
j satisfies semantic condition   of definition      erdf interpretation   in a number of
steps 
step    here  we prove that resj   ct j  j resource    obviously  ct j  j resource  
 resj   we will show that resj  ct j  j resource    let x  resj   then  there is
x  vo such that j x     x  we want to show that hj x    j resource i  pt j  j type   
it holds  hj x    j resource i  pt j  j type   iff hi x    i resource i  pt i  i type   
which is true  since i is an erdf interpretation that satisfies sk g  and i x    resi  
thus  x   j x    ct j  j resourceresource   
therefore  resj   ct j  j resource   
step    here  we prove that p ropj   ct j  j property    we will show that p ropj 
ct j  j property    let x  p ropj   then  there is x  vo such that j x     x and
i x    p ropi   we want to show that hj x    j property i  pt j  j type    it holds 
hj x    j property i  pt j  j type   iff hi x    i property i  pt i  i type   
which is true  since i x    p ropi   thus  x   j x    ct j  j property   
therefore  p ropj  ct j  j property   
we will now show that ct j  j property    p ropj   let x  ct j  j property    then 
x  vo such that j x     x  it holds hj x    j property i  pt j  j type    which implies
that hi x    i property i  pt i  i type    thus  i x    p ropi and x  p ropj  
therefore  ct j  j property    p ropj  
step    by definition  it holds clsj   ct j  j class    lv j   ct j  j literal    tcls j  
ct j  j totalclass   and tprop j   ct j  j totalproperty   
we will now show that j satisfies semantic condition   of definition      erdf interpretation   let hx  yi  pt j  j domain   and hz  wi  pt j  x   we will show
that z  ct j  y   there are x   y   vo such that j x     x  j y      y  thus 
hj x    j y   i  pt j  j domain    additionally  there are z    w  vo such that j z     
z  j w     w  thus  hj z     j w  i  pt j  j x     then  hi x    i y   i  pt i  i domain  
and hi z     i w  i  pt i  i x     since i is an erdf interpretation  hi z     i y   i 
pt i  i type    thus  hj z     j y   i  pt j  j type   and z  ct j  y  
in a similar manner  we can prove that j also satisfies the rest of the semantic conditions
of definition      thus  j is an erdf interpretation of vo  
moreover  we will show that j is a coherent erdf interpretation  definition      
assume that this is not the case  thus  there is z  p ropj s t  pt j  z   pf j  z      
thus  there are x  y  resj s t  hx  yi  pt j  z   pf j  z   for such a z  then  there are

x   y    z   vo s t  j x     x  j y      y  and j z      z  it holds  hj x    j y   i  pt j  j z    
and hj x    j y   i  pf j  j z      thus  hi x    i y   i  pt i  i z     and hi x    i y   i 
pf i  i z      but this is impossible  since i is a  coherent  erdf interpretation  therefore 
j is also a coherent erdf interpretation 
thus  j  i h  o  
we will now show that j    sk g   let p s  o   sk g   it holds p  s  o  vo   since
i    sk g   it holds i p   p ropi   thus  hi p   i property i  pt i  i type    which implies
that hj p   j property i  pt j  j type    from this  it follows that j p   p ropj   it
holds  hj s   j o i  pt j  j p   iff hi s   i o i  pt i  i p    the last statement is true
since i    sk g   let u       resh
o   then  j  u    p s  o   let p s  o   sk g   we can
show that j  u    p s  o   in a similar manner  thus  j    sk g  
now  from definition      stable model  and the fact that j    sk g   it follows that
k  mst  o  s t  k  j  from this and the fact that o   st f   it follows that k    f  
since f is an erdf d formula  it holds that
f     x          xk  f            x          xkn fn   
where fi   t        tmi and tj   for j           mi   is an erdf triple  thus  there is an
i           n  and u   var  fi    resh
o s t  k  u    fi  
we will show that j  u    fi  
let p s  o    t         tmi    since k is an erdf interpretation of vo   k  u    fi   and
p ropk  p ropj   it follows that p  vo   s  o  vo  var   and j p    k p   p ropk 
p ropj   additionally  h k  u  s    k  u  o i  pt k  p   since h j  u  s    j  u  o i   h k  
u  s    k   u  o i and pt k  p   pt j  p   it follows that h j   u  s    j   u  o i  pt j  p  
thus  j  u    p s  o  
let p s  o    t         tmi    since k is an erdf interpretation of vo   k  u    fi   and
p ropk  p ropj   it follows that p  vo   s  o  vo  var   and j p    k p   p ropk 
p ropj   additionally  h k  u  s    k  u  o i  pf k  p   since h j  u  s    j  u  o i   h k  
u  s    k   u  o i and pf k  p   pf j  p   it follows that h j   u  s    j   u  o i  pf j  p  
thus  j  u    p s  o  
we now define a total function u   vfi  var  fi    vo   as follows 

u x  if x  var  fi   and




u x  is not the xml value of a well typed xml literal in vo

t
if x  var  fi   and
u  x   


u x  is the xml value of a well typed xml literal t in vo



x
otherwise

moreover  we define a total function u   var  fi    resi s t  u  x    i u  x   
we will show that i  u    fi  
let p s  o    t         tmi    then  p  vfi and s  o  vfi  var   since j  u    fi   it follows
that vfi  vo   therefore  vfi  vsk g   vrdf  vrdf s  verdf  v    thus  p  v  and
s  o  v   var  
we will now show that i p   p ropi   it holds 
hi p   i property i  pt i  i type   iff
hj p   j property i  pt j  j type    which holds since j  u    fi  
  

fianalyti  antoniou  damasio    wagner

we want to show that h i  v    s    i  v    o i  pt i  i p    note that x  vfi   it holds 
 i   u   x    i u  x     i x  and j u  x      j   u  x    j x   moreover  x  var  fi   
it holds   i   u   x    i u  x   and j u  x      j   u  x   recall the definition of j     
therefore  it holds 
h i   u   s    i   u   o i  pt i  i p   iff
hi u  s    i u  o  i  pt i  i p   iff
hj u  s    j u  o  i  pt j  j p   iff
h j   u  s    j   u  o i  pt j  j p    which is true since j  u    fi   thus  i  u    p s  o  
let p s  o    t         tmi    we can show that i  u    p s  o   in a similar manner 
thus  i  u    fi   which implies that i  u      x          xki fi   thus  i  u    f   now  it
follows from lemma b   that i    f  
thus  sk g    erdf f   now  it follows from proposition     that g   erdf f  
   let g   erdf f   it follows from proposition     that sk g    erdf f   we will show
that hg  i   st f   in particular  let o   hg  i and let i  mst  o   note that i is an
erdf interpretation of vo   such that i    sk g   since sk g    erdf f   it follows that
i    f   
proposition     let d be an instance of the unbounded tiling problem  it holds 
   d has a solution iff od   false  fd   has a stable model 
   d has a solution iff od    st fd  
proof 
   this statement follows easily from statement    
     let  be a solution to d  since in  in is denumerable  there exists a bijective
function    in  in  in   consider now a herbrand interpretation i of od such that 
   cti  tile    cti  hasright    cti  hasabove     rdf   i   i  in   and
cfi  t ile    cfi  hasright    cfi  hasabove     
   p ti  id      hx  xi   x  vo   and p fi  id      
   p ti  hconstraint    h and p fi  hconstraint     
   p ti  vconstraint    v and p fi  vconstraint     
   p ti  type     hrdf    i  j     i  j i   i  j  in   and p fi  type     
   p ti  right     hrdf    i  j   rdf    i      j i   i  j  in   and
p fi  right     hrdf   i  rdf   ji   i  j  in and hrdf   i  rdf   ji   p ti  right   
   p ti  above     hrdf    i  j   rdf    i  j     i   i  j  in   and
p fi  above     hrdf   i  rdf   ji   i  j  in and hrdf   i  rdf   ji   p ti  above   

it is easy to see that i is a stable model of od and i     fd   thus  od    st fd  
  let d   ht   h  v i  where t    t         tn    assume that od    st fd and let i be a
stable model of od   hg  p i such that i     fd   obviously  cti  tile     rdf   i   i  in   
due to rule sets         of p and since od    st fd   it holds that starting from tile rdf    
  

fiextended rdf as a semantic foundation of rule markup languages

and placing tiles according to p ti  right  and p ti  above  relations  a grid is formed  we
define  i  j    k  for i  j  k  in   iff the tile rdf   k has been placed on the hi  ji position
of the previous grid  note that  is a total function  due to rule set     of p   each tile is
assigned a unique type in t    t         tn    due to rule set     of p   this type assignment
satisfies the horizontal and vertical adjacency constraints of d  thus  a solution of d is
   in  in  t   where   i  j    t iff hrdf    i  j   t i  p ti  t ype   since  is a total
function and  for all k  in   tile rdf   k is assigned a unique type in t   it follows that  is a
total function
