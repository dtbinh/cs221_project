abstract
we derive optimal strategies for a bidding agent that participates in multiple  simultaneous
second price auctions with perfect substitutes  we prove that  if everyone else bids locally
in a single auction  the global bidder should always place non zero bids in all available
auctions  provided there are no budget constraints  with a budget  however  the optimal
strategy is to bid locally if this budget is equal or less than the valuation  furthermore  for
a wide range of valuation distributions  we prove that the problem of finding the optimal
bids reduces to two dimensions if all auctions are identical  finally  we address markets
with both sequential and simultaneous auctions  non identical auctions  and the allocative
efficiency of the market 

   introduction
in recent years  there has been a surge in the application of auctions  both online and
within multi agent systems  wellman  greenwald    stone        clearwater        gerding  rogers  dash    jennings      b  rogers  david    jennings        rosenthal   wang 
      roth   ockenfels        dash  parkes    jennings         as a result  there are an
increasing number of auctions offering very similar or even identical goods and services   to
take advantage of this fact  automated support needs to be developed that can monitor  bid
in  and make decisions across this large set of possibilities  such software  in the form of
intelligent bidding agents  hereafter shortened to bidder   can increase the likelihood of winning an item and at a lower price  and thus result in a considerable advantage for a buyer 
now  whereas participating in many auctions is an arduous task when done manually  such
a problem is ideally suited for autonomous agents who can execute the proper actions on
a buyers behalf  stone  schapire  littman  csirik    mcallester         to this end  in
this paper we devise and analyse optimal bidding strategies for one such auction setting
 namely  a bidder that participates in multiple  simultaneous second price auctions for
goods that are perfect substitutes  as we will show  however  this analysis also applies to a
wider context with markets consisting of both sequential  i e   where the auctions close one
   in ebay alone  for example  there are often hundreds or sometimes even thousands of concurrent auctions
running worldwide selling such substitutable items  to illustrate  at the time of writing  over      ebay
auctions were selling the apple iphone worldwide

after the other   as well as simultaneous  i e   where the auctions close at the same time 
auctions 
to date  much of the existing literature on multiple auctions focuses either on sequential
auctions  krishna        or on simultaneous auctions with complementarities  where the
value of items together is greater than the sum of the individual items  see section   for
related research on simultaneous auctions   in contrast  here we consider bidding strategies
for the case of simultaneous auctions and perfect substitutes  in particular  our focus is
on vickrey or second price sealed bid auctions  we choose these because they have a low
communication overhead  in terms of the number of required interactions  and are well
known for their capacity to induce truthful bidding  as a result  this type of auction
and its generalisations  such as the vickrey clarke groves mechanism  have been used in a
number of multi agent system settings  dash  rogers  reece  roberts    jennings       
varian        mes  van der heijden    van harten        dash  vytelingum  rogers  david 
  jennings         moreover  these auctions are  weakly  strategically equivalent to the
widely used english auctions   however  we find that  when there are multiple such auctions
running simultaneously  truthful bidding is no longer optimal  given this  we characterise 
for the first time  a bidding agents utility maximising strategy for bidding in any number
of such auctions and for any type of bidder valuation distribution 
in more detail  we consider a market where a single bidder  called the global bidder 
can bid in any number of auctions  whereas the other bidders  called the local bidders  are
assumed to bid in only a single auction  we distinguish between two types of settings for
this market  one in which the auctions are identical and the global bidder is indifferent
between the auctions  and one in which the global bidder prefers some auctions over others 
for these settings our main results are as follows 
 whereas in the case of a single second price auction a bidder has a weakly dominant
strategy to bid its true value  this is no longer the case when there are several simultaneous
auctions  the best strategy for a global bidder is then to bid below its true value 
 we prove that  even if a global bidder requires only one item and assuming free disposal 
the expected utility is maximised by participating  i e   bidding a non zero amount  in
all the auctions that are selling the desired item 
 finding the optimal bid for each auction can be an arduous task when considering all
possible combinations  however  when the global bidder is indifferent between the auctions  we are able to significantly reduce the search space for common bidder valuation
distributions  as a result  optimal bids can be efficiently calculated for any number of
auctions  although the setting where the global bidder has preferences over auctions is
more involved  we can still apply analytical methods to obtain tractable optimal results 
 we prove that  if the auctions are identical  the bidders expected utility is maximised
by bidding either uniformly across all auctions  or relatively high in one of the auctions 
and the same  low value in all others  which of these two behaviours is optimal depends
on the bidder valuation and market conditions such as the number of other bidders   if
   more specifically  vickrey and english auction are strategically equivalent assuming private valuations
of the good  i e   where a bidders value for the item remains unchanged during the bidding process 

   

fioptimal strategies for simultaneous vickrey auctions with perfect substitutes

this is not the case and a global bidder has different preferences over the auctions  we
show that it is optimal to bid relatively higher in auctions which are preferred over other
auctions 
 we argue that  even though a global bidder has a significantly higher expected utility than
a local one  not all bidders should necessarily bid globally  for example  if bidders have
budget considerations which constrain the amount they can bid  we show analytically
that  if the budget is equal or less than the valuation  it is optimal to bid in a single
auction under certain conditions 
finally  we consider the issue of market efficiency when there are such simultaneous
auctions  efficiency is an important system wide consideration within the area of multiagent systems since it characterises how well the allocations in the system maximise the
overall utility  dash et al          now  efficiency is maximised when the goods are allocated
to those who value them the most  however  a certain amount of inefficiency is inherent
to a distributed market where the auctions are held separately  given this  in this paper 
we measure the efficiency of markets with local bidders only and consider the impact of
global bidders on this inefficiency  in so doing  we find that the presence of a global bidder
generally has a positive impact on the efficiency 
the remainder of the paper is structured as follows  we first discuss related work in
section    in section   we describe the bidders and the auctions in more detail  in section  
we characterise the optimal bidding behaviour for the base setting where all auctions are
identical  and in section   we explore a number of extensions  non identical auctions  budget
constraints and sequential auctions  in section   we address the market efficiency and the
impact of a global bidder  finally  section   concludes  most of the proofs are placed in
the appendix 

   related work
research in the area of simultaneous auctions can be segmented along two broad lines 
on the one hand  there is the game theoretic analysis of simultaneous auctions which concentrates on studying the equilibrium strategy of rational agents  engelbrecht wiggans  
weber        krishna   rosenthal        lang   rosenthal        rosenthal   wang 
      szentes   rosenthal         such analyses are typically used when the auction format employed in the simultaneous auctions is the same  e g   there are m vickrey auctions
or m first price auctions   on the other hand  heuristic strategies have been developed
for more complex settings when the sellers offer different types of auctions or the buyers
need to buy bundles of goods over distributed auctions  stone et al         byde  preist   
jennings        yuen  byde    jennings        greenwald  kirby  reiter    boyan       
greenwald   boyan        wellman  reeves  lochner    vorobeychik         this paper
adopts the former approach in studying a market of m simultaneous vickrey auctions since
this approach yields provably optimal bidding strategies 
related to our approach is the seminal paper by engelbrecht wiggans and weber        
which provides one of the starting points for the game theoretic analysis of distributed
markets where buyers have substitutable goods  their work analyses a market consisting
of couples having equal valuations that want to bid for a dresser  thus  the couples bid

space can at most contain two bids since the husband and wife can be at most at two
geographically distributed auctions simultaneously  they derive a mixed strategy nash
equilibrium for the special case where the number of buyers is large  our analysis differs
from theirs in that we use a decision theoretic approach as opposed to a game theoretic
one  as argued among others by rothkopf         and jiang and leyton brown         a
decision theoretic analysis is often sufficient in practice in the case of auctions   moreover 
the decision theoretic framework allows us to study a more complex setting in which bidders
have different valuations and the global bidder can bid in all the auctions simultaneously
 which is entirely possible for online auctions  
subsequently  krishna and rosenthal        studied the case of simultaneous auctions
with complementary goods  they analyse the case of both local and global bidders and
characterise the bidding of the buyers and resultant market efficiency  the setting provided
by krishna and rosenthal        is further extended to the case of common values by
rosenthal and wang         however  neither of these works extend easily to the case of
substitutable goods which we consider  this case is studied by szentes and rosenthal        
but the scenario considered is restricted to three sellers and two global bidders and with
each bidder having the same value  and thereby knowing the value of other bidders   the
space of symmetric mixed equilibrium strategies is derived for this special case  however 
as mentioned earlier  our results are based on decision theory  rather than game theory  but
our setting is more general  i e   we consider an arbitrary number of auctions   a number of
other authors study settings where bidders face multiple simultaneous sealed bid auctions 
e g  mcafee         peters and severinov         gerding et al       b   leyton brown 
shoham  and tennenholtz         all of these papers  however  assume that bidders bid in
only a single auction and choose this auction randomly  as we show here  however  this is
not optimal  finally  shehory        considers the case of concurrent english auctions  in
which bidding algorithms are developed for buyers with different risk attitudes  however 
in his setting the auctions never close at the same time  and he forces the bids to be the
same across auctions  although this strategy may be effective for the described setting  as
we show in this paper  this is not always optimal when auctions close simultaneously  and
the buyers bid very late in the auctions  
related to this paper is also the literature that considers bidding with budget constraints  although it is beyond the scope of this paper to provide a full literature review
on this topic  here we highlight the most relevant work  a more extensive recent overview
is presented by pitchik         a number of papers  such as those by rothkopf       
and palfrey         study optimal bidding in simultaneous first price auctions when bidders have constraints on exposure  which refers to the sum of bids  these papers  however 
make the very strong assumption that the value accrued in one auction is independent of
that in others  in other words  winning or losing one auction does not affect the expected
utility in other auctions  in contrast  here we consider complete substitutes where bidders
require only a single item  as a result  if one of the auctions is won  the value accrued
in other auctions is zero  this interdependency between auctions makes the analysis sig   essentially  a decision theoretic setup requires only     information about the distribution of the best
competitive bid  and     that the bidders optimize their decision given this assessment  rothkopf        
such information about the distribution can be obtained by observing previous bids  e g   using a learning
approach as described by jiang and leyton brown        

   

fioptimal strategies for simultaneous vickrey auctions with perfect substitutes

nificantly more difficult  krishna and benoit        also consider this interdependency 
but the valuations and budget constraints are assumed to be common knowledge  and the
problem would thus be trivial without any budget constraints   others  such as che and
gale         consider the effect of budget constraints in single auctions  where bidder types
consist of two dimensions  their valuation and the budget  sequential auctions have also
been extensively studied with regards to budget constraints  e g   by krishna and benoit
        pitchik         furthermore  in addition to constraints on exposure  other types
of budget constraints have been considered  in particular limits on the expected expenditures  engelbrecht wiggans         none of these papers  however  address the particular
setting that we consider here 
finally  a number of researchers have investigated online auctions such as ebay  on the
one hand  hendricks  onur  and wiseman         stryszowska         zeithammer        
peters and severinov         rogers  david  schiff  and jennings        have sought to
explain the bidding behaviour of buyers in online auctions  which include multiple bidding
 i e   successively increasing the amount placed as the maximum bid in the ebay proxy agent 
as opposed to bidding the true value  and sniping  i e   starting to bid near the end of the
auction   in fact  as a result of the sniping behaviour of the agents  the english auctions
run by ebay can be approximated as vickrey auctions since bidders no longer have as much
information about the status of bidding in the auction  all of these papers  however  focus
only on the sequential auction problem  and do not discuss the bidding strategies when
multiple auctions close simultaneously  on the other hand  boutilier  goldszmidt  and
sabata         gopal  thompson  tung  and whinston         juda and parkes       
have explored means to improve the efficiency of simultaneous auctions by either proposing
sequential auction mechanisms or the use of options   whereas these works are aimed at
changing or augmenting the auction mechanism to improve their outcome  in our case we
take the auctions as given and focus on the strategic aspects from a bidders perspective 

   bidding in multiple vickrey auctions
the model consists of m sellers  each of whom acts as an auctioneer  each seller auctions
one item  these items are complete substitutes  i e   they are equal in terms of value and a
bidder obtains no additional benefit from winning more than one of them   the m auctions
are executed simultaneously  that is  they end simultaneously and no information about the
outcome of any of the auctions becomes available until the bids are placed   however  in
section     we briefly investigate markets with both sequential and simultaneous auctions
since such markets are common in practice  especially online 
furthermore  we generally assume that all the auctions are identical  i e   a bidder is
indifferent between them   but we relax this assumption in section     where the auctions
   the notion is similar to financial options  in that these auction options provide the buyer the right 
but not the obligation  to buy a specific item at a specified price  the strike price  during a specified
period of time  however  the analysis of these options differs from the financial perspective due to very
different assumptions when modelling them 
   we note that  although this paper focuses on sealed bid auctions  where this is the case  the conditions
are similar for last minute bidding or sniping in iterative auctions such as ebay  roth   ockenfels 
       when some of the auctions close at almost the same time  due to network delays there may be
insufficient time to obtain the results of one auction before proceeding to bid in the next one

have different valuation distributions and or numbers of participating bidders and the global
bidder may thus prefer one auction over another  finally  we assume free disposal and
that bidders maximise their expected profit  these two assumptions  together with the
assumption about the complete substitutes are implicit throughout the paper 
    the auctions
the sellers auction is implemented as a second price sealed bid auction  where the highest
bidder wins but pays the second highest price  this format has several advantages for agentbased settings  firstly  it is communication efficient in terms of the number of interactions 
since it requires each bidder to place a single bid once  and the auctioneer to respond once to
each bidder with the outcome  in contrast  an iterative auction such as the english auction
usually requires several interactions and is typically more time consuming  secondly  for the
single auction case  i e   where a bidder places a bid in at most one auction   the optimal
strategy is to bid the true value and thus requires no computation  once the valuation of
the item is known   this strategy is also weakly dominant  i e   it is independent of the
other bidders decisions   and therefore it requires no information about the preferences of
other agents  such as the distribution of their valuations  
    global and local bidders
we distinguish between global and local bidders  the former can bid in any number of
auctions  whereas the latter bid in only a single one  local bidders are assumed to bid
according to the weakly dominant strategy and bid their true valuation   we consider two
ways of modelling local bidders  static and dynamic  in the first model  the number of local
bidders is assumed to be known and equal to n for each auction  in the latter model  on the
other hand  the average number of bidders is equal to n  but the exact number is unknown
and may vary for each auction  this uncertainty is modelled using a poisson distribution
 more details are provided in section      
as we will later show  a global bidder that bids optimally has a higher expected utility
compared to a local bidder  even though the items are complete substitutes and a bidder
requires only one of them  nevertheless  we can identify a number of compelling reasons
why not all bidders may choose to bid globally 
 participation costs  although the bidding itself may be automated by an autonomous
agent  it still takes time and or money  such as entry fees and time to setup an account 
to participate in a new auction  in that case  if the marginal benefits from bidding in two
auctions instead of a single auctions are less than the participation costs  then a buyer is
better off choosing and bidding in only one of the auctions 
 information  bidders may simply not be aware of other auctions selling the same type of
item  even if this is known  however  a bidder may not have sufficient information about
the distribution of the valuations of other bidders and the number of participating bidders 
whereas this information is not required when bidding in a single auction  because of the
   note that  since bidding the true value is optimal for local bidders irrespective of what others are bidding 
their strategy is not affected by the presence of global bidders 

   

fioptimal strategies for simultaneous vickrey auctions with perfect substitutes

dominance property in a second price auction   it is important when bidding in multiple
simultaneous auctions  such information can be obtained by an expert user or be learned
over time  but is often not available to a novice 
 risk attitude  although a global bidder obtains a higher utility on average  such a
bidder runs a risk of incurring a loss  i e   a negative utility  when winning multiple
auctions  a risk averse bidder may not be willing to take that chance  and so may choose
to participate in fewer or even just a single auction to avoid such a potential loss  whether
a bidder chooses to reduce the number of auctions to a single one depends of the degree
of risk aversion  in general  we would expect an agent to take less risk and bid in fewer
auctions if the stakes are higher  i e   in the case of high value transactions  a global
bidding agent  on the other hand  could be representing a large firm with sufficient funds
to cover any losses  and these agents are more likely to be risk neutral 
 budget constraints  related to the previous point  a bidder may not have sufficient
funds to take a loss in case it wins more than one auction  in more detail  for a fixed
budget b  the sum of bids should not exceed b  thereby limiting the number of auctions a
bidder can participate in and or lowering the actual bids that are placed in those auctions
 see also section     where we investigate budget constraints in more detail  
 bounded rationality  as will become clear from this paper  an optimal strategy for
a global bidder is harder to compute than a local one  a bidder will therefore only
bid globally if the costs of computing the optimal strategy outweigh the benefits of the
additional utility  moreover  the concept of a local bidder also captures the notion of a
manual bidder who does not use an intelligent bidding agent to compute the optimal
bid  for a human bidder it is clearly easier to bid their true value in a single auction
which requires no calculation at all  again  given that the value is known  

   identical simultaneous auctions
in this section  we provide a theoretical analysis of the optimal bidding strategy when a
global bidder participates in identical simultaneous auctions  in particular  we address
the case where all other bidders are local and simply bid their true valuation  however 
the analysis is more general and applies to any setting where the distribution of the best
competitive bid is known and satisfies certain properties  after we describe the global
bidders expected utility in section      we show in section     that it is always optimal for
a global bidder to participate in the maximum number of simultaneous auctions available 
subsequently  in section     we significantly reduce the complexity of finding the optimal
bids for the multi auction problem in case all auctions are equivalent  and we then apply
these methods to find optimal strategies for specific examples 
    the global bidders expected utility
in what follows  the number of sellers  auctions  is m    and m               m  denotes
the set of available auctions  let g denote the cumulative distribution function of the best
competitive bid in a particular auction and g the corresponding density function  equiva   

figerding  dash  byde   jennings

lently  g b  is the probability of winning a specific auction conditional on placing bid b in
this auction  we introduce the following assumptions regarding function g 
assumption    the cumulative distribution g x  has bounded support     vmax    is continuous within this range  and is strictly increasing for     x   vmax  
a global bidder has a valuation v      vmax    nb  we do not consider the trivial case where
v      and we assume that v is within the bounds of g  and places a global bid b  which is
a vector that specifies a  possibly different  bid bi      vmax   for each auction i  m   now 
given the setting described in section   with identical auctions  the expected utility u for
a global bidder with global bid b and valuation v is given by 
 

u  b  v    v   

y

 

    g bi    

im

xz

im

bi

yg y dy 

   

 

here  the left part of the equation is the valuation multiplied by the probability that the
global bidder wins at least one of the m auctions and thus corresponds to the expected
benefit  in more q
detail  note that     g bi    is the probability of not winning auction i
whenqbidding bi   im     g bi    is the probability of not winning any auction  and thus
    im     g bi     is the probability of winning at least one auction  the right part
of equation     corresponds to the total expected costs or payments  to see the latter 
that the expected payment of a single second price auction when bidding b equals
rnote
b
  yg y dy and is independent of the expected payments for other auctions 
now  equation     can be used to address the setting where all bidders except the
global bidder are local  this is done as follows  let the number of local bidders be n 
   a local bidders valuation v      vmax   is independently drawn from a cumulative
distribution f with probability density f   where f  x  has the same properties as g x   i e  
has support     vmax    is continuous within this range  and is strictly positive for     x  
vmax    note that  since it is a dominant strategy for a local bidder to bid the true value  no
additional assumptions are needed about the knowledge of these local bidders regarding the
distributions of other bidders   in case the local bidders are static  i e   there are exactly n
local bidders with equal distributions  g is simply the highest order statistic g b    f  b n  
and g b    dg b  db   nf  b n  f  b   however  we can use the same equation to model
dynamic local bidders in the following way 
lemma    by replacing the highest order statistic g y  and the corresponding density
function g y  with 
g y    en f  y     
g y    dg y  dy   n f  y en f  y     
equation     becomes the expected utility where the number of local bidders in each auction
is described by a poisson distribution with average n  i e   where the probability that n local
bidders participate is given by p  n    nn en  n   
proof to prove this  we first show that g   and f    can be modified such that the
number of bidders per auction is given by a binomial distribution  where a bidders decision
   

fioptimal strategies for simultaneous vickrey auctions with perfect substitutes

to participate is given by a bernoulli trial  as follows 
g  y    f   y n       p   p f  y  n  

   

where p is the probability that a bidder participates in the auction  and n is the total
number of bidders  to see this  note that not participating is equivalent to bidding zero 
as a result  f           p since there is a    p probability that a bidder bids zero at a
specific auction  and f   y    f        p f  y  since there is a probability p that a bidder
bids according to the original distribution f  y   now  the average number of participating
bidders is given by n   p n   by replacing p with n n   equation     becomes g  y   
    n n    n n  f  y  n   note that a poisson distribution is given by the limit of a
binomial distribution  by keeping n constant and taking the limit n    we then obtain
g  y    en f  y      g y  

the results that follow apply to both the static and dynamic model unless stated otherwise 
    participation in multiple auctions
we now show that  for any valuation     v   vmax   a utility maximising global bidder
should always place non zero bids in all available auctions   to prove this  we show that
the expected utility increases when placing an arbitrarily small bid compared to not participating in an auction  this holds even when the auctions are not identical  in the following
let bbj  bj denote the global bid b where the j th bid bj   bj   more formally 
theorem    under assumption   and given that the global bidder has a valuation    
v   vmax   consider a global bid b with bi  v for all i  m   suppose that bj     for some
auction j  m   then equation     is not maximised  i e   there exists a bj     such that
u  bbj  bj   v    u  b  v  
proof we need to show that there exists a bj     such that u  bbj  bj   v   u  b  v   
   using equation      the marginal expected utility for participating in auction j w r t 
bidding zero in that auction can be written as 
y

u  bbj  bj   v   u  b  v    vg bj  

    g bi    

im   j 

now  using integration by parts  we have
equation can be rewritten as 


u  bbj  bj   v   u  b  v    g bj   v

r bj
 

yg y    bj g bj   

y

im   j 

z

bj

yg y dy 

 

r bj
 



g y dy and the above

    g bi     bj   

z

bj

g y dy 

   

 

   we note that this does not necessarily hold in the boundary case where v   vmax   however  in practice 
we find that even here the optimal strategy is to bid below the true value in multiple auctions instead
of the true value in a single auction  this is especially the case when the number auctions is large  see
also section        

   

figerding  dash  byde   jennings

clearly  since bj     and g x      for x      due to assumption    we have that g bj   and
r bj
positive  moreover  given that bi  v   vmax for i  m and that
  g y dy are both strictly
q
q
v      it follows that v im   j      g bi         now  suppose we set bj      v im   j     
h q
i r
b
g bi     then u  bbj  bj   v   u  b  v    g bj      v im   j      g bi        j g y dy     and

thus su  bbj  bj   v    u  b  v  
the above proof applies to the setting where auctions are identical  however  it is easy
to see that the same argument holds if g differs for each auction 
this result states that  even though there is risk of winning and having to pay for more
than one item  and a buyer disposes of any additional items won   the best strategy is to
participate in all auctions  therefore  in expectation  the increasing probability of winning
a single item outweighs the possible loss incurred when winning more than one of them 
to obtain a better understanding of why this is true  consider the following more intuitive
argument  suppose that a global bidder bids in k   m auctions  in that case  there is
some non zero probability that the bidder wins none of the auctions  and thus there is a
non zero expected demand for at least one of the items in the remaining auctions  since this
argument holds for any k   m  by induction a global bidder should bid in all m auctions 
note that theorem   holds only when v is strictly smaller than vmax   in the case that
v   vmax there are two possibilities  either it is optimal to bid vmax in one auction in which
case the bids in the other auctions should be zero  since the bidder is guaranteed to win  
or it is optimal to bid below vmax but strictly positive in all auctions  as we will show in
section       we find emperically that the first is true only when the number of auctions is
small  and the latter is the case for large numbers of auctions 
    the optimal global bid
a general solution to the optimal global bid requires the maximisation of equation     in
m dimensions  an arduous task  even when applying numerical methods  in this section 
however  we show how to reduce the entire bid space to a single dimension in most cases 
thereby significantly simplifying the problem at hand  first  however  in order to find the
optimal solutions to equation      we set the partial derivatives to zero

now  equality     holds either when g bi       or when bj b  bi       g bj   v  bi

in other words  the optimal bid in auction i is equal to the bidders valuation multiplied
by the probability of not winning any of the other auctions  it is straightforward to show that

the second partial derivative is negative  confirming that the solution is indeed a maximum
when keeping all other bids constant  moreover  since the optimal bid requires that     bi  
vmax for v   vmax  due to theorem   and since bidding more than the valuation is clearly
suboptimal   we only need to consider interior solutions  thus  equation     provides a
means to derive the optimal bid for auction i  given the bids in all other auctions 
now  by taking the partial derivatives for each auction and rewriting equation      the
optimal global bid must obey the following relationship  b      g b       b      g b

in what follows  we apply equation     to reduce the search space  and first show that 
for a large class of probability distributions  the optimal global bid consists of at most two
different values  thereby reducing the search space to two dimensions  in section       we
further reduce this to a single dimension  in section       we consider limit results when
the number of auctions goes to infinity  finally  in section       we perform a numerical
analysis of the optimal bidding strategy for specific cases when the number of auctions is
finite  and we consider to what extent a global bidder benefits compared to bidding locally 
      reducing the search space
in this section  we first show that the optimal global bids consists of at most two different
values when the function h b    b    g b   has a unique critical point  more formally  we
introduce the following requirement 
assumption    h b    b    g b   has a unique critical point bf   i e   there exists a bf
d
d
s t  db
h bf       and for all b    bf   db
h b       
we then go on to show that this requirement is met for a wide class of distributions which
are characterised by a non decreasing hazard rate  let the two bid values be denoted by b
and b    where b  b    formally 
theorem    under assumptions   and    the global bid b maximising equation    
contains at most two distinct bid values  b and b    in addition  b  bf  b    where bf
is the unique critical point of h b    b    g b   
proof suppose h has a unique critical point  bf   h      h vmax        and h b     
in     vmax    so bf must in fact be the global maximum of h  furthermore  for b   bf
h is strictly increasing while for b   bf h is strictly decreasing  this also implies that
h x    y has at most two solutions  if y   h bf   then there are no solutions  since bf is
the global maximiser of h  if y   h bf   there is a unique solution  namely bf   if y   h bf  
then applying the intermediate value theorem to h on the interval     bf   gives one solution 
namely b  bf   and on the interval  bf   vmax   gives the other  namely b   bf   there can
be only one solution in each interval because h is strictly monotonic on each 
now  equation     implies that h bi   is equal for all i  m   therefore  given that
h x    y has at most two solutions  there can be at most two distinct interior bids bi

namely b and b    as mentioned before  from theorem   the utility maximizing solution
has     bi   vmax when v   vmax   and therefore all solutions are interior ones  in the case
that v   vmax either b    vmax and b      or we have as before that b    vmax and
b     

we now show that the unique critical point of h is guaranteed if g has a non increasing
hazard rate within the interval     vmax    we choose this property since it encompasses a
large number of distributions  including those with log concave density functions such as
uniform  normal and exponential  we refer to the work by barlow  marshall  and proschan 
     and bergstrom and bagnoli       for a list of such functions   formally  a hazard rate
 see e g   krishna        of a cumulative distribution function f is denoted by f and is
defined by 
f  x

we have the following result 
lemma    under assumption    if g  b  is non decreasing in     vmax    then the function
h b    b    g b   has a unique critical point bf in that interval 
proof see appendix a   
we now extend the proof to the distribution functions of the local bidders f by showing
that  if the hazard rate of f is non decreasing  the hazard rate of g is also non decreasing 
and thus the reduction also applies  this holds both for local and static bidders  formally 
theorem    if f  b  is non decreasing  then g  b  and gb  b  are also non decreasing 
b   en f  y    for n    
where g b    f  b n and g

proof see appendix a   

      characterising the optimal bids
using the above results we are able to reduce the optimal global bid to two values  a high
bid  b   bf   and a low bid  b  bf   however  we do not know the number of auctions
in which to bid high and low  in this section we show that it is optimal to bid high in at
most one auction  and low in all other auctions  using this result  we can then write the
high bid in terms of the low bids  reducing the search space even further 
theorem    under assumptions   and    the global bid b that maximises equation  
has at most one high bid  i e   at most one i  m for which bi   bf   where bf is the unique
critical point of h b    b    g b   
proof see appendix a   
   

fioptimal strategies for simultaneous vickrey auctions with perfect substitutes

together with lemma   this implies that  for distributions with non decreasing hazard
rates  either there exists one high bid and m    low bids  or all bids are low  note that
we can now calculate the value of the high bid analytically given the low bid value by using
equation      consequently  finding the optimal global bid reduces to optimising a single
variable  i e   the value for the low bids   this value can then be computed numerically
using standard optimisation techniques such as the quasi newton method  or  alternatively 
the bids can be discretised and a brute force search can be applied to find the optimum 
whatever method is selected it is important to notice that  due to the reduction of the
search space  the computational complexity of calculating the optimal outcome numerically
is independent of the number of auctions  or indeed the number of bidders  
the result of theorem   suggests that it is optimal to restrict attention to a single
auction by bidding high in that auction  and then using the remaining auctions as a backup
in case the high bid auction fails  as we will show in section       this is often the case
in practise when the number of auctions is small  when the number of auctions is large 
however  we find that it is optimal to bid low in all of the auctions  irrespective of the
bidders valuation  we derive theoretical results for the limit case where the number of
auctions goes to infinity in section        and then consider empirical results for the finite
case in section       
      limit results
in this section we investigate how the optimal bidding changes as the number of auctions
becomes very large and consider whether there are general patterns that characterise the
optimal strategy  the first  most basic result is that  as the number of auctions increases 
the agent is able to extract an increasingly greater utility and this approaches the maximum
possible utility  v  to prove this  without loss of generality we restrict the strategy of the
global bidder by only considering uniform bidding  i e   where all bids are equal   let bu
m
denote the optimal global bid when bidding in m auctions when the bidder is confined to
using uniform bids 
theorem    under assumption    the expected utility as defined by equation   from
playing the optimal uniform bid bu
m converges to v  in the sense that for all      there is
a constant m such that m   m implies u  bu
m     v   
proof see appendix a   

note that  since v is an upper bound on the utility that can be achieved by any global
bidder  this result implies that  as the number of auctions increases  eventually uniform
bidding will always be superior to non uniform bidding  more formally 
corollary    under assumption    for sufficiently large m the globally optimal bid b
maximising equation     is equal to the optimal uniform bid bu
m   independent of v 

   

figerding  dash  byde   jennings

r bf
proof this corollary follows from theorem   with    ep  bf       xg x  dx  for m   m
uniform bidding gives utility at least v    whereas non uniform bidding gives strictly less 
u  b     v  ep  b      v  ep  bf     v   

in practice  we find that it is not necessary for the number of auctions to be particularly
large before uniform bidding is optimal for all v  to this end  in the next section we provide
examples of optimal bidding strategy for specific settings 
      empirical evaluation
in this section  we present results from an empirical study and characterise the optimal
global bid for specific cases with finite numbers of auctions  furthermore  we measure
the actual utility improvement that can be obtained when using the global strategy  the
results presented here are based on a uniform distribution of the valuations with vmax     
and the static local bidder model  but they generalise to the dynamic model and other
distributions  figure   illustrates the optimal global bids and the corresponding expected
utility for various m and n      but again the bid curves for different values of m and n
follow a very similar pattern 
as shown in figure    for bidders with a relatively low valuation  the optimal strategy
is to submit m equal bids at  or very close to  the true value  after the valuation reaches
a certain point  however  placing equal bids is no longer the optimal strategy when the
number of auctions is small  in figure   this occurs at m     and m       at this point 
a so called pitchfork bifurcation is observed and the optimal bids split into two values  a
single high bid and m    low ones  in all experiments  however  we consistently observe
that the optimal strategy is always to place uniform bids when the valuation is relatively
low  moreover  the bifurcation point moves to the right as m increases  and disappears
altogether when m becomes sufficiently large  m     in figure    at which point the
optimal bids are uniform  note that this holds even when v   vmax    note also that the
uniform optimal bids move closer to zero as m tends to infinity 
as illustrated in figure    the utility of a global bidder becomes progressively higher
with more auctions  note that  consistent with the limit results from section        the
utility approaches the upper bound v as the number auctions becomes large  in absolute
terms  the improvement is especially high for bidders that have an above average valuation 
but not too close to vmax   the bidders in this range thus benefit most from bidding globally 
this is because bidders with very low valuations have a very small chance of winning any
auction  whereas bidders with a very high valuation have a high probability of winning a
single auction and benefit less from participating in more auctions  in contrast  as shown in
figure    if we consider the utility relative to bidding in a single auction  this is much higher
for bidders with relatively low valuations  in particular  we notice that a global bidder with
a low valuation can improve its utility by up to m times the expected utility of bidding
locally  intuitively  this is because the chance of winning one of the auctions increases by
up to a factor m  whereas the increase in the expected cost is negligible  for high valuation
buyers  however  the benefit is not that obvious because the chances of winning are relatively
high even in case of a single auction

   extensions  budgets  non identical and sequential auctions
in the previous section  we considered the best response strategy when a global bidder faces
multiple identical simultaneous auctions and has no financial constraints  in this section 
we generalise the results to other settings  in particular  we investigate three important
extensions 
   in section     we investigate a setting where the global bidder has a limited budget which
constrains the sum of bids or exposure 
   in section     we investigate a setting where the auctions differ in their probability of
winning  such differences arise  for example  when the auctions have different numbers
of local bidders participating 
   in section     we extend the results to sequential auctions and consider a setting where
the resources of interest are auctioned both simultaneously and sequentially 
    budget constrained bidding
the derivation of the optimal global bid has shown that it is an optimal strategy for the
global bidder to bid in all the simultaneous auctions  now  such a strategy implicitly
assumes that the bidder does not face financial constraints  i e   a bidder can pay for all the
items won   however  often a bidder has limited resources which may restrict its bidding
strategy  in this section we study how a budget can limit the space of possible strategies
available to a global bidder and affect its optimal strategy  in particular  we consider the
case where a budget constrains the exposure  i e   the sum of the bids   this occurs  for
example  when the global bidder has limited liquidity and faces very negative consequences
when it cannot pay for all the items it wins  e g   going bankrupt or being thrown out of
the system  
now  the importance of taking budget constraints into account becomes even more
pronounced from the following result which shows that  as the number of auctions increases 
the required budget or exposure in the unconstrained case will exceed any given limit  
theorem    under assumption   and assuming that g b  is bounded throughout     vmax   
for all v     and for any c  there exists an m forp
which the exposure of the optimal global

bid b maximising equation     exceeds c  i e   im bi   c 
proof see appendix a   

thus  despite the low probability of the bidder having to pay the sum of its bids  especially 
given that each auction is a second price auction   in practice a bidder may still want to
limit this amount 
   we note that  although in practice a budget constraint is on the payments rather than the bids  even
in the second price auctions the worst case outcome is that a bidder pays their bids in all auctions  and
therefore a hard budget constraint is equivalent to constraining the sum of bids 
   note that this occurs despite the fact that bids tend to zero as m goes to infinity  however  the exposure
does not  see the proof of theorem    

   

fioptimal strategies for simultaneous vickrey auctions with perfect substitutes

in more detail  we can formulate the budget constrained problem faced by the bidder
as 
max u  b  v 

s t 

b   v m

x

bi  c 

   

im

where c is the budget limit and u  b  v  is the utility of the global bidder as given by
equation      we consider budget constraints by distinguishing between three cases  in the
following  b    b            bm   refers to the unconstrained optimal solution  i e   the optimal
c
solution in the absence of any budget constraints   whereas bc    bc
            bm   refers to the
optimal global bid subject to budget constraints 
p

case    
im bi   c and v  c 

here  the sum of the unconstrained optimal bids exceeds the budget and it is
therefore required to recompute the optimal bid given the constraint  moreover 
the budget constraint is equal or less than the valuation  for this case  we are
able to show that it is a best strategy to bid in a single auction and to place bid
bi   c in this auction for fairly general probability density functions of g  by so
doing  this provides one of the justifications for the existence of local bidders  as
outlined in section       although this result is intuitive  it is not straightforward
since a bidder may still decide to divide its budget across several auctions  below
we provide the proof of this result 
p

case    
im bi   c and v   c 

as in the previous case  we need to recompute the optimal bid  however  as we will
show  the optimal strategy for the global bidder in this case is to bid in multiple
auctions  as in the unconstrained case   moreover  in contrast to the unconstrained
case  the global bid may consist of more than two different values 
p

case    
im bi  c 
in this case  the sum of the unconstrained optimal bids is less than the budget 
thus the result is trivial and we have b   bc  

examples of these three different cases are depicted in figure    this figure shows the
optimal strategy for bidding in   simultaneous auctions when local bidders have uniformly
distributed valuations within the range        and the global bidder has a budget constraint
c          clearly  for a global bidder with a low valuation the budget constraint does not
affect the optimal bidding strategy  case     case   occurs when the bidder has a valuation
at or above      and case   occurs in the in between range  as this figure shows  the optimal
strategy in the latter two cases is qualitatively very different from the unconstrained case 
whereas the unconstrained optimal strategy is to bid high in at most a single auction  now
this consists of at most a single low bid  several high bids  and placing zero in the remaining
auctions  as the budget becomes tighter relative to the valuation  the number of auctions
in which the bidder participates decreases until a single auction remains  see figure    case
    in what follows  we first consider conditions under which such behaviour is optimal for
    similar patterns are observed in the optimal strategy with varying number of auctions and budget  these
patterns can always be grouped in these three cases

auctions in which a certain bid is placed  as the valuation increases  and the
budget remains constant   the bids in the auctions taper off one by one  until a
single high bid remains and all other bids are zero  the dotted line represents
the unconstrained solution 

case    and subsequently we address case   in more detail  case   is trivial and is therefore
not considered further 
we now provide a formal result for the optimal strategy in case   and show that  when
the budget constraint imposed on a global bidder is equal to or less than the value it
attaches to the item it wishes to acquire  it is a best strategy to act as a local bidder under
the following conditions 
assumption    the probability density function of the best competitive bid g x  is convex
and g        
the result is stated formally as follows 
theorem    under assumptions   and    if the global bidder has a budget c  v  then
equation     is satisfied for bc    c                 i e   it is optimal to bid c in exactly one
auction 
proof see appendix a   
intuitively  the convexity of g x  is necessary to ensure that the probability of winning
an auction increases sufficiently quickly as the bid increases  this way  a higher bid in a
   

fioptimal strategies for simultaneous vickrey auctions with perfect substitutes

single auction results in a higher probability of winning compared to dividing the same
amount over several auctions  although placing a higher bid in a single auction may lead
to a higher expected payment  the proof shows that the utility obtained from an increased
probability of winning outweighs the expected payment increase  at the same time  the
condition g        is important  otherwise the probability of winning increases sufficiently
quickly such that it is optimal to spread the budget over multiple auctions  the importance
of the two conditions becomes apparent by the following corollary which shows that  for the
special case where c   v  the condition that g        is in fact a necessary condition for
bidding in a single auction to be optimal  and  furthermore  that this strategy is no longer
optimal in case g x  is concave 
corollary    under assumption    if either g        or g x  is strictly concave  and the
global bidder has a budget c   v  then equation     is satisfied by bidding strictly positive
in at least two auctions 
proof see appendix a   
note that  in case of static local bidders  the condition that g x  is convex holds  for
example  when f  x  is convex  increasing  and non negative  and thus f  x  is also convex  
since g x    nf n   x f  x   however  the condition holds in other more general cases as
well  especially if the number of local bidders is high  a concave local bidder distribution
can easily result in a convex g x   also note that the condition g        holds in the case
of static local bidders and n     even if f          but not in the case of dynamic local
bidders unless f           finally  we note that convexity of g x  implies a non decreasing
hazard rate and therefore the conditions are stronger than those imposed by assumption  
in section     
we now move on to consider cases   and    case   cannot be analysed as easily as
case    however  a good insight into the constrained optimal strategy can be obtained by
considering the lagrangian of equation      since the budget constraint is an inequality
constraint  in addition to the regular langrangian multiplier we need to introduce the slack
variable  to convert the inequality into an equality  the variable is first p
squared to ensure
a positive value and is then added to the constraint which becomes c  im bi          
the langrange function becomes as follows

from these equations  it can readily be observed that for case         thereby leading

im bi   c 

for case    either      corresponding to a local maximum of equation      in which
the total budget is not spent or      whereby the total budget is spent  these two
possible situations are highlighted in figure    showing the optimal global bidding strategy
for n       m     and budget c        and the corresponding sum of bids  note that here
case   does not arise since the budget exceeds the highest valuation   the unconstrained
solution is also provided for comparison  this example shows that the total amount spent is
not necessarily equal to the available budget  even when the unconstrained optimal solution
exceeds the budget  thus  for case   we cannot solely consider solutions whereby the sum
of bids is equal to the budget since it may be the case that bidding less than the budget
yields a greater utility  i e   when       
furthermore  as can be observed from figures   and   a   the introduction of a budget
constraint changes the shape of the optimal strategy for cases   and    recall from section     that the optimal strategy in the unconstrained case is to either bid equally in all
auctions or to bid high in one auction and low and equally in all of the remaining ones 
however  with a budget constraint  we now have a region where the best strategy is to
bid high in more than one auction and low in the remaining ones  moreover  parts of the
solution now consist of three different bids  high  low  and zero  hence  equation     no
longer holds in case of budget constraints  and the structure of bids observed in section    
need not be satisfied  this means that we cannot apply the same reduction in search space
to efficiently compute the optimal strategy in the case of budget constraints for case    and
the complexity of computing the optimum using brute force increases exponentially with
the number of auctions 
   

fioptimal strategies for simultaneous vickrey auctions with perfect substitutes

    non identical auctions
whereas previously we assumed all auctions to be equivalent  we now relax this assumption
to the more general case with non identical auctions  here  we assume that these auctions
differ not in the global bidders valuation for the item that is sold  but rather in the probability of obtaining the item at a given bid  these differences arise  for example  when the
number of bidders and or the local bidders valuation distribution vary from one auction
to another  this can be used in practice when specific information about the individual
auctions is available    in more detail  we assume that each auction i  m has an individual
cumulative distribution function  denoted by gi  b   and a corresponding density function
gi  b   now  the expected utility is given by

where b    b            bm   is the global bid  specifying a bid for each auction as before 
it is easy to see that theorem   in section     extends to the setting with non identical
auctions and that the optimal strategy is to bid a strictly positive amount in each auction 
provided gi  b  is strictly positive for all i  m      b  vmax   but  the auctions are now
non identical and this complicates the bidding space  we revisit the search space problem
for non identical auctions in section       where a different method is employed to reduce
the bidding space  in section        we show that a global bidder should always bid higher
in a more preferred auction  the optimal bidding strategy for a number of non identical
auctions is empirically evaluated in section       
      calculating the optimal global bid
although a reduction of the search space as described in section     is no longer possible
when the auctions are not identical  we can still significantly reduce the computation needed
to find the optimal bid  to this end  we first set the partial derivatives u bi to zero for
i  m   given that gi  bi       we have

generally  it is not possible to find the optimal global bid analytically  using expression      
however  we can confine our search to only one of the bids and then  for each value of this
bid  determine the values of m    other bids by the computationally less demanding onedimensional root finding operations  see e g   burden   faires         the remaining bid
value can be found analytically using equation      
    for example  ebay auctions reveal the number of visits to web pages of particular items  which can be
used to estimate the number of participating bidders at individual auctions  see http   www ebay com
for examples

to clarify this reduction in search space  we show how this can be applied to a discrete
bid space and using a brute force search approach  to find the optimal  discrete  global
bid  we iterate through the discrete space of one of the bids  say b    for each value of b  we
then find the corresponding m  bid values such that expression      is satisfied as follows 
we first calculate b      g   b     and then search through all discrete values of b  such that
b      g   b       b      g   b        typically there will be at least two values of b  for
which this equality holds    all the solutions are stored into memory and this is repeated
for each bi   bm   the value for bm is calculated using equation       this way we can
calculate the expected utility given b  such that expression      is satisfied  the optimal
solution is then found by maximising the expected utility across all possible values of b  and
all combinations of solutions which have been stored into memory  note that the amount of
computation required to find the expected utility for a single value of b  increases linearly
with the number of auctions  however  the number of combinations increases exponentially
with the number of auctions  nevertheless  since the base of this exponential is typically
   in particular in the case of non decreasing hazard rates  see footnote      computation
remains tractable when the number of auctions is relatively small but becomes intractable
for very large settings    in specific cases  however  where one auction is clearly better
than another auction in a precise sense  it is possible to reduce the number of combinations
and thus the required computation becomes linear with the number of auctions  this issue
is addressed in the next section 
      preferred auctions and their optimal bids
in many cases  it is possible to find auctions which are more favourable than others in
terms of their expected utility  for example  all else being equal  a bidder is expected to
do better on average in auctions with fewer other bidders  a bidder would therefore prefer
such auctions over less profitable ones  irrespective of a bidders own valuation  in this
section  we formalise the notion of a preferred auction  and investigate the optimal bids
when bidding in multiple auctions with respect to these preferences over auctions 
we use the concept of stochastic orders  shaked   shanthikumar        to rank the
auctions in terms of a global bidders preferences  formally  auction j stochastically dominates auction i when gj  b   gi  b  for all    b  vmax  krishna        appendix b  
the expected utility is then at least as high when bidding only in auction i compared to
bidding the same amount in auction j  this is shown
r bas follows  we can write the expected
utility u of auction i j as  ui j    v  b gi j  b      gi j  x dx  since both gi  b   gj  b 
rb
rb
and   gi  x dx    gj  x dx when auction j dominates auction i  the expected utility of
bidding in auction i is at least as high as in auction j  we therefore refer to auction i as
    in case of discrete bids this equality rarely holds exactly but this can be resolved by minimising the
difference instead  i e   minimising b      g   b      b      g   b     
    more precisely  if the function b     g b   has a single critical value  then there will be at most two
solutions  as shown earlier by lemma   this is the case when g has a non decreasing hazard rate  note
that  in case of discrete bids  these solutions are local minima when taking the difference 
    to provide some idea of what this means in practice  we implemented a brute force search in java which
finds the optimal global bid for     discrete valuations and  in doing so  searches through     bids per
valuation and per auction  using these settings  on a     ghz intel centrino the optimal solution is
found within   seconds when m       and takes about    seconds when m

the  weakly  preferred auction  furthermore  we say that auction i is strictly preferred over
auction j at some b if gi  b    gj  b  
when bidding in multiple auctions  we can show that it is optimal to bid higher in
preferred auctions  intuitively  this is because  in case of second price auctions  preferred
auctions give an agent a higher probability of winning the good at a lower price  this
observation can reduce the computation required since only bid values which are higher
than the bids in less preferred auctions need to be considered  in practice this usually
reduces the number of solutions for each auction which satisfy expression      to a single
one  in which case the computation of the optimal global bid becomes linear in the number
of auctions   in addition to the computational benefit  this observation also provides some
guidelines and intuition about the strategies  the relationship between preferred auctions
and the optimal global bid is more precisely described as follows 
theorem    under assumption    for any i  j  m  i    j  if auction i is  weakly  preferred
over auction j  i e   if gi  b   gj  b  for    b  vmax   and if auction i is strictly preferred
at both bi and bj   where bi and bj maximise equation       then bi   bj for any v     
proof we first prove bi  bj by contradiction  and then go on to show that bi    bj  
suppose the opposite holds and there exist i  j  m such that bi   bj  b are optimal and
bi   bj   we then show that the expected utility is strictly higher when interchanging the
two bids  i e   when bidding bi in auction j and bj in auction i  let bbi bj denote the global
bid b where the two bids bi   bj are interchanged  we now show that u  bbi bj   v   u  b  v 
is strictly positive for    v  vmax   using equation      and itegration by parts we obtain
the following 
u  bbi bj   v   u  b  v     v c  bi   gj  bi    gi  bi       v c  bj   gi  bj    gj  bj

where c   km   i j      gk  bk     first we note that c     because the strict preference of
the auctions at bi and bj requires that     bi   vmax      bj   vmax  since gi       gj      
gi  vmax     gj  vmax         and therefore due to theorem   it holds that     bk   vmax
for k  m   i  j   next  note that the last term in equation      is always positive since
bj   bi and gi  b   gj  b   we can therefore ignore this term if the remaining part is also
positive  let this term be denoted by  in the following  since we assumed bi and bj to be
optimal  from equation      the following holds 
bi   v c     gj  bj     v c  bi   v c gj  bj    
bj   v c     gi  bi     v c  bj   v c gi  bi    

    

by replacing v c  bi and v c  bj in equation      by v c gj  bj   and v c gi  bi   respectively 
and by rearranging the terms  we obtain the following 
u  bbi bj   v   u  b  v    v c  gi  bi    gj  bi    gi  bj    gj  bj

figure    optimal global bid as a fraction of the valuation for  a  two and  b  seven simultaneous auctions for various settings  the auctions differ in the number of local
bidders which are present at each auction 

now  since gi  bi     gj  bi    gi  bj     gj  bj    v      c      and      it follows that
u  bbi bj   v    u  b  v   as a result  bi and bj cannot be optimal bids for auctions i and j
respectively  and this contradicts our initial proposition 
the above proves that bi  bj   we now show that bi must be strictly higher than

bj   this follows directly from equation       suppose bi   bj   then from equation     
it follows that gi  bi     gj  bi   and gi  bj     gj  bj    however  this conflicts with the
requirement that auction i must be strictly preferred at bi and bj   thereby completing the
proof 

the above proof is based on the requirement that auction i is strictly preferred over
auction j for at least the two optimal bids in these auctions  although this requires the
optimal bid to be known in advance  the proof also applies to cases where auction i is strictly
preferred over auction j over the entire range     b   vmax   this is the case  for example 
when the number of bidders in auction i is strictly less than in auction j  furthermore  we
note that similar results hold for slightly different conditions  specifically  if the auction
is strictly preferred at a set of points with non zero measure anywhere within the range
 bj   bi    then bi  bj since      in equation       consequently  the condition bi  bj
holds when auction i is preferred over auction j and gi   gj can be described by analytic
functions 
      empirical evaluation
in this section  we examine how the bidding strategy of the global bidder is affected when the
auctions have different numbers of local bidders  to this end  we find the optimal bids that
maximise the utility given by equation      using a standard optimisation technique  press 
flannery  teukolsky    vetterling         the numerical results shown here assume the
   

fioptimal strategies for simultaneous vickrey auctions with perfect substitutes

bidder valuation distribution to be uniform  although similar results are obtained with
other commonly used distributions  two different scenarios are evaluated  in the first  we
investigate how the optimal bids change with increasing differences between the local bidder
numbers in the case of two simultaneous auctions  see figure   a    here  the number of
local bidders in the first auction  n    is fixed to   whereas the number of local bidders in
the second auction  n    is varied between   and    in the second  note that we depict the
optimal strategy as a fraction of the valuation  bi  v  rather than the actual bid value since
this more clearly demonstrates the effect of preferred auctions   figure   a  shows that
the global bidder bids higher in the preferred auction  i e   the one with fewer bidders  
consistent with lemma    as the valuation increases  the bid in the preferred auction first
decreases relative to the valuation  and then increases  similar to the case with the same
number of local bidders  however  the higher bid is now much closer to the true valuation 
especially if the difference between the auctions is large 
the simulation is extended to more auctions in the second scenario  the results for
two different settings are shown in figure   b   in one setting  solid lines   each of the
seven auctions has a different number of local bidders  in the other settings  dashed lines 
the results are shown where   auctions have   local bidders each and the other   auctions
have   local bidders  as before  we observe that the global bidder always bids higher in
the auctions with fewer local bidders  although the appearance of the bifurcation point is
common for simultaneous auctions with the same number of bidders  this is not the case
when the number of bidders is not identical  this is because the global bidder always bids
different amounts for auctions with different numbers of bidders  as a result  the bifurcation
phenomenon that indicates the transition from equal bids to high low bids does not occur 
    sequential and simultaneous auctions
in this section we extend our analysis of the optimal bidding strategy to sequential auctions 
specifically  the auction process consists of r rounds  and in each round any number of
auctions are running simultaneously  such a combination of sequential and simultaneous
auctions is very common in practice  especially online    it turns out that the analysis for
the case of simultaneous auctions can be easily extended to include sequential auctions  in
the following  the set of simultaneous auctions in round r is denoted by m r   and the vector
of bids in that round by br   as before  the analysis assumes that all other bidders are
local and bid in a single auction  we initially assume that the global bidders have complete
knowledge about the number of rounds and the number of auctions in each round but we
then relax these assumptions 
the expected utility in round r  denoted by u r   is similar to before  equation     in
section      except that now additional benefit can be obtained from future auctions if the
desired item is not won in one of the current set of simultaneous auctions  for convenience 
u r  br   m r   is abbreviated to u r in the following  the expected utility thus becomes 
    rather than being purely sequential in nature  online auctions also often overlap  i e   new auctions
can start while others are still ongoing   in that case  however  it is optimal to wait and bid in the
new auctions only after the outcome of the earlier auctions is known  thereby reducing the chance
of unwittingly winning multiple items  using this strategy  overlapping auctions effectively become
sequential and can thus be analysed using the results in this section

note that equation      is almost identical to equation     in section      except that
the valuation v is now replaced by v  u r     the optimal bidding strategy can thus be
found by backward induction  where u r        using the procedure outlined in section     
now  we first relax the assumption that the global bidder has complete knowledge about
the number of auctions in future rounds  let p m  denote the probability that there are m
auctions in the next round and let mmax denote the maximum number of auctions  furthermore  let mj be the set of j auctions and u r  br   mj   the expected utility in round r when

furthermore  uncertainty about the number of rounds can be addressed by adding a discount factor         which represents the probability that there are no more auctions after
this round  finally  we note that the equation can be similarly extended to non identical
auctions and to settings where g depends on the number of auctions and or the round 

   market efficiency
efficiency is an important system wide property since it characterises to what extent the
market maximises social welfare  i e   the sum of utilities of all agents in the market   to
this end  in this section we study the efficiency of markets with either static or dynamic
local bidders  and the impact that a global bidder has on the efficiency in these markets 
specifically  efficiency in this context is maximised when the bidders with the m highest
valuations  recall that m denotes the number of auctions  but also the total number of
items  in the entire market obtain a single item each  for simplicity we assume that the
total number of bidders in the market is at least m  more formally  we define the efficiency
of an allocation as 
definition    efficiency of allocation  the efficiency k of an allocation k is the
obtained social welfare proportional to the maximum social welfare that can be achieved in
any type of market and is given by

vi  k  is an efficient allocation  k is the set of all possible
allocations  assuming bidders can be allocated to any auction   vi  k  is bidder is utility
for the allocation k  k  and nt is the total number of bidders participating in the market 

now  in order to measure the efficiency of the market and the impact of a global bidder 
we run simulations for the markets with and without a global bidder and for the different
types of local bidders  the experiments are carried out as follows  each bidders valuation
 both local and global  is independently drawn from a uniform distribution with support
        in the experiments without a global bidder  an additional local bidder is placed in one
of the auctions such that the overall number of bidders is the same on average compared
to the case with a global bidder  the local bidders bid their true valuations  whereas the
global bidder bids optimally in each auction as described in section      the experiments are
repeated       times in order to get statistically significant results with a     confidence
interval 
the results of these experiments are shown in figure    note that a degree of inefficiency
is inherent to a multi auction market with only local bidders    for example  if there are
two auctions selling one item each  and the two bidders with the highest valuations both
bid locally in the same auction  then the bidder with the second highest value does not
obtain the good  thus  the allocation of items to bidders is inefficient  and this inefficiency
increases as the number of auctions increases  keeping the average number of bidders per
auction equal   as can be observed from figure    however  the efficiency increases when
n becomes larger  this is because the differences between the bidders with the highest
valuations become smaller  thereby decreasing the loss of efficiency 
furthermore  figure   shows that if one of the local bidders is replaced by a global
bidder this generally creates a positive effect on the efficiency when the number of bidders
is small  but that no significant change occurs when there are many local bidders  this
holds both for static and dynamic local bidders   the latter comes as no surprise since the
impact of a single bidder diminishes as there are more bidders competing in an auction  the
former  on the other hand  is not obvious  the introduction of a global bidder potentially
leads to a decrease of efficiency since this bidder can unwittingly win more than one item 
furthermore  a global bidder will generally bid below its true valuation which can also result
in inefficient outcomes  however  the results show that  on average  the opposite occurs 
this is because  when there is no global bidder and only few local bidders  there is a high
probability that a local bidder with a low valuation will win the item  a global bidder 
on the other hand  is likely to win that auction if it has a sufficiently high valuation  even
though the global bids are below the true valuation  as was shown in section       bids are
often uniform and fairly close to the true value   this effect is particularly pronounced in
the case of dynamic local bidders since it may occur that an auction has no local bidder
whatsoever  in which case the global bidder wins the item for sure 
    an exception is when n     and bidders are static  since the market is then completely efficient without
a global bidder  however  since this is a very special case and does not apply to other settings  we do
not discuss it further here

   conclusions
in this paper  we derive utility maximising strategies for an agent that has to bid in multiple 
simultaneous second price auctions  we first analyse the case where a single global bidder
bids in all auctions  whereas all other bidders are local and bid in a single auction  for this
setting  we find that it is optimal to place non zero bids in all auctions that sell the desired
item  even when a bidder requires only a single item and derives no additional benefit from
having more  thus  a potential buyer can achieve considerable benefit by participating in
multiple auctions and employing an optimal bidding strategy 
for most common valuation distributions  we show analytically that the optimal bids
for identical auctions consist of at most two values  a high bid and a low bid  and that it
is optimal to bid high in at most one auction  moreover  by writing the high bid in terms
of the low ones  the problem of finding the optimal bids reduces to optimising a single
variable  this considerably simplifies the original optimisation problem and can thus be
used in practice to compute the optimal bids for any number of auctions  furthermore  we
show that  when the number of auctions becomes large  it is optimal to bid uniformly across
all auctions  we also analyse the setting where auctions are not identical and differ in their
probability of winning  although it is still optimal to participate in all auctions  we find
that the best strategy is then to bid relatively high in more favourable auctions  i e   where
the probability of winning is highest   we investigate other practical considerations as well 
we show that budget constraints limit the number of auctions that bidders participate in 
specifically  if a global bidders budget is equal to or less than its valuation  the optimal
strategy reverts to bidding in a single auction under certain conditions  thereby justifying
   

fioptimal strategies for simultaneous vickrey auctions with perfect substitutes

the presence of local bidders  furthermore  we consider sequential auctions and show that
our results can be readily applied to markets where auctions occur both sequentially and
simultaneously  finally  we compare the efficiency of a market with multiple simultaneous
auctions with and without a global bidder  we show that  if a local bidder is replaced by a
global one  this increases the average efficiency and thus social welfare of the sysstem when
the number of bidders is small  but that no significant effect is found if there are many local
bidders 
there are a number of interesting directions for future work  first of all  whereas this
paper focuses on the buyer  we intend to extend the analysis and consider the revenue
from the sellers point of view  this is particularly relevant when sellers have a more proactive role and can set auction parameters such as the reserve price to try and maximise
their expected revenue  this is closely related to the research on competing sellers  where
it is shown that the optimal auction parameters depend on the competition with other
sellers  since this affects the number of potential buyers that are attracted to a particular
auction  mcafee        peters   severinov        burguet   sakovics        gerding et al  
    b   however  the current literature on competing sellers assumes that the buyers only
participate in a single auction  which is shown here to be suboptimal  the case where
sellers optimise auction parameters and buyers can participate in any number of auctions
simultaneously has so far not been investigated  furthermore  this paper has taken a
decision theoretic approach by analysing the case of a single global bidder  an interesting
open problem is characterising the game theoretic solution in the case that multiple global
bidders interact strategically

since the denominator of equation      is always non negative  it is thus sufficient to show
that the numerator is always non negative  the numerator of equation      can be rewritten
as 
h

f  b en  f  b   n     nf  b    en f  b     

in which the first and second terms are     b  thus  in order to prove
that the numerator iis

always non negative  it remains to be shown that the third term  n nf  b  en f  b     

is non negative  this term is equal to n      en      since n      and   at the extremums
bmin and bmax respectively  furthermore  the first order differential on this term yields
nf  b     en f  b           b  hence the third term is also      b

the proof is by contradiction  we show that if there are two high bids then the critical
point cannot be a local maximum of u   this is done by showing that if there are two high
bids at b  then the hessian matrix with entries      has a positive eigenvalue  or equivalently
that there exists a vector a    a    a            am   for which

if we can show that the hessian matrix at b has a positive eigenvalue  this means that b is

in turn means that a small enough displacement in the direction of a leads to an increase

a   limit cases
in this section we examine a global bidders expected utility when the number of auctions
goes to infinity  in particular  we prove that for a large enough number of auctions  the
optimal behaviour is always to bid uniformly 
first of all  note from     and the definition of the optimal uniform bid bu

m   v    g bm   

    

lemma    the smallest bid b in the optimal  possibly non uniform  bid vector b tends
to   uniformly in v as m   
rb
proof this follows from the fact that the expected payment function ep  b      xg x  dx
is a strictly monotonically increasing continuous function of b  and hence has a monotonically

our first step towards proving that uniform bidding is eventually globally optimal is to
show that the utility from optimal bidding converges to its maximum value of v 

theorem    under assumption    the expected utility as defined by equation   from
playing the optimal uniform bid bu
m converges to v  in the sense that for all      there is
a constant m such that m   m implies u  bu
m     v   
proof first of all note that the result is trivial for v    since u  bu
m      always  from
the definition of utility      and using

from lemma   we know that bu
m     which implies bm     g bm        so we turn our
attention to the expected payment term  showing that it tends to zero as m    from
the definition      of bu

to prove that the above limit is zero we demonstrate the stronger limit
ln b v ep  b 
    
b  ln    g b

which we do by applying lhopitals rule multiple times  first we apply it to the numerator

where the last limit holds uniformly on   v  vmax

that
bg b 
  b    
g b    bg   b 
and the limit b ln b v     is obvious  so the limit in      must be zero  this in turn implies
that the expected payment from uniform bidding tends to zero  while the expected value
tends to v  and thus the theorem is proved 

a   budget constraints
in what follows we provide the proof for the proposition that the optimal strategy is to bid
in a single auction under certain conditions  if the exposure is constrained to at most its
valuation  the proof for any number of auctions is complex  therefore  we first provide a
formal proof for the case of two auctions  and then generalise the result to more than two 
the proof for the two auction case also provides a building block for the inductive proofs
contained in the more general case 
first we show that the unconstrained optimum bid eventually exceeds any given budget 

theorem    under assumption   and assuming that g b  is bounded throughout     vmax   
for all v     and for any c  there exists an m forp
which the exposure of the optimal global
bid b maximising equation     exceeds c  i e   im bi   c 

proof to begin with  note that the conditions of corollary   are met  so that in fact
we can restrict attention to uniform bidding when m is sufficiently large  in particular as
m    what we then show is that for all v   v     and any c     there is an m such
that mbu
m   c 
the proof is by contradiction  assume that there is a constant c such that bu
mm   c
u   kc m  so that  using
for all m  by the bounded density assumption  g bu

the fact that bu
m is thus bounded below contradicts the bound bm m   c 



the following lemma characterises the bidding strategy when the budget is c  v and
m      this result is then used in theorem   to prove the more general case where m    
lemma    for m     the optimal bidding strategy of a global bidder with budget c  v
is given by bc    c     when the probability density function g x  is convex and g        
proof in order to prove the lemma  we consider the difference between the optimal bid
bc and an arbitrary bid b   b    b  where b    bc and b    b    c

u  bc   v   u  b   v    vg c

hence

now  to prove that bc is indeed the optimal bid  we need to show that the above difference
is positive for any b that satisfies the budget constraint  rin order to do so  we first separate
c
the above equation into two parts  namely  x b    b      b  g y dy  b  g b     b  g b    
r b 
  g y dy and  v  c y where y  b    b       g c   g b     g b      we now show that
both x and y are positive  thus implying that  since  v  c  is positive  u  bc   v   u  b   v 
is also positive 
now  we rewrite x in terms of b  only by replacing b  with c  b   and x becomes 
x b

since g         it is easy to see that there are at least three solutions to equation      
namely b        c  c     we shall now show that the first derivative of x is always
non negative within the range b        c     implying that x increases within this range 
since x        and the solution is symmetric around c    it follows that x is always
non negative  more formally  we need to show that 
x
    b       c    
b 
we now prove that this holds if g x  is convex  now  from the definition of a convex
function we have 
g x         x      g x           g x         
now  let x       then 
g x     g x           g    
since g         this becomes 
g x     g x    
 
g x     g x    

let x     c  b    and

then  equation      becomes

thus  this shows that b
    which  in turn  proves that x    
 
we now prove that y   g c   g b     g b        since we assume that g x  is convex
and positive rin the interval        and that g         it follows that g x  is increasing and
x
thus g x      g x dx is also convex  as a result  we can use the condition in equation

for g x   now  by replacing  by b   b
and x  by b    b    we have g x   g b

b    b    c  note that so far we have assumed that the sum of bids is equal to the budget
constraint  and we have not mentioned the case where b    b    c  we now show that it is
optimal to bid the full budget  i e   b    b    c  
consider any arbitrary b    b    b  where b    b    s  c  then  by replacing c with
s in the above  we know that u   s      v   u   b    b     v   hence  it remains to be shown
that u   c      v   u   s      v   we again consider the difference between these two bids 
which from equation     is

therefore  s g y dy   c  s g s  is also positive  hence  u   c      v   u   s      v     

we have thus shown that a global bidder will bid in only one auction if its budget is
constrained such that c  v when bidding in two simultaneous auctions  provided that
g x  is convex and g        this results can now be generalised to the case that m     in
more detail  the following theorem holds

the above thus proves the inductive step  which along with the base case  thereby proves
that zm     hence the third part of equation      is also positive  since all three parts
of this equation are positive  this impliespthat u  bc   v  is indeed optimal when bc  
 c                 note that we assumed c   im bi   however  using the same argument as
in lemma   it is easy to see that it is indeed optimal to bid the full budget 


corollary    under assumption    if either g        or g x  is strictly concave  and the
global bidder has a budget c   v  then equation     is satisfied by bidding strictly positive
in at least two auctions 
proof the proof is largely based on the reverse arguments from lemma    without loss of
generality we take m      let bl    c     denote the single auction bid and b    b    b   
an arbitrary bid such that b    bl and b    b    c  b    b     as before  since v  c    
we have u  bl   v   u  b   v    x b     where x is given by equation       furthermore 
x
b    b  g c  b      c  b   g b     see equation        now  in order to prove that it is
optimal to bid strictly positive in both auctions  it is sufficient to show that there exists a
c   b      such that x b        when one of the two conditions holds 
x
we first show that this holds when g         it is easy to see that b
      cg       
 
and x    is thus strictly decreasing  since x        this proves that x b        for b 
slightly larger than zero  since b    c  b  it follows that b      as long as b    c  and an
agent can thus do better by bidding in both auctions 
we now consider the case that g        but g x  is strictly concave  by replacing the
condition for convex functions in lemma   with that of strictly concave functions it follows
b 
that   g x      g x    for    c   x       by setting x     c  b    and    cb
