abstract
we consider the problem of allocating fairly a set of indivisible goods among agents
from the point of view of compact representation and computational complexity  we start
by assuming that agents have dichotomous preferences expressed by propositional formulae  we express efficiency and envy freeness in a logical setting  which reveals unexpected
connections to nonmonotonic reasoning  then we identify the complexity of determining
whether there exists an efficient and envy free allocation  for several notions of efficiency 
when preferences are represented in a succinct way  as well as restrictions of this problem  
we first study the problem under the assumption that preferences are dichotomous  and
then in the general case 

   introduction
allocating goods to agents is an important issue that has been considered from different perspectives in economics  especially social choice theory  and in computer science  especially
artificial intelligence and operations research   and arises in various real world settings 
auctions  divorce settlements  electronic spectrum and frequency allocation  airport traffic management  or the fair and efficient exploitation of earth observation satellites  see
the survey from chevaleyre  dunne  endriss  lang  lematre  maudet  padget  phelps 
rodrguez aguilar    sousa        for a detailed description   the general issue also covers
a huge variety of allocation problems  depending on the following parameters  see again the
work from chevaleyre et al         for a detailed taxonomy  
 the nature of the resources to be allocated  are they divisible or not  single unit or
multi unit   
 the nature of the preferences of the agents  are they numerical or simply ordinal  can
there be preferential dependencies between goods  
 the nature of the permitted allocations  can goods be shared among several agents 
do all goods have to be allocated  can allocations be accompanied by side payments   
 the evaluation of the quality of an allocation  pareto efficiency  utilitarian or egalitarian social welfare etc

 the nature of the process that leads to the allocation  centralized or decentralized  
for instance  standard combinatorial auctions  cramton  shoham    steinberg       
typically correspond to indivisible goods  possible multi unit   numerical preferences with
possible dependencies between goods  monetary payments  maximization of the total value
of sold items  and a centralized computation 
in this paper we focus on fair division of indivisible goods without money transfers    fair
division makes a prominent use of ex post fairness criteria such as equity and envy freeness 
and on this point departs from auctions  that rather focus on other kinds of fairness  as
well as on efficiency of the procedure   such as truthful mechanisms  or fairness of the
procedure itself  brams   taylor        young         a key concept in the literature on
fair division is envy freeness  an allocation is envy free if and only if each agent likes her
share at least as much as the share of any other agent  ensuring envy freeness is considered
a desirable property  however  envy freeness alone does not suffice as a criterion for finding
satisfactory allocations  this is especially obvious if it is not compulsory to allocate all
goods  in this case  not allocating anything to anyone results in an envy free allocation  yet
totally unsatisfactory   therefore it has to be paired with some efficiency criterion  such as
pareto optimality or maximum social welfare  however  it is known that for any reasonable
notion of efficiency  there are profiles for which no efficient and envy free allocation exists 
 brams  edelman    fishburn         this is even trivial if every good must be assigned
to someone  in this case  there are profiles for which not even an envy free allocation exists 
another well known notion of fairness  that we do not consider in this paper  except for one
result  is rawlsian egalitarianism  which says that an allocation is equitable if it maximizes
the satisfaction of the least satisfied agent  unlike envy freeness  egalitarianism requires
interpersonal comparability of preferences 
whereas social choice theory has developed an important literature on fair division 
computational issues have rarely been considered  on the other hand  artificial intelligence
has studied these issues extensively  but until now has focused mainly on combinatorial
auctions and related classical utilitarian problems  combinatorial auctions  aiming at maximizing the auctioneers revenue  consisting in the sum of the prices paid by all agents  
are only a specific form of allocation process  namely a pure utilitarian form with money
transfers in which considerations such as equity and fairness are not relevant  the literature
on combinatorial auctions and related problems has been investigating issues such as compact representation  so as to allow agents to express their bids in a concise way  see the
work from nisan        for an overview  as well as computational complexity  algorithms 
tractable subclasses and approximation  complexity issues for negotiation  where agents
exchange goods by means of deals  have also been studied  e g  dunne  wooldridge   
laurence        chevaleyre  endriss  estivie    maudet        
the above discussion reveals the existence of a gap  summarized in table     compact
representation and complexity issues for fair division have received very little attention
until now  apart of the recent work  lipton  markakis  mossel    saberi        which
   note that the possibility of money transfers reintroduces divisibility to some extent  considering money
as a particular  and divisible  good 
   consider for example the situation where we have a single item and two agents who both want it  in
that case  any allocation is either efficient but not envy free  when the item is given to one of the two
agents   or envy free but not efficient  if the item is not allocated to anyone  

   

fiefficiency and envy freeness in fair division of indivisible goods

studies approximation schemes for envy freeness  the need for compact representation
arises from the following dilemma  formulated by several social choice theorists  either  a 
allow agents to express any possible preference relation on the set of all subsets of items 
and end up with an exponentially large representation  which actually happens for example 
in the work from herreiner   puppe         or  b  severely restrict the set of expressible
preferences  typically by assuming additive independence between items  and then design
procedures where agents express preferences between single items  these preferences being
then extended to sets of items by assuming additivity  thus giving up the possibility of
expressing preferential dependencies such as complementarity and substitutability effects
among items  this is the path followed by brams et al          brams and king        and
demko and hill         yet  as we advocate in this paper  conciliating conciseness and
expressivity is possible  by means of compact representation

table    computational issues in fair division 
as in most works on fair allocation of indivisible items  we focus on the joint search
for envy freeness and efficiency  the impossibility to guarantee the existence of an efficient
envy free allocation implies that determining whether there exists such an allocation is a
crucial task  since a positive answer leads to choose such an allocation whereas a negative
answer calls for a relaxation of one of the criteria  which has been investigated in few papers
 lipton et al         chevaleyre  endriss    maudet      b  
we consider the problem of determining whether there exists an efficient and envy free
allocation from the point of view of compact representation and computational complexity 
first  since in most cases agents have preferential dependencies  or synergies  between
goods  we raise the issue of how a fair division problem of indivisible goods should be
expressed  we focus first in the simple case where agents have dichotomous preferences 
that is  they simply express a partition between satisfactory and unsatisfactory shares  the
interest of such a restriction is that in spite of the expressivity loss it imposes  it will be
shown to be no less complex than the general case  while being much simpler to expose 
dichotomous preferences have been considered before in social choice contexts  such as by
bogomolnaia  moulin  and stong        in a fair division context  and of course in approval
voting  brams   fishburn         where every voter specifies a dichotomous preference on
the set of candidates  the most natural representation of a dichotomous preference  with
preferential dependencies between formulae  otherwise the problem is trivial  is by a single
   quoting from the work of brams et al          herreiner and puppe       assume that each person has a
linear preference order in  b   this allows for complementarity and substitutability effects among items
       in view of interdependencies that may beset subset evaluations        the procedures of herreiner
and puppe offer a creative way of dealing with subset preference  on the other hand  the sheer number
of subsets  more than a million when n       and their presumption of clear preference between subsets 
could detract from the practicability of their procedures

propositional formula  where variables correspond to goods  expressing envy freeness and
efficiency within this logical representation reveals unexpected connections to nonmonotonic
reasoning  this issue will be addressed in section   
the following sections are devoted to a detailed complexity study of the following problem  given some fair division problem  does there exist an efficient end envy free allocation   the latter problem will be studied for different notions of efficiency and various
restrictions  we start  in sections   and    by assuming that preferences are dichotomous 
and we identify the complexity of the existence of an envy free and pareto efficient allocation  which turns out to be p   complete  then we consider several restrictions of the
latter problem  namely   a  fixing the number of agents to two   b  forcing all agents to
have identical preferences   c  restricting the syntax of the propositional formulae expressing the preferences of the agents  then we study variations of the problem obtained by
replacing pareto efficiency by other notions of efficiency  namely   a  asking for complete
allocations  such that every good is allocated to an agent    b  requiring that a maximum
number of agents be satisfied  in section   we then consider the more general problem
obtained by removing the assumption that preferences are dichotomous  as the problem
then becomes very dependent on the choice of a particular language for compact preference
representation  we pick a particular one  weighted propositional formulae  that extends in
a simple way the pure propositional representation considered in section    and identify the
complexity of the existence of envy free and efficient allocations  again for several notions
of efficiency  finally  in section   we sum up our contributions and discuss related work
and further issues 

   background
in this section we provide some basic concepts and definitions that we will use all along the
paper 
    fair division problems
definition    fair division problem  a fair division problem  is a tuple p   hi  x  ri
where
 i               n   is a set of agents 
 x    x            xp   is a set of indivisible goods 
 r   hr            rn i is a preference profile  where each ri is a reflexive  transitive and
complete relation on  x  
ri is the preference relation of agent i  ari b is alternatively denoted by ri  a  b  or
by a i b  we write a i b  strict preference  for  a i b and not b i a  and a i b
 indifference  for  a i b and b i a  
in addition  ri is said to be monotonic if and only if for all a  b  a  b  x implies
b i a  r   hr            rn i is monotonic if and only if ri is monotonic for every i 
   in the following  we will use indifferently the terms fair division and resource allocation 

   

fiefficiency and envy freeness in fair division of indivisible goods

definition    allocation  an allocation for p   hi  x  ri is a mapping    i   x
such that for all i and j    i   i    j      if for every x  x there exists an i such that
x   i  then  is a complete allocation 
in other words  it is not possible in our framework to give the same good to different
agents at the same time  but it is possible to throw away some goods  in this paper  we
will focus especially on two desirable properties of the allocations  pareto efficiency and
envy freeness 
definition   let      two allocations   dominates    if and only if  a  for all i   i  i
    i  and  b  there exists an i such that  i  i     i    is  pareto   efficient if and only
if there is no    such that    dominates  
definition   an allocation  is envy free if and only if  i  i  j  holds for all i and
all j    i 
    propositional logic
let v be a finite set of propositional variables  lv is the propositional language generated
from v   the usual connectives    and  and the boolean constants   and  in the usual
way   
an interpretation m for lv is an element of  v   i e   a truth assignment to symbols 
for all x  v   x  m  resp  x   m   means that m assigns x to true  resp  to false  
m od      m   v   m      is the set of all models of   the satisfaction relation    is
defined as usual  as well as satisfiability and logical consequence  
a literal is a formula of lv of the form x or of the form x  where x  v   a formula
 is under negative normal form  or nnf  if and only if any negation symbol in  appears
only in literals  any formula can be turned in polynomial time into an equivalent nnf
formula  for instance  a   b  c  is not under nnf but is equivalent to the nnf formula
a   b  c  
a formula is positive if it contains no occurrence of the negation symbol  for instance 
a   b  c  and a   a  b  are not positive  whereas a   b  c  and  a  c    a  b  are 
  and  are considered positive as well 
let   lv   v ar    v is the set of propositional variables appearing in   for
instance  v ar  a  c    a  b      a  b  c  and v ar       
v
lastly  if s                n   is a finite
w set of formulae then s             n is the
conjunction of all formulae of s  and s             n is the disjunction of all formulae
of s 
    computational complexity
in this paper we will refer to some complexity classes located in the polynomial hierarchy 
bh   also referred to as dp  is the class of all languages of the form l   l  where l  is in
np and l  in conp  p    pnp is the class of all languages recognizable by a deterministic
turing machine working in polynomial time using np oracles  likewise  p    npnp   p

   fair division problems with dichotomous preferences  logical
representation
we start by considering in full detail the case where preferences are dichotomous 
definition   ri is dichotomous if and only if there exists a subset goodi of  x such that
for all a  b  x  a i b if and only if a  goodi or b 
  goodi   r   hr            rn i is
dichotomous if and only if every ri is dichotomous 
there is an obvious way of representing dichotomous preferences compactly  namely by
a propositional formula i  for each agent i  of the language lx  a propositional symbol
vx for each good x  such that m od     goodi   formally 
definition   let ri be a dichotomous preference on  x   with goodi its associated subset
of  x   and i a propositional formula on the propositional language lx   we say that i
represents ri if and only if m od i     goodi  
clearly 
 preference ri there is a formula i representing ri   i  
vfor any dichotomous

example   x    a  b  c  and goodi     a  b    b  c    note that ri is not monotonic 
then i    a  b  c    a  b  c  represents ri   so does  i   b    a  c    a  c   
which is logically equivalent to  
an easy but yet useful result 
proposition   let ri be a dichotomous preference on  x   the following statements are
equivalent 
   ri is monotonic 
   goodi is upward closed  that is  a  goodi and b  a imply b  goodi  
   ri is representable by a positive propositional formula 
proof           suppose ri is monotonic  and let a  goodi and b  a  then we must have
b i a  and therefore b  goodi  since a  goodi   
          suppose that goodi is upward closed 
and consider
 v the set
 min  goodi   of all inclusionw
minimal sets in goodi   then the formula i   amin  goodi  
xa vx represents ri for the following
reasons  for each b  goodi   there is a set a  min  goodi   such that a  b  thus the corresponding
conjunction in i is satisfied  then i is satisfied  conversely  for each set b   goodi   there is no
a  min  goodi   such that a  b  therefore  none of the terms in i is satisfied  then i is not
satisfied  moreover  i is clearly a positive propositional formula 
          suppose that ri is representable by a positive propositional formula i   and let a and
b be two sets of items such that a  b  if a   goodi then clearly b i a  if a  goodi   then
a  m od i    since i is positive  then b  m od i   also  therefore b  goodi   and finally b i a 


   

fiefficiency and envy freeness in fair division of indivisible goods

from now on  we assume that allocation problems p are represented in propositional
form  namely  instead of i  x and r we only specify h            n i  i and x are obviously
determined from h            n i  in the following  we will also write the propositional variables
corresponding to the items x instead of vx for short  since it is often unambiguous 
let p   h            n i be an allocation problem with dichotomous preferences  then for
each i  n   we rewrite i into i obtained from i by replacing every variable x by the
new symbol xi   for instance  if     a   b  c  and     a  d then     a    b   c    and
    a   d   
example   consider the following allocation problem      a   b  c       a and
    ab  therefore i             and x    a  b  c    all the formulae are positive  therefore
preferences are monotonic  for instance  good  is the set composed of all supersets of  a 
and of all supersets of  b  c   then we have
    a    b   c    
    a   
    a   b 
for all i  n   let xi    xi   x  x   an allocation for a standard allocation problem
p corresponds to a model of v   x          xn satisfying at most one xi for each x  x 
in other terms  there is a bijective mapping
the set of possible allocations and the
v between
v
models of the following formula  p   xx i  j  xi  xj   
v
if allocation are required to be complete  then p is replaced by c
p   p  xx  x  
       xn    the rest is unchanged 
let v    xi   i              n  x  x   any interpretation m of m od p   is such that
it is never the case that xi and xj are simultaneously true for i    j  therefore we can map
m  m od p   to an allocation simply defined by  i     x   m    xi    this mapping is
obviously bijective  we will write f    the model of m od p   corresponding to allocation
  and of course f    m   the allocation corresponding to an interpretation m of m od p   
example    continued  for the allocation problem of example    we have 
p    a   a      a   a      a   a   
  b   b      b   b      b   b   
  c   c      c   c      c   c   
the interpretation m such that m only sets a    b    and c  to true is clearly a model
of p   it corresponds to the allocation f    m       with        a  c          and
       c  
    envy freeness
we now show how the search for an envy free allocation can be mapped to a model finding
problem  let j i be the formula obtained from i by substituting every symbol xi in i
by xj   for instance  if     a    b   c    then       a    b   c     notice that obviously 
we have i i   i  
we first give the following lemma  which is easy but yet useful 
   

fibouveret   lang

lemma   for all i  j   j   goodi if and only if f       j i  
in particular  when i   j we have  i   goodi if and only if f       i  
proof by definition of f    j   goodi if and only if  x   f       xj    goodi   that is   x   f      
xj      i   the latter relation is equivalent to  xi   f       xj      i   and finally to  xj   f      
xj      j i by definition of j i   from which we can deduce the result 


using this lemma  we can now map the envy freeness property to the satisfiability of a
logical formula 
proposition   let p   h            n i be an allocation problem with dichotomous preferences under propositional form  and the formulae j i and mapping f as defined above 
let



 
 
i    
p  
j i
i       n

j  i

then  is envy free if and only if f       p  
proof let  be an allocation   is not envy free if and only if there is a pair  i  j   with i    j such
that  j  i  i   that is  j   goodi and  i    goodi   which is in turn equivalent to f       j i

and f        i by lemma    therefore  is envy free if and only if f       p  

the intuitive meaning of this result is that an allocation  is envy free if and only if 
for every agent i  either i is satisfied by her share  i   or she is not but she envies no one 
that is  for every j  she would not be satisfied by js share either 
the search for envy free allocations can thus be reduced to a model finding problem 
 f    m     m    p  p   is the set of envy free allocations for p  note that  importantly 
p  p has a polynomial size  precisely  quadratic  in the size of the input data 
the problem of existence of an envy free allocation without any other property is not
very interesting  because such an allocation always exists   it suffices to consider the allocation that gives an empty share to everyone  however 
 the problem of deciding whether there exists an envy free allocation satisfying some
property expressible by a polynomial size formula  e g  completeness  can be reduced
to a satisfiability problem 
 the problem of finding  resp  counting  all envy free allocations comes down to the
problem of finding  resp  counting  all models of p  p  
example    continued  for the allocation problem of example    we have 
p  

  a    b   c        a    b   c       a    b   c      
 a    a   a    
  a   b       a   b      a   b     

m od p  p       c      c    b      c    b      c      b      c       
there are therefore   envy free allocations  namely  c        c    b      c  b      c    
     b        c  and         note that none of them is complete 
   

fiefficiency and envy freeness in fair division of indivisible goods

    efficient allocations
similarly as for the envy freeness property  pareto efficiency can be expressed as a logical
property  the logical expression of this property requires the definition of a maximal consistent subset of a set of formulae 
definition   let                 m   be a set of formulae
and  be a formula  s   is a
v
maximal  consistent subset of vif and only if  a  s   is consistent and  b  there is
no s   such that s  s     and s     is consistent  let m axcons     be the set of
all maximal  consistent subsets of   moreover  we will write m axcons   the set of all
maximal consistent subsets of   that is  the set m axcons      
proposition   let p   h            n i an allocation problem  let p                n   
then  is pareto efficient for p if and only if  i   f       i   is a maximal p  consistent
subset of p  
proof let  be an allocation  let sat   be the set of agents satisfied by   that is  by lemma

   i by definition v
the set  i   f       i    for all i  sat

sat    therefore  if  is pareto dominated there is a consistent subset s  p  corresponding
to
v
 i   f          i    such that  i   f       i    s  moreover  since    is an allocation  s  p is

conversely 
 i   f       i    s and s  p is consistent  and m be

a model of s  p   by definition     f  m   is a well defined allocation  and     i   goodi for all
i  s  since  i   f       i    s  we have sat        sat    therefore  is pareto dominated  

this simple result suggests that efficient allocations can be computed from the logical
expression p of the problem  namely  by computing the maximal
p  consistent subsets of
v
p   call them  s            sq    then for each si   let mi   m od  si p   and let m   qi   mi  
then f    m   is the set of all efficient allocations for p   note that there are in general
exponentially many maximal p  consistent subsets of p  and therefore exponentially many
efficient allocations   this can be tempered by  a  there are many practical cases where
the number of maximal consistent subsets is small   b  it is generally not asked to look for
all efficient allocations  if we look for just one  then this can be done by computing one
maximal p  consistent subset of p  
example    continued  the maximal
p  consistent subsets of p are s   v         
v




s             and s             
s  vp has only one model   b    c    a    
s    p
has two models   a    b    and  b    c    a     s   p has one model   a    b     therefore the
four efficient allocations for p are  bc  a      a    b    bc    a  and    a  b   none of them
is envy free 
    efficient and envy free allocations
we are now in position of putting things together  since envy free allocations correspond to
the models of p and efficient allocations to the models of maximal p  consistent subsets
of p   the existence of an efficient and envy free  eef  allocation is equivalent to
v the
following condition  there exists a maximal p  consistent subset s of p such that s

p p is consistent  in this case  the models of the latter formula are the eef allocations 
interestingly  this is an instance of a well known problem in nonmonotonic reasoning 
definition   a supernormal default theory  is a pair d   h  i with                 m   
where             m and  are propositional formulae  a propositional formula  is a skeptical

terms  s     p   moreover 
v s is a maximal p  consistent subset of p by proposition    thus
s  m axcons p   p    and s  p     p   which implies hp   p i    p by definition of     

there is a set s  m axcons p   p   such that

s  p v
p has a model m   by proposition    f    m   is a pareto efficient allocation  since m is
a model of s  p    and by proposition    f    m   is envy free  since m is a model of p   


this somewhat unexpected connection to nonmonotonic reasoning
has several impliv
cations  first  eef allocations correspond to the models of
s  p  p for s 
m axcons p   p    however  m axcons p   p   may be exponentially large  which argues for avoiding to start computing efficient allocations and then filtering out those that
are not envy free  but rather compute eef allocations in a single step  using default reasoning algorithms  thus  fair division may benefit from computational work in default logic
and connected domains such as belief revision and answer set programming  baral

priorities  correspond to alternative efficiency criteria in allocation problems 

   allocation problems with dichotomous preferences  complexity
we will study in this section the complexity of the problem of the existence of an eef
allocation and some of its restrictions  in the case where preferences are dichotomous  for
several notions of efficiency 
    complexity of the general problem
it is known that skeptical inference is p   complete  gottlob         now  after proposition
   the problem of the existence of an eef allocation can be reduced to the complement of
a skeptical inference problem  which immediately tells that it is in p    less obviously  we
now show that it is complete for this class  even if preferences are required to be monotonic 
to prove hardness  we will use the following restriction of the skeptical inference problem 
problem    restricted skeptical inference  rsi 
instance  a set of propositional formulae                 n

fiefficiency and envy freeness in fair division of indivisible goods

proposition   the problem rsi is p   complete 
proof membership to p  comes easily from the fact that the problem rsi is a restriction of the
skeptical inference problem  where the formula  to infer is simply     hardness comes from the fact
that from any instance h    i of the skeptical inference problem  we have h  i    if and only if
h      i     if and only if h                    n      i     if and only if all maximal
 consistent subsets of                n   contain   which is an instance of rsi 


proposition   the problem eef existence of determining whether there exists an efficient and envy free allocation for a given problem p with monotonic  dichotomous preferences under logical form is p   complete 
we show hardness by the following reduction from rsi  the complement problem of rsi 
that is  is there one maximal consistent subset of  that does not contain      to eef
existence  given any finite set  of propositional formulae  let v   v ar   be the set
of propositional symbols appearing in   and let p     hi  x  p   i be the following
instance of eef existence 
   i               n      
   x    v i  v  v   i      n    v i  v  v   i      n    xi  i      n        y  
   for each i              n  let i be obtained from i by the following sequence of operations 
 i  put i into nnf form  let i  be the result    ii  for every v  v   replace  in i   
each  positive  occurrence of v by v i and each occurrence of v by v i   let i be the
formula obtained  then

given some allocation   let now r be defined by r  i     i    i   then
   r is regular

   if  is envy free then r is envy free 
proof     is obvious  for all i  the goods outside  i  do not have any influence on the satisfaction
of i  since they do not appear in i    therefore r  i  i  i   from which     follows  the formulae
i being positive  the preference relations i are monotonic  therefore  j  i r  j  holds for all i  j 
now  if  is envy free then for all i  j we have  i  i  j   therefore r  i  i  i  i  j  i r  j 
and therefore r is envy free  from which     follows

   n     can only envy   
              n envy no one 
   n     can only envy n     
   n     can only envy n     
proof first  note that for any i  j    i  i envies j if and only if  i     i and  j     i  
   let i     and j              n  n       if   envies j  then x    j    being regular  x     j  
therefore i cannot envy j 
   since n         the same holds for agent n     
   let i              n  and j    i  if i envies j then  j     i  xi   which is impossible because
xi    j   due to the regularity of

lemma   let  be a regular allocation satisfying n     and n     and leaving   and n    
unsatisfied  let m    be the interpretation on v obtained from  by  for all v  v

n     receives v             v n   then  is efficient and envy free only if m           
proof let  be a regular allocation satisfying n     and n      since  satisfies n      y   n      
now   satisfies n     without giving her y  therefore  for any v  n     receives either all the v i s or all
the v i s  this shows that our definition of m    is well founded 
now assume that  is efficient and envy free  and suppose that m           one s

other one envying her  it contradicts the envy freeness of   thus proving that m

then 
   m is a well defined and regular allocation satisfying n     and n     
   m  m     m  m  m   is obtained from m as in lemma    
   for any i             n  m satisfies i if and only if m    i  
   m is efficient if and only if m satisfies a maximal consistent subset of  
proof
   one can easily check that m does not give the same good to more than one individual 
and that m can only give to each agent i a set of items that are in  i   therefore it is a
well defined and regular allocation  this allocation obviously satisfies n     and n     
   if m    v then m  n      contains  v i   i              n  and therefore m  m      v  the case
m    v is similar 
   let i             n  since m gives xi to i  m satisfies i if and only if f  m  i      i   which is
equivalent to m    i  
   from point     i   m satisfies i     i   m    i     n      n       obviously  n     is not
satisfied   now  since preferences are dichotomous  an allocation  is efficient if and only if the
set of individuals it satisfies is maximal with respect to inclusion  therefore  m is efficient if
and only if m satisfies a maximal consistent subset of  


lemma   let  be a regular and efficient allocation satisfying n     and n      then m   
satisfies a maximal consistent subset of  
proof  is regular and satisfies n   and n    therefore obviously  n       y  and by lemma   m   
is well defined  we will now consider the allocation m      defined from  like in the previous lemmas 
we have m     n         xn       v i  m       v    v i  m       v     xn       v i   v             v n   
 n         v i   v             v n     n        since n     is satisfied by    n      must contain  xn     
from what we assert that m     n        n      
let i              n   since  is regular  we have  i    i   since m    is a complete allocation by
definition  and regular by lemma     i   m     i   m     n       since m     n        n      we
have  i   m     i    n       and thus  i   m     i    n        being an allocation  we have
of course  i    n          from what follows  i   m     i  
 being regular  we have     n         n     since        n     the latter inclusion
comes down to       n            now  we have      m         m     n       m     n      for
similar reasons as for i              n   which  together with m     n      n    and m     n       
comes down to      m          n       and  with       n          we deduce the inclusion
      n       m        
we can now prove that m    is efficient  since preferences are monotonic  all individuals but n    
satisfied by  are satisfied by    as well  since i    n       i   m     i   
 if n     was not satisfied by   then immediately we deduce that m    is efficient 
 if n     was satisfied by   suppose that m    is not efficient  in that case  there is an allocation
   such that i  m    satisfies i implies    satisfies i and there is a particular j      such that   
satisfies j and m    does not satisfy j  clearly     satisfies    since m    does   thus j    n    
 satisfying simultaneously   and n     is impossible   consider the allocation     deduced from
   just from swapping the shares of   and n      we have  for all i              n        satisfies i
implies m    satisfies i implies    satisfies i implies     satisfies i  we also have  satisfies n    
and does not satisfy    which is the same for       thus  satisfies i implies     satisfies i for all
i  moreover      satisfies j              n       the same j as above  while m    does not  and
therefore neither does   it proves that  is pareto dominated  which is contradictory with the
hypotheses

therefore m    is efficient  from which we conclude  together with lemma    point     that m   
satisfies a maximal consistent subset of  


lemma   any envy free and efficient allocation for p   satisfies n     and n      and
leaves   and n     unsatisfied 
proof suppose that  does not satisfy n      then y    n       now  if y   n      then n     envies
n      if y    n      then  is not efficient because giving y to n     would satisfy n     and thus lead
to a better allocation than  
now  suppose  does not satisfy n      that is  y    n       if y   n      then n     envies n     
if y    n      then again   is not efficient because giving y to n     would satisfy n     and thus lead
to a better allocation than  
concerning agents   and n      one can notice that since they have identical preferences  any
envy free allocation must either satisfy them both  or leave them both unsatisfied  since they cannot
be simultaneously satisfied  because of x     any envy free allocation leaves them both unsatisfied  

lemma   if there exists an eef allocation  then there exists a maximal consistent subset
of  that does not contain    
proof let  be an efficient and envy free allocation  by lemma    r is regular  efficient and envyfree  by lemma    r satisfies n     and n     and leaves   and n     unsatisfied  then by lemma   
m  r   satisfies a maximal consistent subset of   and by lemma    m  r           therefore  i 
   m  r      i   is a maximal consistent subset of  and does not contain    


lemma   if there exists a maximal consistent subset of  that does not contain   then
there exists an eef allocation 
proof assume that
v there exists a maximal consistent subset s of  that does not contain     and let
m be a model of s  by point   of lemma    m is efficient 
by point   of lemma    m is regular  then by lemma    m is envy free if and only if  i    does
not envy n       ii  n     does not envy    iii  n     does not envy n     and  iv  n     does not envy
n      by definition of m   m does not satisfy n      hence  i  holds  by point   of lemma    m      
implies that m does not satisfy    therefore  ii  holds as well  and finally  by point   of lemma    n    
and n     are satisfied by m   thus  iii  and  iv  also hold  therefore m is envy free 


we are now in position of putting things together and proving proposition   
proof  proposition    from lemmas   and    the existence of a maximal consistent subset of  that
does not contain   and the existence of an efficient and envy free allocation for p   are equivalent 
clearly  p   is computed in polynomial time  therefore  p is a polynomial reduction from rsi to eef
existence  which shows that the latter problem is p   hard  and therefore p   complete 


as a corollary  this p   completeness result holds for general  not necessarily monotonic 
dichotomous preferences 
corollary   eef existence for general  dichotomous preference under logical form is p  complete 
    restrictions on the language
as a consequence of this high complexity  it is worth studying restrictions and variants of
the latter problem for which complexity may fall down  we will investigate three kind of
intuitive restrictions of the eef existence problem  defined by 
 fixing the number of agents  and especially  restricting the problem to the case where
there are only   agents 
   

fiefficiency and envy freeness in fair division of indivisible goods

 forcing the agents to have identical preferences 
 restricting the syntax of the agents goals  by limiting their expression to some subclasses of propositional formulae  e g  clauses  cubes          
contrary to the general eef existence problem  the complexity of these restrictions
may be sensitive to whether the preferences are monotonic or not 
      identical preferences
we start by considering identical dichotomous preference profiles  that is  all agents have
the same preference  i e  the same formula  
proposition   eef existence with n identical dichotomous  monotonic preferences is
np complete  this result holds even for a fixed number of agents n    
proof if preferences are identical  an envy free allocation satisfies either all agents or none  now  if
preferences are monotonic  it is always possible to satisfy at least one agent  by giving her all the items  
therefore  an allocation is eef if and only if it satisfies all the agents  clearly  it can be checked in
polynomial time that a given allocation satisfies all agents  hence membership to np 
hardness comes from an simple reduction from set splitting 
problem    set splitting
instance  a collection c    x            xn   of subsets of a finite set s 
question  is there a partition hs    s  i of s such that no subset in c is entirely contained in either
s  or s   
given an instance hc  si of set splitting  let p c  s  be the following eef existence instance 
agents 
objects 
preferences

v

v
w
        xi c axi x a   and as usual k   xi c axi xk  a    each agent
wants at least one object from each set 

it is easy to see that if there is a set splitting hs    s  i of hc  si  it is possible to find an allocation
that satisfy the two agents  by giving them respectively x s    and x s     conversely  suppose that
there is an efficient and envy free allocation   then this allocation must satisfy the two agents  let
 
hs    s  i   hx        
wx      i  suppose that there is an xi  c such that xi  s  or xi  s   say
e g xi  s     then axi x   a  is false  thus making   false  which is contradictory with the initial
hypothesis  therefore hs    s  i is a set splitting of hc  si 
this is clearly a polynomial time reduction  hence np hardness of eef existence with   agents
having identical dichotomous and monotonic preferences 


unlike proposition    proposition   is sensitive to whether preferences are required to
be monotonic or not 
proposition   eef existence with n identical dichotomous preferences is cobh   complete 
this result holds even for a fixed number of agents n    
proof if preferences are identical  an envy free allocation satisfies either all agents or none  let  be
the formula representing one agents preferences  of course  is identical for all the agents   if  is
satisfiable then it is possible to satisfy at least one agent  in that case  an allocation  is eef if and
only if  satisfies all the agents  if  is not satisfiable  then every allocation is eef  therefore  there
exists an eef allocation if and only if                 n is satisfiable or  is unsatisfiable  this shows
membership to cobh   
hardness comes from a simple reduction from sat or unsat  let i   h  i be a pair of propositional formulae  assumed w l o g  to have no variables in common  we map i to the following allocation
problem

  objects v and v   per propositional variable v appearing in   one object w per propositional variable w appearing in   and one object y 
              y    where   denotes the formula  where each variable v has
been replaced by v    

   suppose that  is not satisfiable  but  is  corresponding to a negative instance of sat orunsat   then it is possible to satisfy at least one agent by giving her y and the objects v
corresponding to the variables assigned to true in the model of   however it is not possible to
satisfy simultaneously the second agent because  is unsatisfiable  and by the way so is      and
the first agent has already taken y  therefore in that case there is no eef allocation 
   suppose now that  is satisfiable or  is unsatisfiable  corresponding to a positive instance of
sat or unsat   there are two cases 
  is satisfiable  in that case  no matter whether  is satisfiable or not  it is possible to satisfy
the two agents by satisfying simultaneously  for the first one and   for the second one 
consequently there is an eef allocation 
  and  are both unsatisfiable  recall that the case  unsatisfiable and  satisfiable is covered
by point     in that case it is clearly impossible to satisfy any agent  in that case  the empty
allocation is efficient and envy free 
therefore there is an eef allocation if and only if  is satisfiable or  is unsatisfiable  which proves
the proposition 


      two agents
note that for the two previous results  the hardness result holds for any fixed number of
agents       things are different with proposition    for which hardness does not hold
when n is fixed  namely  we have the following results 
proposition   eef existence for two agents with monotonic dichotomous preferences is
np complete 
proof hardness is a corollary of proposition    membership is obtained as follows  let h      i be the
preference profile  where       are both positive  the formulae    and the formulae i are defined
as earlier  see section     as well as f    for all allocation   now  is efficient if and only if either  a 
it satisfies both agents  or  b  it satisfies only one agent  and        is unsatisfiable  or  c  it is
impossible to satisfy even one agent  i e   both   and   are unsatisfiable   c  is impossible because
      are positive  now   is envy free if and only if m      therefore   is eef if and only if  a 
m           or  b  m                 thus  there exists an eef allocation if and only if
                         is satisfiable  hence membership to np 


proposition    eef existence for   agents with dichotomous preferences is cobh  complete 
proof membership comes from the following reduction to sat or unsat  consider an instance p of
the eef problem with   agents having respectively the preferences   and     we translate this instance
to an instance h     i of sat or unsat defined as follows   is defined as usual                
                 and               we will prove that  is satisfiable or    is unsatisfiable if
and only if there is an eef allocation for p 
   suppose that  is not satisfiable  but    is  since  is not satisfiable  no valid allocation can
satisfy both agents  because        is not satisfiable   since    is satisfiable  it is possible
to satisfy at least one agent  because      is satisfiable   we can then deduce that every
efficient allocation satisfies exactly one agent  since                  is not satisfiable

satisfying the agent    the case is similar with agent     f           and thus f            
since f           because it is impossible to satisfy both agents   f         and thus  is not
envy free  hence every efficient allocation raises envy  there is no eef allocation 
   suppose now that  is satisfiable or    is not satisfiable 
    is not satisfiable  this case is easy because it is not possible to satisfy even one agent 
therefore every allocation is efficient and envy free 
  and  are both satisfiable  there are two cases 
        is satisfiable  in this case  there is an allocation  corresponding to the model
of          that satisfies both agents  this allocation is clearly eef 
     is satisfiable but     is not satisfiable  the case with     is similar  
in that case it is not possible to satisfy both agents  however  since  is satisfiable  it
is possible to satisfy at least one  and  like in point    every efficient allocation satisfies
exactly one agent  since      is satisfiable  there is a model of   which is not
a model of     the allocation corresponding to this model is such that the agent   is
satisfied and not the agent    but the latter agent cannot envy the first one 
it finally proves the correctness of the reduction  which is clearly polynomial 
hardness comes directly from proposition   



      restriction on the propositional language
in the previous results  we made no specific assumptions on the formulae expressing the
agents preferences  except  sometimes  monotonicity  however  if we restrict the set of possible propositional formulae  it can decrease the complexity of the eef existence problem 
we investigate first two natural restrictions on the propositional language  in the first case
we restrict the formulae to the set of clauses  disjunctions of literals   in the second case
the preferences are expressed using cubes only  conjunctions of literals   these restrictions
match two different kinds of real world problems 
 the case  where the agents preferences are represented by clauses  corresponds to the
kind of problems where each agent only wants one single object of a certain class  one
can consider for example a set of patients all waiting for a kidney transplant  each
patient only needs one kidney  but several ones may be compatible 
 the case  where the agents preferences are represented by cubes  corresponds to the
kind of problems where each agent needs a single bundle of objects  it is typical from
the kind of problems where the agents build the object they want from a set of basic
material  or virtual  components  the set of objects stand for the basic components 
and the cube of one agent stands for the complete device she wants 
making one of these two assumptions actually decreases the complexity of the eef existence problem  it even renders it tractable in the case of clauses of objects 
proposition    eef existence for agents having dichotomous preferences restricted to
clauses of objects can be solved in polynomial time 
proof we will first make two additional assumptions and prove that the complexity of the problem
does not decrease under these two assumptions      we suppose first that the agents preferences are
monotonic  if one agent has non monotonic preferences  it means that there is one negative literal in
her clause  giving her an empty share will satisfy her without spoiling another agent  thus she can be
safely removed from the problem      we also suppose that each agent wants at least one object  if one

   

fibouveret   lang

agent has an empty clause as her goal  it means that no matter what she gets  she cannot be satisfied 
thus she can also be safely removed from the problem  in the rest of the proof  we will only consider
problems that verify the assumptions     and     
the proof is based on the following result  when the agents preferences are disjunction of objects
under assumptions     and      an allocation is pareto efficient and envy free if and only if it satisfies
every agent  the implication  is immediate  to prove the implication  we need to notice that an
agent is satisfied if and only if she receives at least one object of her clause  now take an allocation 
such that there is an agent i which is not satisfied by   then either it is possible to satisfy her without
spoiling another agent  because one object of her clause is given to an agent that does not want it  or
that is already satisfied by another agent  in that case  is not pareto efficient  or it is not possible to
do so because all the objects of agent is disjunction have been given to some other agents that truly
want them  in that case  the agent i envies these other agents  and  is thus not envy free 
therefore  finding a pareto efficient and envy free allocation here comes down to finding an allocation that gives to each agent one object that she wants  thus  an instance p of the eef existence
problem can be reduced to a maximal matching problem  in a bipartite graph gp where there is one
node per agent on one side  and one node per object on the other side  and where there is an edge
between an agent node i and an object node o if and only if o is in the agent is clause  it can be easily
checked that there is a pareto efficient and envy free allocation if and only if there is a matching of size
n in gp   the latter problem can be solved in time o nm   ford   fulkerson         where m is the
size of the biggest disjunction 


now we investigate the case where the agents preferences are cubes of objects  not
very surprisingly  this case is harder that the previous one  but remains in np 
proposition    eef existence for agents having dichotomous preferences restricted to
cubes of objects is np complete  the same result holds if we require the preferences to be
monotonic 
proof the proof is organized as follows  we will first prove membership to np without any assumption
on the monotonicity of the preferences  then we will show hardness in the monotonic case 
we first introduce some additional notations  in the following  we will denote by obj    i   resp 

obj  i   the set of objects appearing as positive  resp  negative  literals in agent is cube  let 
be an allocation   will be said minimally regular if i  either  i    obj    i  or  i      for a
given allocation   we will denote by m r its corresponding minimally regular allocation  that is  the
allocation such that for all i  m r  i     if obj    i     i   and m r  i    obj    i  if obj    i    i  
 
we will also write
s sat   the set of agents satisfied by   sat m r      i   m r  i    obj  i     and
allocated     ii  i   the set of objects allocated to an agent  
we have the following result 
lemma    let  be an allocation  we have 
 m r is minimally regular 
 sat    sat m r   
 if  is pareto efficient  then m r is also pareto efficient 
proof
 for all agent i  m r  i     or m r  i    obj    i  by definition of m r   therefore
m r is minimally regular 
 let  be an allocation  and let i be an agent  if i is satisfied by   then obj    i    i  and
obj   i    i      by definition of m r   we have m r  i    obj    i   and thus we still have
obj    i    i  and obj   i    i      therefore the agent i is still satisfied by m r   it
proves that sat    sat m r   
 suppose that  is pareto efficient  and suppose that there is a    that pareto dominates
m r   then we have sat    sat m r     sat       which contradicts the fact that  is
pareto efficient  it proves the third point 


   

fiefficiency and envy freeness in fair division of indivisible goods

lemma    a minimally regular allocation m r is pareto efficient if and only if there is no i such
that  a  i   sat m r   and  b  obj    i   allocated m r      
proof let m r be a minimally regular allocation  and suppose that there is some i such that
i   sat m r   and obj    i   x   allocated m r    then the allocation    such that j    i
    j    m r  j  and     i    obj    i  is well defined  since obj    i  is among the set of unallocated
objects for m r    and pareto dominates m r   since all the agents satisfied by m r are also satisfied
by      and i is now satisfied by    whereas she was not by m r  
conversely  suppose that m r is not pareto efficient  and let    be a pareto efficient alloca 
tion that pareto dominates m r   then by lemma     m
r is pareto efficient  and also pareto 
dominates m r   for all i  sat m r    m r  i    m r  i    obj    i  since these two allocations are
 
both minimally regular  and each agent satisfied by m r is also satisfied by s
m r   moreover  there
 
 
is a j   sat m r   such that m r  j    obj  j   since allocated m r     isat m r   obj    i 
s
 
 
 
and since m
r  j   x  
isat m r   obj  i   we have obj  j   x   allocated m r    which
finally proves the lemma 

the two lemmas provide a procedure to check if a given allocation  is pareto efficient  first
compute m r  which can be done in polynomial time   by lemma     sat    sat m r    if the
inclusion is strict  that is  sat     sat m r     then obviously  is not pareto efficient since m r
pareto dominates it  otherwise  checking if  is pareto efficient comes down to checking if m r is
pareto efficient  which comes down  according to lemma     to n set inclusion tests  now  checking if
 is envy free is still polynomial  hence the problem is in np 
we will now prove the hardness of the problem by focusing on monotonic preferences  that is  such
that obj   i     for all i   for the hardness proof  we will need a few additional lemmas 
lemma    let  be an allocation and suppose that the agents have monotonic preferences  if  is
envy free then m r is envy free 
proof let  be an allocation  by lemma     sat    sat m r    conversely  let i  sat m r   
we have m r  i    i   which proves that i  sat    because we deal with monotonic preferences 
now suppose that i envies j in m r   then i is not satisfied by m r   and thus neither satisfied by
  since m r  j    j  and agent is preferences are monotonic  i will still envy j in   thus if
 is envy free  so is m r  

an important corollary of this lemma is that when we deal with monotonic cubes  the existence of
a pareto efficient and envy free allocation is equivalent to the existence of a minimally regular paretoefficient and envy free allocation  therefore we can restrict our existence problem to the minimally
regular allocations 
lemma    let i and j be two different agents  and still suppose that the agents have monotonic
preferences   then  there exists a minimally regular allocation m r such that i envies j  if and only if
obj    i   obj    j  
proof let m r be a minimally regular allocation  and suppose that i envies j  then obviously
i is not satisfied but j is  hence m r  j    obj    j   since i envies j  we thus have directly
obj    i   obj    j  
conversely  suppose that obj    i   obj    j   then the allocation m r that gives obj    j  to
j and nothing to the other agents is clearly minimally regular  and is also obviously such that i
envies j 

now we introduce the np complete problem that we will use to prove np hardness  in the monotonic
case  
problem    exact cover by   sets  karp       
instance  a set s of size  q  and a collection c   hs            s c  i of   element subsets of s
question  does c contain an exact cover for s  i e  a sub collection c    c such that every element
of s occur in exactly one member of c    
given an instance hs  c   hs            s c  ii of exact cover by   sets  we will assume w l o g  that
the si are all different   let p s  c  be the following eef instance 

   

fibouveret   lang

agents 

a set of  c      s  agents i   i   i    with i                 c   and i      c                c   
  s   

objects 

a set of   s  items x   x   x    with x    x            x s    and x      x             x  s    
each pair  xi   x i   corresponding to a different element ai of s 
v
for each agent i  i    i   aj si xj   and for each k               s     c   k   
 c   k   xk  x k  

preferences 

in other words  the first  c  agents preferences correspond to the sets in the collection c  and the last
  s  agents are gathered by pairs  each member of the same pair having the same preferences as the
other member 
since all the si are different and of size    for all i    j  si   sj   and thus obj    i    obj    j  
by definition of the preferences  we also have obj    i    obj    j  for each  i  j   i   i  and for each
 i  j   i   i  as well  hence  by lemma     the only potential source of envy in such an instance
comes from an agent in i  envying her partner  since it is impossible to satisfy the two agents of the
same pair at the same time  an allocation is envy free if and only if it does not satisfy any agent from
i   
by lemma     a minimally regular allocation m r is pareto efficient if and only if there is no i such
that i   sat m r   and obj    i   x   allocated m r    therefore a minimally regular allocation m r
is pareto efficient and envy free if and only if there is no k               s   such that m r   c     k      
 xk   x k   or m r   c     k     xk    x k     and there is no k                s   such that  xk    x k    
x   allocated m r    this last condition comes down to xk    allocated m r    since xk  and x k  must
be allocated together in a minimally regular allocation   finally  m r is pareto efficient and envy free
if
s and only if ks               s    there is an i  i  such that xk  m r  i   that is  if and only if
ii  m r  i   
aj s  xj   
let m r be a minimally regular allocation  then we can define the sub collection g m r   by
g m r      si  c   m r  i    obj    i    the mapping g clearly defines a bijection between the set of
non overlapping
sub collections
s
s
s and the set of minimally regular allocations  and one can notice that
ii  m r  i   
sj g m r  
ak sj  xk   
 
 
let c    csis an exact cover for
s s  then
s g  c   exists
s and is a valid minimally regular allocation 
 
 
we also have ii  g  c   i    sj c ak sj  xk     aj s  xj   because c   is a cover  therefore

g    c     is pareto efficient and envy free by the previous result 
conversely  suppose that there is a minimally regular pareto efficient andsenvy free allocation
m r  
s
then g m r   is a non overlapping sub collection of c  and is such that si g m r   aj si  aj

 aj     xj  m r  i    ii     aj    m r being pareto efficient and envy free  we have

ii  m r  i   
aj s  xj    and hence
xj  m r  i    ii     aj    
xj  xj   aj s   aj     s  it proves
that g m r   is an exact cover for s 
the reduction is clearly polynomial  hence the np hardness 


the previous proof  and especially lemma     sheds the light on the hard case of the
eef existence problem with conjunctive preferences  in an instance of this problem  the
only possible source of envy comes from obj    i   obj    j  when we deal we minimally
regular allocations  in that case  we cannot satisfy j without raising envy from i  now if
obj    i    obj    j   one can remove j from the instance  because if she is satisfied  then
i will envy her  note that this is not true for non monotonic preferences  because one can
give an object to an agent that does not want it to prevent envy from another agent  and
thus we cannot restrict our problem to minimally regular allocations  
if there is no pair  i  j   i    j  such that obj    i    obj    j   then one can remove every
agent i such that there is a j    i such that obj    j    obj    i   after that  it is easy to
see that every minimally regular allocation is envy free  since there is at least one paretoefficient minimally regular allocation  it guarantees the existence of a pareto efficient and
envy free allocation in that case  may the preferences be monotonic or not  more formally 
   

fiefficiency and envy freeness in fair division of indivisible goods

proposition    there always exists an efficient and envy free allocation for an instance
of the eef existence problem with agents having dichotomous preferences restricted to
cubes of objects when the following condition holds 

 i  j   i     i    j   i   j    k such that k    i  k    j and obj    k    obj    i       
of course  there is no equivalence between condition   and the existence of a paretoefficient and envy free allocation    because it may happen that  given two agents i and j
having the same preferences  the satisfaction of one of these two agents is prevented by
another agent k such that obj    i   obj    k       but obj    k    obj    i   this is the
hard case  when two agents i and j have identical preferences  but no agent k is such that
obj    k    obj    i   it may however be possible to prevent i and j from being satisfied
by satisfying another agent k   such that obj    i   obj    k          as the following example
shows          x   x    and     x   x    satisfying the agent   only leads to an efficient
and envy free allocation  whereas the condition   does not hold 
proof  proposition     in the following we will denote by i  the set of all the agents whose preferences are inclusion minimal  that is  i     i    j such that obj    j   obj    i    we will denote by
i  the other agents  i    i   i   
here is a simple procedure for finding a pareto efficient and envy free allocation  greedily select
a maximal set s of agents from i    such that each agent i  s receives obj    i   until it becomes
impossible to select another unsatisfied agent in i    
the allocation  resulting from this procedure is minimally regular  and by lemma    it is clearly
envy free  by definition of i     moreover  suppose there is an i   sat   such that obj    i   x  
allocated    then i   i    since if it was the case  the procedure would have selected her and therefore
she should be satisfied  we have also i   i    because if it was the case  then there is a j  i  such
that obj    j   obj    i   and therefore obj    j   x   allocated    which is impossible for the same
reasons as above  therefore   is also pareto efficient by lemma    


after having investigated two natural restrictions on the propositional language used
for dichotomous preferences  we introduce a more general result  based on the fact that
the hardness result of proposition   is clearly linked to the np completeness of the sat
problem  now what happens if we restrict the expression of preferences to a certain class c
such that sat c  can be solved in polynomial time   in the general case  where no additional
assumption is made on c we cannot say anything more about the complexity of the eef
existence problem than about the complexity of the general problem  however  if c is
also closed by conjunction  the complexity falls down to np 
proposition    let c be a class of propositional formulae closed by conjunction and such
that sat c  is in p  then the eef existence for agents having dichotomous preferences
expressed with formulae from class c is in np 
proof membership to np comes from the fact that  after having non deterministically guessed an
allocation   checking if it is envy free and pareto efficient can be done in polynomial time  given an
allocation  checking if it is envy free can be done in time o nm   where m is the length of the biggest
cnf   just by checking  for each unsatisfied agent  if it would have been satisfied with the share of
another agent  given the set sat   ofvthe agents satisfied by   checking the pareto efficiency of 
comes down to check i  i   sat   if jsati j  i is unsatisfiable  this can be done by making a
linear number of calls to a sat c  oracle  since all the preferences are in c  and since this class is closed
by conjunction  it thus proves that the eef existence with formulae in c is in np 

   otherwise  the proposition    would be false  or we would have proved that p   np 

   

fibouveret   lang

as a corollary  for all classes of propositional formulae such that sat c  is polynomial 
and that contain cubes  the eef existence problem is np complete  this applies for
example to the class of   cnf formulae or to the class of horn clauses 
    alternative efficiency criteria
the main reason for the high complexity of the eef existence problem is that the paretoefficiency of an allocation is hard to check  as a consequence  complexity can decrease if
we choose an alternative notion of efficiency  we investigate here two alternative efficiency
criteria  completeness of the allocation  and maximal number of satisfied agents 
first  we weaken the pareto efficiency by only requiring the allocations to be complete 
unsurprisingly  this makes the complexity fall down to np 
proposition    the problem of deciding whether a complete envy free allocation for agents
with dichotomous preferences exists is np complete  even for   agents with identical preferences 
proof since checking that an allocation is complete can be done in polynomial time  membership to
np is straightforward 
we will prove hardness by a reduction from the sat problem  let  be a propositional formula  we
create the following instance of the resource allocation problem   we map each propositional variable
of  to a different object and we add another object y   the two agents have the same preferences 
represented by the formula   y  obviously  every complete allocation satisfies at least one agent  the
one who receives y   if  is satisfiable  it is possible to satisfy the other agent as well with a share
that corresponds to a model of   thus in this case there exists a complete and envy free allocation 
conversely  suppose that there exists a complete and envy free allocation  then one of the two agents
must be satisfied thanks to   since y cannot be given to both agents   hence proving that  is satisfiable 


notice that the hardness proof above is no longer valid if we require preferences to be
monotonic  as an anonymous referee pointed out  it can be proved by a reduction from
exact cover by   sets that the result holds if we require monotonicity  while relaxing
the restriction on the number of agents  however  we do not know if np hardness holds for
two agents with monotonic preferences  we conjecture it does  
secondly  we can think of looking for cardinality maximal subsets of satisfied agents 
instead of inclusion maximal subsets like pareto efficiency does 
proposition    the problem of deciding whether an envy free allocation satisfying a maximal number of agents with monotonic dichotomous preferences exists is p   complete 
proof checking whether there exists an envy free allocation satisfying at least k agents is in np 
therefore  the maximal number of agents who can be satisfied simultaneously can be computed by
dichotomy within log n np oracles  it then suffices  after this step is done  to guess an allocation and
check that it is envy free and satisfies a maximal number of agents  adding just one more np oracle 
hence the membership to p   
hardness is obtained by a reduction from the following problem   
problem    max index satodd  wagner       
instance  a sequence of propositional formulae h            n i such that  i is unsatisfiable    i  
is unsatisfiable  
question  is the maximum index i such that i is satisfiable an odd number  
   this problem is referred to several times in the literature  but it does not seem to have a name 

   

fiefficiency and envy freeness in fair division of indivisible goods

first notice that the complexity of the latter problem does not decrease under the following assumptions 
 n is even  if it is not  we can just add the  formula at the end of the sequence  
 the sets of propositional variables of the formulae i are pairwise disjoint  if two formulae i and
i   share some variables  just transform each variable v of say i into a copy v     it will not
change the  un satisfiability of i but the set of propositional variables of i and i   will now
be disjoint  
let h            n i be an instance of max index satodd with the two additional latter assumptions 
and let vi denote the set of propositional variables appearing in i   we translate this instance to the
following instance p             n   
agents 
objects 
preferences 

 n agents   i     i         in  n   where the group i i   i contains the four agents
  i      i      i      i  
we create for each v  vi  for each i              n   four objects xv   xv   yv   yv   and we
add n dummy objects dk  k              n   
for each group i i   i  i              n      the preferences of the agents are 
  i     i       i   d i        i  d i   
v
  i    vv i  v i xv  xv  
v
  i   vv i  v i yv  y v  
where  k is the formula k where v has been replaced by xv  yv   and v has been
replaced by xv  y v  

the proof of the proposition is primarily based on the fact that the problem can be split into n  
subproblems concerning the agents from i i   i  
lemma    we denote by p i the restriction of p             n   to the set of agents i i   i and to the
objects they want  an allocation  will be said to be splittable if i    j   i i   i     i j   j      
the restriction of a splittable allocation  to  i i   i   will be written  i  
there exists an envy free allocation satisfying a maximal number of agents for p             n   if and
only if there exists a splittable allocation  such that i              n      i is envy free and satisfies a
maximal number of agents for p i  
proof first  we restrict our attention to regular allocations  where regular means  like in lemma   
that an allocation gives an object to an agent only if she wants it  this is safe for the same reasons
as in lemma    the existence of an envy free allocation satisfying a maximal number of agents
is equivalent to the existence of a regular envy free allocation satisfying a maximal number of
agents  since the sets vi are pairwise disjoint  two different subproblems p i and p j do not share
any object  and therefore any regular allocation is also splittable 
 
let  be a regular allocation  suppose that there is an allocation  i
for the problem p i that
satisfies more agents than  i   then the splittable allocation made from the sub allocations  j
 
for j    i and  i
is valid  regular  and satisfies more agents than   conversely  suppose that
there is a regular allocation    that satisfies more agents than   then there is at least one i such
 
that strictly more agents from i i   i are satisfied by  i
than by  i   it proves that any regular
allocation  satisfies a maximal number of agents if and only if for each i   i satisfies a maximal
number of agents 
suppose now that  is envy free  then obviously all the  i are as well  conversely  suppose
that all the  i are envy free  then  is envy free  because     no agent can envy another agent
from the same group  because the  i are envy free  and     no agent from a group i can envy an
agent from another group j  since  i i   i     i j   j      

for each interpretation intk of vk   we define the following sets of objects

proof let int i  and int i be two respective interpretations of v i  and v i  
 by definition  f  intk   contains xv or xv for each v  vk   thus int i   int i   i   contains xv
or xv for each v  v i   v i   therefore the agent  i    is satisfied by int i   int i   i     
the same reasoning holds for the agent  i 
 by definition   i  is satisfied by int i  if and only if   i  is satisfied by the interpretation
defined by setting to true all the xv and yv  resp  all the xv and yv   such that int i     v
 resp  int i      v   thus  if int i      i    int i   int i satisfied   i    since it also
satisfies d i    then  i    is satisfied by int i   int i   conversely  if  i    is satisfied by
int i   int i   then obviously   i  must be satisfied by int i   int i  because  i    does
not receive d i    which proves that  i  is satisfied by int i    the same result holds for
 i and the agent  i    

lemma    consider the restricted problem p i  
 if neither  i  nor  i is satisfiable  then for any interpretations int i  and int i of v i  and
v i respectively  int i   int i is envy free and satisfies a maximal number of agents 
 if only  i  is satisfiable  then if m i  is a model of  i    m i   int i satisfies a maximal
number of agents  moreover  there is no envy free allocation satisfying a maximal number of
agents in this case 
 if both  i  and  i are satisfiable  then if m i  and m i are respective models of  i  and
 i   m i   m i satisfies a maximal number of agents and is envy free 
proof suppose that neither  i  nor  i is satisfiable  then any allocation  i satisfying  i   
 resp   i     must be such that there is at least one v  v i   v i such that  xv   xv   yv   yv   
 i   i      resp   i   i       because otherwise one could deduce a model of  i  or  i from
 i   i      resp   i   i       thus any of the agents  i and  i    can be satisfied in this case 
the maximal number of agents it is possible to satisfy is    since every allocation of the form
int i   int i satisfies both agents  i    and  i  it satisfies a maximal number of agents in this
case  it is also obviously envy free  since neither d i nor d i  are in the shares of agents  i   
and  i  and thus the   other agents cannot envy them 
suppose that only  i  is satisfiable  then any allocation satisfying both agents  i    and
 i    must satisfy   i  for one of these two agents  and   i for the other one  because of d i
and d i     since  i is not satisfiable  in that case neither  i    nor  i can be satisfied by  i  
for the same reasons as above  from that we can deduce that it is not possible to satisfy the  
agents  neither is it possible to satisfy   agents with both  i    and  i    satisfied  now consider
the allocation m i   int i   m i  being a model of  i    by lemma     m i   int i satisfies
  agents   i      i    and  i  this allocation is not envy free  but no allocation satisfying a
maximal number of agents can be in this case  because either  i    or  i    remains unsatisfied
in such an allocation  envying her partner  
lastly  suppose that both  i  and  i are satisfiable  and let m i  and m i be their models 
then by lemma     m i   m i satisfies the   agents  thus satisfying a maximal number of agents
and obviously being envy free 


   

fiefficiency and envy freeness in fair division of indivisible goods

we can now conclude the proof  by lemma     there exists an envy free allocation satisfying a
maximal number of agents for p             n   if and only if there exists a splittable allocation  such
that i              n      i is envy free and satisfies a maximal number of agents for p i   by lemma    
there exists an envy free allocation  i satisfying a maximal number of agents for p i if and only if either
none of the two formulae  i  and  i are satisfiable  or both are  now suppose that the maximum
index j such that j is satisfiable is an odd number  say  i      in that case  there is not any envyfree allocation satisfying a maximal number of agents for p i since  i  is satisfiable but  i is not 
conversely  suppose that the maximum index j such that j is satisfiable is an even number  say  i  
in that case  there is an envy free allocation satisfying a maximal number of agents for all p k   since for
each p k either the two formulae  k  and  k are satisfiable  if k  i   or none of them is  if k   i  
we thus have a reduction from the latter problem to the problem of existence of an envy free
allocation satisfying a maximal number of agents  it proves the p   completeness 


   non dichotomous preferences
we will now consider the case where preferences are no longer dichotomous 
    general logical preferences
again  since an explicit description of preferences is exponentially large  the need for a
compact description thereof is clear  many languages exist for succinct representation of
preference  we limit our investigation to the following class of languages 
definition    compact language under logical form  let l be a language representing a set of preference relations over a set of alternatives  x   l will be said to be a compact
language under logical form if and only if  
 a  it is able to express any dichotomous preference as compactly as the previous language
introduced  that is  the language expressing dichotomous preferences in propositional
form can be polynomially reduced to l 
 b  comparing two sets of goods can be done in polynomial time 
these two previous conditions are in practise not very restricting  and are met by many
languages for succinct representation of representation  see for instance the paper by lang
       for a survey of logical languages for compact preference representation  note that
several widely studied representation languages  such as cp nets and other graphical languages  are not under logical form  because they fail to represent preferences expressed
by logical formulas within polynomial space    interestingly  proposition   extends to any
compact representation language under logical form 
corollary   eef existence with monotonic compact preference under logical form is p  complete 
proof the eef existence problem can be solved using the following algorithm 
   non deterministically guess an allocation  
   check that it is envy free 
   check that it is pareto efficient 
   a natural question is the complexity of the fair division problems when preferences are expressed in
these languages  this is left for further study 

   

fibouveret   lang

by condition  b   step two can be done in polynomial time  since it requires at most a quadratic number
of polynomial oracles  by condition  b  also  the problem of checking whether a given allocation is
pareto efficient is in co np  therefore  the previous non deterministic algorithm uses   np oracle  and
runs in polynomial time  hence membership to p   
hardness is a corollary of proposition   together with condition  a  


    numerical preferences under logical form
for the latter result preferences do not have to be numerical since pareto efficiency and
envy freeness are purely ordinal notions  now  if preferences are numerical  which implies
the possibility of intercomparing and aggregating preferences of several agents  then  besides
pareto efficiency  we may consider efficiency based on social welfare functions  we consider
here only the two most classical way of aggregating a collection of utility functions into a
social welfare function 
definition     classical utilitarianism and egalitarianism  given a collection of individual utility functions hu            un i  with for each i  ui    x  z 
 
 the
p classical utilitarian social welfare function is the function defined by sw     
i ui   i   

 the egalitarian social welfare function is the function defined by sw e       mini ui   i   
maximizing the egalitarian social welfare function is often viewed as an alternative criterion of fairness  encoding the rawlsian egalitarian point of view  rawls         however 
as we will see in proposition     egalitarianism  as well as classical utilitarianism  is not
always compatible with envy freeness  the link between these two alternative points of
view about fairness is deeply investigated by brams and king        
since we do not deal anymore with ordinal  or dichotomous  preferences  we have to
define precisely what we will mean by compact representation of numerical preferences  here
we will pick as the basic numerical language one of the most simple compact languages 
consisting in associating numerical weights to propositional formulae  see e g   chevaleyre 
endriss    lang         or  ieong   shoham        in the context of coalitional games 
definition     weighted propositional language  given a set of goods x  the weighted
propositional language associated to x is the set of all possible subsets of lx  z 
given a set of weighted propositional formulae     h    w  i          hr   wr i   the utility
function associated is 

  if s    k
x
u    
 z
  with k  
pr
  otherwise 
s
 
k   wk  k
using this language  preferences are monotonic if all formulae are positive and all weights
are positive 
now  we can define our notion of compact numerical language 
definition     compact numerical language under logical form  let l be a language representing a set of utility functions over a set of alternatives  x   l will be said to
be a compact numerical language under logical form if and only if  
   

fiefficiency and envy freeness in fair division of indivisible goods

 a  it is able to express any utility function as compactly as the weighted propositional
language  that is  the weighted propositional language can be polynomially reduced to
l 
 b  computing the utility of one set of goods can be done in polynomial time 
of course  since a compact numerical language under logical form is also a compact
language under logical form  the complexity result form corollary   still holds  however  it
appears that the complexity of the problem of deciding whether an efficient and envy free
allocation exists decreases when the pareto efficiency is replaced by a weaker notion  the
maximization of one of the two latter social welfare functions 
proposition    given a collection of utility functions on  r given in a compact numerical
language under logical form 
 the problem of deciding whether there exists an envy free allocation among those that
maximize utilitarian social welfare is p   complete  even if n      and even if the
agents have identical preferences 
 the problem of deciding whether there exists an envy free allocation among those that
maximize egalitarian social welfare is p   complete  even if n     
proof for both results  membership comes easily from the fact that the maximum value of social
welfare can be computed by dichotomy over the set of all possible social welfare values  there are
exponentially many  therefore we need a polynomial number of np oracles to do this  after this step
is done  it suffices to guess an allocation and check that it is envy free and that it maximizes social
welfare  adding just one more np oracle 
hardness is obtained in both utilitarian and egalitarian cases by a simple reduction to an instance
of the fair division problem with preferences expressed in the weighted propositional language from the
following problem 
problem    max sat asgeven  wagner       
instance  a propositional formula  in conjunctive normal form  over a set of propositional
variables v    v            vn    and a weight function w over interpretations i   v         
def p
i 
defined by w i   
 
i i vi     
question  is maxm model of  w m   an even number  in other words  is v  falsified in the model of
maximal weight   
we will suppose that the formula  has at least on model m such that m     v    it does not
change the complexity  because if v  is verified in every model of   clearly the answer to the problem
max sat asgeven is no  as a consequence  every instance h  v i without any assumption on  can be
solved by first checking if v    is unsatisfiable  which is a conp complete problem   and then  if
not  by solving the unsat or max sat asgeven problem on an instance that has at least one model
falsifying v   
utilitarian social welfare  from an instance h  v i of max sat asgeven   we create the following
instance p   v   
agents 
objects 
preferences 

  agents 
for each literal vi of   we create two objects xi and x i   except for v    for which only
one object x  is created  and we add two objects y and y    
the agents   and   have identical preferences  and both ask for h   y       
y       n   i  hx   y   i          hxn  y   n  i  hx    y      i          hx n  y      n  i  with  the formula  in which each symbol vi has been replaced by xi   and    the formula  in which
each symbol vi  except v  replaced by x    has been replaced by x i

let  m    m    be a pair of models of   with possibly m    m    such that m      v    then we define
the allocation m   m  by  m   m         y    xi  m     vi   and m   m         y       x i  m     vi   
the proof is based on the following lemma 
lemma    there exists an envy free allocation among those that maximize utilitarian social welfare if
and only if there are two models m  and m  of   possibly m    m    with m      v    such that m   m 
is envy free and maximizes utilitarian social welfare 
proof let  be an allocation maximizing the utilitarian social welfare  let m be a model of
 falsifying v   our hypothesis is that there is at least one   then f  m m           y and
f  m m             y     which proves that the individual utility of the two agents is at least  n    
hence there is at least one allocation whose utilitarian social welfare is greater than or equal
to  n     therefore  an allocation  maximizing the utilitarian social welfare must be such that
f          y   and f          y         or vice versa  moreover  either x         or x        
suppose that x        swapping the shares of the agents leads to an allocation    which is
completely equivalent to  with respect to pareto efficiency and envy freeness  due to the identical
preferences  we can therefore assume w l o g that  is such that x       
since f            then there is a model m  of  such that        y    xi  m     vi    s   
where s    x    x             x n    similarly  there is a model m  such that m      v    and      
 y       x i  i      m     vi    s    where s    x            xn    now consider the allocation m   m   
that is well defined since m      v    we have u       u   m   m     since the x i do not satisfy any
formula of the preferences of the agent   without y    given to the agent     and u       u   m   m   
for the same reasons  in other terms  m   m  gives the same utility as  to both agents  m   m 
is thus envy free and maximizes the utilitarian social welfare 

by lemma     we can thus restrict our problem to the allocations of the form m   m    we
have  for each m  and m  as defined earlier  u   m   m       n     w m    and u   m   m       n    
w m     thus sw   m   m       n     w m      w m     we have  argmaxm  m sw   m   m     
 
 
argmax m  m    w m    w m    m     v  or m     v      given the symmetry of the problem  we can assume
 
 
that only m  has to satisfy m      v    thus the latter allocation becomes  mopt  argmaxm  w m    m     v     
 
where mopt is the model of  of maximal weight 
suppose mopt     v    then the allocation maximizing the utilitarian social welfare is mopt  mopt and
it is clearly envy free  because both agents have the same utility  now suppose that mopt    v    then
the allocation maximizing the utilitarian social welfare is mopt  mopt    where mopt  is the model of 
of maximal weight that assigns v  to false  we have w mopt      w mopt    thus u   mopt  mopt     
u   mopt  mopt     hence this allocation is not envy free 
the latter reduction is clearly polynomial  recall that the weights  n   can be encoded using a
linear space   this proves the proposition for the utilitarian case 
egalitarian social welfare  from an instance h  v i of max sat asgeven   we create the following
instance p   v   
agents 
objects 
preferences 

  agents 
for each literal vi of   we create two objects xi and x i   and we add two objects y and
y   
the preferences of the agent   are hx     i          hxn    n  i  h  y   n i  and the preferences
of the agent   are hy  y       n i  hx     i  with  the formula  in which each symbol vi
has been replaced by xi  

every allocation that maximizes egalitarian social welfare must give at least a utility of   n to
agent    in that case  the egalitarian social welfare will be given by the utility of agent    because this
utility cannot be greater than   n   therefore  maximizing social welfare comes down to maximizing the
utility of agent    or in other words to give her the items corresponding to the model of  of maximum
weight  if v  is set to true in this model  then x  is given to agent    and since y is also given to
agent    agent   could get a strictly higher utility with agent  s share  therefore this allocation is not
envy free  if v  is set to false in the latter model  then x  is not given to agent    and thus can be given
to agent    producing an envy free allocation  since the reduction is polynomial  it proves hardness for
the egalitarian case 


   

fiefficiency and envy freeness in fair division of indivisible goods

we can notice here that the combination of envy freeness with a numerical criterion
such as classical utilitarianism or egalitarianism induces a complexity gap  since  as stated
by bouveret  fargier  lang  and lematre         the complexity of the problems of maximizing the classical utilitarian or egalitarian collective utility functions  with agents having
weighted logical preferences  are only np complete 
from the previous proof in the utilitarian case  we can notice that the hardness result still
holds if we require the allocation to be pareto efficient instead of maximizing the utilitarian
social welfare  it suggests that in the case of a language extending the weighted propositional
formulae  the eef existence problem with identical preferences is much harder than in
the case of agents having identical dichotomous preferences  we have actually the following
result 
proposition    given a collection of n identical utility functions on  r given in compact
numerical language under logical form the problem of deciding whether a pareto efficient
and envy free allocation exists is p   complete  even if n      even if the preferences are
monotonic 
proof since the preferences are identical  any envy free allocation satisfies all the agents equally  thus 
a pareto efficient and envy free allocation  if there is one  is an allocation that gives everyone a utility of
m   maximal among the set of allocations that satisfy everyone equally  this value m can be computed
using a polynomial number of np oracles  like in the previous proof   now that we have this value
of m   checking if there is a pareto efficient and envy free allocation comes down to check if there is
no allocation giving at least m to all the agents  and at least m     to at least one agent  which is a
problem in conp  and hence adds only one call to an np oracle 
for the hardness proof  one may notice that the same reduction as the one used in the utilitarian
case of the proof of proposition    works in this case  because an allocation is pareto efficient and
envy free in this particular problem if and only if it is envy free and maximizes the utilitarian social
welfare 


    additive numerical preferences
a last case that we consider here is the case of additive numerical preferences  additive
numerical preferences is a degenerate case of weighted logical preferences  where all the
formulae are single positive literals  in other words  the preferences of an agent i are given
by a set i of pairs hxk   wk i  where xk is an object and wk is the weight  possibly   
associated with the object  the utility function associated with such preferences is thus the
following 
u    x  z
p
s
 
xk s wk  
notice that the agents preferences are monotonic if and only if all the numbers wk are
positive 
this preference representation language is the most natural one when dealing with
resource allocation problems  however  it is unable to express compactly any kind of dependencies  superadditivity or subadditivity  between the objects  in particular  it does
not extend dichotomous preferences  hence the previous hardness results do not extend
to additive preferences  however  since we are still able to compare two alternatives in
polynomial time  membership to p  is guaranteed 
   

fibouveret   lang

our intuition is that this problem is as hard as the eef existence problem with
dichotomous preferences 
conjecture   eef existence with additive numerical preferences is p   complete  even if
the preferences are monotonic 
all we know about this problem is that it is np hard  this is implied by proposition   
presented later  and in p    but its precise complexity remains open  however  things become
much easier if we only require the allocation to be complete  instead of pareto efficient  this
case has already been investigated by lipton et al          and we have the following result 
proposition     lipton et al         the problem of deciding whether there exists a
complete envy free allocation for agents having additive preferences is np complete  even if
their preferences are monotonic 
other restrictions of the eef existence problem with additive preferences are worth
being studied  first  we study as in the dichotomous case the restriction to identical additive
preferences 
proposition    eef existence with n identical additive numerical preferences is npcomplete  for any fixed n     the same result holds if we require the preferences to be
monotonic 
proof membership is easy to prove  since all the preferences are identical  we write hu x             u xp  i
the utility vector associated to the set of object   an allocation is pareto efficient if and only if it gives
each object xj such that u xj       to one agent  and trashes each object xj such that u xj      
moreover  an allocation is envy free if and only if all the agents have the same utility  these two latter
properties can be checked in polynomial time  hence membership to np 
hardness comes from a reduction from partition 
problem    partition
instance  a finite set s and a size s a   n for
p each a  s p
question  is there a subset s  s such that as   s a    as s   s a   
from a given instance hs  si of the partition problem  we create the following instance p s  s  of
the eef existence problem 
agents 
objects 
preferences 

  agents 
to each a  s  we associate an object xa  
the two agents preferences are identical and defined by the size of the elements in the
initial set  u x a     s a  

there isp
a pareto efficient
p and envy free allocation for p s  s  if and only if there is an allocation
 such that x    u x    x    u x   that is  the partition problem returns true  the reduction
can be clearly done in polynomial time  which proves the proposition 


now another interesting case is the case where the preferences are not necessary identical 
but where all the atomic utilities ui  xj   are either   or    in other words  an agent either
wants an object or does not want it  and each agent wants to maximize the number of
desired objects she gets 
proposition    eef existence with additive    preferences  i e  i  j  ui  xj           
is np complete 
   

fiefficiency and envy freeness in fair division of indivisible goods

proof pareto efficiency is easy to check in this case  we can first safely remove the objects that
do not appear anywhere in the preferences  afterwards  an allocation is pareto efficient if and only
if each object xj is given to an agent i such that ui  xj        for the following reasons     let 
be a pareto efficient allocation  and suppose that there is an xj which is not given to any agent  or
which is given to an agent such that ui  xj        let k be an agent such that uk  xj        there
is one since we previously trashed the undesired objects   then giving xj to the agent k increases
ks utility while the others utilities remains the same  thus  is pareto dominated     let  be
an allocation such that each object xj is given
such p
that ui  xj        and
p to an agent ip
p suppose  is
pareto dominated by an allocation      then ii ui      i     ii xj    i  ui  xj     ii ui   i    
p p
ii
xj     i  ui  xj     p  therefore there is at least one ui  xj   such that ui  xj        which is not
possible due to our restriction to    preferences 
it thus give an simple way to check pareto efficiency  by just checking if the sum of utilities is equal
to the number of objects p that are desired by at least one agent  as usual  envy freeness can be verified
in polynomial time  therefore eef existence with additive    preferences is in np 
hardness can be proved by a polynomial reduction from exact cover by   sets  problem    
given an instance hs  c   hs            s c  ii of exact cover by   sets  create the following eef existence instance p c  s   we will suppose that the elements of s will be written ai   with i               s    
agents 
objects 
preferences 

a set of   c  agents gathered by triples   i      i      i  
a set of  s      c  items x  sm  d  m for main  and d for dummy   with
m    m            m s     and d   i        c   j         di j   
s
the agents from   i      i      i  all desire the same set of objects ak si  mk   
 di     di     di      the three objects corresponding to si plus the three dummy objects
di j   

if there is an exact cover c   for the instance hc  si  then we will consider the following allocation 
each agent from the triple   i      i      i  gets respectively di     di     and di     and if si  c     each
one of these three agents gets one of the three objects mk corresponding to the elements of the set
si   this allocation is admissible and pareto efficient  because all the objects are allocated   it is also
envy free  for the following reasons 
 the agents from the same triple cannot envy each other  because they are equally satisfied 
 an agent k  cannot envy any agent k  from another triple  because the only objects k  could
envy from k  s share are the mi   k  having at most one mi   and k  having a utility of at least
one  k  cannot envy k   
the rest of the proof is based on the following result  if an allocation
s  is pareto efficient and
envy free for p c  s  then we must have   i        i        i    ak si  mk     di     di     di    
or   i     i        i     di     di     di      this is easy to show  since the agents from the triple
  i      i      i  are the only ones to desire the objects di k   these three objects must be given to these
three agents  for the allocation to be efficient  since these three agents have the same preferences  the
allocation has to satisfy them equally in order to be envy free  thus the number of objects allocated
to the three agents must be divisible by    which gives only two possible numbers    and    and hence
only two possible allocations 
suppose that there is a pareto efficient and envy free allocation  for p c  s   consider the subcollection c   s
  hs            s c     i made of the triples si from the collection c such that   i        i 
      i    ak si  mk     di     di     di      then we have the following results 
 the si are pairwise disjoints  suppose that there is a pair  i  j  such that i    j and there is
an element ak belonging to both si and sj   then mk is allocated to two different agents  one
member of triple   i      i      i   and one member of triple   j       j       j       which is
impossible 
s
 i        c      si   s  let ak be an element of s  since  is pareto efficient  then mk must be
allocated to one agent that wants it  say
s this agent belongs to the triple   j       j       j       
unless no one wants it  which occurs if i        c      si    s  then  by the previous result  all the
s
objects from al sj  ml   must be allocated to this triple  consequently  sj  c     since ak  sj  
ak belongs to at least one set from the collection c

therefore  c   is an exact cover of s  which finally proves the proposition 



we can see with proposition    and conjecture   that there is a huge complexity gap
between the problem where we allow the weights to be freely given and the problem where
we require the weights to be   or    at least if the conjecture is true   the natural question
it raises is to know if this complexity fall is specific to the    preferences  or if it occurs
for any fixed upper bound of the weights 
conjecture   the complexity of the eef existence problem with additive         k
preferences for k    fixed is as hard as the general problem with unbounded additive preferences 
the precise complexity of this problem remains an open problem  but as it is stated
in the conjecture  our intuition is that it is as hard as the eef existence problem with
unbounded additive preferences 
another natural problem is raised by the proposition     what is the complexity of the
eef existence problem with stratified    preferences   by stratified    preferences 
we mean that the preferences are given by a set of pairs hxk   pi  where xk is an object and p
is a priority level  comparing two sets of objects comes down to compare lexicographically
the vectors where the component at index i is the number of objects of priority i in the
share of the agent  notice that this problem is not an instance of the eef existence
problem with additive preferences  nor an instance of the eef existence problem with
logical numerical preferences under logical form  however it is easy to see that it remains
in p    but its precise complexity remains unknown 
finally  we investigate the case where the number of objects is less than the number
of agents  one could think intuitively that the problem is trivial in this case  however  it
is not always the case  as we will see  to begin with  the following results shows that the
problem is easy for monotonic preferences 
proposition    let p be an allocation problem with n agents having additive monotonic
numerical preferences and all wanting at least one object  and p objects that are desired by
at least one agent 
 if p   n  then there is no pareto efficient and envy free allocation 
 if p   n  the problem of deciding whether there exists an efficient and envy free allocation for agents having monotonic additive preferences is in p 
proof
 each object being desired by at least one agent  every pareto efficient allocation is complete  if the number of objects p is strictly lower then the number of agents n   then at least one
agent i is unsatisfied  consequently  there is an agent j that obtains an object wanted by i  hence
creating envy  thus no pareto efficient allocation can be envy free 
 since there are as many objects as agents  each agent should receive one object that she values
the most  that is  such that ui   x   is maximal   for an allocation  to be pareto efficient and
envy free  indeed  if an agent i receives an object that is not her preferred one  it means that
another agent j receives it  otherwise the allocation would not be pareto efficient   creating envy
from i  therefore  checking the existence of a pareto efficient and envy free allocation comes
down in this case to checking if it is possible to give to every agent one of her best valued objects 
it comes down to checking if there is a perfect matching in the bipartite graph made with one
node per agent on the one side  and one node per object on the other side  and connecting an

   

fiefficiency and envy freeness in fair division of indivisible goods

agent i to an object x if and only if x is among the best valued objects in agent is preferences 
such a perfect matching can be computing in polynomial time  hence the result 


interestingly  the latter result does not hold at all if we allow non monotonic preferences 
in that case  the complexity increases up to the complexity of the general eef existence
problem with additive preferences 
proposition    the eef existence problem with additive numerical preferences and such
that the number of objects is less than the number of agents has the same complexity as the
eef existence problem with additive numerical preferences  but no assumption on the
number of objects 
proof let us consider an instance hi  x  h        ui  xj          i of the eef existence problem with additive numerical preferences  with n agents and p objects  p   n    we create the following instance
p hi  x  h        ui  xj          i  
agents 
objects 
preferences 

p     agents  the number of agents is not important  it just has to be greater than the
number of objects and of the initial number of agents  
the p initial objects xi plus two dummy ones d  and d   
the preferences of the n first agents are the same as in hi  x  h        ui  xj          i  the
preferences of the  n    st agent are un      d       un      d         and u n      xj    
  for the other items xj   and the preferences of the remaining agents are un      d      
   un      d         and un     xj       for the remaining objects 

if there is an efficient and envy free allocation  for hi  x  h        ui  xj          i then it can be easily
checked that the allocation that gives the same items to the n first agents of p hi  x  h        ui  xj          i  
 d    d    to the  n     st agent  and nothing to the remaining ones is efficient and envy free  conversely 
any pareto efficient and envy free allocation for p hi  x  h        ui  xj          i  yields a pareto efficient and
envy free allocation for hi  x  h        ui  xj          i by restricting it to the n first agents and all the objects
but the two dummy ones 


   related work and discussion
as already argued in the introduction  computational studies in resource allocation either
concern divisible goods  or focus on classical utilitarianism such as in combinatorial auctions 
existing work on fair division of indivisible goods  on the other hand  is mainly axiomatic 
and its computational aspects have been neglected  except in a few papers that we are
mentioning below 
our results have of course a lot in common with complexity results for combinatorial
auctions  after all  the structure of the problems are  to some extent  similar  items are
indivisible  allocations are preemptive     and each agent has preferences over sets of items
expressed in some compact representation language  logical bidding languages have also
been designed  boutilier   hoos         however  the complexity results completely differ 
the standard decision problem for combinatorial auctions is np complete  rothkopf  pekec 
  harstad        while the decision problems considered here are typically located at the
second level of the polynomial hierarchy  even in the degenerate case where preferences
are dichotomous  this can be explained by the fact that combinatorial auctions care only
about efficiency  not about envy freeness  requiring both criteria together  efficiency and
    here  preemptive means that an object cannot be allocated to more than one agent  this assumption
can be absent from some problems implying for example virtual objects  such as software licences

envy freeness  makes things much more difficult  while  under the usual assumption that
preferences are monotonic  efficiency is a monotonic property  allocating more goods never
makes an allocation less efficient   envy freeness is not  allocating more goods to an agent
may generate envy      this is the reason why there may not exist an eef allocation  and
this is also the source of the high complexity of the problem 
moreover  due to the failure of monotonicity for envy freeness  searching for an eef
allocation cannot simply be formulated as the maximization or minimization of a simple
criterion  which is problematic when designing local search algorithms or approximation
schemes  a few authors  lipton et al         chevaleyre  endriss  estivie    maudet 
    a  brams  jones    klamler        have suggested to relax the envy freeness criterion
and make it a gradual notion  by defining a measure on envy freeness  lipton et al        
assume that the input consists of numerical utility functions over sets of goods  the degree
to which agent i envies agent j in allocation  is either defined as the envy difference
di j      max    ui   j    ui   i    or the envy ratio rij      max    uuii  j  
  i     in both
cases  the global degree of envy is then the maximum degree of envy between any pair of
players  alternative definitions of the degree of envy in a society have been proposed by
chevaleyre et al       a   such as the number of envious agents  the number of pairs  i  j 
such as i envies j  or the sum of all local degrees of envy  which is relatively similar to
the measure of envy considered by brams et al          based on the maximum number
of agents that any single agent may envy  chevaleyre et al       b  suggest a radically
different way of relaxing envy freeness  the society comes along with an undirected graph
 which reflects acquaintance between agents   and an allocation is envy free if and only if
no agent envies an agent to whom she is connected 
then  lipton et al         focus on the search for a complete allocation with minimum
envy  moreover  in the case of additive utilities  they provide approximation schemes  another work on approximation algorithms for the fair allocation of indivisible goods is the
one by asadpour and saberi         who assume from the beginning that utilities are linear
and consider the problem of finding a maximally equitable allocation  that is  an allocation maximizing the utility of the least satisfied agent  cf  the problem considered in our
proposition      they do not consider envy freeness at all    
all the approaches we have considered so far  including ours  assume that the allocation
is computed in a centralized way by a neutral  objective agent  in other contexts  this
centralized approach is not possible or not realistic  and the allocation is obtained in a
decentralized way  by successive negotiations between groups of agents  such an approach
has been initiated by sandholm         who studies convergence properties on the allocation
depending on the structural restrictions made on exchanges of goods that may occur  it
has been further investigated by dunne        and dunne et al          who study the
computational complexity of these negotiation problems  and by endriss  maudet  sadri 
and toni         in these approaches  the optimality criterion is the classical utilitarian
    note that it is not antimonotonic either  allocating less goods to an agent may generate envy as well 
    note that alternative ways of relaxing the search for eef allocations exist  one may for instance
keep envy freeness as a hard requirement and relax efficiency  or allow for relaxing both and look for
an allocation that shows a good trade off between efficiency and envy freeness  considering then the
problem as a two criteria optimization problem  

   

fiefficiency and envy freeness in fair division of indivisible goods

social welfare  envy freeness is considered in a distributed setting by chevaleyre et al 
     a      b  
so far  by computational issues we referred to the design and the study of algorithms
to be run on computers so as to find an allocation  and not to designing and studying
protocols that query agents interactively so as to gather enough information for a solution to
be determined  these procedural issues  although extensively studied in the literature of
fair division of divisible goods  see below   as well as in voting  conitzer   sandholm       
have rarely been considered for allocating indivisible goods  with the notable exception
of herreiner and puppe         who study the properties of interactive protocols where
two agents enumerate their preferred bundles one by one  until an allocation is found  as
mentioned in the introduction  the drawback of such protocols is that they are exponentially
long  and henceforth infeasible as soon as the number objects is more than a few units 
beyond these few works on the computational aspects of fair division of indivisible goods 
there are much more that consider the computational and procedural aspects of fair division
of divisible goods  or  at least  assume that at least one good is divisible  e g   money  
the literature on the subject is vast and the techniques are quite far from those used for
allocating indivisible goods  see in particular the literature on cake cutting algorithms  e g 
brams   taylor        robertson   webb        so we do not find it relevant to give here a
detailed bibliography on this subject  the interested reader can refer to the book by brams
       that covers fair resource allocation in both the indivisible and the divisible case 

   conclusion
we have studied several computational aspects the search for efficient and envy free allocations in fair division problems with indivisible goods  our results of section   show that
in the case of dichotomous preferences  the search for such allocations can be reduced to
the search for preferred models in prerequisite free default logic  such a connection was
rather unexpected  and it implies that the practical search for eef allocations can be done
using existing algorithms for default logic  however this search is likely to be very timeconsuming  due to our complexity results  indeed  our extensive study of the complexity of
deciding whether an efficient and envy free allocation exists  under various restrictions  dichotomous preferences or not  two agents or more  all agents having identical preferences or
not  monotonic preferences or not  and for various notions of efficiency  pareto efficiency 
completeness  maximum number of satisfied agents  maximum social welfare  classical
utilitarian or egalitarian   seems to show that the problem is intrinsically very difficult 
since it lies at the second level of the polynomial hierarchy  even if preferences are dichotomous and monotonic  this implies that designing fast algorithms for solving the problem
in the general case is out of reach  we may first focus on those restrictions for which the
problem is at most np complete  unfortunately  these restrictions  agents with identical
preferences  only two agents  purely conjunctive  purely disjunctive or   cnf preferences 
search for complete allocations without any other efficiency requirement  additive     preferences  are very compelling and imply a huge loss of generality 
the complexity results introduced in this paper are summed up in figure   and table   
several issues for further research remain to be explored

first  knowing that there is no efficient and envy free allocation for a given problem
is not very helpful in practice when an allocation has to be found anyway  the solution
then consists in defining functions that return an allocation in all cases  even when envyfreeness and efficiency cannot be jointly met  a way of addressing this issue consists in
defining suitable relaxations of the problem  such as   a  using a measure of envy instead
of seeing envy freeness as a strict criterion  as suggested by lipton et al         chevaleyre
et al       b    b  make envy freeness a relative notion  for instance by introducing an
acquaintance graph between agents  chevaleyre et al       b   or  c  keeping envy freeness
as a strict criterion and relaxing efficiency  in all cases  new problems arise  the complexity
of which has to be identified 
second  our results are mostly negative  since most of the interesting problems we studied are np hard  and often even worse   therefore  it would be worth pursuing work and
design practical algorithms for these problems  most likely this would require coming up
with appropriate optimization criteria and then either  a  giving polynomial algorithms
that can approximate the desired objective  lipton et al         or  b  implementing and
experimenting local search algorithms with relevant heuristics 
third  throughout our paper it is assumed that everyones preferences are completely
known  in reality  presumably agents need to report their preferences  which introduces the
issue of strategic misreporting  manipulation   one direction for future research would be
to investigate how to prevent this  that is  mechanism design aspects
