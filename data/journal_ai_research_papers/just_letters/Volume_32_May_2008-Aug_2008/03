studies approximation schemes envy freeness  need compact representation

thus envy free maximizes utilitarian social welfare

every allocation maximizes egalitarian social welfare must give least utility   n

envy free  indeed  agent receives object preferred one  means
another agent j receives  otherwise allocation would pareto efficient   creating envy

   conclusion
studied several computational aspects search efficient envy free allocations fair division problems indivisible goods  results section   show
case dichotomous preferences  search allocations reduced
search preferred models prerequisite free default logic  connection
rather unexpected  implies practical search eef allocations done
using existing algorithms default logic  however search likely timeconsuming  due complexity results  indeed  extensive study complexity
deciding whether efficient envy free allocation exists  various restrictions  dichotomous preferences not  two agents more  agents identical preferences
not  monotonic preferences not  various notions efficiency  pareto efficiency 
completeness  maximum number satisfied agents  maximum social welfare classical
utilitarian egalitarian   seems show problem intrinsically difficult 
since lies second level polynomial hierarchy  even preferences dichotomous monotonic  implies designing fast algorithms solving problem
general case reach  may first focus restrictions
problem np complete  unfortunately  restrictions  agents identical
preferences  two agents  purely conjunctive  purely disjunctive   cnf preferences 
search complete allocations without efficiency requirement  additive     preferences  compelling imply huge loss generality
