   introduction
motivation work qualitative spatial logics comes needs integrating
disparate geospatial datasets  especially crowd sourced geospatial datasets  crowd sourced
data involves non specialists data collection  sharing maintenance  compared
authoritative geospatial data  collected surveyors geodata professionals  crowd sourced data less accurate less well structured  often provides richer
user based information reflects real world changes quickly much lower cost
 jackson  rahemtulla    morley         interests national mapping agencies 
government organisations  users geospatial data able integrate
use different geospatial data synergistically 
geospatial data matching refers problem establishing correspondences  matches 
spatial objects represented different geospatial datasets  essential step
data comparison  data integration enrichment  change detection data update 
matching authoritative geospatial data crowd sourced geospatial data non trivial
task  geometry representations location place different datasets usually exactly same  objects sometimes represented different levels
granularity  example  consider geometries objects nottingham city centre given
ordnance survey great britain  osgb         openstreetmap  osm        
figure    position shape prezzo ristorante represented differently
osgb data  dotted  osm data  solid   victoria shopping centre represented

order integrate datasets  need determine objects
 represent entity  sometimes objects one dataset parts objects
dataset  as example victoria shopping centre   statements
representing two types relations referred sameas matches partof
matches respectively  one way produce matches use locations geometries
objects  although course use lexical labels associated objects 
names restaurants etc  previous work  du  alechina  jackson    hart        
present method generates matches using location lexical information
spatial objects  generated matches may contain errors  seen retractable
assumptions require validation checking  one way use logical reasoning
check consistency matches respect statements input datasets 
using description logic reasoning  correctness matches checked respect
classification information  example  wrong state spatial objects
b same  bank b clinic  concepts bank clinic
disjoint  containing common elements  however  sufficient validating
matches spatial objects    example  two spatial objects close
one dataset cannot matched two spatial objects far away apart
dataset  matter whether type not  therefore  spatial
reasoning required validate matches regard location information  addition
