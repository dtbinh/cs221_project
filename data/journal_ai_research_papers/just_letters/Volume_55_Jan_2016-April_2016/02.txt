abstract
linguistic borrowing is the phenomenon of transferring linguistic constructions  lexical 
phonological  morphological  and syntactic  from a donor language to a recipient language as a result of contacts between communities speaking different languages  borrowed
words are found in all languages  andin contrast to cognate relationshipsborrowing
relationships may exist across unrelated languages  for example  about     of swahilis
vocabulary is borrowed from the unrelated language arabic   in this work  we develop a
model of morpho phonological transformations across languages  its features are based
on universal constraints from optimality theory  ot   and we show that compared to
several standardbut linguistically more navebaselines  our ot inspired model obtains
good performance at predicting donor forms from borrowed forms with only a few dozen
training examples  making this a cost effective strategy for sharing lexical information
across languages  we demonstrate applications of the lexical borrowing model in machine
translation  using resource rich donor language to obtain translations of out of vocabulary
loanwords in a lower resource language  our framework obtains substantial improvements
 up to     bleu  over standard baselines 

   introduction
state of the art natural language processing  nlp  tools  such as text parsing  speech
recognition and synthesis  text and speech translation  semantic analysis and inference  rely
on availability of language specific data resources that exist only for a few resource rich
languages  to make nlp tools available in more languages  techniques have been developed
for projecting such resources from resource rich languages using parallel  translated  data

auxiliaries  large lexicon  etc    and the assumption of construction level parallelism that
projection techniques depend on is thus questionable  given this state of affairs  there is an
urgent need for methods for establishing lexical links across languages that do not rely on
large scale parallel corpora  without new strategies  most of the        languages in the
worldmany with millions of speakerswill remain resource poor from the standpoint of
nlp 
we advocate a novel approach to automatically constructing language specific resources 
even in languages with no resources other than raw text corpora  our main motivation is
research in linguistic borrowingthe phenomenon of transferring linguistic constructions
 lexical  phonological  morphological  and syntactic  from a donor language to a recipient
language as a result of contacts between communities speaking different languages  thomason
  kaufman         borrowed words  also called loanwords  e g   in figure    are lexical
items adopted from another language and integrated  nativized  in the recipient language 
borrowing occurs typically on the part of minority language speakers  from the language
of wider communication into the minority language  sankoff         that is one reason
why donor languages often bridge between resource rich and resource limited languages 
borrowing is a distinctive and pervasive phenomenon  all languages borrowed from other
languages at some point in their lifetime  and borrowed words constitute a large fraction
        of most language lexicons  haspelmath        
loanword nativization is primarily a phonological process  donor words undergo phonological repairs to adapt a foreign word to the segmental  phonotactic  suprasegmental and
morpho phonological constraints of the recipient language  holden        van coetsem       
ahn   iverson        kawahara        hock   joseph        calabrese   wetzels       
kang        inter alia   common phonological repair strategies include feature phoneme
epenthesis  elision  degemination  and assimilation  when speakers encounter a foreign
word  either a lemma or an inflected form   they analyze it morphologically as a stem 
and morphological loanword integration thus amounts to selecting an appropriate donor
surface form  out of existing inflections of the same lemma   and applying the recipient
language morphology  repetti         adapted loanwords can freely undergo recipient
language inflectional and derivational processes  nouns are borrowed preferentially  then
other parts of speech  then affixes  inflections  and phonemes  whitney        moravcsik 
      myers scotton        p       
although borrowing is pervasive and a topic of enduring interest for historical and
theoretical linguists  haugen        weinreich         only limited work in computational
  

ficross lingual bridges with models of lexical borrowing

modeling has addressed this phenomenon  however  it is a topic well suited to computational
models  e g   the systematic phonological changes that occur during borrowing can be modeled
using established computational primitives such as finite state transducers   and models
of borrowing have useful applications  our work can be summarized as the development
of a computational model of lexical borrowing and an exploration of its applications to
augment language resources and computational approaches to nlp in resource limited
languages  specifically  we demonstrate how multilingual dictionaries extracted using models
of borrowing improve resource limited statistical machine translation  mt   using a pivoting
paradigm where the borrowing pair and the translation pair have only a single language in
common 
the problem we address is the identification of plausible donor words  in the donor
language  given a loanword  in the recipient language   and vice versa  for example  given
 
a swahili loanword safari journey  our model identifies its arabic donor k
 q  sfryh  
journey      although at a high level  this is an instance of the well known problem of
modeling string transductions  our interest is being able to identify correspondences across
languages with minimal supervision  so as to make the technique applicable in low resource
settings  to reduce the supervision burden  our model includes awareness of the morphophonological repair strategies that native speakers of a language subconsciously employ to
adapt a loanword to phonological constraints of the recipient language        to this end 
we use constraint based theories of phonology  as exemplified by optimality theory  ot 
 prince   smolensky        mccarthy         which non computational linguistic work has
demonstrated to be particularly well suited to account for phonologically complex borrowing
processes  kang         we operationalize ot constraints as features in our borrowing
model        we conduct a case study on arabic and swahili  two phylogenetically unrelated
languages with a long history of contact  we then apply the model to additional language
pairs        we then employ models of lexical borrowing to obtain cross lingual bridges
from loanwords in a low resource language to their donors in a resource rich language  the
donor language is used as pivot to obtain translations via triangulation of out of vocabulary
loanwords      we conduct translation experiments with three resource poor setups 
swahilienglish pivoting via arabic  malteseenglish pivoting via italic  and romanian
english  pivoting via french  in intrinsic evaluation  arabicswahili  italianmaltese  and
frenchromanian borrowing models significantly outperform transliteration and cognate
discovery models        we then provide a systematic quantitative and qualitative analysis
of contribution of integrated translations  relative to baselines and oracles  and on corpora
of varying sizes        the proposed pivoting approach yields substantial improvements
 up to      bleu  in swahiliarabicenglish translation  moderate improvement  up to
     bleu  in malteseitalianenglish translation  and small       bleu  but statistically
significant improvements in romanianfrenchenglish 
our contributions are twofold  while there have been software implementations of
ot  hayes  tesar    zuraw         they have been used chiefly to facilitate linguistic
analysis  we show how to use ot to formulate a model that can be learned with less
supervision than linguistically nave models  to the best of our knowledge  this is the first
   we use buckwalter notation to write arabic glosses 
   romanian is not resource poor from mt perspective  but in this work we simulate a resource poor
scenario

   motivation
the task of modeling borrowing is under explored in computational linguistics  although
it has both important practical applications and lends itself to modeling with a variety of
established computational techniques  in this section we first situate the task with respect to
two most closely related research directions  modeling transliteration and modeling cognate
forms  we then motivate the new line of research proposed in this work  modeling borrowing 
    borrowing vs  transliteration
borrowing is not transliteration  transliteration refers to writing in a different orthography 
whereas borrowing refers to expanding a language to include words adapted from another
language  unlike borrowing  transliteration is more amenable to orthographicrather
than morpho phonologicalfeatures  although transliteration can also be prone to phonetic
adaptation  knight   graehl         borrowed words might have begun as transliterations 
but a characteristic of borrowed words is that they become assimilated in the linguistic system
of the recipient language  and became regular content words  for example  orange and
 
sugar are english words borrowed from arabic l    pak   narnj  and q   alskr   respectively 
whatever their historical origins  synchronically  these words are indistinguishable to most
speakers from words that have native ancestral forms in the language  thus  the morphophonological processes that must be accounted for in borrowing models are more complex
than is required by transliteration models 
    borrowing vs  inheritance
cognates are words in related languages that are inherited from a single word in a common
ancestral language  the proto language   loanwords  on the other hand  can occur between
any languages  either related or not  that historically came into contact  from a modeling
perspective  cognates and borrowed words require separate investigation as loanwords are
more likely to display marginal phonotactic  and other phonological  patterns than inherited
lexical items  theoretical analysis of cognates has tended to be concerned with a diachronic
point of view  that is modeling word changes across time  while of immense scientific
interest  language processing applications are arguably better served by models of synchronic
processes  peculiar to loanword analysis 

   this article is a thoroughly revised and extended version of the work of tsvetkov  ammar  and dyer
        and tsvetkov and dyer         we provide a more detailed linguistic background of lexical
borrowing and ot  we demonstrate results on a new language  maltese  to emphasize the generality
of the method  additional extensions include a detailed error analysis and a more complete literature
survey 

  

ficross lingual bridges with models of lexical borrowing

    why borrowing 
borrowing is a distinctive and pervasive phenomenon  all languages borrowed from other
languages at some point in their lifetime  and borrowed words constitute a large fraction
of most language lexicons  another important property of borrowing is that in adaptation
of borrowed items  changes in words are systematic  and knowledge of morphological and
phonological patterns in a language can be used to predict how borrowings will be realized
in that language  without having to list them all  therefore  modeling of borrowing is a task
well suited for computational approaches 
our suggestion in this work is that we can identify borrowing relations between resourcerich donor languages  such as english  french  spanish  arabic  chinese  or russian  and
resource limited recipient languages  for example        of the vocabulary in vietnamese 
cantonese  and thairelatively resource limited languages spoken by hundreds of millions
of peopleare borrowed from chinese and english  languages for which numerous data
resources have been created  similarly  african languages have been greatly influenced
by arabic  spanish  english  and frenchwidely spoken languages such as swahili  zulu 
malagasy  hausa  tarifit  yoruba contain up to     of loanwords  indo iranian languages
hindustani  hindi  urdu  bengali  persian  pashtospoken by     million  also extensively
borrowed from arabic and english  haspelmath   tadmor         in short  at least a
billion people are speaking resource scarce languages whose lexicons are heavily borrowed
from resource rich languages 
why is this important  lexical translations or alignments extracted from large parallel
corpora have been widely used to project annotations from high  to low resource languages
 hwa et al         tckstrm et al         ganchev et al         inter alia   unfortunately 
large scale parallel resources are unavailable for the majority of resource limited languages 
loanwords can be used as a source of cross lingual links complementary to lexical alignments
obtained from parallel data or bilingual lexicons  this holds promise for applying existing
cross lingual methods and bootstrapping linguistic resources in languages where no parallel
data is available 

   constraint based models of lexical borrowing
our task is to identify plausible donorloan word pairs in a language pair  while modeling
string transductions is a well studied problem in nlp  we wish to be able to learn the crosslingual patterns from minimal training data  we therefore propose a model whose features
are motivated by linguistic knowledgerather than overparameterized with numerous weakly
correlated features which are more practical when large amounts of training data is available 
the features in our scoring model are inspired by optimality theory  ot        in which
borrowing candidates are ranked by universal constraints posited to underly the human
faculty of language  and the candidates are determined by transduction processes articulated
in prior studies of contact linguistics 
as illustrated in figure    our model is conceptually divided into three main parts      a
mapping of orthographic word forms in two languages into a common phonetic space     
generation of loanword pronunciation candidates from a donor word  and     ranking of
generated loanword candidates  based on linguistic constraints of the donor and recipient

figure    our morpho phonological borrowing model conceptually has three main parts

optimality theoretic constraints  part     and     are rule based      uses pronunciation dictionaries

from a few dozen automatically extracted training examples 

languages  in our proposed system  parts     and     are rule based  whereas     is learned 
each component of the model is discussed in detail in the rest of this section 
the model is implemented as a cascade of finite state transducers  parts     and    
amount to unweighted string transformation operations  in      we convert orthographic
word forms to their pronunciations in the international phonetic alphabet  ipa   these are
pronunciation transducers  in     we syllabify donor pronunciations  then perform insertion 
deletion  and substitution of phonemes and morphemes  affixes   to generate multiple
loanword candidates from a donor word  although string transformation transducers in    
can generate loanword candidates that are not found in a recipient language vocabulary  such
candidates are filtered out due to composition with the recipient language lexicon acceptor 
our model performs string transformations from donor to recipient  recapitulating the
historical process   however  the resulting relation  i e   the final composed transducer  is a
bidirectional model which can just as well be used to reason about underlying donor forms
given recipient forms  in a probabilistic cascade  bayes rule could be used to reverse the
direction and infer underlying donor forms given a loanword  however  we instead opt to
train the model discriminatively to find the most likely underlying form  given a loanword  in
part      candidates are evaluated  i e   scored  with a weighted sum of universal constraint
violations  the non negative weights  which we call the cost vector  constitute our model
parameters and are learned using a small training set of donorrecipient pairs  we use a
shortest path algorithm to find the path with the minimal cost 
    ot  constraint based evaluation
borrowing relations may be the result of quite complex transformations on the surface  our
decision to evaluate borrowing candidates by weighting counts of constraint violations is
based on optimality theory  which has shown that complex surface phenomena can be
well explained as the interaction of constraints on the form of outputs and the relationships
of inputs and outputs  kager        
ot posits that surface phonetic words of a language emerge from underlying phonological
forms according to a two stage process  first  various candidates for the surface form are
enumerated for consideration  the generation or gen phase   then  these candidates are
weighed against one another to see which most closely conforms toor equivalently  least

correctly characterized  then the actual surface form should be selected as the optimal
realization of the underlying form  such preferences are expressed as violable constraints
 violable because in many cases there may be no candidate that satisfies all of them  
there are two types of ot constraints  markedness and faithfulness constraints  markedness constraints  mccarthy   prince        describe unnatural  dispreferred  patterns in
the language  faithfulness constraints  prince   smolensky        reward correspondences
between the underlying form and the surface candidates  to clarify the distinction between
faithfulness and markedness constraint groups to the nlp readership  we can draw the
following analogy to the components of machine translation or speech recognition  faithfulness constraints are analogical to the translation model or acoustic model  reflecting
how well an output candidate is appropriate to the input   while markedness constraints
are analogical to the language model  requiring well formedness of the output candidate  
without faithfulness constraints  the optimal surface form could differ arbitrarily from the
underlying form  as originally proposed  ot holds that the set of constraints is universal 
but their ranking is language specific 
in ot  then  the grammar is the set of universal constraints and their language specific
ranking  and a derivation for a surface form consists of its underlying form  surface
candidates  and constraint violations by those candidates  under which the surface form is
correctly chosen   an example of ot analysis is shown in table    ot constraints will be
explained later  in tables   and   
ot has been adapted to account for borrowing by treating the donor language word
as the underlying form for the recipient language  that is  the phonological system of the
  

fitsvetkov   dyer

recipient language is encoded as a system of constraints  and these constraints account for
how the donor word is adapted when borrowed  we show an example in table    there
has been substantial prior work in linguistics on borrowing in the ot paradigm  yip

but none of it has led to computational realizations 
ot assumes an ordinal constraint ranking and strict dominance rather than constraint
weighting  in that  our ot inspired model departs from ots standard evaluation assumptions  following goldwater and johnson         we use a linear scoring scheme 
    case study  arabicswahili borrowing
in this section  we use the arabicswahili  language pair to describe the prototypical
linguistic adaptation processes that words undergo when borrowed  then  we describe how
we model these processes in more general terms 
the swahili lexicon has been influenced by arabic as a result of a prolonged period
of language contact due to indian ocean trading      ce       as well as the influence
of islam  rothman         according to several independent studies  arabic loanwords
constitute from      hurskainen      b  to      johnson        of swahili word types 
despite a strong susceptibility of swahili to borrowing and a large fraction of swahili
words originating from arabic  the two languages are typologically distinct with profoundly
dissimilar phonological and morpho syntactic systems  we survey these systems briefly
since they illustrate how arabic loanwords have been substantially adapted to conform to
swahili phonotactics  first  arabic has five syllable patterns   cv  cvv  cvc  cvcc  and
cvvc  mccarthy        pp         whereas swahili  like other bantu languages  has only
open syllables of the form cv or v  at the segment level  swahili loanword adaptation thus
involves extensive vowel epenthesis in consonant clusters and at a syllable final position if

the syllable ends with a consonant  for example  h
  aj  ktab   kitabu book  polom       
schadeberg        mwita         second  phonological adaptation in swahili loanwords
includes shortening of vowels  unlike arabic  swahili does not have phonemic length  
substitution of consonants that are found in arabic but not in swahili  e g   emphatic
 pharyngealized   tq   t   voiceless velar fricative  x  k   dental fricatives  t  s  
 d  z   and the voiced velar fricative  g  g    adoption of arabic phonemes that were

   for simplicity  we subsume omani arabic and other historical dialects of arabic under the label arabic

      pronunciation
based on the ipa  we assign shared symbols to sounds that exist in both sound systems

unique symbols to sounds that are unique to the phonemic inventory of arabic  e g  
pharyngeal voiced and voiceless fricatives      q   or swahili  e g   velar nasal  n    for
swahili  we construct a pronunciation dictionary based on the omniglot grapheme to ipa
mapping   in arabic  we use the cmu arabic vowelized pronunciation dictionary containing
about    k types which has the average of four pronunciations per unvowelized input word
type  metze  hsiao  jin  nallasamy    schultz          we then design four transducers
arabic and swahili word to ipa and ipa to word transducerseach as a union of linear
chain transducers  as well as one acceptor per pronunciation dictionary listing 
      syllabification
arabic words borrowed into swahili undergo a repair of violations of the swahili segmental and
phonotactic constraints  for example via vowel epenthesis in a consonant cluster  importantly 
repair depends upon syllabification  to simulate plausible phonological repair processes 
we generate multiple syllabification variants for input pronunciations  the syllabification
transducer optionally inserts syllable separators between phones  for example  for an
input phonetic sequence  kuttaba   the output strings include  ku t ta ba    kut ta ba  
and  ku tta ba  as syllabification variants  each variant violates different constraints and
consequently triggers different phonological adaptations 
   www omniglot com
   since we are working at the level of word types which have no context  we cannot disambiguate the
intended form  so we include all options  for example  for the input word ak  aj  ktaba  book sg indef  we
use both pronunciations  kitaba  and  kuttaba

      phonological adaptation
phonological adaptation of syllabified phone sequences is the crux of the loanword adaptation
process  we implement phonological adaptation transducers as a composition of plausible
context dependent insertions  deletions  and substitutions of phone subsets  based on prior
studies summarized in      in what follows  we list phonological adaptation components in
the order of transducer composition in the borrowing model  the vowel deletion transducer
shortens arabic long vowels and vowel clusters  the consonant degemination transducer
shortens arabic geminate consonants  for example  it degeminates  tt  in  ku tta ba  
outputting  ku ta ba   the substitution of similar phonemes transducer substitutes
similar phonemes and phonemes that are found in arabic but not in swahili  polom 
      p       for example  the emphatic  tq     dq     sq   are replaced by the corresponding
non emphatic segments  t    d    s   the vowel epenthesis transducer inserts a vowel
between pairs of consonants   ku tta ba    ku tata ba    and at the end of a syllable  if
the syllable ends with a consonant   ku t ta ba    ku ta ta ba    sometimes it is possible
to predict the final vowel of a word  depending on the word final coda consonant of its
arabic counterpart   u  or  o  added if an arabic donor ends with a labial  and  i  or
 e  added after coronals and dorsals  mwita         following these rules  the final vowel
substitution transducer complements the inventory of final vowels in loanword candidates 
      morphological adaptation
both arabic and swahili have significant morphological processes that alter the appearance
of lemmas  to deal with morphological variants  we construct morphological adaptation
transducers that optionally strip arabic concatenative affixes and clitics  and then optionally
append swahili affixes  generating a superset of all possible loanword hypotheses  we
obtain the list of arabic affixes from the arabic morphological analyzer sama  maamouri 
graff  bouziri  krouna    kulick         the swahili affixes are taken from a hand crafted
swahili morphological analyzer  littell  price    levin         for the sake of simplicity in
implementation  we strip no more than one arabic prefix and no more than one suffix per
word  and in swahili  we concatenate at most two swahili prefixes and at most one suffix 
    learning constraint weights
due to the computational problems of working with ot  eisner               we make
simplifying assumptions by     bounding the theoretically infinite set of underlying forms with
a small linguistically motivated subset of allowed transformations on donor pronunciations 
as described in          imposing a priori restrictions on the set of the surface realizations
by intersecting the candidate set with the recipient pronunciation lexicon      assuming that
the set of constraints is finite and regular  ellison         and     assigning linear weights

constraints are implemented as standalone identity transducers  inputs are equal outputs 
but path weights representing candidate evaluation with respect to violated constraints are
different 
the final loanword transducer is the composition of all transducers described in    
and ot constraint transducers  a path in the transducer represents a syllabified phonemic
sequence along with  weighted  ot constraints it violates  and shortest path outputs are
those  whose cumulative weight of violated constraints is minimal 
ot constraints are realized as features in our linear model  and feature weights are
learned in a discriminative training to maximize the accuracy obtained by the loanword
transducer on a small development set of donorrecipient pairs  for parameter estimation

method that iteratively optimizes  based on an objective function evaluation  the convex
hull of n     simplex vertices   the objective function used in this work is the soft accuracy
of the development set  defined as the proportion of correctly identified donor words in the
total set of   best outputs 
    adapting the model to a new language
the arabicswahili case study shows that  in principle  a borrowing model can be constructed 
but a reasonable question to ask is  how much work is required to build a similar system
for a new language pair  we claim that our design permits rapid development in new
language pairs  first  string transformation operations  as well as ot constraints are
language universal  the only adaptation required is a linguistic analysis to identify plausible
morpho phonological repair strategies for the new language pair  i e   a subset of allowed
insertions  deletions  and substitutions of phonemes and morphemes   since we need
only to overgenerate candidates  the ot constraints will filter bad outputs   the effort is
minimal relative to many other grammar engineering exercises  the second language specific
component is the grapheme to ipa converter  while this can be a non trivial problem in
some cases  the problem is well studied  and many under resourced languages  e g   swahili  
have phonographic systems where orthography corresponds to phonology  this tendency
can be explained by the fact that  in many cases  lower resource languages have developed
orthography relatively recently  rather than having organically evolved written forms that
preserve archaic or idiosyncratic spellings that are more distantly related to the current
phonology of the language such as we see in english 
to illustrate the ease with which a language pair can be engineered  we applied our
borrowing model to the italianmaltese and frenchromanian language pairs  maltese and
romanian  like swahili  have a large number of borrowed words in their lexicons  tadmor 
       maltese  a phylogenetically semitic language  has            loanwords of romance
 italian sicilian  origin  comrie   spagnol         although french and romanian are
sister languages  both descending from latin   about     of romanian types are french
borrowings that came into the language in the past few centuries  schulte         for both
language pairs we manually define a set of allowed insertions  deletions  and substitutions
of phonemes and morphemes  based on the training sets  a set of maltese affixes was
defined based on the linguistic survey by fabri  gasser  habash  kiraz  and wintner        
we employ the globalphone pronunciation dictionary for french  schultz   schlippe 
       converted to ipa  and automatically constructed italian  romanian  and maltese
pronunciation dictionaries using the omniglot grapheme to ipa conversion rules for those
languages 

   models of lexical borrowing in statistical machine translation
before turning to an experimental verification and analysis of the borrowing model  we
introduce an external application where the borrowing model will be used as a component
machine translation  we rely on the borrowing model to project translation information
   the decision to use neldermead rather than more conventional gradient based optimization algorithms
was motivated purely by practical limitations of the finite state toolkit we used which made computing
derivatives with latent structure impractical from an engineering standpoint

from a high resource donor language into a low resource recipient language  thus mitigating
the deleterious effects of out of vocabulary  oov  words 
oovs are a ubiquitous and difficult problem in mt  when a translation system encounters
an oova word that was not observed in the training data  and the trained system thus
lacks its translation variantsit usually outputs the word just as it is in the source language 
producing erroneous and disfluent translations  all mt systems  even when trained on billionsentence size parallel corpora  will encounter oovs at test time  often  these are named
entities and neologisms  however  the oov problem is much more acute in morphologicallyrich and low resource scenarios  there  oovs are primarily not lexicon peripheral items such
as names and specialized technical terms  but also regular content words  since borrowed
words are a component of the regular lexical content of a language  projecting translations
onto the recipient language by identifying borrowed lexical material is a plausible strategy
for solving this problem 
procuring translations for oovs has been a subject of active research for decades 
translation of named entities is usually generated using transliteration techniques  alonaizan   knight        hermjakob  knight    daum iii        habash         extracting
a translation lexicon for recovering oov content words and phrases is done by mining

addition  oov content words can be recovered by exploiting cognates  by transliterating
and then pivoting via a closely related resource richer language  when such a language
exists  haji  hric    kubo        mann   yarowsky        kondrak  marcu    knight

      wang  nakov    ng        nakov   ng        dholakia   sarkar         our work is
similar in spirit to the latter pivoting approach  but we show how to obtain translations for
oov content words by pivoting via an unrelated  often typologically distant resource rich
language 
our solution is depicted  at a high level  in figure    given an oov word in resource poor
mt  we use our borrowing system to identify list of likely donor words from the donor
language  then  using the mt system in the resource rich language  we translate the donor
words to the same target language as in the resource poor mt  here  english   finally  we
integrate translation candidates in the resource poor system 
we now discuss integrating translation candidates acquired via borrowing plus resourcerich translation 
briefly  phrase based translation works as follows  a set of candidate translations for an
input sentence is created by matching contiguous spans of the input against an inventory of
phrasal translations  reordering them into a target language appropriate order  and choosing
the best one according to a model that combines features of the phrases used  reordering
patterns  and target language model  koehn  och    marcu         a limitation of this
approach is that it can only generate input output phrase pairs that were directly observed
in the training corpus  in resource limited languages  the standard phrasal inventory will
generally be incomplete due to limited parallel data  thus  the decoders only hope for
producing a good output is to find a fluent  meaning preserving translation using incomplete
translation lexicons  synthetic phrases is a strategy of integrating translated phrases

figure    to improve a resource poor swahilienglish mt system  we extract translation candidates

arabicenglish resource rich mt 

directly in the mt translation model  rather than via pre  or post processing mt inputs and

tsvetkov   dyer         synthetic phrases are phrasal translations that are not directly
extractable from the training data  generated by auxiliary translation and postediting
processes  for example  extracted from a borrowing model   an important advantage of
synthetic phrases is that the process often benefits from phrase synthesizers that have high
recall  relative to precision  since the global translation model will still have the final say on
whether a synthesized phrase will be used 
for each oov  the borrowing system produces the n best list of plausible donors  for
each donor we then extract the k best list of its translations   then  we pair the oov with
the resulting n  k translation candidates  the translation candidates are noisy  some of
the generated donors may be erroneous  the errors are then propagated in translation   
to allow the low resource translation system to leverage good translations that are missing
in the default phrase inventory  while being able to learn how trustworthy they are  we
integrate the borrowing model acquired translation candidates as synthetic phrases 
to let the translation model learn whether to trust these phrases  the translation options
obtained from the borrowing model are augmented with an indicator feature indicating
that the phrase was generated externally  i e   rather than being extracted from the parallel
data   additional features assess properties of the donorloan words relation  their goal is to
provide an indication of plausibility of the pair  to mark possible errors in the outputs of the
borrowing system   we employ two types of features  phonetic and semantic  since borrowing
is primarily a phonological phenomenon  phonetic features will provide an indication of how
   we set n and k to    we did not experiment with other values 
    we give as input into the borrowing system all oov words  although  clearly  not all oovs are loanwords 
and not all loanword oovs are borrowed from the donor language  however  an important property of
the borrowing model is that its operations are not general  but specific to the language pair and reduced
only to a small set of plausible changes that the donor word can undergo in the process of assimilation
in the recipient language  thus  the borrowing system only minimally overgenerates the set of output
candidates given an input  if the borrowing system encounters an input word that was not borrowed
from the target donor language  it usually  but not always  produces an empty output 

  

ficross lingual bridges with models of lexical borrowing

typical  or atypical  pronunciation of the word in a language  loanwords are expected to
be less typical than core vocabulary words  the goal of semantic features is to measure
semantic similarity between donor and loan words  erroneous candidates and borrowed
words that changed meaning over time are expected to have different meaning from the
oov 
    phonetic features
to compute phonetic features we first train a    gram  language model  lm  of ipa pronunciations of the donor recipient language vocabulary  p    then  we re score pronunciations of
the donor and loanword candidates using the lms  we hypothesize that in donorloanword
pairs both the donor and the loanword phone lm score is high  we capture this intuition in
three features  f    p  donor   f    p  loanword   and the harmonic mean between the two
  f 
scores f    f f   f
 the harmonic mean of a set of values is high only when all of the values
 
are high  
    semantic features
we compute a semantic similarity feature between the candidate donor and the oov
loanword as follows  we first train  using large monolingual corpora      dimensional word
vector representations for donor and recipient language vocabularies    then  we employ
canonical correlation analysis  cca  with small donorloanword dictionaries  training sets
in the borrowing models  to project the word embeddings into    dimensional vectors with
maximized correlation between their dimensions  the semantic feature annotating the
synthetic translation candidates is cosine distance between the resulting donor and loanword
vectors  we use the word vec skip gram model  mikolov  sutskever  chen  corrado   
dean        to train monolingual vectors    and the cca based tool  faruqui   dyer       
for projecting word vectors   

   experiments
we now turn to the problem of empirically validating the model we have proposed  our
evaluation consists of two parts  first  we perform an intrinsic assessment of the models
ability to learn borrowing correspondences and compare these to similar approaches that
use less linguistic knowledge but which have been used to solve similar string mapping
problems  second  we show the effect of borrowing augmented translations in translation
systems  exploring the effects of the features proposed above

in addition to predictive accuracy on all models  if a model produces multiple hypotheses

evaluate two particular aspects of our proposed model      appropriateness of the model
family  and     the quality of the learned ot constraint weights  the first aspect is designed
to evaluate whether the morpho phonological transformations implemented in the model
are required and sufficient to generate loanwords from the donor inputs  we report two
evaluation measures  model reachability and ambiguity  reachability is the percentage of
test samples that are reachable  i e   there is a path from the input test example to a correct
output  in the loanword transducer  a nave model which generates all possible strings
would score      reachability  however  inference may be expensive and the discriminative
component will have a greater burden  in order to capture this trade off  we also report
the inherent ambiguity of our model  which is the average number of outputs potentially
generated per input  a generic arabicswahili transducer  for example  has an ambiguity of
       the size of the arabic pronunciation lexicon   
      results
the reachability and ambiguity of the borrowing model are listed in table    briefly  the
model obtains high reachability  while significantly reducing the average number of possible
outputs per input  in arabic from    k to     words  in maltese from    k to     in french
from   k to     this result shows that the loanword transducer design  based on the prior
linguistic analysis  is a plausible model of word borrowing  yet  there are on average   
correct arabic words out of the possible     outputs  thus the second part of the modelot
constraint weights optimizationis crucial 
the accuracy results in table   show how challenging the task of modeling lexical
borrowing between two distinct languages is  and importantly  that orthographic and
phonetic baselines including the state of the art generative model of transliteration are not
suitable for this task  phonetic baselines for arabicswahili perform better than orthographic
ones  but substantially worse than ot based models  even if ot constraints are not weighted 
crucially  the performance of the borrowing model with the learned ot weights corroborates
    our measure of ambiguity is equivalent to perplexity assuming a uniform distribution over output forms

the assumption made in numerous linguistic accounts that ot is an adequate analysis of
the lexical borrowing phenomenon 
      qualitative evaluation
the constraint ranking learned by the borrowing model  constraints are listed in tables      
is in line with prior linguistic analysis  in swahili no coda dominates all other markedness
constraints  both  complex s and  complex c  restricting consonant clusters  dominate
 complex v  confirming that swahili is more permissive to vowel clusters  sspsonority based
constraintcaptures a common pattern of consonant clustering  found across languages 
and is also learned by our model as undominated by most competitors in swahili  and as
a dominating markedness constraint in romanian  morphologically motivated constraints
also comply with tendencies discussed in linguistic literature  donor words may remain
unmodified and are treated as a stem  and then are reinfected according to the recipient
morphology  thus dep io morph can be dominated more easily than max io morph  finally 
vowel epenthesis dep io v is the most common strategy in arabic loanword adaptation  and
is ranked lower according to the model  however  it is ranked highly in the frenchromanian
model  where vowel insertion is rare 
a second interesting by product of our model is an inferred syllabification  while we did
not conduct a systematic quantitative evaluation  higher ranked swahili outputs tend to
contain linguistically plausible syllabifications  although the syllabification transducer inserts
optional syllable boundaries between every pair of phones  this result further attests to the
plausible constraint ranking learned by the model  example swahili syllabifications   along
with the constraint violations produced by the borrowing model are depicted in table

the goal of our experiments is not only to evaluate the contribution of the oov dictionaries
that we extract when pivoting via borrowing  but also to understand the potential contribution of exploiting borrowing  what is the overall improvement that would be achieved if we
could correctly translate all oovs that were borrowed from another language  what is the
overall improvement that can be achieved if we correctly translate all oovs  we answer
this question by defining upper bound experiments  in the upper bound experiments
we word align all available parallel corpora  including dev and test sets  and extract from
the alignments oracle translations of oov words  then  we append the extracted oov
dictionaries to the training corpora and re train smt setups without oovs  translation
scores of the resulting system provide an upper bound of an improvement from correctly
translating all oovs  when we append oracle translations of the subset of oov dictionaries 
in particular translations of all oovs for which the output of the borrowing system is not
empty  we obtain an upper bound that can be achieved using our method  if the borrowing
system provided perfect outputs relative to the reference translations   understanding the

table     the size of translated lexicons extracted using pivoting via transliteration and integrated
in translation models 

upper bounds is relevant not only for our experiments  but for any experiments that involve
augmenting translation dictionaries  however  we are not aware of prior work providing
similar analysis of upper bounds  and we recommend this as a calibrating procedure for
future work on oov mitigation strategies 
      borrowing augmented setups
as described in    we integrate translations of oov loanwords in the translation model using
the synthetic phrase paradigm  due to data sparsity  we conjecture that non oovs that
occur only few times in the training corpus can also lack appropriate translation candidates 
these are target language oovs  we therefore plug into the borrowing system oovs and
non oov words that occur less than   times in the training corpus  we list in table    the
size of resulting borrowed lexicons that we integrate in translation tables   
      transliteration augmented setups
in addition to the standard baselines  we evaluate transliteration baselines  where we replace
the borrowing model by the baselines described in      as in the borrowing system 
transliteration outputs are filtered to contain only target language lexicons  we list in
table    the size of obtained translated lexicons 
      results
translation results are shown in table     we evaluate separately the contribution of
the integrated oov translations  and the same translations annotated with phonetic and
semantic features  we also provide upper bound scores for integrated loanword dictionaries
as well as for recovering all oovs 
    differences in statistics stem from differences in types of corpora  such as genre  domain  and morphological
richness of the source language

table     blue scores in the swahilienglish  malteseenglish  and romanianenglish mt
experiments 

swahilienglish mt performance is improved by up to      bleu when we augment
it with translated oov loanwords leveraged from the arabicswahili borrowing and then
arabicenglish mt  the contribution of the borrowing dictionaries is         bleu 
and phonetic and semantic features contribute additional half bleu  more importantly 
upper bound results show that the system can be improved more substantially with better
dictionaries of oov loanwords  this result confirms that oov borrowed words is an
important type of oovs  and with proper modeling it has the potential to improve translation
by a large margin  malteseenglish system is also improved substantially  by up to     
bleu  but the contribution of additional features is less pronounced  romanianenglish
systems obtain only small but significant improvement for  k and  k  p        clark  dyer 
lavie    smith         however  this is expected as the rate of borrowing from french
into romanian is smaller  and  as the result  the integrated loanword dictionaries are small 
transliteration baseline  conversely  is more effective in romanianfrench language pair  as
the languages are related typologically  and have common cognates in addition to loanwords 
still  even with these dictionaries the translations with pivoting via borrowing transliteration
improve  and even almost approach the upper bounds results 
      error analysis
our augmented mt systems combine three main components  the translation system itself  a
borrowing system  and a pivot translation system  at each step of the application errors may
occur that lead to erroneous translations  to identify main sources of errors in the swahili

table     sources of errors 

english end to end system  we conducted a manual analysis of errors in translations of oov
types produced by the swahilienglish  k translation systems  as a gold standard corpus
we use the helsinki corpus of swahili    hurskainen      a  hcs   hcs is a morphologically 
syntactically  and semantically annotated corpus of about    k sentences      m tokens  
in the corpus        surface forms     m tokens  are marked as arabic loanwords  out of
the       oov types in the swahilienglish  k translation systems      word types are
annotated in the hcs  we manually annotated these     words and identified     errors 
the remaining     words were translated correctly in the end to end system  our analysis
reveals the error sources detailed below  in table    we summarize the statistics of the error
sources 
   reachability of the borrowing system 
only     out of     input words produced loanword candidates  the main reason
for the unreachable paths is complex morphology of swahili oovs  not taken into
account by our borrowing system  for example  atakayehusika who will be involved 
the lemma is husika involve 
   loanword production errors 
about half of errors are due to incorrect outputs of the borrowing system  this is
in line with the arabicswahili borrowing system accuracy reported in table    for
example  all morphological variants of the lemma wahi never  hayajawahi  halijawahi 
hazijawahi   incorrectly produced an arabic donor word ag   jawh  java  additional examples include all variants of the lemma saidia help  isaidie  kimewasaidia 
produced arabic donor candidates that are variants of the proper name saidia 
   arabicenglish translation errors 
as the most frequent source of errors in the arabicenglish mt system  we have identified oov arabic words  for example  although for the swahili loanword awashukuru

thank you the borrowing system correctly produced a plausible donor word p
 w kwr  and thank you  rarely used   the only translation variant produced by the
arabicenglish mt was kochkor 
   swahilienglish translation errors 
in some cases  although the borrowing system produced a correct donor candidate 
and the arabicenglish translation was also correct  translation variants were different
from the reference translations in the swahilienglish mt system  for example  the
    www aakkl helsinki fi cameel corpus intro htm

  

fitsvetkov   dyer

word alihuzunika he grieved correctly produced an arabic donor   qm       alhzn  grief 
translation variants produced by the arabicenglish mt are sadness  grief  saddened 
sorrow  sad  mourning  grieved  saddening  mourn  distressed  whereas the expected
translation in the swahilienglish reference translations is disappointed  another
source of errors that occurred despite correct outputs of borrowing and translation
systems is historical meaning change of words  an interesting example of such semantic
 
shift is the word sakafu floor  that was borrowed from the arabic word   sqf  
ceiling 
complex morphology of both swahili and arabic is the most frequent source of errors at
all steps of the application  concatenation of several prefixes in swahili affects the reachability
of the borrowing system  some swahili prefixes flip the meaning of words  for example
kutoadhibiwa impunity  produces the lemma adhibiwa punishment  and consequently
translations torture  torturing  tortured  finally  derivational processes in both languages
are not handled by our system  for example  a verb aliyorithi he inherited  produces an

arabic noun kp    alwarvp  the heiress  and its english translations heiress  jointly
reasoning about morphological processes in the donor and recipient languages suggests a
possible avenue for remedying these issues 

   additional related work
with the exception of a study conducted by blair and ingram        on generation of
borrowed phonemes in englishjapanese language pair  the method does not generalize
from borrowed phonemes to borrowed words  and does not rely on linguistic insights   we
are not aware of any prior work on computational modeling of lexical borrowing  few
papers only mention or tangentially address borrowing  we briefly list them here  daum iii
       focuses on areal effects on linguistic typology  a broader phenomenon that includes
borrowing and genetic relations across languages  this study is aimed at discovering language
areas based on typological features of languages  garley and hockenmaier        train a
maximum entropy classifier with character n gram and morphological features to identify
anglicisms  which they compare to loanwords  in an online community of german hip hop
fans  finally  list and moran        have published a toolkit for computational tasks in
historical linguistics but remark that automatic approaches for borrowing detection are
still in their infancy in historical linguistics 

   conclusion
given a loanword  our model identifies plausible donor words in a contact language  we
show that a discriminative model with optimality theoretic features effectively models
systematic phonological changes in arabicswahili loanwords  we also found that the model
and methodology is generally applicable to other language pairs with minimal engineering
effort  our translation results substantially improve over the baseline and confirm that oov
loanwords are important and merit further investigation 
there are numerous research questions that we would like to explore further  is it possible
to monolingually identify borrowed words in a language  can we automatically identify a
donor language  or its phonological properties  for a borrowed word  since languages may
  

ficross lingual bridges with models of lexical borrowing

borrow from many sources  can jointly modeling this process lead to better performance 
can we reduce the amount of language specific engineering required to deploy our model 
can we integrate knowledge of borrowing in additional downstream nlp applications  we
intend to address these questions in future work
