crowdsourcing harnesses human intelligence common sense complete tasks
difficult accomplish using computers alone  crowdsourcing markets  amazon mechanical turk crowdflower  platforms designed match available human workers
tasks complete  using platforms  requesters may post tasks would
completed  along amount money willing pay  workers
choose whether accept available tasks complete work 
course human workers equal  human produced work  tasks 
proofreading english text  easier workers others  requiring less
effort produce high quality results  additionally  workers dedicated
others  willing spend extra time make sure task completed properly  encourage
high quality results  requesters may set quality contingent bonus payments top

single worker type  since one type  drop subscript

    v    v      worker chooses low effort  outcome equally likely  
   worker chooses high effort  equally likely      easy verify
type satisfies fosd assumption  finally  simplicity  assume workers
break ties high effort effort level favor high effort 
workers break ties low effort null effort level favor low effort 
lets consider optimal contract  since single worker type
workers type break ties way  consider separately best contract
would make workers choose null effort level  best contract would make
workers choose low effort  best contract would make workers choose high
effort  compare requesters expected value each 
since c e        workers break ties low effort null effort favor low
effort  contract would cause workers choose null effort  workers always
prefer low effort null effort 
easy see best contract  in terms requester expected value  would
make workers choose low effort would set x      x        x    sufficiently low
workers would enticed choose high effort  setting x        sufficient 
case  expected value requester would     v      v     
lets consider contracts cause workers choose high effort  worker chooses

since x    appear equation     set x        make equation
