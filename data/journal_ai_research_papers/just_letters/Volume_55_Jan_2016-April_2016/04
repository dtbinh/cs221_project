    syntax
assume existence three types constant symbols  object symbols  time value symbols 
spatial region symbols  constants id    id            idm                     tmax

apply unique name assumption  so  instance idi idj    j different objects 
similarly  pi pj    j different points  use variables type  object

spatio temporal atom  st atom  short  expression form loc x  y  z   where 
 i  x object variable constant id id 
 ii  space   variable constant r space

   summary
believe first comprehensive paper focuses systematically knowledge representation form integrity constraints probabilistic spatio temporal data    knowledge
represented form spatio temporal atoms describing location objects time
probability interval well spatio temporal denial formulas describing integrity constraints system must satisfy  within framework investigated consistency checking
problem well problem answering selection queries consistent pst kbs  although
problems turned hard general case  devised several sets linear
inequalities allow us decide consistency well answer queries checking feasibility  addition  identified different classes spatio temporal denial formulas
checking consistency answering queries tractable  finally  discussed extension
framework arbitrarily large finite numbers objects  time values  points space
showed behavior consistency inconsistency uniform 

   future work conclusion

possibility semantic query optimization pst kbs  study use previous
knowledge efficiently check consistency process queries updates 
another direction future work investigation probabilistic std formulas expressing
constraints hold probability given interval  intuitively  would allow us state

probability intervals associated std formulas introduces new issues semantics  f     u

      randell  cui    cohn        galton         interesting project incorporation
concepts pst framework  new syntax semantics include adding rules
language  additions allow adding types information well new
integrity constraints  instance  using concepts qualitative direction orientation proposed spatial reasoning  galton        would allow us explicitly represent knowledge
region toward object moving  another important concept needed many applications explicit representation qualitative quantitative distance objects well
information speed  i e   maximum average  objects  additional structured information objects type  e g   vessel  vehicle  person  etc   would general useful
exhaustively reason moving objects  however  depending addition made increase
expressive power extended framework  important consequences complexity
consistency checking problem may arise  spatial temporal aspects formalisms qualitative
spatial temporal reasoning expressive framework  gabelaia
et al         knapp et al          trade off expressiveness complexity within
hierarchy formalisms obtained combining well known spatial temporal logics analyzed
gabelaia et al          shown complexity satisfiability problem
spatio temporal logics  not dealing probabilities  vary np complete undecidable 
using formalisms pst framework may drastically increase computational complexity problems studied paper  nevertheless  believe attempt
later made include even simpler concepts qualitative spatio temporal reasoning pst
framework  particularly trying exploit restrictions recently studied huang  li  renz
