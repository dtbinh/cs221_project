because  fails keep p    still bargain p  loss p  means loss
both 
another significant difference model bargaining gametheoretic model  game theoretic model abstracts bargaining situation numerical
game  demands  preferences risk posture player represented utility
values  model  however  factors abstracted logical statements
ordering statement  i e   prioritized demand set  note endowed
word demand broad meaning  model  demand player
everything related negotiation player wants keep final
agreement  physical item player wants obtain party 
piece knowledge  belief  goal  constraint even thread  whatever 
player wants keep agreement  different logics rational agency 
bdi logics  distinguish knowledge  belief  goal real demands 
instance  logical tautology demand player player considers
included final agreement  consider example   again  typical demands
player xa     xa     xa     on    mean player
wants get share cake less                  player bs demands
opposite  say xb     xb     xb       besides real demands 
set domain constraints players demand sets  xa   xb     
xa xa z xb xb z whenever z  constraints link
demands players together  therefore  play important rule determination
bargaining outcomes  instance  cannot xa    xb   
final agreement inconsistent constraints  one may wonder
player include constraints demand set  case 
player would accept unreasonable results  xa    xb    
words  idealize bargaining problem assuming two individuals highly
rational  see work nash        p       assume constraints
background knowledge included demand set player  see discussions
example section     again  ordering demand sets reflect gains
player mentioned above  likely rational agent could give
highest priority mentioned constraints background knowledge since
might never going give fundamental rules 
following example shows model suitable discrete domain
problems 
example   couple making family budget next year  husband wants
change car new fancy model domestic holiday  wife going
implement dream romantic trip europe suggests redecorate kitchen 
know cant two holidays one year  realize
cannot afford new car overseas holiday year without getting
loan bank  however  wife idea borrowing money 
order represent situation logic  let c denote buy new car  stand
domestic holiday  overseas holiday  k kitchen redecoration l loan 
   note player may different demands different stages negotiation

 d o  means impossible domestic holiday overseas
holiday  statement  c o  l says want buy new car
overseas holiday  get loan bank 
symbolization  express husbands demands following
set 
x     c  d   d o    c o  l 
similarly  wifes demands represented by 
x     o  k   d o    c o  l  l 
let us assume husbands preferences demands are 
 d o     c o  l   c  
wifes preferences are 
 d o     c o  l     k   l
note agents give common beliefs   d o   c o  l highest
priority  reflects couple rational  shall see common beliefs
play important role determination bargaining solution

  rubinsteins model  osborne   rubinstein         first  demand sets x  x 
model represent players physical demands rather feasible outcomes  note
two players share feasible set x osborne   rubinsteins model  
model  feasible set generated demand sets procedure conflict
resolving  see definition   example     secondly  representation

therefore  g  contains single deal  d   see example     solution

f  g    d       d o    c o  l  c     d o    c o  l  o  k  
words  couple agree upon commonsense one holiday
get loan want buy new car go overseas holiday 
husband accepts wifes suggestion holiday europe wife agrees buying
new car 
consider following preference orderings 
 d o     c o  l     c
 d o     c o  l     k   l
therefore demand hierarchies become 
x       d o    c o  l    d    c   
x       d o    c o  l    o    k    l

g      three deals included  g     note
o    c o  l  k   max
final agreement include demands lead conflicting  d  o  l  keeps
demands lead conflicting  k   words  solution excludes
demands lead conflict keeps demands involved conflicts
even though low priorities 

   logical properties bargaining solution
following two sections  discuss properties bargaining solution introduced previous section  according zhang         bargaining solution satisfies

proof  proofs properties straightforward definition bargaining solution  definition    

note logical version individual rationality  ir  different meaning
game theoretic version  logical version ir means player concerns
demands  i e   whether many demands included
final agreement  contrast  game theoretic version ir concerns whether
player gain less disagreement point negotiation  see details
section       two properties quite intuitive 
following example shows solution satisfy comprehensiveness 
requires  g  implies  g   see work zhang 
      
example   consider bargaining situation player  s demand set x     p  q 
player  s demand set x     p  r   p  r  q propositional variables  assume
player ranks demands level  i e   demand sets singleton
partition   based assumption  easy know solution game
  q    r    therefore  solution comprehensive  for instance  q p q f   g 
p   f   g   
since solution satisfy comprehensiveness  according zhang        
logical version kalai smorodinsky solution  however  mean
solution less intuitive  although comprehensiveness common restriction belief
revision game theory  means desirable property bargaining solution 
example  q r involved conflict underlying bargaining
game  thus reasonable players keep irrelevant demands  addition 
solution syntax dependent  represent demand set x     p q 
x     p r   solution      
    fixed point property
besides generic properties  solution possesses another extraordinary logical property 
fixed point property  consider bargaining negotiation mutual persuasion  one
persuades accept demands  outcome negotiation result

risk on  cardinal utility specifies two sorts information  preference possible agreements  via ordering utility values  risk attitudes  via non linearity
utility function   however  second sort information  determines players
bargaining power  may lost ordinal transformation  meanwhile  bargaining
model based purely ordinal information preferences automatically solve
problem bargainers risk attitude even inexpressible model  therefore ordinal bargaining theory must supply facility describe information
ordinal preferences  including risk attitudes  paper  specify bargaining
situation logical structure  bargainers demands  goals beliefs described logical
statements  conflicts demands two players identified
consistency checking  importantly  bargainers attitudes towards risk expressible
model natural way  risk averse player tends give conflicting demand
relatively lower priority agreement could likely reached risk lover
would firmly entrench demands less care whether demands contradict
opponents 
issues worth investigation  firstly  shown solution
satisfies set logical properties game theoretic properties  interesting know
whether axiomatic system exactly characterizes solution  main
challenge construction solution syntax dependent  simply
impose logical closedness demand sets  lose desirable properties 
inclusion irrelevant items computational results  apply
assumption  shall need axioms specify way logical representation 
words  axioms specify demand set represented syntactically 
secondly  present work offers solution bilateral bargaining situations 
supply model bargaining agents  therefore current framework
deal issues demand formed   demand ranked
higher another  bargain effectively   interesting logic
agency used developed model bargaining agents logic interacts
logic bargaining 
finally  issues computational complexity proposed solution remain
unsolved  shown paper membership checking solution dphard p    clear yet upper bound lower bound gap
closed  think new complexity proof technique may needed challenge
