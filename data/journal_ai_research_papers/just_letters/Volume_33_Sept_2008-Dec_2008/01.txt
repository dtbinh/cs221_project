abstract
we present the design and analysis of the first fully expressive  iterative combinatorial
exchange  ice   the exchange incorporates a tree based bidding language  tbbl  that is
concise and expressive for ces  bidders specify lower and upper bounds in tbbl on their
value for different trades and refine these bounds across rounds  these bounds allow price
discovery and useful preference elicitation in early rounds  and allow termination with an
efficient trade despite partial information on bidder valuations  all computation in the
exchange is carefully optimized to exploit the structure of the bid trees and to avoid enumerating trades  a proxied interpretation of a revealed preference activity rule  coupled
with simple linear prices  ensures progress across rounds  the exchange is fully implemented  and we give results demonstrating several aspects of its scalability and economic
properties with simulated bidding strategies 

   introduction
combinatorial exchanges combine and generalize two different mechanisms  double auctions
and combinatorial auctions  in a double auction  da   multiple buyers and sellers trade
units of an identical good  mcafee         in a combinatorial auction  ca   a single seller
has multiple heterogeneous items up for sale  de vries   vohra        cramton  shoham 
  steinberg         each buyer in a ca may have complementarities  i want a and b 
or substitutabilities  i want a or b  between goods  and is provided with an expressive
bidding language to describe these preferences  a common goal in the design of both das
and cas is to implement the efficient allocation  which is the allocation that maximizes
total social welfare 
a combinatorial exchange  ce   parkes  kalagnanam    eso        is a combinatorial
double auction that brings together multiple buyers and sellers to trade multiple heterogeneous goods  ces have potential use in wireless spectrum allocation  cramton  kwerel

rights  and it is necessary to facilitate a complex multi way reallocation of resources  another potential application domain for ces is to allocate resources in shared distributed

systems  such as planetlab  fu  chase  chun  schwab    vahdat         ces can also find
use in task allocation in robot teams  making them a potentially powerful tool to the multiagent systems community  gerkey   mataric        bererton  gordon    thrun       
dias  zlot  kalra    stentz         finally  ces have promise as mechanisms for expressive
sourcing by multiple bid takers  perhaps representing different profit centers within an organization  see the associated work on expressive sourcing using one sided cas  sandholm 
      
this paper presents the design of the first fully expressive  iterative combinatorial exchange  ice   in designing an iterative exchange  we share the motivation of earlier work on
iterative cas  we wish to mitigate elicitation costs by focusing bidders  in this case through
price discovery and activity rules  on their values for relevant trades  this is important
because determining the value on even a single potential trade can be a challenging problem in complex domains  sandholm   boutilier        compte   jehiel         moreover 
bidders often wish to reveal as little information as possible to avoid leaking information to
competitors  in describing the central design principles that support the ice mechanism 
we highlight the following aspects 
 a bidder interacts with ice by first defining a structured representation of his valuation for different trades  defined in the tree based bidding language  tbbl   this
concisely defines the set of trades of interest to the bidder  the bidder must annotate
the tree with initial lower and upper bounds on his value for different trades 
 having lower and upper bounds on valuations allows the exchange to identify both a
provisional trade and provisional payments in each round  and to generate a provisional clearing price on each item in the market  in each round of ice  each bidder
is required to tighten the bounds on his tbbl bid so as to make precise which trade
is most preferred given the current prices 
 ice is a hybrid between a demand revealing process and a direct revelation mechanism  with simple  linear  prices guiding preference elicitation but bids submitted
through direct claims about valuation functions in the tbbl language  and these
expressive bids being finally used to clear the exchange 
when ice terminates  a payment rule is used to determine the payments made  and
received  by each participant  while suggesting that these payments be defined in a way
that seeks to mitigate opportunities for manipulation in the exchange  ice is agnostic to
the particular payment rule that is adopted  for a given rule  the prices that are quoted
in each round are defined in part to approximate these payments  when aggregated across
the provisional trade suggested for a bidder  for concreteness  we adopt the threshold
rule  parkes et al         in defining final payments  which minimizes the ex post regret
for truthful bidding across all budget balanced payment rules  when holding the bids from
other participants fixed  see also the work of milgrom           this is not to say that
   we are not aware of the existence of mechanism design solutions for approximately efficient  but truthful
 i e   with truthful bidding as a dominant strategy equilibrium  and budget balanced  sealed bid  i e  
non iterative  ces  nevertheless  it is true that any payment rules that are developed can be leveraged
directly within ice and would allow ice to inherit truthful bidding  i e   revising tbbl bounds to
remain consistent with a bidders true valuation  in an ex post nash equilibrium  just as can be achieved
in iterative generalized vickrey auctions  mishra   parkes        

  

fiice  an iterative combinatorial exchange

incentive issues related to payment rules are not important in the design of successful ces 
rather  this is just orthogonal to the design of ice and not the main focus of our work  we
do propose novel activity rules  which are themselves designed to mitigate opportunities for
strategic behavior 
we highlight the following technical contributions made in this work 
 the tree based bidding language  tbbl  extends earlier ca bidding languages to support bidders that wish to simultaneously buy and sell  the specification of valuation
bounds  and the use of generalized choose operators to provide more concise representations than or  and lgb  boutilier   hoos        nisan         tbbl can
be directly encoded within a mixed integer programming  mip  formulation of the
winner determination problem 
 despite quoting prices on items and not bundles of items  ice is able to converge
to the efficient trade with straightforward  i e   non strategic  bidders  efficiency is
established through duality theory when prices are sufficiently accurate  otherwise  a
direct proof based on reasoning about the upper and lower valuation bounds is always
available  even when the combinatorics of the instance preclude a duality based proof 
 preference elicitation is performed through the combination of two novel activity rules 
the first is a modified revealed preference activity rule  mrpar   and requires each
bidder to make precise which trade is most preferred in each round  the second is
a delta improvement activity rule  diar   and requires each bidder to refine his bid
to improve price accuracy or prove that no improvement is possible  when coupled
together these rules ensure that useful progress towards determining the efficient trade
is made in each round 
to summarize  there are three main reasons to prefer explicit value representations over
repeated demand reports in the context of an iterative ce   a  a provisional allocation can
be computed from round    since both upper and lower bounds on value are available   b  the
combinatorics of the domain can be directly handled in clearing the exchange and efficiency
is not limited by adopting simple  linear  prices   c  proofs of  approximate  efficiency
are available by reasoning directly with bounds on valuations and despite adopting simple
 linear  prices 
the exchange is fully implemented in java  with a c based mip solver   we present
scalability results showing performance across a wide number of bidders  goods and valuation complexity as well as benchmarks that provide a qualitative understanding of the
characteristics of our mechanism  our experimental results  with straightforward bidders 
show that the exchange quickly converges to the efficient trade  taking an average of only
  rounds for an example domain with     goods of    different types and   bidders with
valuation functions containing an average of     tbbl nodes  in this same domain  we
find that bidders can leave upwards of     of their maximum attainable value undefined
when the efficient trade is known  and     once final payments are determined  indicating
that bidders are able to leave large amounts of their value space unrefined  the exchange
terminates on these problems in an average of     minutes on a    ghz dual processor dualcore workstation with  gb of memory  this includes the time for all winner determination 
pricing  and activity rules  as well as the time to simulate agent bidding strategies

with simple prices on items  dunford  hoffman  menon  sultana    wilson        kwasnica 
ledyard  porter    demartini         in computing  approximately competitive  linear
prices  we generalize and extend these methods  building on the work of rassenti  smith 
and bulfin         these earlier papers consider bids on bundles individually  and find prices
that are exact on winning bids and minimize the pricing error to losing bids  generalizing
to the tbbl expressive language  we propose instead to compute prices that minimize the
worst case pricing error over all bidders  rather than bids on individual trades   considering
the most preferred trade consistent with the tbbl bid of each bidder  as in the work
of dunford et al         and kwasnica et al         we incorporate additional tie breaking
stages  in our case to lexicographically minimize the error and then to find prices that closely
approximate the provisional payments  this latter step appears to be novel 
linear prices are important in practical applications  such prices are adopted by the
fcc in their wireless spectrum auctions  cramton         within clock auctions for the
procurement of electricity generation  cramton         and are an essential part of the
proposed design for an airport landing slot auction at laguardia airport  ball et al        
linear competitive equilibrium prices exist in two sided markets with indivisibilities for
the assignment problem in which each agent will buy or sell a single item  but may be
interested in multiple different items   shapley   shubik         but in general linear 
competitive equilibrium prices will not exist in combinatorial markets with nonconvexities 
see the work of kelso and crawford         bikhchandani and mamer         bikhchandani
and ostroy         and oneill  sotkiewicz  hobbs  rothkopf  and stewart        for related
discussions 
ice has a proxied architecture in the sense that bidders submit and refine bounds
on tbbl bids directly to the exchange  with this information used to drive price dynamics
and ultimately to clear the exchange  earlier work has considered proxied approaches 
but in application to one sided ascending price cas  parkes   ungar      b  ausubel  
milgrom         given its focus on simple  linear prices  ice can be considered to provide
a two sided generalization of the clock proxy design of ausubel  cramton  and milgrom 
which has an initial stage of linear price discovery followed by a best and final sealedbid stage  ausubel et al          activity rules have been shown to be very important
in practice  for instance  the milgrom wilson activity rule that requires a bidder to be
active on a minimum percentage of the quantity of the spectrum for which it is eligible
to bid is a critical component of the auction rules used by the fcc for wireless spectrum
auctions  milgrom         ice adopts a variation on the clock proxy auctions revealedpreference activity rule 
it is well known that exact efficiency together with budget balance is not possible because
of the myerson satterthwaite impossibility result  myerson   satterthwaite         given

this  parkes et al  study sealed bid combinatorial exchanges and introduced the threshold
payment rule  parkes et al          see the work of milgrom        and day and raghavan        for a recent discussion  double auctions in which truthful bidding is in a dominant strategy equilibrium are known for unit demand settings  mcafee        and also for
slightly more expressive domains  babaioff   walsh        chu   shen         however 
no truthful  budget balanced mechanisms with useful efficiency properties are known for
the general ce problem 
voucher based schemes have been proposed as an alternative method to extend onesided cas to exchanges  kwerel   williams         such mechanisms collect all goods
from sellers and then run a one sided auction in which sellers can buy back their own
goods with vouchers used to provide a seller with a share of the revenue collected on their
own goods  although voucher based schemes can facilitate the design of exchanges through
one sided auction technology  the ice design offers the nice advantage of providing equal
and symmetric expressiveness to all participants  we are not aware of any previous studies
of fully expressive iterative ces  smith  sandholm  and simmons previously studied iterative ces  but handle only limited expressiveness and adopt a direct query based approach
with an enumerative internal data structure that does not scale  smith et al          a
novel feature in their earlier design  not supported here  is item discovery  where the items
available to trade need not be known in advance  earlier work has also considered sealed bid
combinatorial exchanges for the purpose of contingent trades in financial markets  including
aspects of expressiveness and winner determination  saatcioglu et al         
several bidding languages for cas have previously been proposed  arguably the most
compelling of which allow bidders to explicitly represent the logical structure of their valuation over goods via standard logical operators  we refer to these as logical bidding
languages  nisan         closest in generality to tbbl is the lgb language  boutilier  
hoos         which allows for arbitrarily nested levels  combining goods and trades by the
standard propositional logic operators  and also provides a k of operator  used to represent
a willingness to pay for any k trades it quantifies over  see also the work of rothkopf  pekec 
and harstad        for a restricted tree based bidding language  in a key insight  boutilier
specifies a mip formulation for winner determination  wd  using lgb   and provides positive empirical performance results using a commercial solver  suggesting the computational
feasibility of moving to this more expressive logical language  boutilier         tbbl shares
some structural elements with the lgb language but has important differences in its semantics  in lgb   the semantics are those of propositional logic  with the same items in an
allocation able to satisfy a tree in multiple places  although this can make lgb especially
concise in some settings  the semantics that we propose provide representational locality  so
that the value of one component in a tree can be understood independently from the rest
of the tree

   preliminaries
the basic environment considers a set of bidders  n               n   who are interested in
trading multiple units of distinct  indivisible goods  where the set of different types of goods
is denoted g               m   each bidder has an initial endowment of goods and a valuation
for different trades  let x     x             x n   denote the initial endowment of goods  with
x i    x i            x im   and x ij  z  to indicate the number of units of good type j  g
initially held by bidder i  n   a trade                 n   denotes the change in allocation 
with i    i            imp
  and 
ij  z denoting the change in the number of units of item j
p
to bidder i  let m   in jg x ij denote the total supply in the exchange  we write
i   to denote that bidder i is active in the trade  i e   buys or sells at least one item 
    the efficient trade
each bidder has a value vi  i    r for his component of trade   this value can be positive
or negative  and represents the change in value between the final allocation x i   i and
the initial allocation x i   the valuation and initial allocation information is private to each
bidder  and we assume that there are no externalities  so that each bidders value depends

only on his individual trade  we assume free disposal 
p so that vi  i    vi  i   for trade


i  i   i e   for which ij  ij for all j  let v     i vi  i   
utility is modeled as quasi linear  with ui  i   p    vi  i    p for trade i and payment
p  r  this implies that bidders are modeled as being risk neutral and assumes that
there are no budget constraints  the payment  p  can be negative  indicating the bidder
may receive a payment for the trade  we use the term payoff interchangeably with utility 
because of quasi linearity  any pareto optimal  i e   efficient  trade will maximize the social
welfare  which is equivalent to the total increase in value to all bidders due to the trade 
given an instance of the ce problem  defined by tuple  v  x     i e   a valuation profile
v    v            vn   and an initial allocation x     x             x n    the efficient trade    is defined

by free disposal  we can impose strict balance in the supply and demand of goods at the

solution in constraints      i e   we can allocate unwanted items to any bidder  we adopt
f x    to denote the set of feasible trades  given these constraints and given an initial
allocation x    and fi  x    for the set of feasible trades to bidder i  note that valuation
function vi cannot be explicitly represented as a value for each possible trade to bidder i 
because the number of such trades scales as o sm    where s is the maximal number of units
of any item in the market and there are m different items  the tbbl language  introduced
in section    leads to a concise formulation of the efficient trade problem as a mixed integer
program 
the initial allocation x i may be private to agent i  we assume throughout that bidders
are truthful in revealing this information  which we motivate by supposing that participants
cannot sell items that they do not actually own  or pay a suitably high penalty if they do  
    competitive equilibrium prices
linear prices                  m    define
pa price j on each good so that the price to bidder
i on a trade  is defined as p  i     j ij j   i    such prices play an important role
in ice  of particular interest is the set of competitive equilibrium prices 
definition   linear prices  are competitive equilibrium  eq  prices for ce problem
 v  x    if there is some feasible trade   f x    such that 
vi  i    p  i    vi  i    p  i   

i  fi  x    

   

for every bidder i  we say that such a trade    is supported by prices  
theorem    bikhchandani   ostroy        any trade  supported by competitive equilibrium prices  is an efficient trade 
in practice  exact eq prices are unlikely to exist  instead  it is useful to define the
concept of approximate eq prices and an approximately efficient trade 
definition   linear prices  are  approximate competitive equilibrium  eq  prices for
ce problem  v  x    and   r    if there is some feasible trade   f x    such that 
vi  i    p  i       vi  i    p  i   

i  fi  x    

   

for every bidder i 
at  approximate eq prices  there is some trade for which every bidder i is within    
of maximizing his utility  furthermore  say that trade  is z approximate if the total value
of the trade is within z of the total value of the efficient trade 
theorem   any trade  supported by  approximate eq prices  is a   min m  n   approximate efficient trade

here a  x    is the maximal number of bidders that can trade in a feasible trade given x   
the second inequality follows because no more bidders can trade than there are number of

   step one  a tbbl based sealed bid combinatorial exchange
we first flesh out the details for a non iterative  tbbl based ce in which each bidder
submits a sealed bid in the tbbl language 
bidding language  the tree based bidding language  tbbl  is designed to be expressive
and concise  to be entirely symmetric with respect to buyers and sellers  and to easily provide
for bidders that are both buying and selling goods  i e   ranging from simple swaps to highly
complex trades  bids are expressed as annotated bid trees  and define a bidders change in
value for all possible trades  the main feature of tbbl is that it has a general intervalchoose logical operator on internal nodes coupled with a rich semantics for propagating
values within the tree  leaves of the tree are annotated with traded items and all nodes are
annotated with changes in values  either positive or negative   tbbl is designed such that
these changes in value are expressed on trades rather than the total value of allocations 
examples are provided in figures   and   
consider bid tree ti from bidder i  let   ti denote a node in the tree  and let
vi     r denote the value specified at node   perhaps negative   let leaf  ti    ti be
the subset of nodes representing the leaves of ti and let child     ti denote the children
of node   all nodes except leaves are labeled with the interval choose operator icyx    
each leaf  is labeled as a buy or sell  with units qi    j   z for the good j associated with
leaf   and qi    j        otherwise  the same good j may simultaneously occur in multiple
leaves of the tree  given the semantics of the tree described below 
the ic operator defines a range on the number of children that can be  and must
be  satisfied for node  to be satisfied  an icyx    node  where x and y are non negative
integers  indicates that the bidder is willing to pay for the satisfaction of at least x and
at most y of his children  with suitable values for x and y the operator can include many
logical connectors  for instance  icnn    on node  with n children is equivalent to an and
operator  icn     is equivalent to an or operator  and ic      is equivalent to an xor
operator  
we say that the satisfaction of an icyx    node is defined by the following two rules 
   this equivalence implies that tbbl can directly express the xor  or and xor or languages  nisan 
      

  

fiice  an iterative combinatorial exchange

r  node  with icyx    may be satisfied only if at least x and at most y of its children
are satisfied 
r  if some node  is not satisfied  then none of its children may be satisfied 
one can consider r  as a first pass that defines a set of candidates for satisfaction  this
candidate set is then refined by r   besides defining how value is propagated  by virtue
of r  our logical operators act as constraints on what trades are acceptable and provide
necessary and sufficient conditions  
given a tree ti   the  change in  value of a trade  is defined as the sum of the values on
all satisfied nodes  where the set of satisfied nodes is chosen to provide the maximal total
value  let sat i            denote whether node  in tree ti of bidder i is satisfied  with
sat i    sat i       ti    for solution sat i to be valid for tree ti and trade i   written
sat i  valid  ti   i    then rules r  and r  must hold for all internal nodes    ti leaf  ti

equation     enforces the interval choose constraints  by ensuring that no more and no
less than the appropriate number of children are satisfied for any node that is satisfied  the
constraint also ensures that any time a node other than the root is satisfied  its parent is
also satisfied  we further require  for sat i  valid  ti   i    that the total increase in quantity
of each item across all satisfied leaves is no greater than the total number of units awarded
in the trade

leaf  ti  

by free disposal  we allow here for a trade to assign additional units of an item overand above that required in order to activate leaves in the bid tree  this works for sellers
as well as buyers  for sellers a trade is negative and this requires that the total number of
items indicated sold in the tree is at least the total number of items traded away from
the bidder in the trade 
given these constraints  the total value of trade i   given bid tree ti from bidder i  is
defined as the solution to an optimization problem

airline wishes to acquire at least two and possibly three of the evening slots  however  it

in working through numerous examples we frequently found it very cumbersome to
capture even simple trades in languages that specified values on allocations  as is the case
with all existing languages  indeed  in earlier work  we demonstrate natural instances for
which tbbl is exponentially more concise than or  and lgb  cavallo et al         in
fact  tbbls conciseness is incomparable to or  and lgb but can be extended in simple
ways to strictly dominate these earlier languages 
winner determination  the problem of determining an efficient trade given bids is
called the winner determination  wd  problem  the wd problem in cas  and thus also
in ces  is np hard  rothkopf et al          the approach we adopt here is to formulate the problem as a mixed integer program  mip   and solve with branch and cut algorithms  nemhauser   wolsey         a similar approach has proved successful for solving
the wd problem in cas  de vries   vohra        boutilier        sandholm        
given some tree ti   it is useful to adopt notation   i to denote a node   ti that is
satisfied by trade i   we can now formulate the wd problem for bid trees t    t            tn

figure    ice system overview
annotates a single tbbl tree with upper and lower bounds on his valuation  the ice
mechanism then proceeds in rounds  as illustrated in figure   
ice is a proxied design in which each bidder has a proxy to facilitate his valuation
refinement  in each round  a bidder responds to prices in interacting with his proxy agent
in order to tighten the bounds on his tbbl tree and meet the activity rules  the exchange
chooses a provisional valuation profile  denoted v     v            vn   in the figure   with the
valuation vi for each bidder picked to fall within the bidders current valuation bounds
 and to tend towards the lower valuation bound as progress is made towards determining
the final trade   then  the exchange computes a provisional trade  and checks whether
the conditions for moving to a last and final round are satisfied  approximate equilibrium
prices are then computed based on valuation profile v  and trade  and a new round
begins  in the last and final round  the final payments and the trade are computed in terms
of lower valuations  the semantics are that these lower bounds guarantee that a bidder
is willing to pay at least this amount  or receive a payment of this amount  in order to
complete the trade 
let v i and v i denote the lower and upper valuation functions reported by bidder i in
a particular round of ice  and adopt wd v  to denote the wd problem for valuation
profile v    v            vn    ice is parameterized by a target approximation error          
which requires that the total value from the optimal trade  given the current lower bound
valuation profile  i e    solves wd v   is close to the total value from the efficient trade i

however  the true valuation v and thus the trade  are uncertain within ice and thus we
will later introduce techniques to estblish this bound 
in each round  ice goes through the following steps 
   if this is the last and final round  then implement the trade that solves wd v  and
collect threshold payments defined on valuations v  stop

in transitioning to the next round  the proxy agents are responsible for guiding bidders
to make refinements to their lower  and upper bound valuations in order to meet activity
rules that ensure progress towards the efficient trade across rounds  in what follows  we  a 
extend tbbl to capture lower and upper valuation bounds   b  describe our two activity
rules   c  explain how we compute price feedback   d  provide our main theoretical results 
in developing theoretical and experimental results about ice we assume straightforward
bidders  so that bidders refine upper and lower bounds on valuations to keep their true
valuation consistent with the bounds 
extending tbbl  we first extend tbbl to allow bidder i to report a lower and upper
bound  v i     v i     on the value of each node   ti   which in turn induces valuation
functions v i  ti   i   and v i  ti   i    using the exact same semantics as in       the bounds
on a trade can be interpreted as bounding the payment that the bidder considers acceptable 
the bidder commits to complete the trade for a payment less than or equal to the lowerbound and to refuse to complete a trade for any payment greater than the upper bound  the
exact value  and thus true willingness to pay  remains unknown except when v i      v i   
on all nodes  we say that bid tree ti for bidder i is well formed if v i     v i    for all
nodes   ti   in this case we also have v i  ti   i    v i  ti   i   for all trades i   we refer
to the difference v i     v i    as the value uncertainty on node   the efficient trade can
often be determined with only partial information about bidder valuations  consider the
following simple variant on example   
example   the structure of the bidders trees in figure   is the same as in example   but
the nodes are annotated with bounds  let x         denote bidder  s true value for buy
c and y         denote bidder  s true value for sell c  the three feasible trades
are      trade a and c      trade b and c      no trade  the first trade is already provably
efficient  fixing x and y  its minimal value is     xy and this is at least     xy 
the value of the second trade  moreover  its worst case value is                  the value
of the null trade

figure    two bidders  each with partial value information defined on their bid tree  one

    activity rules
activity rules are used to guide the preference elicitation process in each round of ice 
without an activity rule  a rational bidder would likely wait until the very last moment to
revise his valuation information  free riding on the price discovery enabled by the bids of
other participants  if every bidder were to behave this way then the exchange would reduce
to a sealed bid mechanism and lose its desirable properties   thus  activity rules are critical
in mitigating opportunities for strategic behavior  
ice employs two activity rules  in presenting our activity rules  we will not specify the
explicit consequences of failing to meet an activity rule  one simple possibility is that the
default action is to automatically set the upper valuation bound on every node in a bid
tree to the maximum of the provisional price on a node  and the lower bound value on
that node  this is entirely analogous to when a bidder in an ascending clock auction stops
bidding at a price  he is not permitted to bid at a higher price again in future rounds 
modified revealed preference activity rule  mrpar   the first rule  mrpar 
is based on a simple idea  we require bidders to refine their valuation bounds in each round 
so that there is some trade that is optimal  i e   maximizes surplus  for the bidder given the
current prices and for all possible valuations consistent with the bounds  mrpar is loosely
based around the revealed preference based activity rule  advocated for the clock proxy
auction in a one sided ca  ausubel et al         
let vi  ti for tbbl tree ti denote that valuation vi is consistent with the value bounds
in the tree  if the bounds are tight everywhere  then vi is exactly the valuation function
defined by tree ti   a simple variant  rpar   requires that there is enough information in
valuation bounds to establish that one trade is weakly preferred to all other trades at the
prices  i e 
i  fi  x    s t  vi  i    p  i    vi  i    p  i   

vi  ti   i  fi  x   

 rpar 

note that a bidder can always meet this rule by defining an exact valuation vi and tight
value bounds on every node in his bid tree  in this case  trade i  arg maxi fi  x     vi  i   
   this problem has been evocatively described as the snake in the grass problem  see kwerels forward
in milgroms book        
   there is no conflict here with our assumption about straightforward bidding  we design for the strategic
case despite assuming straightforward bidding to provide for tractable theoretical and experimental
analysis  moreover  the presence of activity rules helps to motivate straightforward bidding 
   the provisional price on a node is defined as the minimal total price across all feasible trades for which
the subtree rooted at the node is satisfied

p  i    satisfies rpar  we say that prices  are strict eq prices for  v       when 
vi  i    p  i     vi  i    p  i   

i  fi  x       i    

    

for every bidder i  n  
theorem   if prices  are strict eq prices for provisional valuation profile v  and trade
   and every bidder i retains vi in his bid tree after meeting rpar  then trade  is
efficient when all bidders are straightforward 
proof  fix bidder i  let i denote the trade that satisfies rpar  because vi is consistent
with the revised bid tree of bidder i  we have 
vi  i    p  i    vi  i    p  i   

i  fi  x    

    

moreover  we must have i   i   because vi  i    p  i     vi  i    p  i   by the
strictness of prices  instantiating rpar with this trade  and with true valuations vi  ti
 since bidders are straightforward   we have 
vi  i    p  i    vi  i    p  i   

i  fi  x    

    

from which prices p are eq prices with respect to true valuations  the efficiency claim
then follows from the welfare theorem  theorem   

in particular  the provisional trade is efficient given strict eq prices when every bidder
meets the rule without modifying his bounds in any way  strict eq prices are required to
prevent problems involving ties

figure    an example to illustrate the failure of the simple rpar rule without strict eq
prices  true values are shown in bold and are such that the efficient outcome is
no trade 
example   the tbbl trees shown in figure   will have no trade occur at the truthful
valuation  which is indicated in bold between the value bounds   however  suppose      so
that at the provisional valuations it is efficient for a to be traded  prices           are eq
 but not strict eq  prices given v  and    with the buyer indifferent between buying a and
buying b and the seller indifferent between selling a  selling a and b  or making no sale 
the buyer passes rpar without changing his bounds because the bounds already establish
that he  weakly  prefers a to b  and prefers a to no trade  at all possible valuations 
similarly  the seller passes rpar without changing his bounds because the bounds establish
that he weakly prefers no trade to selling any combination of a and b given the current
prices  thus  we have no activity even though the current provisional trade is inefficient 
  

filubin  juda  cavallo  lahaie  shneidman   parkes

in order to better handle these sorts of ties  we slightly strengthen rpar to modified
rpar  mrpar   which requires that there exists some i  fi  x    such that
i  i   i   vi      
and either i

trade i over i given vi and prices        is rpar and the additional requirements enforce
that the satisfying trade i is either i or strictly preferred to i   this need to show a
strict preference over i prevents the deadlock shown in example    the seller has shown
only a weak preference for not trading over selling a  with mrpar  the seller must also
show that he strictly prefers i   in this case by reducing the upper bounds on both a and
b  thus ensuring progress 
the actual rule adopted in ice is  mrpar  parameterized with accuracy parameter
     and providing a relaxation of mrpar which is useful even when there are no exact
eq prices defined with respect to     v    in some round 
definition   given provisional trade    linear prices   and accuracy parameter     
 mrpar requires that every bidder i refines his value bounds so that his tbbl tree ti
satisfies 
i  i   i   vi     

vi  ti   i  fi

    

or  that there is some i  fi  x    such that
i  i   i   vi

it is a simple matter to check that  mrpar reduces to mrpar for       phrasing
the description to allow for the rule to be interpreted with and without the  relaxation 
 mrapr requires that each bidder must adjust his valuation bounds to establish that the
provisional trade is  within  of   maximizing profit for all possible valuations       or some
other trade satisfies rpar      and is strictly preferred  by at least   to the provisional
trade       just as for rpar  one can show that a bidder can always meet  mrpar  for
any   by defining an exact valuation  
lemma   if every bidder i meets  mrpar without precluding vi from his updated bid
tree  and prices  are  approximate eq prices with respect to provisional valuation profile
v  and trade    and bidders are straightforward  then the provisional trade is a
  min m  n    approximate efficient trade 
   let vi denote this valuation  if  mrpar is not satisfied via      then i  arg maxi fi  x     vi  i   
p     will satisfy  mrpar  this satisfies      by construction  now  let i denote the trade with









vi  i    p  i     vi  
i    p  i       we have vi  i    p  i    vi  i    p  i     vi  i    p  i

proof  fix bidder i  by  eq  we have i  i   i   vi     for all i  fi  x     consider
any i    i   because vi remains in the bid tree  we must have i  i   i   vi     and
 mrpar cannot be satisfied via      and       therefore   mrpar is satisfied for every
bidder via      and with provisional trade  the satisfying trade  therefore we prove that
prices    are  approximate eq prices for all valuations  and including the true valuation
since bidders are straightforward and this is within their bounds  the efficiency of the trade
follows from theorem   

this in turn provides a simple proof for the efficiency of ice when approximate ce
prices exist upon termination  suppose that ice is defined to terminate as soon as prices
are  accurate and v  is retained in the bid tree by all bidders in meeting the activity rule 
or when quiescence is reached and no bidder refines his bounds in meeting the rule  in this
variation  the provisional trade  is the trade finally implemented 
theorem   ice with  mrpar is   min m  n    efficient when prices are  accurate with
respect to  v       upon termination and bidders are straightforward 
proof  when ice terminates either  a  prices are  accurate and v  is retained in the
bid tree by all bidders and we can appeal directly to lemma    or  b  no bidder refines his
bounds in meeting  mrpar  in which case vi remains in the space of valuations consistent
with the bid tree for each bidder 

we also have the following simple corollary  which considers the property of ice for a
domain in which approximately accurate eq prices exist 
corollary   ice with  mrpar is   min m  n    efficient when  accurate competitive
equilibrium prices exist for all valuations in the valuation domain and when all bidders are
straightforward 
specializing to domains in which exact eq prices exist  e g   for unit demand preferences
as in the assignment model of shapley and shubik        see also the work of bikhchandani
and mamer        then ice with mrpar is efficient for straightforward bidders

remark  computation and bidder feedback  the definition of mrpar naively
suggests that checking for compliance requires explicitly considering all valuations vi  ti
and all trades i  fi  x     fortunately  this is not necessary  we present in the appendix a
method to check mrpar given prices   provisional trade i and bid tree ti by solving three
mips  moreover  we explain that the solution to these mips also provides nice feedback for
bidders  ice can automatically identify a set of nodes at which a bidder needs to increase
his lower bound and a set of nodes at which a bidder needs to decrease his upper bound in
meeting mrpar 
delta improvement activity rule  diar   with only  mrpar  it is quite possible
for ice to get stuck  with all bidders satisfying the activity rule without changing their
bounds  but with the prices less than  accurate  with respect to     v      therefore  we
need an activity rule that will continue to drive a reduction in value uncertainty  i e   the
gap between upper bound values and lower bound values  even in the face of inaccurate
prices  and ideally in a way that remains price directed in the sense of using prices to
determine which trades  and in turn which nodes in tbbl trees  each bidder should be
focused on 
we introduce for this purpose a second  and novel  activity rule  diar   which fills
this role by requiring bidders to reveal information so as to improve price accuracy and 
in the limit  full information on the nodes that matter  defined this way  the diar rule
very nicely complements the  mrpar rule  because we can establish the efficiency of
the provisional trade directly via the valuation bounds  as we will see in section      we
do not actually need fully accurate prices in order to close the exchange  thus  the diar
rule does not imply that bidders will reveal full information  rather  the presence of diar
ensures both good performance in practice as well as good theoretical properties  in our
experiments we enable diar in all rounds of ice  and it fires in parallel with  mrpar 
in practice  we see that most of the progress in refining valuation information occurs due to
 mrpar  and that all the progress in early rounds occurs due to  mrpar  experimental
support for this is provided in section    
before providing the specifics of diar  we identify a node   ti in the bid tree of
bidder i as interesting for some fixed instance  v  x     when the node is satisfied in some
feasible trade  we have the following simple lemma 
   in a variation on the way ice is defined  diar could be used only in rounds in which the price error for
the provisional valuation and trade is greater than the error associated with  mrpar  this is because
 mrpar is sufficient for approximate efficiency when prices are accurate enough

lemma   if there is no value uncertainty on any interesting nodes in the bid trees of any
biders  and bidders are straightforward  then  is efficient 
proof  no value uncertainty and thus exact information about the value on all interesting
nodes implies that the difference in value is exactly known between all pairs of feasible
trades because for all uninteresting nodes  either the node is never satisfied in any trade
 and thus its value does not matter  or the node is satisfied in every trade and thus its actual
value does not matter in defining the difference in value between pairs of trades  only the
difference in value between pairs of trades is important in determining the efficient trade 

diar focuses a bidder in particular on interesting nodes that correspond to trades for
which the pricing error is large  and where this error could still be reduced by refining the
valuation bounds on the node  given prices  and provisional trade i   the main focus of
k
diar is the following upper bound  i   on the amount by which prices  might misprice
some trade ki  fi  x    with respect to bidder is true valuation 
k

 i   max
 vi  ki    p  ki     vi  i    p  i    

vi ti

    

we call this the diar error on trade ki   and note that it depends on the current
prices as well as the current bid tree and provisional trade  but not the true valuation which
is unknown to the center  the diar error provides an upper bound on the additional payoff
that the bidder could achieve from trade ki over trade i   if we order trades   i    i          so
 
that  i has maximal diar error  then  i  i   where i   maxi fi  x     vi  i    p  i   
 vi  i    p  i     is the pricing error with respect to the provisional trade and provisional
valuation profile  this is the error that the pricing algorithm is designed to minimize in
each round  and the same error that is used in theorem   in reference to  accurate prices 
thus  we see that the maximal diar error also bounds the amount by which prices are
 
approximate eq prices  and that if  i    for all bidders i then the current prices  are
exact eq prices with respect to     v    
to satisfy diar a bidder must reduce the diar error on the trade with the largest error
for which the error can be reduced  some error may just be intrinsic given the current prices
and not because of uncertainty about the bidders valuation   or establish by providing exact
value information throughout the tree that none of the diar error on any trades is due
to value uncertainty  figure   illustrates the difference between mrpar and diar  a
bidder can satisfy mrpar by making it clear that the lower bound on payoff from some
trade is greater than the upper bound on all other trades  but still leave large uncertainty
about value  diar requires that a bidder also refine this upper bound if it is on a node
that corresponds to a trade for which the diar error  and thus potentially the actual
approximation in prices  is large  the rule is illustrated in figure   
diar is parameterized by some      we refer to the formal rule as  diar 
definition   to satisfy  diar given provisional trade i and prices   the bidder must
modify his valuation bounds to 
 a  reduce the diar error on some trade  ji  fi  x     by at least  and
k

 b  prove that error  i cannot be improved by  for all trades ki  fi  x    for    k   j

a decrease of      is impossible by raising the lower bound on buy c to       however

lemma   when ice incorporates diar  a straightforward bidder must eventually reveal
complete value information on all interesting nodes in his bid tree as     
proof  fix provisional trade i and consider trade   i  fi  x       i   with the maximal
diar error  continue to assume straightforward bidders  recall that vi    denotes a
bidders true value on node  in his tbbl tree  by case analysis on nodes   ti   meeting
the diar rule on this trade as     requires 
 i  nodes    i   i   decrease the upper bound to vi     the true value  to reduce the
error  increase the lower bound to vi    to prove that further progress is not possible 
 ii  nodes   i    i   increase the lower bound to vi     the true value  to reduce
the error  decrease the upper bound to vi    to prove that further progress is not
possible 
 iii  nodes   i   i   no change is required 
 iv  nodes  
   i  i   no change is required 
continue to fix some i   and consider now the impact of diar as     and as the
rule is met for successive trades  moving from  i to  i and onwards  eventually  the value
bounds on all nodes  
  i but in at least one other feasible trade are driven to truth by
 i   and the value bounds on all nodes   i but not in at least one other feasible trade
are driven to truth by  ii   noting that the null trade is always feasible  the bidder will
ultimately reveal complete value information except on nodes that are not satisfied in any
feasible trade 

putting this together we have the following simple theorem  which considers the convergence property of ice when diar is the only activity rule 
theorem   ice with the  diar rule will terminate with the efficient trade when all
bidders are straightforward and as     
proof  immediate by lemma   and lemma   

in practice  we use both  mrpar and diar and the role of diar is to ensure convergence in instances for which there do not exist good  supporting eq prices  the use
of diar does not lead  in any case  to full revelation of bidder valuations because we can
prove efficiency directly in terms of valuation bounds on different trades  see section      
remark  computation and bidder feedback  we present in the appendix a method
to check  diar given prices   provisional trade i   the bidders bid tree from the past
round and proposed new bid tree by solving two mips  moreover  the solution to these
mips also provides nice feedback for bidders  ice can automatically identify the trade 
and in turn the corresponding nodes in the bid tree  for which the bidder must provide

    generating linear prices
given the provisional trade    provisional valuations v    and given that provisional payments have also been determined  according to the payment rule  such as threshold 
adopted in the exchange   approximate clearing prices are computed in each round according to the following rules 
i  accuracy  acc   first  we compute prices that minimize the maximal error in the
best response constraints across all bidders 
ii  fairness  fair   second  we break ties to prefer prices that minimize the maximal
deviation from provisional payments across all bidders 
iii  balance  bal   third  we break ties to prefer prices that minimize the maximal
difference in price across all items 
taken together  these steps are designed to promote the informativeness of prices in
driving progress across rounds  balance is well motivated in domains where items are more
likely to be similar in value than dissimilar  preferring prices to be similar across items
and rejecting extremal prices  note that these prices may ascend or descend from round
to round  but that they will in general tend towards increasing accuracy  as we shall see
experimentally in section

one seller interested in selling ab  here the buyers and sellers values for each item are
  and    respectively  the efficient outcome given these values is for the trade to complete 
acc requires     a  b      and thus allows a range of prices  the threshold payment
splits the difference  so that the buyer pays    to the seller and so fair adds the constraint

these prices minimize the maximal loss in payoff across all bidders for trade  compared to the trade that a bidder would most prefer given provisional valuation v    i e  
minimize the maximal value of i  i   i   vi    where i   arg maxi fi  x     vi  i    p  i    
prices that solve this lp are then refined lexicographically  fixing the worst case pricing error  acc  and then working down to try to additionally minimize the next largest pricing
error and so on  given maximally accurate prices  this then triggers a series of lexicographical refinements to best approximate the payments  fair  without reducing the pricing
accuracy  and eventually a series of lexicographical refinements to try to maximally balance prices across distinct items  bal   in addition to further improving the quality of the
prices  this process also ensures uniqueness of prices 
each of the accuracy  fairness and balance problems have an exponential number of
constraints because the price accuracy constraints       which are carried forward into
the subsequent stages  are defined over all trades i  fi  x    and all bidders i  it is
therefore infeasible to even write these problems down  rather than solve them explicitly 
we use constraint generation  e g  bertsimas   tsitsiklis        and dynamically generate
a sufficient subset of constraints  constraint generation  cg  considers a relaxed program
that only contains a manageable subset of the constraints  and solves this to optimality 
given a solution to this relaxed program  a subproblem is used to either prove that the
solution is optimal to the full program  or find a violated constraint in the full problem
that is then introduced and the  now strengthened  relaxed program resolved  in this case
the subproblem is a variation of the winner determination ip from section    and can be
concisely formulated and solved via branch and cut  
    establishing bounds on efficiency
consider some round t in ice  the round starts with the announcement of prices  denote
them  t   and the provisional trade  the round ends with every bidder having met the
 mrpar and  diar activity rules  the question to address is  what can be established
about the efficiency of the trade defined on lower bound valuations at the end of the round 
it is perhaps unsurprising that mrpar by itself is sufficient to provide efficiency claims
when prices are suitably accurate  what is interesting is that the coupling of mrpar
with diar ensures that ice converges to a provably efficient trade in all cases  with
efficiency often established independently of prices by reasoning directly about lower and
upper valuation bounds  for the theoretical analysis of convergence to efficiency  we assume
straightforward bidders  by which we mean a bidder that always retains his true valuation
within the valuation bounds   all results could equivalently be phrased in terms of efficiency
claims with respect to reported valuations  
at the closing of each round  ice makes a determination about whether to move to
the last and final round  bidders are notified when this occurs  this last and final round
   the pricing step is the most computationally intensive of all steps in ice and therefore heavily optimized 
in practice  we have found it useful to employ heuristics to seed the set of constraints used in cg  we
have also developed algorithmic techniques to speed the search for the appropriate set of constraints
in the context of lexicographic refinement  provisional locking of multiple lexicographic values for each
cg check  and lazy constraint checks in which only a subset of the conditions for cg are routinely
checked  even though the complete set is eventually enforced  please see the technical report at www 
eecs harvard edu  blubin ice for complete details of the pricing method

provides a final opportunity for bidders to update their lower valuation bound information
 without exceeding their upper bounds   the exchange finally terminates with the efficient
trade and payments determined with respect to the lower valuation bounds  it is these
lower bounds that can be considered to bep
the ultimate bid submitted by each bidder when
ice terminates  let   arg maxf  x    i v i  i   denote the trade that is optimal given
the lower bound valuations  as explained in section    ice is parameterized by target
approximation error     providing a lower bound on the relative efficiency of  to the
efficient trade  for true valuations  the challenge is to obtain useful bounds on the
relative efficiency eff   of trade   we provide two methods  one of which is price based
and uses duality theory and the second of which directly reasons about the bounds on bidder
valuations  we now consider each in turn 
a price based proof of efficiency  we have already seen in section     that a bound on
the efficiency of provisional trade  can sometimes be established via prices  this provides
a simple method to establish a bound on the efficiency of trade   fix some      for v 
denoting the provisional valuation profile at the start of round t  and  the corresponding
provisional trade  we know that if
 a  bidders meet  mrpar while leaving v  within their bounds 
 b  prices  t were  approximate eq prices for v  and    and
 c   is equal to   i e   the efficient trade given the refined lower bound valuations 
then trade
 is a   min m  n    approximation
to the efficient trade  by theorem    we

which we define as  price   conditioned on  ac  being met  so that the bound is available 
it will satisfy  price   for a small enough  parameter  when the bound is not available
we set  price      
a direct proof of efficiency  we also provide a complementary  direct  method to
establish the relative efficiency of  by working with the refined valuation bounds at the
end of round t  first  given a bid tree ti   it is useful to define the perturbed valuation
with respect to a trade i   by assigning the following values to each node  

v i      if   sat i  i  
vi     
    
v i      otherwise 
where   sat i  i   if and only if node  is satisfied given tree ti and lower bound valuations
v i on nodes  and given trade i   the valuation function vi associated with tbbl tree ti
is defined to minimize the value on nodes satisfied by trade i and maximize the value on
other nodes  with this concept  and given the valuation bounds  we can now establish the
following bound

 b  there is no trade even at optimistic  i e   upper bound  valuations 
combining this with theorem    we immediately get our main result 
theorem   when ice incorporates  mrpar and  diar and when all bidders are
straightforward  then the exchange terminates with a trade that is within target approximation error    for any     as     
the use of  diar by itself is sufficient to establish this result  however  it is the use
of prices and mrpar that drives most elicitation in practice  particularly as we fix  in
 mrpar to a tiny constant in actual use  empirical support for this  along with the
quality of the price based bound and the direct efficiency bounds  is provided in section   
for the  parameter in  diar  we find that a simple rule

works well  this tends towards zero as more value information is revealed by participants 
one last element of the design of ice is the precise method by which the provisional
valuation profile v    v        v is constructed  this is important because it is then
  

filubin  juda  cavallo  lahaie  shneidman   parkes

used to determine the provisional trade and price feedback  a simple approach that works
well is to define     max       eff    we find that the lower bound of     is a useful heuristic
for early rounds when  eff is likely to be small  making ice adopt a provisional valuation
in the middle of the valuation bounds when not much is known  the effect is then to push
 towards   and thus v  towards v as the efficiency bound  eff improves   

   illustrative examples
in this section we illustrate the behavior of the exchange on two simple examples  these
examples are provided to give a qualitative feel for its behavior  to construct the examples
we populate ice with very simple  automated bidding agents  these agents use mipguided heuristics to minimize the amount of information revealed in the course of passing
the activity rules  while maintaining their true value within their lower  and upper bounds
 i e   they act in a straightforward way   their reluctance to reveal information models
a basic tenet of our design  that it is costly for participants to refine and then reveal
information about their values for different trades  a detailed explanation of the operation
of these bidding agents is provided in the appendix 
in this section  and also in presenting our main experimental results  we do not move to
a last and final round  rather  the bidding agents are programmed to continue to improve
their bids past the round at which efficiency is already proved  and when a last and final
round would ordinarily be declared   and until payments are within some desired accuracy
tolerance  we do this to avoid the need to program agents with a strategy for how to bid
in the last and final round

    in some domains  it may also be important to require that payments  rather than just the efficiency
of trade   be accurate enough before moving to the last and final round  a bound on payments can
be computed in an analogous way to that on efficiency  whether this is required in practice is likely
domain specific and to depend  for instance  on whether the payments tend to be accurate anyway by
the time the trade is approximately accurate  and also on the impact on strategic behavior

in this more complex example  it takes   rounds  as illustrated in figure    a   for a trade
to be found in the pessimistic trade  revelation drives progress towards a completed trade 
and as we can see in figure    b   this is reflected in falling prices on the goods  thus we
can see that the price feedback is providing accurate information to the participants  only
when the price eventually becomes low enough do the buying bidders actually want a trade
to occur and that is also when the exchanges provisional trade switches  it is also worth
noting that the greater valuations the seller and swapper place on good a result in a net
higher price than that for good b 

   experimental analysis
in this section we report the results of a set of experiments that are designed to provide a
proof of concept for ice  the results illustrate the scalability of ice to realistic problem
sizes and provide evidence of the effectiveness of the elicitation process and the techniques
to bound the efficiency of the provisional trade

implementation  first  a brief aside on our experimental implementation  ice is approximately        lines of extremely tight java code  broken up into the functional packages
described in table      the prototype is modular so that researchers may easily replace
components for experimentation    because of ices complexity  it is essential that the
code be constructed in a rigid hierarchy that avoids obscuring the high level logic behind
the details of generating  running and integrating the results of mips  to this end  the
system is written in a series of progressively more abstractmini languages each of which
defines a clean  understandable api to the next higher level of logic  our hierarchy provides
a way to hide the extremely delicate steps needed to handle the numerical issues that come
out of trying to repeatedly solve coupled optimization problems  where the constraints in
one problem may be defined in terms of slightly inaccurate results from an earlier problem 
most of the constraints presented in this paper must be carefully relaxed and monitored
in order to handle these numerical precision issues  at the bottom of this hierarchy the
mip specification is fed into our generalized back end optimization solver interface    we
currently support cplex and the lgpl licensed lpsolve   that handles machine loadbalancing and parallel mip lp solving  this concurrent solving capability is essential  as
we need to handle tens of thousands of comparatively simple mips lps

experimental set up  in the experiments  the  parameter in mrpar is set to near
zero and both the mrpar and diar activity rule fire in every round  the rule used
to define the  parameter in diar is exactly as described in section      we adopt the
same straightforward bidding agents that were employed in section    see the appendix
for details   in simulation  we adopt the threshold payment rule and terminate ice when
the per agent error in payment relative to the correct payment is within    of the average
per agent value for the efficient trade  on typical instances  this incurs an additional  
rounds beyond those that would be required if we had a last and final round  all timing
is wall clock time  and does not separately count the large number of parallel threads of

the problem instances are available at http   www eecs harvard edu  blubin ice 
our instance generator begins by generating a set g of good types  next  for each j  g it
creates s    copies of each good type  forming a total potential supply in the market of s g 
goods  exactly how many units are in supply depends on the precise structure of bid trees  
each unit is assigned to one of the bidders uniformly at random  the generator creates a
bid tree ti for each bidder by recursively growing it  starting from the root and adopting
two phases  for the tree above depthlow  each node receives a number of children drawn
uniform between outdegreelow and outdegreehigh  a percentage of which are designated
as leaves   resulting in an exponential growth in the number of nodes during this phase  by
the width at some depth we refer to the number of nodes at that depth  below this point 
we carefully control the expected number of children at each node in order to make the
expected width conform to a triangle distribution over depth from depthlow to depthmid
to depthhigh  we linearly increase the expected width at each depth between depthlow and
depthmid to a fixed multiple    of the width at depthlow  and then linearly decrease the
expected width back to zero by depthhigh    this provides complex and deep trees without
inherently introducing an exponential number of nodes 
each internal node must be assigned the parameters for its interval choose operator  we
typically choose y with a high triangle distribution between   and the number of children and
x with a low triangle distribution between   and y  this will bias towards the introduction
of ic operators that permit a wide choice in the number of children  each internal node is
also assigned a bonus drawn according to a uniform distribution  each leaf node is assigned
as a buy node with a probability           and then a specific good type for that node
is chosen from among those good types for sale in the market  the node is assigned a
quantity by drawing from a low triangle distribution between   and the total number in
existence    a unit value for the node is then drawn from a specific buy distribution 
typically uniform  which is multiplied by the quantity and assigned as the nodes bonus 
the leaf nodes assigned as sell nodes have their goods and bonuses determined similarly 
this time with goods selected from among those previously assigned to the bidder   
    experimental results  scalability
the first set of results that we present focuses on the computational properties of ice 
figure    shows the runtime performance of the system as we increase the number of
bidders while holding all other parameters constant  in this example      goods in    types
are being traded by bidders with an average of     node trees  the graph shows the total
wall clock time for all parts of the system  while we see super linear growth in solve time
    note that by setting depthlow  depthmid  depthhigh one can still grow a full tree of a given depth by
eliminating phase   
    the total number of goods of a given type in existence may not actually be available for purchase at any
price given the structure of seller trees  thus a bias towards small quantities in buy nodes and large
quantities in sell nodes produces more interesting problem instances 
    in our experiments  we vary     g           d           n           outdegreelow    
   outdegreehigh        depthlow        depthmid        depthhigh     set a balanced buy
probability         and set width multiplier during the second phase to       in these examples 
buy node bonuses were drawn uniformly from            sell nodes bonuses were drawn uniformly from
          and internal nodes bonuses uniformly from

concavity of the run time performance is suggested by the decrease in the average  item

goods to the problem will initially make the winner determination problem more difficult 
but only until there is a large over supply  at which point the outcome is easier to determine 
figures    and    illustrate the change in run time with the size of bid trees  here we
use only the first phase of our tree generator to avoid confounding the effects of size with
structural complexity  in both experiments      goods in    types were being traded by   
bidders  in figure    we vary the number of children of any given node while in figure   
we vary the depth of the tree  increasing the branching factor and or tree depth results in
an exponential growth in tree size  which necessarily corresponds to an exponential growth
in runtime  however  if we account for this by instead plotting against the number of nodes
in the trees  we see that both graphs indicate a near polynomial increase in runtime with
tree size  we fit a polynomial function to this data of the form y   axb   indicating that
this growth is approximately of degree     in the range of tree sizes considered in these

efficiency of trade across rounds  the effectiveness of preference elicitation  and the accuracy
and stability of prices  for this set of experiments we average over    problem instances

average of     nodes

figure     average reduction in value uncertainty due to each rule 

rounds    the vertical  dashed  line indicates the average percentage complete when the
trade is provably     efficient  the exchange remains open past this point while payments
converge  and because we simulate the outcome of the last and final round by continuing
progress with our straightforward bidding agents   the two lines on either side represent
one standard error of this statistic 
in figure     we see that the exchange quickly converges to highly efficient trades  taking
an average of     rounds to achieve efficiency  in general  the optimistic trade  i e   computed
from upper bounds v  has higher  true  efficiency than the pessimistic one  i e   computed
from lower bounds v   while the efficiency of the provisional trade  is typically better than
both  this justifies the design decision to adopt the provisional valuations and provisional
trade in driving the exchange dynamics  it also suggests that exchanges with the traditional
paradigm of improving bids  i e   increasing lower bound claims on valuations  would allow
little useful feedback in early rounds  the efficiency of the pessimistic tradeall that would
be available without information about the upper bounds of bidder valuationsis initially
very poor 
figure    shows the average amount of revelation caused by mrpar and diar in each
round of ice  revelation is measured here in terms of the absolute tightening of upper and
lower bounds  summed across the bid trees  the mrpar activity rule is the main driving
force behind the revelation of information and the vast majority of revelation  in absolute
terms  occurs within the first     of rounds  diar plays a role in making progress towards
identifying the efficient trade but only once mrpar has substantially reduced the value
uncertainty and despite firing in every round  one can think of mrpar as our rockets
main engine  and diar as a thruster for mid course correction  ice determines the efficient
    each data point represents the average across the    instances  and is determined by averaging the
underlying points in its neighborhood  error bars indicate the standard error  se  of this mean  thus 
the figures are essentially a histogram rendered as a line graph

bounds on value at the node equal to around     of the maximum  true  value that a node
could contribute to a bidders value  roughly the maximum marginal value contributed by a
node over all feasible trades  we see that ice is successful in directing preference elicitation
to information that is relevant to determining the efficient trade 
we now provide two different views on the effectiveness of prices  figure    shows the
mean percentage absolute difference between the prices computed in some round and the
prices computed in the final round  prices quickly converge  in our experiments we have
driven the exchange beyond the efficient solution in order to converge to the threshold

efficiency  figure    provides information about the quality of the price feedback  we plot

as the payoff from trade i   when evaluated at prices   approaches that from the bestresponse trade at prices   then regreti  i     approaches     figure    plots the average
regret across all bidders as a function of the number of rounds completed in ice  the regret
is low        when averaged across all rounds before the efficient trade is determined and
     when averaged across all rounds  that regret falls across rounds also shows that prices
become more and more informative as the rounds proceed

figure     comparison between the actual efficiency of the pessimistic trade and the  direct
bound 
finally  we present experimental results that relate to the two methods that ice employs
to bound the final efficiency of the pessimistic trade  the total pricing error across all
bidders in each round as determined within pricing in terms of     v     and normalized
here by the total true value of the efficient trade  is already small  at       in initial rounds
and falls to around    by final rounds of ice  this suggests that a price based bound is
quite informative  although note that this is defined in terms of the error given     v    and
does not immediately map to a price based accuracy claim for true valuations and for the
current trade  defined on lower bound valuations  figure    compares the actual efficiency
of the pessimistic trade  in each round with that estimated by the  direct bound on efficiency
that is available to the exchange  this confirms that the direct bound is reasonably tight 
and very effective in bounding the true efficiency regardless of the accuracy of the prices 

   conclusions
in this work we designed and implemented a scalable and highly expressive iterative combinatorial exchange  the design includes many interesting features  including  a new treebased language for combinatorial exchange environments  a new method to construct approximate linear prices from expressive languages  a proxied architecture with optimistic
and pessimistic valuations coupled with price based activity rules to drive preference elicitation  and a direct method to estimate the final efficiency of the trade in terms of valuation
bounds  by adopting proxy agents that receive direct  expressive claims on upper and
lower valuations bounds we are able to form claims about efficiency despite using only
linear prices  these bounds also allow for good progress in early rounds  and even when
there is no efficient trade at lower bound  pessimistic  values  experimental results with
automated  simple bidding agents indicate good behavior in terms of both scalability and
economic properties

there are many intriguing opportunities for future work  it will be especially interesting
to instantiate special cases of the ice design to domains for which there exist strategyproof 
static  two sided  combinatorial market designs  this would bring straightforward bidding
strategies into an ex post nash equilibrium  for example  it should be possible to integrate
methods such as trade reduction  mcafee        and its generalizations  babaioff   walsh 
      chu   shen        in domains with restricted expressiveness  we can also consider
ice as a combinatorial auction rather than exchange  where a direct appeal to vcg payments would provide incentive compatibility  the other two major directions for future work
are to   a  modify the design to allow bidders to refine the structure  not just the valuation
bounds on their tbbl tree  across rounds   b  extend ice to work in a dynamic environment with a changing bidder population  for instance maintaining linear price feedback
and periodically clearing  recent progress in on line mechanism design includes truthful 
dynamic double auctions for very simple expressiveness  blum  sandholm    zinkevich 
      bredin  parkes    duong         but does not extend to the kind of expressiveness
and price sophistication present in ice  see the work of parkes        for a recent survey 
lastly  the incentive properties of ice are very much dependent on the payment rule used
which argues for further analysis of the threshold rule and its alternatives

theorem   c mrpar is equivalent to  mrpar for      
proof  comparing      and      with c mrpar  and given lemmas   and    all that is
left to show is that it is sufficient to check l
i   as the only candidate to pass mrpar  that
is  we need to show that if there is some i  fi  x    that satisfies mrpar then l
i satisfies
mrpar  we argue as follows 
   trade i must solve maxi fi  x     v i  i    p  i     otherwise  there is some i with
v i  i    p  i     v i  i    p  i    a contradiction with      
   trade i must also break ties in favor of maximizing v i  i    v i  i    otherwise  there
is some i with the same profit as i at v i   with v i  i    v i  i     v i  i    v i  i    this
implies v i  i    v i  i     v i  i    v i  i    and i  i   i   v i     i  i   i   v i    but  since
i has the same profit as i at v i we have i  i   i   v i       and so i  i   i   v i       
this is a contradiction with      
   proceed now by case analysis  either i   i   in which case we are done because
this will be explicitly selected as candidate passing trade l
i   for the other case  let
l
denote
all
feasible
solutions
to
    
and
consider
the
difficult
case when  l
i
i       
l

we argue that if i  i satisfies mrpar  then so does any other trade i  l
i  
with i    i   by mrpar  we have i  i   i   vi       vi  ti   in particular 
vi  i  p  i    vi  i  p  i    where vi is defined with respect to i   and equivalently 
v i  i    p  i    vi  i    p  i   

    

v i  i    p  i     v i  i    p  i   

    

on the other hand 


since both are in l
i   taking      together with       we must have that i satisfies
no uncertain value nodes in ti not also satisfied in i   moreover  since v i  i   
v i  i     v i  i    v i  i    both trades must satisfy exactly the same uncertain value
nodes  finally  by      the profit from all fixed value nodes in ti must be the same
in both trades  we conclude that the profit is the same for all vi  ti for i and i
at the current prices and mrpar is satisfied by either trade 


to understand the importance of the tie breaking rule  i  in selecting the candidate
passing trade  l
i   in c mrpar  consider the following example for mrpar with      
example    a bidder has xor  a   b  and a value of   on the leaf  a and a value range
of        on leaf  b  suppose prices are currently   for each of a and b and i    b 
the mrpar rule is satisfied because the market knows that however the remaining value
uncertainty on  b is resolved the bidder will always  weakly  prefer  b to  a and  b is
i   notice that both  a and  b have the same pessimistic utility  but only  b can satisfy
mrpar  but  b has maximal value uncertainty  and therefore this is selected over  a by
c mrpar 
  

filubin  juda  cavallo  lahaie  shneidman   parkes

to understand the importance of selecting  and evaluating  u
i with respect to vi rather
than v i   consider the following example  again for        it illustrates the role of shared
uncertainty in the tree  which occurs when multiple trades share a node with uncertain
value and the value  although uncertain  will be resolved in the same way for both trades 
example    a bidder has xor  a   b  and value bounds         on the root node and a
value of   on leaf  a  suppose prices are currently   for each of a and b and i    b 
the mrpar rule is satisfied because the bidder strictly prefers  a to  b  whichever way
the uncertain value on the root node is ultimately resolved  c mrpar selects l
i as buy
  l                   at valuation v   the witness trade buy b
 

p
a  with payoff v i  l
i
i
i
would be selected and have payoff           and seem to violate mrpar  but  whichever
way the uncertain value at the root is resolved it will affect  a and  b in the same way 
this is addressed by setting vi      v i        on the root node  the same value adopted
in determining the payoff from l
i   evaluated at vi   the witness is buy a and     of
c mrpar is trivially satisfied while     is satisfied since              
for  mrpar with       we adopt a slight variation  with a  c mrpar procedure
defined as 
    check i  i   i   vi     for all vi  ti   all i  fi  x    directly  by application of
lemma   with valuation vi defined with respect to trade i   and test
 u
v i  i    p  i    vi  u
i    p  i    

    

    if this is not satisfied then fall back on c mrpar to verify      and       with

candidate passing trade l
i modified from      to drop tie breaking in favor of i and
l

l
with the second step of c mrpar modified to require v i  i    p  i     vi  i   
p  i       again with vi defined with respect to l
i  
the argument adopted in the proof of theorem   remains valid in establishing that it

is sufficient to consider l
i   as defined in  c mrpar  in the case that i does not pass
the activity rule 

appendix b  computation for diar
the  diar rule can be verified by solving two mips  the first optimization problem
identifies the trade with maximal diar error for which the current bounds refinement has
improved this error by at least  
pi

where vi  and vi  are defined with respect to i   v   and v   represent valuations defined
before and after the bidders refinement respectively  and c   v  i  i    p  i    note that
the problem could be infeasible  in which case we define pi     
the second optimization identifies the trade with maximal diar error for which v   still
allows for the possibility of valuation bounds that provide an  error reduction over v

where vi is defined with respect to i   and vi is similarly defined with respect to i   the
second term in      recognizes that it remains possible to decrease the value on i to the
new lower bound v  i  i    while increasing the value on i to the new upper bound v  i  i  
except on those nodes that are shared with i   giving vi   i    we see that      is equivalent

which calculates the amount of refinement that is still possible in service of reducing the
diar error  note the problem could be infeasible  in which case we define fi      we
ultimately compare the two solutions  and the bidder passes diar if and only if pi  fi  

appendix c  the automated bidding agents and bidder feedback
the bidding agents that are used for the simulation experiments are designed to minimize
the amount of information revealed in order to pass the activity rules and while remaining
straightforward so that the true valuation is consistent with lower and upper valuations  in
summarizing the behavior of the bidding agents  there are three things to explain   a  the
method that we adopt in place of the last and final round   b  the feedback that is provided
by ice to bidders in meeting mrpar and diar  and  c  the logic that is followed by the
bidding agents  rather than define a method for bidding agents to adjust their bounds in
a last and final round  we keep ice open in simulation past the point in which it would
ordinarily go to last and final  past this point  the bidding agents continue to refine their
bounds and ice terminates when the payments are within some desired accuracy  each
bidding agent in this phase reduces its uncertainty by some multiplicative factor on all
nodes that are active in the current provisional trade or in any of the provisional trades for
the economies with bidder i removed  this is adopted for simulation purposes only 
our bidding agents operate in a loop  heuristically modifying their valuation bounds in
trying to meet mrpar and diar and querying the proxy for advice  the proxy provides
guidance to help the bidding agent further refine its valuation so it can meet the activity
rule  for both mrpar and diar  the optimization problems that are solved in checking
whether a bidder has satisfied the activity rule also provide information that can guide the
  

filubin  juda  cavallo  lahaie  shneidman   parkes

u
bidder  first consider mrpar and recall that l
i is the candidate passing trade and i is
the witness trade  the following lemma is easy  and stated without proof 

lemma   when mrpar is not satisfied for the current valuation bounds  a bidder must
u
increase a lower bound on at least one node in  l
i   i    or decrease an upper bound on
u
l
at least one node in  i   i    in order to meet the activity rule 
once a simple bidder makes some changes on some subset of these nodes  the bidder
can inquire if he has passed the activity rule  the proxy can then respond yes or can
revise the set of nodes on which the bidding agent should refine its valuation bounds  a
similar functionality is provided for diar  this time the trade that solves the second mip
 with diar error fi   is provided as feedback  together with information about how much
the bidder must either further reduce the error  or further constrain the possibilities on this
trade  to satisfy diar  the bidding agent can determine from this information which nodes
it must modify  and by how much in total  and is free to decide how much to modify each
node to satisfy the rule  the key to our agent design is the following lemma 
lemma   the trade with which a straightforward bidder passes mrpar  for       must
be a trade that is weakly preferred by the bidder to all other trades for his true valuation 
proof  by contradiction  suppose true valuation vi  ti and trade i meets mrpar but
is not a weakly preferred trade at the true valuation and prices   then  there exists a
trade i  fi  x    such that i  i   i   vi        but  this is a contradiction with mrpar
since i  i   i   vi      for all vi  ti and all i  fi  x     including vi   vi and i   i   
we use this observation to define a procedure updatemrpar by which a bidder
can intelligently refine its valuation bounds to meet mrpar  let i be the trade with
which we hope to pass mrpar  and define ui  i       vi  i    p  i    ui  i       v i  i   
p  i    ui  i       vi  i    p  i    where vi is defined with respect to candidate passing
trade i   the high level approach is as follows

i  arg maxi fi  x    ui  i    
if ui  i         then
reduce slack on i by ui  i    
end if

the bidding agent makes use of a couple of optimization modalities that are exposed
by the proxy to the bidder  the procedure first chooses the most preferred trade at truth
as the trade to pass mrpar with i   the bidding agent requests that the proxy finds this
trade by solving a mip  if the trade has negative profit  then the bidding agent attempts to
demonstrate positive profit for this trade  next  the bidding agent enters a loop  wherein it
repeatedly requests the proxy to run a mip that calculates a witness trade u
i with respect
to i   as long as this witness has more profit than that of what should be the most preferred
trade  the bidding agent adjust bounds so as to reverse this mis ordering  lastly  because
the bidding agent must pass mrpar  not merely rpar  the bidding agent attempts to
show a strict preference for i over i when they are not identical 
in meeting diar  the bidding agent responds to the f    and     parameter
provided by the proxy as follows  let f be the trade chosen in the maximization that
calculates f   the high level approach is as follows 
function updatediar
while proxy says we still have not passed diar do
if f or  can be modified to reduce diar error by  over last round then
heuristically reduce the upper bound slack in f   
heuristically reduce the lower bound slack in    f
else
heuristically reduce the upper bound slack in    f
heuristically reduce the lower bound slack in f   
end if
end while
end function
the bidding agent attempts to make the current failing trade pass diar if possible by
reducing the error with respect to that trade  otherwise  it reduces bounds to prove that
diar could not be made to pass on that trade and loops on to the next trade
