abstract
correlated equilibrium generalizes nash equilibrium to allow correlation devices  correlated equilibrium captures the idea that in many systems there exists a trusted administrator who can recommend behavior to a set of agents  but can not enforce such behavior 
this makes this solution concept most appropriate to the study of multi agent systems in
ai  aumann showed an example of a game  and of a correlated equilibrium in this game in
which the agents welfare  expected sum of players utilities  is greater than their welfare in
all mixed strategy equilibria  following the idea initiated by the price of anarchy literature
this suggests the study of two major measures for the value of correlation in a game with
nonnegative payoffs 
   the ratio between the maximal welfare obtained in a correlated equilibrium to the maximal
welfare obtained in a mixed strategy equilibrium  we refer to this ratio as the mediation
value 
   the ratio between the maximal welfare to the maximal welfare obtained in a correlated equilibrium  we refer to this ratio as the enforcement value 
in this work we initiate the study of the mediation and enforcement values  providing
several general results on the value of correlation as captured by these concepts  we also
present a set of results for the more specialized case of congestion games   a class of games
that received a lot of attention in the recent literature 

   introduction
much work in the area of multi agent systems adopts game theoretic reasoning  this is
due to the fact that many existing systems consist of self motivated participants  each of
which attempts to optimize his own performance  as a result the nash equilibrium  the
central solution concept in game theory  has become a major tool in the study and analysis of
multi agent systems  nash equilibrium captures multi agent behavior which is stable against

unilateral deviations  naturally  a system that is fully controlled by a designer can enforce
behaviors which lead to a higher welfare than the one obtained in a fully decentralized system
in which agents behave selfishly and follow some nash equilibrium  the comparison between
these quantities is studied under the title of work on the price of anarchy  koutsoupias  
papadimitriou        roughgarden   tardos        christodoulou   koutsoupias        
and is a subject of much interest in computer science  however  fully controlled systems
versus fully uncontrolled systems are two extreme points  as was acknowledged in various
works in ai  shoham   tennenholtz      a      b  one of the main practical approaches to
dealing with realistic systems is to consider systems with some limited centralized control 
indeed  in most realistic systems there is a designer who can recommend behavior  this
should be distinguished from the strong requirement that the designer can dictate behavior 
correlated equilibrium  introduced by aumann         is the most famous game theoretic
solution concept referring to a designer who can recommend but not enforce behavior  in
a game in strategic form  a correlated strategy is a probability distribution over the set
of strategy profiles  where a strategy profile is a vector of strategies  one for each player 
a correlated strategy is utilized as follows  a strategy profile is selected according to the
distribution  and every player is informed about her strategy in the profile  this selected
strategy for the player is interpreted as a recommendation of play  correlated strategies are
most natural  since they capture the idea of a system administrator reliable party who can
recommend behavior but can not enforce it  hence  correlated strategies make perfect sense
in the context of congestion control  load balancing  trading  etc  a correlated strategy is
called a correlated equilibrium if it is better off for every player to obey her recommended
strategy if she believes that all other players obey their recommended strategies    correlated
equilibrium makes perfect sense in the context of work on multi agent systems in ai in which
there exists a mediator who can recommend behavior to the agents   a major potential
benefit of a mediator who is using a correlated equilibrium is to attempt to improve the
welfare of selfish players  in this paper  the welfare obtained in a correlated strategy is
defined to be the expected sum of the utilities of the players  and it is referred to as the
welfare obtained in this correlated strategy 
a striking example introduced in aumanns seminal paper        is of a two player
two strategy game  where the welfare obtained in a correlated equilibrium is higher than
the welfare obtained in every mixed strategy equilibrium of the game  a modification of
aumanns example serves us as a motivating example 
aumanns example 

   every correlated strategy defines a bayesian game in which the private signal of every player is her
recommended strategy  it is a correlated equilibrium if obeying the recommended strategy by every
player is a pure strategy equilibrium in this bayesian game 
   the use of mediators in obtaining desired behaviors  in addition to improving social welfare  has been
further studied   e g   monderer   tennenholtz              rozenfeld   tennenholtz        ashlagi 
monderer    tennenholtz         however  the mediators discussed in that work makes use of more
powerful capabilities than just making recommendation based on probabilistic coin flips

as a result  aumanns example suggests that correlation may be a way to improve
welfare while still assuming that players are rational in the classical game theoretic sense  
in this game  there are three mixed strategy equilibrium profiles  two of them are
obtained with pure strategies   a    b     and  a    b     the welfare in each of these purestrategy equilibrium profiles equals six  there is an additional mixed strategy equilibrium
in which every player chooses each of her strategies with equal probabilities  the welfare
obtained in this profile equals                          because every entry in the matrix
is played with probability      hence  the maximal welfare in a mixed strategy equilibrium
equals    consider the following correlated strategy  a probability of     is assigned to
every pure strategy profile but  a    b     this correlated strategy is a correlated equilibrium 
indeed  when the row player is recommended to play a  she knows that the other player
is recommended to play b    and therefore she strictly prefers to play a    when the row
player is recommended to play a  the conditional probability of each of the columns is half 
and therefore she weakly prefers to play a    similar argument applied to the column player
shows that the correlated strategy is indeed a correlated equilibrium  the welfare associated
 
with this correlated equilibrium equals   
                    
the above discussion suggests one may wish to consider the value of correlation in
games  in order to address the challenge of studying the value of correlation  we tackle two
fundamental issues 
 how much can the society system gain by adding a correlation device  where we
assume that without such a device the agents play a mixed strategy equilibrium 
 how much does the society system loose from the fact that the correlation device can
only recommend  and can not enforce  a course of action 
accordingly we introduce two measures  the mediation value and the enforcement value 
these measures make sense mainly for games with nonnegative utilities  which are the focus
of this paper 
the mediation value measures the ratio between the maximal welfare in a correlated
equilibrium to the maximal welfare in a mixed strategy equilibrium  notice that the higher
the mediation value is  the more correlation helps  hence  the mediation value measures
the value of a reliable mediator who can just recommend a play in a model in which there
is an anarchy without the mediator  where anarchy is defined to be the situation in which
the players use the welfare best mixed strategy equilibrium  that is  anarchy is the best
outcome reached by rational and selfish agents  
   other advantages are purely computational ones  as has been recently shown  correlated equilibrium
can be computed in polynomial time even for structured representations of games  kakade  kearns 
langford    ortiz        papadimitriou        
   the phenomenon of multiple equilibria forces a modeling choice of the concept of anarchy  which could
have been defined also as the welfare worst mixed strategy equilibrium  or as a convex combination of

   

fiashlagi  monderer    tennenholtz

in aummans example it can be shown that the correlated equilibrium introduced above
is the best correlated equilibrium  i e   it attains the maximal welfare among all correlated
equilibria in the game  hence  the mediation value of aumanns example is   
   
the enforcement value measures the ratio between the maximal welfare to the maximal
welfare in a correlated equilibrium  that is  it is the value of a center who can dictate a
course of play with respect to a mediator who can just use correlation devices in equilibrium 
as the maximal welfare in aumanns example is    the enforcement value in this game equals
 
  
in this paper we establish general and basic results concerning the measures defined
above  we consider the mediation  enforcement  value of classes of games  which is defined
to be the least upper bound of the mediation  enforcement  values of the games in the class 
we first study general games  then we consider the important class of congestion games
 rosenthal        monderer   shapley         indeed  this class of games is perhaps the
most applicable to the game theory and cs synergy  in particular  results regarding the
price of anarchy have been obtained for congestion games  we restrict our study to simple
congestion games 
next we summarize our main results and discuss some related literature 
    main results for general games
aumanns example implies that the mediation value of the class of two player two strategy
     games is at least       in this paper it is proved that the mediation value of this class
equals      next  more complex games are studied  in particular we consider two possible
minimal extensions of      games  two player games with three strategies for one of the
players and two strategies for the other  and three player games with two strategies for each
player  it is shown that the mediation value of each of these classes is unbounded  i e   it
equals   consequently  the mediation value is unbounded for classes of larger games  
this should be interpreted as a positive result  showing the extreme power of correlation 
considering the enforcement value  it is proved that it equals  for the classes of     
or larger games  the proof of this result uses games with weakly dominant strategies  we
show  however  that the enforcement value of the class of three player two strategy games
without weakly dominated strategies also equals  
    main results for simple congestion games
in a simple congestion game there is a set of facilities  every facility j is associated with a
nonnegative payoff function wj   every player chooses a facility  say facility j  and receives
wj  k   where k is the number of players that chose facility j 
for completeness we first deal with the simple case  in which there exist only two players 
and show that the mediation value of the class of simple congestion games with two facilities
equals      in the more general case  in which there are m    facilities  it is proved that
the mediation value is bounded from above by    however  it is proved that the mediation
the best welfare and worst welfare mixed strategy equilibrium  this choice is a matter of taste  and we
chose the best option 
   a game  is larger than the game  if it is obtained from  by adding players  and or by adding strategies
to the players in  

   

fion the value of correlation

value equals   for the class of simple congestion games with non increasing facility payoff
functions 
for the case of more than two players  we show that the mediation value is unbounded
for the class of games with three players and two facilities with non increasing payoffs  in
contrast 
in the linear case  it is proved that the mediation value is bounded from above

by    

      for the class of games with any number of players and two facilities with
 
non increasing linear payoff functions  we give an example for a game in this class whose
mediation value equals      leaving open a significant gap 
additional special theorems are proved for simple congestion games with symmetric
 identical  facilities  it is proved that  for every n     the mediation value is higher than  
for the class of two symmetric  identical  facilities with non increasing payoffs and n players 
this further illustrates the power of correlation  nevertheless  we show that every simple
congestion game with any number of players and any number of symmetric facilities  in
which the facility payoff functions satisfy a certain concavity requirement  the best mixedstrategy equilibrium obtains the maximal welfare  and therefore both the mediation value
and the enforcement value of such a game equal   
finally  we study the enforcement value in the case  in which there exist n players and m
symmetric facilities with arbitrary facility payoff functions  we characterize the set of such
games for which the enforcement value equals    and as a result  determine the situations
where correlation allows obtaining maximal welfare 
    related literature
we end this introduction with a discussion of some relevant issues in the price of anarchy
literature  and their potential relationships to the concepts of mediation value and enforcement value   in many situations it is natural to deal with nonnegative costs rather than
utilities  indeed  the literature on the price of anarchy focused on such models  when
translating the definition of price of anarchy  to games with utilities and not with costs 
the price of anarchy with utilities is the ratio between the maximal welfare to the minimal
welfare obtained in a mixed strategy equilibrium  the higher this number is  the value of
a center is higher  where a center can enforce a course of play  hence  the price of anarchy
with utilities measures the value of a center with respect to anarchy  where a center can
dictate a play  and when anarchy is measured by the worst social outcome reached by rational and selfish agents  recently  anshelevich  dasgupta  kleinberg  tardos  wexler  and
roughgarden        defined price of stability in models with costs   accordingly  the price
of stability with utilities  is the ratio between the maximal welfare and the maximal welfare
in a mixed strategy equilibrium  a relevant concept using correlated equilibrium in models
with costs has been defined independently by christodoulou and koutsoupias         and
is referred to as the price of stability of correlated equilibria   when translated to a model
   the concept of the price of anarchy has received much attention in the recent computer science literature 
 e g   marvonicolas   spirakis        czumaj   vocking        roughgarden        roughgarden

   the price of anarchy is defined for games with costs as the ratio between the maximal cost in a mixedstrategy equilibrium to the minimal cost 
   it is the ratio between the minimal cost in a a mixed strategy equilibrium to the minimal cost 
   it is the ratio between the minimal cost in a correlated equilibrium to the minimal cost

with utilities  the price of stability of correlated equilibria with utilities is the ratio between
the maximal welfare and the maximal welfare in a mixed strategy equilibrium  that is it is
the enforcement value    however  results proved for one of the ratios in one of the models
cannot be translated to results on the analogous ratio in the other model  this is due the
fact that when moving from one model to the other does not only require multiplication by
a negative constant  e g      but the numbers also need to be shifted to remain nonnegative 
needless to say  the corresponding ratios can be significantly changed by such shifting   
we return to this discussion in section     

   basic definitions
a finite game in strategic form is a tuple     n   s i  in    ui  in    n is a nonempty finite
set of players  unless otherwise specified we assume that n                n   n     for
each i  n   s i is a finite set of strategies of player i  let s   s    s        s n be the
set of strategy profiles  n tuples   an element of s is s    si  in   for each i  n and
s  s let si    s         si    si        sn   denote the strategies played by everyone but i  thus
s    si   si    for each player i  n   let ui   s  r be the utility function of player i  ui  s 
is the utility of player i when the profile of strategies s is played   is called a nonnegative
game if all utilities to all players are nonnegative  i e   ui   s  r  for every player i 
a player can also randomize among her strategies by using a mixed strategy   a distribution over her set of strategies  for any finite set c   c  denotes the set of probability
distributions over c  thus p i    s i   is the set of mixed strategies of player i  let pi  p i
be a mixed strategy of i  for every si  s i   pi  si   is the probability that player i plays
strategy si in pi   every pure strategy si  s i is  with the natural identification  a mixed
strategy psi  p i in which

  ti   s i
i
psi  t    
  ti    si  
psi is called a pure strategy  and si is interchangeably called a strategy and a pure strategy
 when it is identified with psi    let p   p    p        p n be the set of mixed strategy
profiles 
let si   ti  s i be pure strategies of player i  we say that si weakly dominates ti   and ti
is weakly dominated by si if for all si  si
ui  si   si    ui  ti   si   
where at least one inequality is strict  we say that si strictly dominates ti   and ti is strictly
dominated by si if all of the above inequalities are strict  if ui  si   si     u ti   si   for all
si  si   we will say that si and ti are equivalent strategies for player i 
any    s  is called a correlated strategy  every mixed strategy profile p  p
can be interpreted as the correlated strategy p   where for every strategy profile s  s 
    for completeness  one can define the mediation value with costs as the ratio between the minimal cost
at a mixed strategy equilibrium to the minimal cost at a correlated equilibrium 
    interestingly  it can be shown that there exist classes of cost games in which the price of anarchy is
bounded  while the price of anarchy with utilities in the analogous classes of utility games is unbounded 
the class of cost games analogous to the class of utility games given in example   in section       
constitutes one such example

   results for general games
the following two basic lemmas are used in some of the proofs in this paper  the proof
of lemma   follows directly from definition    and the proof of lemma   is standard 
therefore  these proofs are omitted 
    an elementary proof of existence of correlated equilibrium  which does not use the existence of a mixedstrategy equilibrium is given by hart and schmeidler

consequently  if si is a strictly dominated strategy   s      for every correlated equilibrium
 
next we define extensions of a game by adding a dummy strategy to one of the players  or by
adding a dummy player  let   gm  m  mn   the game   gm  mi   mi    mi   mn
is an extension of  by adding a dummy strategy to player i if it is obtained from  by adding
a strategy to player i such that the utility of all n players equal zero  when player i uses

the game   gm  m  mn   is an extension of  by adding a dummy player  player

    the mediation value
in this section we show the power of correlation in general games  we start with extending
aumanns result on the power of correlation in      games

aumanns example shows that a mediation value of

by lemma    if  has less than two pure strategy equilibrium profiles  m v        
therefore  we can assume without loss of generality that  has two or more pure strategy
equilibrium profiles  however  if there are four pure strategy equilibrium profiles  the mediation value equals    therefore we should discuss the cases in which  has either two or
three pure strategy equilibrium profiles 
suppose  possesses exactly three pure strategy equilibrium profiles  and without loss of
generality let  a    b    be the only strategy profile not in equilibrium  since  a    b      a    b   
and  a    b    are all pure strategy equilibria  m   a and b   k  because  a    b    is not an
equilibrium  c   j or d   n  if c   j  by lemma    every correlated equilibrium   c  
satisfies  a    b         and therefore m v         similarly  if d   n   a    b        implies
m v        
suppose there are exactly two pure strategy equilibrium profiles in   these two equilibrium profiles may be in the same row  in the same column  or on a diagonal  obviously 
the proof for the case that the two pure strategy equilibrium profiles are in the same row
or in the same column is covered by the following proof  which assumes that the two purestrategy equilibrium profiles are in the first row  that is   a    b    and  a    b    are both
pure strategy equilibria  this assumption implies that b   k  observe that any strategy
profile in which player   plays strategy a  with probability one  and player   plays any
mixed strategy p   p     is a mixed strategy equilibrium  since there are exactly two purestrategy equilibria  it must be that m   a or c   j  if m   a and c   j  by lemma   every
correlated equilibrium   c   satisfies both  a    b        and  a    b         therefore
m v         suppose m   a  therefore c   j  hence  by lemma   every correlated
equilibrium   c   satisfies  a    b         since  a    b    is not a pure strategy equilibrium  n   d  since b   k and n   d  then again by lemma    every correlated equilibrium
  c   satisfies  a    b         therefore m v         we showed that m v        if
there are two pure strategy equilibrium profiles  and they are on the same row or the same
column 
we proceed to the last case in which the two pure strategy equilibrium profiles are on
a diagonal  without loss of generality let  a    b    and  a    b    be pure strategy equilibrium
profiles  it was shown by peeters and potters        that if c   j or a   m or b   k or
d   n  c   is exactly the convex hull of n     hence  in this case there is no extreme
point of c   that is not a mixed strategy equilibrium  and therefore the mediation value
equals    therefore we can assume 
c   j  a   m  b   k

and d   n 

   

if both  u a    b    and u a    b    are smaller than max u a    b     u a    b      m v        and
the proof is completed  therefore  without loss of generality we make the following two
assumptions

before continuing with the proof we will need the following geometric characterization of

points i   i             
 






 
    
    
                   
 
   
     
     


    
    
          
        

 

 
 

 
 
             
       
   
     
 



  
    
             

where i  j  k  denotes the probability given to the strategy profile  aj   bk   in the correlated equilibrium i   that is  the  j  k th entry of i is i  aj   bk    by our agreement
to identify mixed strategy profiles with correlated strategies we observe that the set of
mixed strategy equilibrium is precisely
n                   

   

we have to prove that u       vn    for every correlated equilibrium   c    it is
sufficient to prove that the inequality holds for the extreme points of c    since

prove the inequality for   and

all utilities are nonnegative  a  c   d and d  c   d  therefore  since m   a and n   d  we
obtain the inequality

j   k  c   b  by  a   and since m   n  a   d  c  a  hence j   k  a   b  therefore  by

j   k  c   d 
   
note that inequality     implies that u      vn    since  a    b    is a pure strategy

we will show that vn         that is  the welfare in every mixed strategy equilibrium
is zero  in addition we will construct a correlated equilibrium  which yields a strictly
positive welfare  we begin with proving that vn         note that the only pure strategy
equilibrium profiles in the game are  a    b    c    and  a    b    c     obviously  every strategy
profile in which players   and   play b  and c  respectively  and player   plays any mixed
strategy  is a mixed strategy equilibrium  we next show that there are no other mixedstrategy equilibria in the game  first we show that there are no other mixed strategy
equilibria in which at least one of the players plays a pure strategy  we verify this for each

probability one  if p   c         p   b         but then player   is better off playing c

next we prove that there does not exist a completely mixed strategy equilibrium   an equilibrium in which every player assigns a positive probability to all of her strategies   suppose
in negation that this is not the case  let   p     p    q     q    h     h   be a completely
mixed strategy equilibrium  that is     p  q  h      by the equilibrium properties  player
  is indifferent between b  and b  given that players   and   play  p     p  and  h     h 
respectively  hence  p    h         p     h   which implies that p        similarly  player
  is indifferent between c  and c  given that players   and   play  p     p  and  q     q 
respectively  therefore     p     q    p    q  yielding p        which is a contradiction 
therefore  there does not exist a completely mixed strategy equilibrium

the proof of theorem   was based on showing that there exists a three player nonnegative game  in which not all utilities are zero  yet the welfare in every mixed strategy

proof  the proof is by induction on the total number of pure strategies n   m in the game 
first note that the assertion holds for all games    gnm for which n   m     because in

for every game    gnm for which n   m  k 
let   gnm be a game in which n   m   k     and for which vn         we should
prove that  is the zero game  as k         there exists at least one player that has more

since vn              implies that  r    q     is not a mixed strategy equilibrium in   however  since r  coincide with q   on t     r   s         and  q     q     is a mixed strategy equilibrium
in    player   does not have a profitable deviation from q   in  when player   uses r   
therefore  player   must have a profitable deviation from r  in  when player   uses q    
in particular  player   must have a pure strategy profitable deviation  since  q     q     is a
mixed strategy equilibrium in    the only potential pure strategy profitable deviation of

   simple congestion games
in this section we explore the mediation and enforcement values in simple congestion games 
we first need a few notations and definitions 
a simple congestion form f    n  m   wj  jm   is defined as follows  n is a nonempty
set of players  we keep our assumption that  whenever is convenient  n                  n  
where n    n   is the number of players  m is a nonempty set of facilities  unless otherwise
specified we assume m               m   for j  m   let wj  rn be the facility payoff
function  where for every    k  n  wj  k  denotes the payoff of each user of facility j 
if there are exactly k users  a congestion form is nonnegative if for every j  m   wj is
nonnegative  let q be the class of all nonnegative simple congestion forms and denote
by qnm  q the class of all nonnegative simple congestion forms with n players and m
facilities  every simple congestion form f    n  m   wj  jm   defines a simple congestion
game f    n   s i  in    ui  in    where n is the set of players  s i   m for every player
i  n   and the utility functions  ui  in are defined as follows 
let s   in s i   for every a    a    a         an    s and every j  m   let j  a   
  i  n   ai   j   be the number of users of facility j  define ui   s  r by
ui  a    wai  ai  a   

    

we say that a facility j is non increasing if wj  k  is a non increasing function of k 
define qn nm  qnm as follows 
qn nm    f  qnm   all facilities in f are non increasing 
we will call a facility j linear if there exist a constant dj such that wj  k       wj  k    dj
for every k     that is wj  k    dj k   j for every k     where j is a constant 
let f be a simple congestion form with n players and m facilities  a congestion vector
    n  m  ispan m tuple     j  jm   where              m  z   the set of nonnegative
integers  and m
j   j   n   represents the situation in which j players choose facility
j  every strategy profile a p s uniquely determines a congestion vector  a   note that
 



m 
 
j   j
there are n  n
   n m 
strategy profiles in the game f that correspond to
 
a congestion vector   and denote by b the set of all such strategy profiles  thus b  
 a  s   a      given a congestion vector   all
p strategy profiles in b have the same
welfare which we denote by u    that is u      jm   j     j wj  j   
we say that a congestion vector  is in equilibrium if every strategy profile in b is a purestrategy equilibrium  a congestion form is called facility symmetric if wj   wk j  k  m  
obviously  a facility symmetric congestion form induces a symmetric game in strategic form 
let inm  qnm be defined by
inm    f  qnm   f is facility symmetric   
define in nm  inm as follows
in nm    f  inm   all facilities in f are non increasing  
   

fion the value of correlation

    the mediation value
although congestion games are especially interesting when the number of players is large 
we begin with presenting results for the case in which we have only two players  extending
upon the results in the previous section  following that  we consider the more general
n player case 
      the two player case  n     
theorem   provides a    a tight upper bound for the mediation value in the class of games
g     hence     is obviously an upper bound for the mediation value of nonnegative simple
congestion games with two players and two facilities  i e   games generated by congestion
forms in q     it turns out that this bound is tight 
theorem   m v   f  f  q            
proof  let fx   x      be the following simple congestion form  m    a    a     wa     x     
and wa        x       the games fx   x     are obtained from the games  x defined in
the proof of theorem    see figure    by renaming the strategies of player    hence  by
what is proved in theorem    m v  fx       as x     
next we consider the more general case in which two players can choose among m
facilities 
theorem   m v   f  f  q m       for every m    
proof  let f  q m   by rosenthal        there exists a pure strategy equilibrium in f  
let a be a fixed pure strategy equilibrium with the largest welfare  that is
u a   u d  for every pure strategy equilibrium d 

    

let j and k be the facilities that players   and   choose in a respectively  we prove by
separation to two cases  j   k and j    k 
case    j   k  we prove the theorem in this case by separation to cases wj       wj    
and wj      wj     
case      wj       wj      in this case we show that j is a strictly dominant strategy 
which implies by lemma   that m v  f        indeed  let h    j be a facility  in order
to prove that j strictly dominates h we have to show that the following three inequalities
hold  wh       wj      wh       wj      and wh       wj      however  since wj       wj     
only the first two inequalities should be proved  we first prove that wh       wj      since
a is a pure strategy equilibrium in which both players choose j  wh      wj      suppose
in negation that wh       wj      since a is a pure strategy equilibrium  wj      wl     for
every l    j  and therefore  wh      wl     for every l    j  if  in addition  wj      wh     
the strategy profile in which one player chooses h  and the other player chooses j is a purestrategy equilibrium and obtains a larger welfare than a contradicting       therefore 
wh       wj      this implies that the strategy profile in which both players choose h is
a pure strategy equilibrium and obtains a larger welfare than a  again a contradiction to
      therefore wh       wj     
   

fiashlagi  monderer    tennenholtz

we next show that wh       wj      if wh      wj     the strategy profile in which both
players choose h is a pure strategy equilibrium and  wh       wj        wj     contradicting
      this completes the proof in case     
case      wj      wj      let b be a pure strategy profile in which the maximum
welfare is obtained  that is  u b    opt f    in order to prove the theorem it suffices to
prove that
u b    u a  
    
suppose in b the players choose distinct facilities  one of these facilities can be j  
since a is a pure strategy equilibrium  wl      wj     for every l    j  therefore  since
also wj      wj      u b   u a  and in particular      holds  suppose the two players
choose the same facility in b  and denote this facility by s  if s   j b   a and      holds 
therefore we assume s    j  if ws      wj      u b   u a   which implies       therefore
we can assume ws       wj     and in particular ws       wj      since wj      wl     for
every facility l  l    j  b is a pure strategy equilibrium and u b    u a   contradicting
      hence the proof of case     is complete 
case    j    k  let b be an arbitrary pure strategy profile in which the maximum
welfare is obtained  that is  u b    opt f    it suffices to prove that      holds 
recall that a is a pure strategy equilibrium  if in b each player chooses a different
facility  u b   u a  and in particular      holds  therefore we assume that in b both
players choose the same facility l  l can be j or k   we claim that
wl      max wj      wk      

    

indeed  if      does not hold  b is a pure strategy equilibrium  because a player in b does
not want to deviate to either j or k  and she does not want to deviate to any other facility
because a is a pure strategy equilibrium  since u b    u a  this contradicts       since
u b     wl     and max wj      wk       u a        implies        
notice that theorems   and   imply that correlation can help in congestion games with
only two players  the next theorem shows that correlation cannot help increasing social
welfare when the facilities are non increasing 
theorem   m v  qn  m       for every m    
proof  let f  qn  m   let j  m be such that wj      wl     for all l  m   if
wj       wl     for all l    j  j is a strictly dominant strategy  which implies by lemma  
that m v  f        suppose there exist some facility k k    j such that wj      wk     
choose such k for which wk     is maximal  that is wl      wk     for every l  l    j 
therefore  the strategy profile in which one player chooses j and the other player chooses
k is a pure strategy equilibrium which obtains the maximal welfare  the existence of such
a strategy profile implies that m v  f          
      simple congestion games with n players
theorems   and   in section       imply that correlation has an unbounded value when
considering arbitrary games  the next theorem shows that correlation has similar effects
in the context of simple congestion games  in particular  we show that the mediation value
is unbounded with the presence of an additional player 
   

fion the value of correlation

theorem   m v   f  f  qn          
proof  consider the following family of forms f              m    a    a     wa   
 z           wa                  where z        observe that the games  f are the games
given in the proof of theorem    figure     and that the monotonicity condition is satisfied
for every           
we first show that for every sufficiently small   the welfare in every mixed strategy
equilibrium is lower than     after that we will construct  for every sufficiently small   a
correlated equilibria in f such that the welfare in these correlated equilibria approaches
infinity as     
note that the only pure strategy equilibria are the strategy profiles in which two players
play a  and one player plays a    the welfare in each of these strategy profiles is       
which is less than    
we proceed to deal with mixed strategy equilibria in which at least one player does not
play a pure strategy  in such an equilibrium  no player plays the strategy a  with probability
one because if one of the players does it  the only mixed strategy equilibria are those in
which each of the other two players plays a  with probability one  i e   the equilibrium is
pure 
suppose some player plays a  with probability one  note that the utility matrix of the
other two players is as given in figure

therefore it is standard to check that there exists a unique mixed strategy equilibrium
in which one of the players play a  with probability    and that this equilibrium  when this
player is player   is 
 

 

          
 
    
 
   
           
since the game is symmetric  the only mixed strategy equilibria are the three permutations
of this vector  the welfare in each of these mixed strategy equilibria is

as     
consider a completely mixed strategy equilibrium  that is  every player assigns positive
probabilities to both facilities  denote this equilibrium by   p     p    q     q    h    
h       p  q  h      because player   is indifferent between a  and a  given that players  
and   play  q     q   h     h  respectively

fiashlagi  monderer    tennenholtz

note that similar equalities hold for players   and    when q and h are exchanged with p
respectively  for every fixed h there exists a unique q that solves equation       therefore 
by permuting the names of the players  p   q   h  this enables us to reduce equation     
to
 z       p         z p   z     
    
which yields


 z           z
p 
 z       

    

because the other solution of      does not satisfy     p      therefore  the welfare in this
completely mixed strategy equilibrium is

let a          p           p  and b    zp    zp     zp  hence        a   b  we
show that a     and b    as      observe that p    as      this implies that

as     
this completes the proof that vn  f       for every sufficiently small enough  
to complete the proof of the theorem we construct  for every sufficiently small   a
correlated equilibria in f such that the welfare in these correlated equilibria approaches
infinity as     
in order that a correlated strategy  will be a correlated equilibrium in f   the following
inequalities should be satisfied  in brackets we relate the inequality to the corresponding
inequality in

monotonicity condition  wf  n    wg      which yields a contradiction  therefore      holds 
which implies that choosing f strictly dominates choosing g in   therefore  by lemma   
every correlated equilibrium in  is a pure strategy profile  which generates the congestion

theorem    we know that the mediation value equals    unfortunately  we do not know
what is the mediation value for these classes of games when n     however  the example
below shows that  when n      the mediation value for this class is at least      hence  the
mediation value is between       and

two players choose f and the other player chooses g  consider the correlated strategy  
which assigns the probability    to every strategy profile in which not all players choose the
same facility  it is easily verified that  is a correlated equilibrium and that the welfare at
 is     hence  the mediation value is at least

for the next discussion it is useful to recall that the price of stability of a cost game is the
ratio between the minimal cost at a mixed strategy equilibrium and the minimal cost  and
that the price of stability with utilities of a utility game is the ratio between the maximal
welfare and the maximal welfare at a mixed strategy equilibrium 
let n  m     another open question for us is estimating the mediation value  of simple
congestion games with n players  m facilities  and with nonnegative  non increasing  and
linear facilities  one can think that an upper bound for this class can be derived from
the results about the price of stability for the analogous class of congestion games with
costs  indeed  christodoulou and koutsoupias        proved that the price of stability of
the class of congestion games with cost with n players  m facilities  and with nonnegative 
linear  and non decreasing cost functions is bounded above by      had this result proven
for the price of stability with utilities for our class of games it would have implied  in
particular  that the mediation value of this class is bounded above by      because the
mediation value cannot exceed the price of stability with utilities    however  as discussed
in the introduction  results about the price of stability in cost models cannot be transformed
to results about the price of stability with utilities in utility models  to illustrate this  we
show in the next example that the price of stability with utilities of the class  f  f 
qn      all facilities of f are linear  equals    
example   let x       be fixed  let n           m    f  g  and for every d    
let wfd    x   d     x      let wgd    x  x   and d be the associated congestion game 
since f strictly dominates g  the strategy profile in which both players choose f is the only
mixed equilibrium in the game d   the welfare obtained in this equilibrium is  x      the
strategy profile attaining the maximal welfare is the one in which each player chooses a
different facility yielding a welfare of  x      d  since  x  d
 x     when d    the price
of stability of  f  f  qn      all facilities of f are linear  equals  
theorems    and example   show that correlation can be helpful in the context of  even
non increasing  congestion games  the next theorem shows that correlation can be helpful
even in the narrow class of facility symmetric forms with nonnegative and non increasing
facilities 
theorem    m v   f  f  in n         for every n    
proof  let n     it suffices to prove that there exists f  in n  such that m v  f       
let          be fixed and sufficiently small  and consider the following form  f   w   
w       n                         note that the maximal welfare is obtained by any strategy
profile in which exactly n    players choose the same facility  i e   when the congestion
vector is         n     or      n         let l be the set of all strategy profiles with a
congestion vector   or     note that there exist exactly  n strategy profiles in l  let  be
 
the correlated strategy in which every strategy profile in l is played with probability  n
 
since  is a convex combination of welfare maximizers  the maximal welfare is attained at
    moreover  since        such a result would have saved us the tedious proof of theorem    
    the proof of christodoulou and koutsoupias        elegantly uses the fact that every congestion game
has an exact potential  it is not known to us wether the potential approach could simplify our proof
of theorem     however  it turns out that their technique can not be applied directly to our setting
because essentially they bound the total cost of the players on every facility separately in a given profile 

   

fion the value of correlation

  we claim that  is a correlated equilibrium  indeed  by      it is easily verified that in
f there exists a unique constraint that should be satisfied in order to guarantee that  is a
correlated equilibrium  this constraint is    n        n  
    which is indeed satisfied
 n
because we chose  to be sufficiently small  hence  is a correlated equilibrium 
in order to prove that m v  f        it suffices to prove that no mixed strategy equilibrium obtains the maximal welfare  first  note that only strategy profiles in l obtain
the maximal welfare  hence  if a pure strategy equilibrium obtains the maximal welfare  it
must belong to l  however  we claim that every strategy profile in l is not in equilibrium 
indeed any player that chooses the facility chosen by n    players is better off deviating to
the other facility since her utility will increase by  
therefore  it remains to show that in every mixed strategy equilibrium  p    p            pn   
in which at least one player assigns a positive probability to each facility  there exists at
least one pure strategy profile  s  not in l  which is played with positive probability  that
is p  s       where p is the correlated strategy associated with p  indeed  let p be a
mixed strategy equilibrium  and assume w l o g  that player i assigns a positive probability
to both facilities  that is  pi      pi          assume in negation that p  t      implies t  l 
and let s be a strategy profile for which p  s       since pi      pi          p     si       and
p     si        therefore      si    l and     si    l  which is impossible since n      
if we further restrict the assumptions in theorem    by requiring some concavity condition correlation cannot help anymore  we first define concavity 
let n     a function v               n   r  is concave if for every integer k     k   n 
v k       v k   v k   v k     
theorem    let n  m     and let f  in nm   define v k    kw k  for every
   k  n  where w is the common facility payoff function  that is  w   wj for every
j  m   if v is concave  there exists a pure strategy equilibrium in f which obtains the
maximal welfare  consequently  m v  f       
proof  for convenient we also define v         we first define an operator on congestion
vectors  let                  m   be a congestion vector and let j  l  m be any pair of
distinct facilities  let    j  l  be the congestion vector obtained from  by replacing j and
  
  
l with j   d j   l e and l   b j   l c  respectively  where bxc  dxe  denotes
pm the largest
 least  integer that is not higher  lower  than x  observe that u    
i   v i    and
therefore  by the concavity of v 
u    j  l    u   

    

next we describe a finite sequence of congestion vectors  such that each one of them
obtains the maximal welfare and the last one is also in equilibrium  before that  set k   
n

c  k    d m
e  and note that every congestion vector in which each coordinate is either k 
or k  is in equilibrium 
pick any congestion vector  that obtains the maximal welfare  if  is in equilibrium 
we are done  otherwise  not all of its coordinates are k  or k    in particular  there exist
two distinct coordinates j and l such that j  k    l  k    and at least one inequality
is strict  construct        j  l   by       u      u    and therefore    obtains the
maximal welfare  if   is in equilibrium we are done  otherwise let      and repeat the
   

fiashlagi  monderer    tennenholtz

process  if the sequence of   s does not terminate  it eventually reaches a   in which every
coordinates equals k  or k    i e   it reaches an equilibrium a contradiction  therefore  the
sequence terminates after finite number of stages  and hence the last congestion vector in
the sequence is in equilibrium and attains the maximal welfare   
    the enforcement value
we already know from the construction in the proof of theorem   that the enforcement
value of the class d    x   x      of prisoners dilemma games described in figre  
is unbounded  it is easily verified that every game in this class is a potential game  and
therefore  by  monderer   shapley         it is a congestion game  moreover  it can be easily
verified that each such game can be derived from a simple and nonnegative congestion form
in q     therefore  ev   f  f  q         however  as noticed by monderer        
not every congestion game with nonnegative utilities can be represented by a congestion
form with nonnegative and non increasing facilities  in particular  it can be shown that
the prisoners dilemma games in d cannot be represented by simple congestion forms
with nonnegative and non increasing facilities  the next theorem shows that even if the
facility payoff functions are restricted to be non increasing  the enforcement value remains
unbounded for two player games 
theorem    ev   f  f  qn  m       for every m    
proof  consider the games d  d      given in example    since using facility f strictly
dominates using g  by lemma    the strategy profile in which both players choose f is the
d 
unique correlated equilibrium in d   as is proved in example    opt 
   when d   
vc  d  
this proves the theorem for m      for m     the proof is obtained  as above  by naturally
modifying the games in example     
since theorem    deals with two players  we deduce that the enforcement value is
unbounded also for the class of games generated by linear facilities in qn  m because for
two players  every non increasing facility is linear 
note that the proof of theorem    utilizes games  which posses strictly  and in particular 
weakly dominant strategies  the next theorem deals with games without weakly dominant
strategies 
theorem   
 i  ev   f  f  qn      there are no weakly dominant strategies       
 ii  ev   f  f  qn      there are no weakly dominant strategies      
proof  assertion  i  follows from theorem    as for assertion  ii   the proof follows by
observing that the game in the proof of theorem   is a simple congestion game with nonincreasing facilities   
the next theorem shows that the enforcement value tends to  when the number of
players tends to  even when restricting the facilities to be symmetric and non increasing

fion the value of correlation

proof  consider the following family of forms fn  in n    n     m    f  g  and let

wf   wg     n                   observe that the congestion vector  n       n      obtains

the maximal welfare  which equals n  therefore  in order to prove the theorem  it suffices
to show that
    
vc  fn      for every n    
b by the
let then n    be fixed  in order to prove       we use the dual program  d  
weak duality theorem  every feasible solution of the dual problem satisfies   vc  fn   
therefore  it suffices to prove that the dual problem has a feasible solution with      
b  described right after      
however  in our case  the dual problem is just the problem  d
b    in which all dual variables except  have an identical
we will find a feasible solution to d

which has the feasible solution   x              therefore      holds   
although the enforcement value may be unbounded when we have facility symmetric
congestion forms  it is interesting to characterize those congestion games for which correlation enables to get the maximal welfare  this is done in the next theorem  but first we need
the following notations  let f be a congestion form  and let  be a congestion vector in
f   let    m  m be a one to one function  i e    is a permutation of the set of facilities 
we define the congestion vector        jm as follows     j     j  for every facility j 
recall that b is thesset of all strategy profiles that induce the congestion vector   we
further define  l    b  to be the set of all strategy profiles that induce a permutation

proof of theorem      
clearly  if there exist a congestion vector  and a correlated equilibrium   c f   
which satisfy both conditions  vc  f     opt f    before we prove the other direction we
need claim   below 
let w be the common facility payoff function  that is  w   wj for every j  m   for
every congestion vector  we define z   as follows

claim    suppose vc  f     opt f    let              m   be a congestion vector in which
u     opt f    and let  be a correlated strategy distributed uniformly over all elements
in l    is a correlated equilibrium if and only if z      
proof  let d i j be the set of all strategy profiles in which player i chooses facility j and
the congestion vector is   that is d i j    d   d  b   di   j

we proceed with proving the remaining direction  suppose that vc  f     opt f    and
assume for a contradiction that there do not exist a congestion vector  and a correlated
equilibrium   c f   such that  is distributed uniformly over all elements in l and
u     opt f    recall that for every strategy profile d  s   d is the congestion vector
induced
by d and that kd is the number of players that choose facility k in d  let d  
s
 d u  d   opt f    l d   because of our negation assumption  claim   implies that
z  d       for every d  d 

    

we are about to utilize lemma    and for that matter set j    d   define the matrix
a of size j  n m   m  as follows 
a d  ijk

    the proof technique was inspired by nau and mccardle

where each row corresponds to a strategy profile d  d and column ijk corresponds to
player i who chooses jth strategy  facility  and deviates to the kth strategy  j    k   and

  otherwise 
every row d in the matrix a corresponds to strategy profile d  d  which in turn 
d    set b d    z  d   for every d 
corresponds to a congestion vector  d     d        m

d  note that the column vector x                   rj satisfies  i  in lemma    where
b    b d  dd   therefore  by lemma    system  ii  in lemma   does not have a solution 
because vc  f     opt f    there exists a correlated equilibrium  say   satisfying u    
vc  f     opt f    obviously   is supported in d  that is  d      for every d   d  let
y d     d  for every d  d  and let y    y d  dd   since  is a correlated equilibrium

contradicting       therefore  our negation assumption cannot hold  and the theorem is
proved   
theorem    shows that for symmetric congestion games  under the conditions of the
theorem  correlation helps in obtaining the maximal welfare  the next example shows that
there exist such games in which mixed strategy equilibrium is not as useful as correlated
equilibrium 
example   let f  i     let wj                            for every j         it is easy
to verify that the maximal welfare is obtained in a strategy profile a if and only if a 
l   l    where            and             let  be the correlated strategy  which is
distributed uniformly over l    it can be checked that  is a correlated equilibrium  hence 
by theorem     vc  f     opt f    on the other hand  note that both   and   are not
in equilibrium  hence  in every mixed strategy profile  a profile which does not obtain the
maximal welfare will be played with positive probability  therefore the mediation value is
greater than    i e  the best mixed strategy equilibrium is less useful than the best correlated
equilibrium 

   conclusion
in this work we have introduced and studied two measures for the value of correlation in
strategic interactions  the mediation value and the enforcement value  these measures
complement existing measures appearing in the price of anarchy literature  which are comparing the maximal welfare  when agent behavior can be dictated  to the welfare obtained
in nash equilibrium  when agents are selfish   indeed  correlation captures many interesting situations  which are common to computing systems and e commerce applications  in

many systems a reliable party can advise the agents on how to behave but can not enforce
such behavior  the gain that may be obtained by this capability is the major subject of
the study presented in this work  we studied and showed the power of this approach  both
for general games and in the context of congestion games
