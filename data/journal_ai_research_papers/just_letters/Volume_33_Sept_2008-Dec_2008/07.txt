abstract
shapleys impossibility result indicates that the two person bargaining problem has no
non trivial ordinal solution with the traditional game theoretic bargaining model  although
the result is no longer true for bargaining problems with more than two agents  none of the
well known bargaining solutions are ordinal  searching for meaningful ordinal solutions 
especially for the bilateral bargaining problem  has been a challenging issue in bargaining
theory for more than three decades  this paper proposes a logic based ordinal solution
to the bilateral bargaining problem  we argue that if a bargaining problem is modeled in
terms of the logical relation of players physical negotiation items  a meaningful bargaining
solution can be constructed based on the ordinal structure of bargainers preferences  we
represent bargainers demands in propositional logic and bargainers preferences over their
demands in total preorder 
we show that the solution satisfies most desirable logical
properties  such as individual rationality  logical version   consistency  collective rationality
as well as a few typical game theoretic properties  such as weak pareto optimality and
contraction invariance  in addition  if all players demand sets are logically closed  the
solution satisfies a fixed point condition  which says that the outcome of a negotiation is
the result of mutual belief revision  finally  we define various decision problems in relation
to our bargaining model and study their computational complexity 

   introduction
bargaining has been a central research topic in economics for over five decades and has
become an interesting issue in computer science in recent years  osborne   rubinstein 
      rosenschein   zlotkin        muthoo         in his ground breaking paper  nash
       models a bargaining problem as a pair  s  d   where s     is a subset of twodimensional euclidean space  feasible set   representing a set of utility pairs that can be
derived from bargainers preferences on feasible outcomes  and d is a point in d designated
to be the disagreement point  a bargaining solution is then a function that assigns each
bargaining problem  s  d  a point in s  thomson        
the nash bargaining model presumes that bargainers preferences are represented by
von neumann morgenstern utility  referred to as cardinal utility  myerson         under
such an assumption  two utility functions can be viewed as the same if one can be derived
from the other by an affine positive transformation  thus a bargaining solution based on
nashs bargaining model should be invariant under any affine positive transformations 
however  traditional economic theory considers bargaining problems in which players preferences are represented in ordinal  calvo   peters         therefore  ideally  a bargaining

solution should be invariant under any order preserving transformations on utilities  this
property is referred to as ordinal invariance in the game theoretic literature  thomson 
       a bargaining solution that possesses such a property is called an ordinal solution 
obviously  ordinal bargaining solutions are more desirable than cardinal solutions because
ordinal information about players preferences is easier to elicit than cardinal preferences
and the corresponding solutions can be more robust  sakovics        calvo   peters        
however  none of the well known bargaining solutions  nash        kalai   smorodinsky 
      kalai        perles   maschler        are ordinal  in fact  shapley        showed
that for the two person bargaining problem  bilateral bargaining  there is no non trivial
 i e   strongly individual rational  ordinal solution    the result is generally referred to as
shapleys impossibility result in the game theoretic literature 
shapleys negative result obviously discouraged the investigation of ordinal bargaining 
notwithstanding shapley himself demonstrated ten years later that ordinal solutions exist
for the three person bargaining problem  shubik         the study of ordinal bargaining
theory did not regain the focus of game theory until very recently  kibris        provided an
axiomatic characterization for an ordinal solution of the three person bargaining problem
based on nashs bargaining model    safra and samet        extended the result to the
bargaining problems with more than three players  rubinstein et al         and oneill et
al         investigated the ordinal bargaining problem by varying nashs bargaining model 
calvo and perers        explored the problem of ordinal bargaining in which at least one
player is cardinal  nevertheless  the problem of ordinal bargaining is still considered to be an
unsolved problem  most of these pierces of work focus on the existence of ordinal solutions 
none of these proposed solutions gains strong intuitive support  looking for meaningful
ordinal bargaining solutions is still an outstanding problem in game theory  sakovics        
to show the difficulty of ordinal bargaining  let us consider a simple but typical bargaining
scenario 
example    muthoo        two players  a and b  bargain over the partition of a cake 
let xi be the share of the cake in percentage to player i  i   a  b   the set of possible
agreements is represented by      xa   xb        xa      and xb        xa    for each
xi            ui  xi   is player is utility from obtaining a share xi of the cake 
assume that player a has a linear utility scale of its share  ua  xa     xa   and player
b has a utility scale that is proportional to the square of his share  ub  xb     x b   failure to agree is rated   by both a and b  consider two most influential bargaining solutions  nashs solution  nash        and kalai smorodinskys solution  kalai   smorodinsky         it is easy to calculate that nashs bargaining solution to the problem gives the
outcome              and kalai smorodinskys solution gives               both solutions are
in favor of player b  this is because player b is less risk averse  has concave utility  than
player a  has linear utility   for both nashs solution and kalai smorodinskys solution 
risk loving players has advantage in bargaining comparing to risk neutral and risk averse
players  see roths book      a  p         now consider an order preserving transformation

  x    x on player bs utility  the transformed utility of player b becomes linear  under
   see the work of thomson        for an easy proof 
   the original work was not formally published  kibris        gave a brief note 

   

fian ordinal bargaining solution with fixed point property

the new utility scales  both nashs solution and kalai smorodinskys solution give         
as outcome  this means that none of the solutions is ordinally invariant 
this example clearly shows that the non linearity of utility functions  which expresses
the risk posture of a player  determines the outcomes of bargaining but collapses under ordinal transformations  in other words  ordinal transformations filter out useful information
that is expressible by cardinal utility but not expressible by ordinal utility  this explains
why no resolution of the two player bargaining problem can be made on the basis of ordinal
utility alone      a satisfactory theory of bilateral bargaining requires knowledge of something more than just an ordering of the bargainers preferences  see shubiks book       
p        
all in all  ordinal preference is insufficient to fully specify a bargaining situation  a
bargaining model must supply a way to express the information additional to ordinal preferences  such as bargainers attitude towards risk  this article aims to demonstrate with an
ordinal solution to the bilateral bargaining problem that the language of logic can be used
to express the knowledge that is required for modeling bargaining with ordinal preferences 
in recent years  the studies on logic based frameworks of bargaining and negotiation
have received considerable attention in the field of artificial intelligence  ai   sycara       
kraus  sycara    evenchik        parsons  sierra    jennings        zhang  foo  meyer 
  kwok        meyer  foo  kwok    zhang        zhang               these frameworks
utilize logical languages to represent bargaining situations so that physical negotiation items 
bargaining conflicts  players beliefs and mutual threats can be explicitly expressed  which
differentiates themselves from the traditional game theoretic models  in this paper we
propose an ordinal solution to the bilateral bargaining problem based on the logical model
introduced by zhang and zhang      a  
the organization of the paper is the following  section   presents the formal model of
bargaining  we will use a finite propositional language to describe bargainers demands 
the bargainers preferences on their demands are sorted in total preorder  a bargaining
problem is then defined as a pair of hierarchies of two parties demand sets  the construction
of the bargaining solution  presented in section    is based on the idea that each party tries
to maximize their prior demands to be included in the final agreement while keeping the
outcome to be consistent  the approach can be viewed as an extension of nebels prioritized
base revision to the two agent setting  nebel         section   and section   are devoted
to the discussions on the properties of the proposed solution  we shall prove in section
  that the solution satisfies most desirable logical properties  such as the logical version
of individual rationality  consistency and collective rationality  more extraordinarily 
we shall show that the solution satisfies a desirable fixed point condition introduced by
zhang et al          which says that the outcome of bargaining is the result of mutual
belief revision  section   focuses on the discussion of the game theoretic properties of the
solution  we prove that the solution satisfies weak pareto optimality  restricted symmetry
and contraction invariance  section   is devoted to a discussion of how bargainers attitudes
towards risk are represented in our model and how they determine players bargaining power 
section   investigates the complexity issues related to the proposed model  we consider four
major decision problems in relation to a bargaining game and provide their computational

complexity results  the final two sections conclude the work with a discussion of the related
work 
the paper is made to be self contained  however  the reader will find that basic knowledge in belief revision and game theoretic bargaining theory can be helpful for a better
understanding of the concepts introduced in the paper  for an introductory survey of the
areas  see gardenforss article        and thomsons article         respectively 

   representation of bargaining problems
as we have seen in example    an ordinal solution to the bilateral bargaining problem
requires information in addition to ordinal preferences  in order to express such extra information  we model a bargaining situation in two aspects  the physical bargaining terms 
described in propositional logic  and the ordering of the bargainers preferences on their
bargaining terms  described in total preorder  since the bilateral bargaining is the most
challenging problem to bargaining theory  we shall restrict ourselves to the bargaining problem with only two players 
    preliminaries
we assume that each party has a set of negotiation items  referred to as demand set 
described by a finite propositional language l  the language consists of a finite set of
propositional variables and the propositional connectives       and  with standard
syntax and semantics  the logical closure operator cn is defined as cn x        x     
where x is a set of sentences  we say x to be logically closed or a belief set if x   cn x  
if x and y are two sets of sentences  x   y denotes cn x  y   
suppose that x  and x  are two sets of sentences  to simplify exploration  we use xi
to represent the other set among x  and x  if xi is one of them  if d is a vector of two
components  d  and d  will represent each component of d 
    bargaining games
as shown in the previous section  cardinal utility encodes two types of information  bargainers attitude towards risk  via non linearity of utility functions  and bargainers preferences
on possible outcomes  via the ordering of utility values   one may ask whether a theory of
bargaining can be based purely on ordinal information about preferences  in order to investigate such a possibility  osborne and rubinstein introduced a different way to represent a
bargaining situation  with which the preference information is separated from the physical
bargaining terms  osborne   rubinstein         precisely  they define a bargaining problem as a four tuple  x  d           where x is a set of feasible outcomes  in physical terms  
d is the disagreement event  and i is a complete transitive reflexive ordering over the set
x  d  representing bargainer is preferences  as shown by example    however  simply
describing physical bargaining terms without specifying their relations does not suffice to
lead to an ordinal solution  see also osborne   rubinsteins book        p      in this
paper  we further extend osborne   rubinsteins model in such a way that the physical
negotiation items are represented in logical formulae 
   

fian ordinal bargaining solution with fixed point property

definition   a bargaining game is a pair   x          x          where xi  i         is a
logically consistent set of sentences in l and i is a complete transitive reflexive order
 total preorder or weak order  over xi that satisfies the following logical constraint   
 lc  if          n     then there is k     k  n  such that  i k  
we call the pair  xi   i   the prioritized demand set of player i  for any     xi    i 
denotes that  i  and   i    i  denotes that  i  and  i  
intuitively  a bargaining game is the formal representation of a bargaining situation in
which each player describes his demands in logical formulae and expresses his preferences
on his demands in total preorder  we assume that each player has consistent demands  the
preference ordering of each player reflects the degree of entrenchment in which the player
defends his demands  the logical constraint lc says that if the demand  is a logical
consequence of the demands          n   then  should not be less entrenched than all the
i because if you fail to defend   at least one of the i has to be dropped  otherwise you
would not have lost    it is easy to see that such an ordering is similar to gadenfors and
makinsons epistemic entrenchment  gardenfors   makinson         in fact  the logical
constraint lc  introduced by zhang and foo         is actually the combination of the
postulates ee  and ee  of epistemic entrenchment ordering 
observation   let  be a total preorder on x  the logical constraint lc is equivalent to
the conjunction of the following conditions 
   if      then    
   either      or      
proof  it is easy to verify that lc implies these two conditions  we now prove that the
conditions imply lc by induction on n  obviously  lc holds when n      assume that lc
holds when n   l  suppose that          l    l   l       then          l     l l        
by the inductive assumption  either   l  l   or there is k     k  l     such that
  k   if   l  l     by the condition   and transitivity of   either   l or
  l     therefore in any case there is k     k  l      such that   k  

we remark that the preference ordering represents how firmly an agent entrenches her
demands rather than her gain or payoff    for instance  suppose that p  represents the
demand of a seller the price of the good is no less than     and p  denotes the price
of the good is no less than     obviously the seller could get higher payoff from p  than
p    however  since p  implies p    she will entrench p  no less firmly than p    i e   p   p   
   a complete transitive reflexive order  i e   total preorder or weak order  satisfies the following properties 
 completeness or totality     or    
 reflexivity     
 transitivity  if    and    then    
   we will define bargainers gains in section

because  if she fails to keep p    she can still bargain for p  but the loss of p  means the loss
of both 
there is another significant difference between our model of bargaining and the gametheoretic model  the game theoretic model abstracts a bargaining situation into a numerical
game  the demands  preferences and risk posture of a player are all represented in utility
values  in our model  however  these factors are abstracted into logical statements and
ordering on these statement  i e   a prioritized demand set  note that we have endowed
the word demand with a broad meaning  in our model  a demand of a player can be
everything that is related to the negotiation and that the player wants to keep in the final
agreement  it can be a physical item the player wants to obtain from the other party  it can
also be a piece of knowledge  a belief  a goal  a constraint or even a thread  whatever  the
player wants to keep in the agreement  different from the logics for rational agency  such
as the bdi logics  we do not distinguish knowledge  belief  goal from the real demands 
for instance  a logical tautology can be a demand of a player if the player considers that
it should be included in the final agreement  consider example   again  typical demands
of player a are xa      xa      xa      and so on    which mean that the player
wants to get a share of the cake no less than                    player bs demands
are the opposite  say xb      xb      xb          besides these real demands 
there are a set of domain constraints in the players demand sets  such as xa   xb      
xa  y  xa  z and xb  y  xb  z whenever y  z  these constraints link all
the demands of the players together  therefore  play an important rule in the determination
of bargaining outcomes  for instance  we cannot have both xa     and xb     in
the final agreement because they are inconsistent with the constraints  one may wonder
what if a player does not include these constraints in her demand set  in this case  the
player would have to accept unreasonable results  such as xa     and xb      in other
words  if we idealize the bargaining problem by assuming that the two individuals are highly
rational   see the work of nash        p       we should assume that these constraints and
background knowledge are included in the demand set of each player  see more discussions
on this example in section     again  the ordering of demand sets does not reflect the gains
of a player as we mentioned above  it is very likely that a rational agent could give her
highest priority to the above mentioned constraints and background knowledge since she
might be never going to give up these fundamental rules 
the following example shows that our model is more suitable for discrete domain of
problems 
example   a couple are making their family budget for the next year  the husband wants
to change his car to a new fancy model and have a domestic holiday  the wife is going to
implement her dream of a romantic trip to europe and suggests to redecorate their kitchen 
both of them know that they cant have two holidays in one year  they also realize that
they cannot afford a new car and an overseas holiday in the same year without getting a
loan from the bank  however  the wife does not like the idea of borrowing money 
in order to represent the situation in logic  let c denote buy a new car  d stand for
domestic holiday  o for overseas holiday  k for kitchen redecoration and l for loan 
   note that the player may have different demands at different stages of negotiation 

   

fian ordinal bargaining solution with fixed point property

then  d  o  means that it is impossible to have both domestic holiday and overseas
holiday  the statement  c  o   l says that if they want to buy a new car and also have
an overseas holiday  they have to get a loan from the bank 
with the above symbolization  we can express the husbands demands in the following
set 
x     c  d   d  o    c  o   l 
similarly  the wifes demands can be represented by 
x     o  k   d  o    c  o   l  l 
let us assume that the husbands preferences over his demands are 
 d  o     c  o   l   c   d
and the wifes preferences are 
 d  o     c  o   l   o   k   l
note that both agents give the common beliefs   d  o  and  c  o   l the highest
priority  this reflects that the couple are rational  we shall see that these common beliefs
play important role in the determination of bargaining solution 
from the above example  we can also see the differences between our model and osborne
  rubinsteins model  osborne   rubinstein         first  the demand sets x  and x 
in our model represent players physical demands rather than feasible outcomes  note that
the two players share the same feasible set x in osborne   rubinsteins model   in our
model  the feasible set is generated from the demand sets through a procedure of conflict
resolving  see definition   and example     secondly  we do not have a representation of
disagreements  if a negotiation ends with disagreement  we simply assume that the agreement is empty  thirdly  in osborne   rubinsteins model  the items in x are independent 
while in our model  the items from both players demand sets are related through their
logical relations and the orderings  via lc   this allows us to represent bargainers attitude
towards risk 
    hierarchy of demands
before we construct our bargaining solution  we present the basic properties of prioritized
demand sets  consider a prioritized demand set  x    for a single agent  we define
recursively a hierarchy   x j   
j     of x with respect to the ordering  as follows 
   x        x     x       t     x x    
   x j        t j     t j        t j     t j  x j    
the intuition behind the construction is the following  at each stage of the construction 
we collects all the maximal elements from the current demand set and remove them from
the set for the next stage of the construction  it is easy to see that there exists a number

n such that x

x j due to the logical constraint lc    therefore a demand set x can

be always written as x        x n   where x j  x k    for any j    k  see figure     also

figure    the hierarchy of a demand set 
for any   x j and   x k      if and only if j   k  in other words  the prioritized
demand set  x    uniquely determines a partition of x

x j   with a total order over

j  

the partition  therefore  the concept of prioritized demand set is equivalent to the concept
of so called nicely ordered partition of a belief set    introduced by zhang and foo  zhang
  foo         if the demand set is logically closed 
in the sequent  we write x k to denote

k
s

xj 

j  

    prioritized base revision
once we have a hierarchy of the demand set for each agent  we are able to define a belief
revision operator for each agent by following nebels prioritized base revision  nebel          
we define a revision function  as follows 
for any demand set  x    and a set f of sentences 
def

x f  

 

 h   f   

hxf

where x  f is defined as  h  x  f if and only if
   h  x 
   for all k  k              h  x k is a maximal subset of x k such that

k
s

 h  x j    f

j  

is consistent 

in other words  h is a maximal subset of x that is consistent with f and gives priority to
the higher ranked items  the following result will be used in section   
lemma    nebel        if x is logically closed  then  satisfies all agm postulates 
   note that x can be an infinite set even though the language is finite 
   a nicely ordered partition of a belief set k is a triple  k       where  is a partition of k and  is a
total order on  that satisfies the logical constraint lc  see the work of zhang and foo        p     
   the idea of the construction can be traced back to poole and brewkas approach to default logic  brewka 
      poole        

   

fian ordinal bargaining solution with fixed point property

   bargaining solution
in nashs bargaining model  a bargaining solution is defined as a function that assigns to
each bargaining game a point in the feasible set of the game  however  we do not have such
a simple definition because in our model the set of possible agreements  feasible set  is not
given in a bargaining game  we have to generate the feasible set from the demand sets 
this involves a process of conflict resolving 
    possible deals
whenever the demands from two agents conflict  at least one agent has to make a concession
in order to reach an agreement  the simple way of making a concession is to withdraw a
number of demands  in such sense  a possible agreement is a pair of subsets of two players
original demand sets such that the collection of remaining demands is consistent  obviously
each player would like to keep as many original demands as possible  in addition  if a player
has to give up a demand  the player typically gives up the one with the lowest priority  this
idea leads to the following definition of possible deals 
definition   let g     x          x         be a bargaining game  a deal of g is a pair
 d    d    satisfying the following conditions  for each i        
   di  xi  
   x   x   di  
   for each k  k              di  xik is a maximal subset of xik such that

k
s

 di  xij   

j  

di is consistent 
where  xij   
j   is the hierarchy of xi defined in section      the set of all deals of g is
denoted by  g   called the feasible set of the game 
this definition is obviously an analogue of nebels notion   see section       the only
difference is that the procedure of maximization here is interactive between two agents 
given one players demands  the other player always tops up his demands with the highest
prioritized items provided the overall outcome is consistent 
since we have assumed that both x  and x  are consistent   g  is non empty  specifically  if x   x  is consistent  we have  g      x    x     
example   consider the bargaining game in example    according to the preference orderings of the couple  the game has three possible deals 
d       d  o    c  o   l  c  d     d  o    c  o   l  k  l   
d       d  o    c  o   l  c     d  o    c  o   l  o  k   
d       d  o    c  o   l     d  o    c  o   l  o  k  l   
therefore  g     d    d    d

    the core of agreement
we have shown how to generate possible deals  which form the set of possible agreements 
i e   the feasible set  by resolving conflicting demands  now we are at the same level as the
game theoretic model that  to define a bargaining solution  we only have to select a deal
from all possible deals  obviously  if the demands from two parties contradict  there are
multiple possible deals  different deals would be in favor of different parties  for instance 
in figure    the deal d  is in favor of player   while d   is in favor of player    therefore 
the conflicts in choosing outcomes still exist  the major concern of a bargaining theory is
how to measure and balance the gain of each negotiating party

figure    different deals are in favor of different players 
instead of counting the number of demands that each party can remain from a deal  we
consider the top block demands that a player keeps in the deal  the top levels of demands
in each players demand hierarchy  and ignore all the demands that are not included in the
top blocks for the purpose of measuring players gains 
given a deal d  we shall use the maximal number of the top levels of demands in the
deal as the indicator of each players gain from the deal  i e   max k   xik  di   for
i         for instance  in figure    player   remains maximally the top k    levels of her
demands from the deal d   while player   can successfully gain the top k     levels of his
demands from the same deal  with deal d    both players can remain the top k levels of
demands 
in order to compare different deals  we refer the gain index of a deal to the gain of the
player whoever receives less from the deal  i e   min max k   x k  d     max k   x k 
d      or equivalently  max k   x k  d  and x k  d     for instance  in figure    the
gain index of d  is k while the gain index of d   is k     therefore we can say that d 
is better than d   because  with d    both players can remind at least top k blocks in their
demand hierarchies but d   cant

then  g  collects all the best deals from all the possible deals of g  this is because none

we call             the core of the game  therefore the core contains the top block
demands that all the best deals contain  therefore should be included in the final agreement 
the following lemma gives another way to calculate the core of a game

lemma   max

that x  max  x  max   x   x    is consistent because  g  is non empty  therefore

   on the other hand  since x   x    x   x    is consistent  there exists
a deal  d    d      g  such that xi  di and x   x   di for each i         thus

    the solution
at first sight  a bargaining solution can be easily defined as a function that assigns each
bargaining game g a possible deal in  g   more likely  the solution could select one of
the best deals from  g   however  due to the multiplicity of  g   see figure     such a
selection is not always feasible if we want the solution to be symmetric to each player  to
show the difficulty  let us consider the following example 
example   consider a bargaining game g     x          x          described in three propositional variables p  q and r  where x      p    r   and x      q    r    note that the
demand sets are represented in the form of hierarchy where p   r and q   r  see section
       it is easy to know that the game has two possible deals    p  r    q   and   p    q  r   
which are all in  g   however  none of the deals can lead to an impartial solution  a reasonable solution to the problem should be   p    q    which take the intersection of all the
best deals for each player  respectively 
base on the above intuitive explanation  we are now ready to present our bargaining
solution 
definition   the bargaining solution is the function f defined as follows  which maps a
bargaining game g     x          x         to a pair of sets of sentences

for a better understanding of the construction of our solution  we would like to make

   the solution gives a prediction of bargaining outcome for each game  given a game
g  fi  g  represents all the demands the player i can successfully remain at the end
of bargaining  it also means that these demands are accepted by the other player 
therefore the final agreement of the bargaining can be defined as f   g   f   g    
   note that fi  g   xi for each i         therefore the solution means a compromise
to each player  both players may make concessions to their demands in order to
reach the agreement  obviously  if there is no conflict between the players original
demands  i e   x   x  is consistent  no concession is needed  that is  fi  g    xi
 i         
   the construction of the solution takes a skeptical view in the sense that  for each
player  a demand item is included in the solution only if it belongs to all the best
deals  in other words  the solution gives only a cautious prediction of bargaining
outcome  as a result  the solution is not necessarily a deal if there are multiple
elements in  g  
   the solution is unique to each bargaining game  like the bargaining problem with
non convex domain  we have to scarify strict pareto optimality to gain the uniqueness
 this is the reason we take cautious prediction   however  we will show that the
solution is weakly pareto optimal  see section     for more discussions  
   in our bargaining model  we do not specify disagreement points  in fact  we assume
that if the solution gives an empty agreement  i e   f  g          then the negotiation
reaches a disagreement  in other words       is the default disagreement point for
any bargaining game 
example   continue on example    according to the hierarchies of the demand sets shown
in example    the core of the game is 
   d  o    c  o   l  c     d  o    c  o   l  o  
   alternatively  we can define the final agreement as cn f   g   f   g   if we consider that the outcome
of the negotiation contains all the logical consequences of the demands in the agreement  in addition 
the relation of the items in the agreement should be read as and rather than or  in other words  all
items in the agreement are accepted by all players 

   

fian ordinal bargaining solution with fixed point property

therefore  g  contains only a single deal  which is d   see example     the solution is
then
f  g    d       d  o    c  o   l  c     d  o    c  o   l  o  k  
in words  the couple agree upon the commonsense that they can only have one holiday and
they have to get a loan if they want to buy a new car and to go overseas for holiday  the
husband accepts his wifes suggestion to have holiday in europe and the wife agrees on buying
a new car 
now consider the following preference orderings 
 d  o     c  o   l   d   c
 d  o     c  o   l   o   k   l
therefore the demand hierarchies become 
x       d  o    c  o   l    d    c   
x       d  o    c  o   l    o    k    l   
let g  denote the game  the deals are the same as the original hierarchy as shown
in example    however the solution of the game becomes    d  o    c  o   l     d 
g      and all three deals are included in  g     note that the
o    c  o   l  k   because max
final agreement does not include the demands which lead to conflicting  d  o  l  but keeps
the demands which do not lead to conflicting  k   in other words  the solution excludes the
demands that lead to a conflict but keeps the demands that are not involved in any conflicts
even though they are in low priorities 

   logical properties of the bargaining solution
in the following two sections  we discuss the properties of the bargaining solution introduced in the previous section  according to zhang         a bargaining solution satisfies
the axioms collective rationality  scale invariance  symmetry and mutually comparable
monotonicity as well as the basic assumptions individual rationality  consistency and comprehensiveness if and only if it is the logical version of kalai smorodinsky solution  kalai  
smorodinsky         among these properties  collective rationality  individual rationality
and consistency capture the logical properties of a bargaining solution  scale invariance 
symmetry and mutually comparable monotonicity reflect the game theoretic properties of
a bargaining solution  comprehensiveness is an idealized assumption for a logic based bargaining solution  although there is a significant difference between the bargaining solution
we defined in this paper and the one in that work  these two solutions share most desirable
properties of bargaining solutions 
    generic properties of logic based bargaining solutions
it is easy to see that the solution we constructed in the previous section satisfies the following
generic properties of a logic based bargaining solution 
theorem   for any bargaining game g     x          x          let f  g     f   g   f   g   
then
   

fizhang   zhang

   f   g   x  and f   g   x   

 individual rationality 

   f   g   f   g  is consistent 

 consistency 

   if x   x  is consistent  fi  g    xi for all i 

 collective rationality 

proof  the proofs for these properties are straightforward from the definition of the bargaining solution  definition    

note that the logical version of individual rationality  ir  has a different meaning
of its game theoretic version  the logical version of ir means that each player concerns
only her own demands  i e   whether and how many of her demands are included in the
final agreement  in contrast  the game theoretic version of ir concerns about whether each
player can gain no less than disagreement point from a negotiation  see more details in
section       the other two properties are quite intuitive 
the following example shows that our solution does not satisfy comprehensiveness  which
requires that   fi  g  and  i  implies   fi  g  for each i  see the work of zhang 
      
example   consider a bargaining situation in which player  s demand set is x     p  q 
and player  s demand set is x     p  r   where p  r  q are propositional variables  assume
that each player ranks her demands in same level  i e   both demand sets have a singleton
partition   based on the assumption  it is easy to know that the solution of the game is
  q    r    therefore  the solution is not comprehensive  for instance  q  p and q  f   g 
but p   f   g   
since the solution does not satisfy comprehensiveness  according to zhang         it is
not the logical version of kalai smorodinsky solution  however  this does not mean that
our solution is less intuitive  although comprehensiveness is a common restriction in belief
revision and game theory  it is by no means a desirable property of bargaining solution  in
the above example  q and r are not involved in the conflict of the underlying bargaining
game  thus it is reasonable for the players to keep these irrelevant demands  in addition 
the solution is syntax dependent  if we represent the demand set as x     p  q  and
x     p  r   the solution will be      
    fixed point property
besides the generic properties  the solution possesses another extraordinary logical property 
the fixed point property  we consider bargaining or negotiation as mutual persuasion  one
persuades the other to accept her demands  the outcome of negotiation is then the result
of mutual belief revision  zhang et al          if it is the case  the negotiation outcome
should satisfy the following fixed point property 
theorem   for any bargaining game g     x          x          if x  and x  are logically
closed  the bargaining solution f  g  satisfies the following fixed point condition 
f   g    f   g     x    f   g     x    f   g  

   

where i is the prioritized revision operator for player i  see the definition in section      
   

fian ordinal bargaining solution with fixed point property

assume that x  and x  are two belief sets  so logically closed   representing the belief
states of two agents  mutual belief revision between the agents means that each agent takes
part of the other agents beliefs to revise his belief set  for instance  if   is a subset of x 
and   is a subset of x    then x      is the revised belief set of player   after he accepts
player  s beliefs   while x      is the resulting belief set of player   after accepting
    such an interaction of belief revision can continue until it reaches a fixed point where
the beliefs in common  i e    x          x         are exactly the beliefs that the agents
mutually accept  that is          note that each agent uses his own way of revision to
rebuilt his belief state  if we view bargaining as mutual belief revision  then the agreement
of bargaining  i e   f   g    f   g   is exactly the common demands the agents accept each
other  i e    x    f   g     x    f   g    in other words  the solution f  g  should be the
fixed point with respect to the game g  the above theorem shows that this can be true if
the demand sets of a game are logically closed 
to show this theorem  we need a few technical lemmas 
lemma   for any bargaining game g     x          x         
   f   g   x    f   g  
   f   g   x    f   g  
proof  according to the definition of prioritized base revision  we have x    f   g   
t
cn h  f   g    for any h  x   f   g   there is a deal  d    d      g  such

hx  f   g 

that d    h  this is because we can extend the pair  h  f   g   to a deal  h  d    such that
f   g   d    on the other hand  since    f   g  is consistent  we have    h  where
         is the core of g  thus     d  and    d    it follows that  d    d      g  
since f   g   d    we have f   g   h  we conclude that f   g   x    f   g   the
proof of the second statement is similar 

by this lemma we have 
   f   g    f   g   x    f   g  
   f   g    f   g   x    f   g  
note that the above lemma does not require the demand sets x  and x  to be logically
closed  however  without the assumption  the following lemmas do not hold 
lemma   let          be the core of game g     x          x          if x  and x  are
logically closed  then
   x    f   g    x          x   x     
   x    f   g    x          x   x    
proof  we only present the proof of the first statement  the second one is similar  firstly 
we prove that f   g            x   x     if x   x  is consistent  the result is obviously
true  therefore we can assume that x   x  is inconsistent

consistent  according to lemma    we have x  max x  max  x  x    is inconsistent 
since our language is finite and both x  and x  are logically closed  the sets x   x   
 g   
 g   
x  max
and x  max
are all logically closed  the latter two due to lc   therefore
each set has a finite axiomatization  let sentence   axiomatize x   x      axiomatize
 g   
 g   
x  max and   axiomatize x  max   thus         is inconsistent  notice that
     x  and      x    it follows that         x  and         x   
since            x   x    is consistent  there is a deal  d    d      g  such that
           x  x     d  and            x  x     d    we know
that   f   g   so   d    d    thus          d    d    which contradicts the fact
that d    d  is consistent  therefore  we have shown that f   g            x   x    
now we prove that x    f   g    x          x   x      by lemma    we have
       x    f   g   it follows that x    f   g     x    f   g              
furthermore  we yield x    f   g     x    f   g                 x   x    because
x   x   f   g   since f   g            x   x     according to the agm postulates  we have  x    f   g               x   x       x              x   x     
therefore x    f   g    x              x   x      in addition  it is easy to
prove that    x          x   x      by the agm postulates again  we have
x          x   x        x          x   x           x              x   x     
therefore x    f   g    x          x   x     

the following lemma will complete the proof of theorem   
lemma   if x  and x  are logically closed  then

   we claim that x    f   g        f   g  and x    f   g         f   g   we shall
provide the proof of the first statement  the second one is similar 
firstly  according to lemma            secondly  by lemma    we have x    f   g   
x         x  x      therefore to show x    f   g        f   g   we only need to prove
that x         x  x               x  x     this is because     x  x     f   g  
f   g            x   x    and         by the construction of prioritized revision  we
can easily verify that           x   x     x          x   x      therefore we only
have to show the other direction  i e   x          x   x                x   x    
if      x    then x         x   x     is consistent  it follows that x        
 x   x      x          x   x                 x   x     as desired  if       x   
     
 
  we have x  max      x   x    is inconsistent 
according to the definition of max

therefore there exists   x 

such that        x   x     now we assume that

  x          x   x      if              x   x     then             x   x   
     
is consistent  so is               x   x     notice that     x  max  
there exists h  x         x   x     such that           h  since  
x          x   x     and h is logically closed  we have   h  which contradicts the
consistency of h      x  x      therefore x         x  x              x  x    
finally we prove the claim of the lemma  let    x    f   g     x    f   g   
we then have         f   g          f   g    for        f   g   there exists a sentence   such that f   g      and           similarly  there exists a sentence  
such that f   g      and           it turns out that                 
thus         x   x    however  x   x   f   g    f   g   it follows that
        f   g    f   g   note that       f   g    f   g   therefore we conclude
that   f   g    f   g  

theorem   establishes the link between bargaining theory and belief revision  the link
helps us to understand the reasoning process behind bargaining  it is even more interesting
if we can extend the result into the general multiagent case  however  the main challenge
is how multiple agents mutually revise their beliefs 

   game theoretic properties of the bargaining solution
in game theory  the properties that are considered to be important to a bargaining solution
include individual rationality  pareto optimality  ordinal invariance  or scale invariance  
symmetry and contraction independence  in our bargaining model  bargainers preferences
are represented in total preorder  any order preserving transformation on the preferences
does not change the order of preferences  therefore our solution satisfies ordinal invariance
trivially  in this section  we will examine the other properties in the above list with our
bargaining solution  before presenting the results  we first introduce a few concepts that
are necessary for the game theoretic analysis of bargaining 
    strategies and utilities
two concepts play essential roles in game theoretic analysis of bargaining  strategy and
utility  given a bargaining game g     x          x          a strategy profile of the game is
a pair  s    s    where s   x  and s   x    the strategy profile can be interpreted as a
pair of proposals of demands from both players in a course of bargaining 
we say a strategy profile s    s    s    to be compatible if
   x   x   s  and x   x   s 
   s   s  is consistent
obviously any deal of a game is a compatible strategy profile  the bargaining solution
f  g  is also a compatible strategy profile of g 
now we consider the gains of each player from a strategy profile  assume that the
strategy profile  s    s    leads to an agreement  the player is payoff or utility is defined as 

   

fizhang   zhang

 

ui  si    

max k   xik  si   
min k   xik   xi   

if si    xi  
otherwise 

in other words  ui  s  counts the number of top block demands that are covered by si  
note that the payoff does not count individual demands  specifically we define the utility
for the default disagreement point      to be        
    pareto optimality
based on the above definition  it is easy to see that our solution satisfies individual rationality  in the sense of game theory  because for any game g  ui  fi  g      for i        
now we consider pareto efficiency 
pareto optimality is one of the most important properties of bargaining solution  we
call a compatible strategy profile  s    s    of a game to be  strictly  pareto optimal if there
does not exist a compatible strategy profile  s     s     of the game such that either u   s     
u   s      u   s       u   s    or u   s       u   s      u   s      u   s    
a compatible strategy profile  s    s    of a game is weakly pareto optimal if there does
not exist another compatible strategy profile  s     s     of the game such that u   s       u   s   
and u   s       u   s    
theorem   for any bargaining game g  f  g  is weakly pareto optimal 
proof  suppose that there is a compatible strategy profile  s    s    of g such that u   s     
g
g   since
u   f   g   and u   s      u   f   g    then u   s      max

u   s

max k   x   x    x   x    is consistent    max
f  g  is weakly pareto optimal 

obviously  our solution f does not satisfy strict pareto optimality  for instance  the
solution of g  in example    the second part of the example  is not strictly pareto optimal
 but it is weakly pareto optimal   this is not a problem of the solution but the nature of
the problem domain we consider  it is well known in game theory that if the feasible set of
a bargaining game is not convex  there is no guarantee of unique bargaining solution that is
strictly pareto optimal  kaneko        mariotti         therefore  for non convex domain 
we need a trade off between the uniqueness of solutions and strict pareto optimality  conley
  wilkie              mariotti        xu   yoshihara         by using a similar approach
introduced by zhang         we can map a logically represented bargaining game into a
numerically represented bargaining game  under such a mapping  the feasible set that
corresponds to any logically represented bargaining game is non convex unless the demand
sets of the logical bargaining game is consistent  since our solution is a unique solution  we
cannot expect it to be strictly pareto optimal 
    restricted symmetry
in game theory  a bargaining game is symmetric if the feasible set is invariant under any
permutation of each point in the feasible set  nash         however  the concept of symmetry is not easy to be extended to the logic based bargaining models because a bargaining
   

fian ordinal bargaining solution with fixed point property

problem is represented by its physical items  permutation of deals does not make any sense 
one may wonder how to judge the fairness of bargaining without the concept of symmetry 
in our point of view  there is no such a thing as fair outcome in negotiation  the outcome
of a negotiation relies on the bargaining power of each party  a bargainer with higher
negotiation power receives more gains from the negotiation  however  it is reasonable to
assume that any negotiation should be based on a fair bargaining procedure or a negotiation
protocol  the construction of our bargaining solution is meant to capture the idea of fair
negotiation protocols  the approach we use in this paper is similar to the idea of bargaining
with an agenda  oneill et al          we consider a negotiation process consists of several
rounds or stages  at each round  the parties are to reach agreements on new issues that
have not been considered in the previous rounds  we assume that each party always place
the higher wanted demands at earlier rounds  all the demands that have been mutually
accepted in the earlier rounds have to remain in the agreements of the negotiation in the
later rounds  once there is no new agreement being reached  the negotiation procedure
stops  with such a process  a negotiation always terminates at the same level of priority of
demands for all players 
theorem   for any bargaining game g     x          x          if x  and x  are logically
closed  then there is a natural number n such that
f g     x    x n   x n    x   x      x    x n   x n    x   x     
g   in such a case x n   x n

obviously if x   x  is consistent  then the result is trivial  therefore we assume that
x   x  is inconsistent  we only prove the case that f   g    x             x   x     
the proof of the other part is similar 
for any  d    d      g   we have    d  and    d    we prove that x         
 x   x      d    if it is not the case  there exists a sentence   x             x   x    
such that    d    on the one hand    x          x  x     implies that d  d    
because          x   x     d    d    on the other hand     d  implies that
    d   d  is inconsistent due to the maximality of deals  it follows that d   d     
therefore d   d  is inconsistent  a contradiction  we have proved that for any deal
 d    d      g   x             x   x      d    thus x             x   x

this theorem shows that at the termination of negotiation  each party can remain the
g   including the common demands and their
demands down to the same level  i e   max
logical consequences  however  the solution seemingly excludes the low ranked irrelevant
items  this is due to the assumption of the logical closedness on the demand sets  in fact 
with this assumption  no items are irrelevant because for any two statements     xi   we
always have    and    in xi   this is why we do not assume logical closedness in
general 
another question that may arise is that a player could gain more negotiation power
than the other if he puts more negotiation items in earlier stages of his agenda  effectively
   

fizhang   zhang

could gain more if the negotiation does not end up with disagreement   in fact  this is true
and natural if the risk of breakdown is taken into account  if a player places a conflictive
item in an earlier stage in his agenda  the negotiation would terminate sooner  therefore
the ordering of demands is a part of the strategy of a bargainer  we will discuss this issue
in a separate section  see section   
    contraction independence
contraction independence  or called independence of irrelevant alternatives  iia   requires
that if an alternative is judged to be the best compromise for some problem  then it should
still be judged best for any subproblem that contains it  thomson         for logic based
bargaining model  alternatives are not explicitly given  however  we can easily define the
concept of subproblem in terms of bargainers prioritized demand sets 
a bargaining game g      x            x           is a subgame of g     x          x         
denoted by g  v g  if for any i        
   xi   xi  
    i  i  xi   xi    
   for any   xi   if there is   xi  and     then   xi   
in other words  xi  is the upper segment of xi with respect to xi s hierarchy 
theorem   let g  v g  if f  g  is a strategy profile of g    then f  g      f  g  
proof  first  since f  g  is a strategy profile of g    we have x   x   xi   i

g   by the
according to the definition of subgame  it is easy to show that max

condition that f  g  is a strategy profile of g again  we have max   max   which means
that g  and g share the same core           for each deal  d    d      g   obviously
 d   x     d   x     is a deal of g  and  d   x     d   x       g     it follows that
f   g     d  and f   g     d    therefore f   g     f   g  and f   g     f   g  
on the other hand  for each  d     d       g     we can extend it into a deal  d    d    of
g such that  d    d      g  because g  and g share the same core and x   x   xi 
 i          since f  g  is a strategy profile of g    we have f   g   d   x   and f   g  
d   x     it follows that f   g   d   and f   g   d     which implies f   g   f   g    and
f   g   f   g     we conclude that f  g      f  g  

note that the claim of the above theorem is weaker than nashs iia because  for any
two bargaining games g and g    the alternatives of g  being a subset of the alternatives of
g do not guarantee g  is a subgame of g  however  as it has been pointed out by many
authors  nashs iia in his original form is no longer a plausible assumption for the domain
of non convex bargaining problems  conley   wilkie        mariotti        zhang        

   bargaining power and risk posture
as we have shown in section    representing bargainers preferences in ordinal does not
automatically solve the problem of ordinal bargaining  see example     this is because
   

fian ordinal bargaining solution with fixed point property

ordinal preference has much less expressive power than cardinal utility  it is unable to express risk posture of a player  which determines the players bargaining power  a successful
solution to the ordinal bargaining problem should supply an alternative mean to express
bargainers attitude towards risk  in this section  we will illustrate with two case studies
how this problem is solved using our framework 
    case study i  bargainers attitude towards risk
let us revisit the bargaining game in example    where the demand sets are x     p  r  and
x     q  r   consider the following variations of preferences  which reflect the difference
of players attitude towards risk  note that different cases lead to different games  
g    x      p    r   and x      q    r    
g    x      p  r       and x      q    r  
g    x      p    r   and x      q  r      
g    x      p  r   and x      q  r  
it is easy to calculate the solutions of the games 
f  g        p    q  
f  g        p  r    q  
f  g        p    q  r  
f  g          
in g    both players are risk averse  where the players rank the conflicting item r being
the lowest priority  this means that both have the incentive to reach an agreement  in
g    player   is more aggressive since the conflicting item is highly ranked  we find that
player   won the game in this case  this is not surprising  in general  a risk averse player
would gain disadvantage in negotiation comparing to a risk lover  see roths book      b 
p         g  is symmetrical to g    in g    both players are aggressive  therefore the game
ends up with disagreement 
from the example  it is clear to see how bargainers attitude towards risk are specified
in our model  a risk averse player would give the demands that likely conflict with the
demands of the other player relatively lower priorities so that an agreement is more likely
to be reached  in contrast  a risk loving player would more firmly entrench those conflicting
demands  notice that logic plays a crucial role in the representation  simply expressing
bargainers demands in physical terms without specifying their relation is not sufficient to
lead to an ordinal solution  it is crucial to specify the logical relations between the demands
from all players  in the above example  the contradiction demands r and r play the main
role in the determination of the solutions  this is the main difference of our model from
the game theoretic models 
    case study ii  discretization of numerical games
as we have mentioned in the introduction section  risk posture is represented in non linearity
of utility functions in nashs model  in this subsection  we use the example of cake division
 example    to show how the non linearity of preferences is represented in our model 
    the demand sets are represented in prioritized partitions  their corresponding preference orderings are
p   r and q   r  respectively 

   

fizhang   zhang

to represent the bargaining problem in logical form  we need to discretize the domain 
let pn    player a receives no less than n percentages of the cake and player b gets
the remain   where n is a natural number between   to      in addition  the following
constraints should be acknowledged by both players 
c    pn    pn   n                     
which says that if player   receives no less than n     percents of the cake  then he must
receive no less than n percents 
then the demands of two players can be represented as
xa   c   p    p    p         p     
xb   c   p      p      p          p   
assume that player a arranges his demands according to the linear scale of his share 
the hierarch of his demand set is    
 c   p       p      p       p            p          p      
player b arranges his demands according to the square of his share  the hierarch of her
demand set is    
 c   p           p       p          p            p    p    p      p    p      p    
according to the above setting  the solution of the bargaining game is 
 c   p     p          p     c   p     p          p      
it is easy to calculate that the players agree on the division of the cake to be     xa     
and      xb        therefore our solution gives similar prediction as the game theoretic
solutions  this indicates that the risk posture of the players has been embedded in our
model  in fact  we can easily see that player b is more aggressive because he ranks higher
conflicting items relatively higher than player a does  for instance  player b ranks the
equal share         at the  th level while player a ranks it at   th level 
as we have seen again from the example  the ordering of demands does not reflect
players gains from the demands but represents the players preference of retaining or abandoning his demands  this is another significant difference between our bargaining model
and the game theoretic models 
one may ask that whether a player could get advantages by cheating in the sense
that if an agent knows the demands and ranking of the other party  the agent can adjust
her demand hierarchy in order to obtain a better outcome  yes  it is possible  you can tell
your opposite what you want  your demands  but you should not release your ranking on
your demands  otherwise  you lose your bargaining power  the reason is that your attitude
towards risk has been encoded in your ranking on your demands 
    this indicates that player a ignores small differences of divisions  for instance  he may consider that
any share between      means the same to him  in the real negotiation  the player may request      
           in sequence by giving up    at each round in a bargaining 
    player b claims his share in the sequence                    by dropping his demand in the scale of
square 
    note that there is no communication between the players  therefore a player may give up more then it
is needed  similar to sealed bid auction

   computational complexity
in this section  we study the computational properties of the bargaining solution we developed earlier  we assume that readers are familiar with the complexity classes of p 
np  conp  p  and p    cop    the class of dp contains all languages l such that
p
l   l   l  where l  is in np and l  is in conp  also the class pk     p k contains
all languages recognizable in polynomial time by a deterministic turing machine with a
pk oracle  in particular  the class p   o logn   contains all languages recognizable by a
deterministic turing machine with o logn  calls to an np oracle   and p  contains all languages recognisable by a deterministic turing machine with a p  oracle  it is well known
that p  n p  dp  p   p   p    and these inclusions are generally believed to be
proper  readers may refer to the work of papadimitriou        for further details  
consider a bargaining game g     x          x         where x  and x  are finite  as we
have mentioned in section      we can always write xi   xi       xim   where xik  xil   
for any k    l  also for each k   m  if a formula   xik   then there does not exist a
  xil  k   l  such that  i   therefore  for the convenience of analysis  in the rest
of this section  we will specify a bargaining game as g    x    x     where x

x i and

x j   and x         x m   and x         x n are the partitions of x  and x  respectively

and satisfy the properties mentioned above 
the following four major decision problems are most important in order to understand
the computational properties for our bargaining game model developed in the previous
sections  let g    x    x    be a bargaining game  we would like to decide      whether a
given pair  d    d    where di  xi  i         is a deal of g      whether a given pair of
propositional formulas          is a core of g respectively      whether a given formula is
derivable from the core of g  and     whether a given strategy profile of g is a solution of
g  first  we have the following result for deciding a deal for a given bargaining game 
theorem   let g    x    x    be a bargaining game  and d   x  and d   x    deciding
whether  d    d    is a deal of g is dp complete 
proof  membership proof  according to definition    to decide whether  d    d    is a deal
of g  for d   or d     we need to check      for each k           m  or for k             n resp   
whether d  

k
s

 d   x j    or d  

j  

k

 d   x j   resp   is consistent      checking whether

j  

x   x   di  i          and     such d  and d  are maximal such subsets of x  and x 
sk
respectively  for      we observe that for each k  the set j  
 d   x j   can be computed in
polynomial time  and checking the consistency of d  

k
s

 d   x j   is in np  the same for

j  

d  case  it is obvious to see that     can be done in polynomial time  now we consider     
in order to check whether d  and d  are the maximal subsets of x  and x  respectively
satisfying the condition  we consider the complement the problem  assume that d   we
can also assume d    is not the maximal subset of x  satisfying the required conditions 
    note that in literatures  different notions have been used to denote this complexity class such as p n p  logn   
p  n p and p

then there exists some k and some    x    d    such that d  

k
s

  d        x k   is

j  

consistent  clearly  we can guess such k  formula  and an interpretation s  then check
whether s is a model of d  

k

  d        x k    obviously  this is in np  so the original

j  

problem is in conp 
hardness proof  it is known that for given propositional formulas   and     deciding whether   is satisfiable and   is unsatisfiable is dp complete  papadimitriou        
given two propositional formulas   and     we construct in polynomial time a transformation from the   s satisfiability and   s unsatisfiability to a deal decision problem of
a game  we simply define a game g    x    x              p    q    p    where
p  q are propositional atoms not occurring in   and     note that x   x      let
d    x  and d     q   now we show that  d    d    is a deal of g  that is  d  are the
maximal subset of x  such that x   d  is consistent  if and only if   is satisfiable and  
is unsatisfiable 
   clearly  if   is satisfiable and   is unsatisfiable  then x   d  is consistent  but
x   x  is not consistent  so  d    d    is a deal of g 
   suppose   and   are unsatisfiable  then x  itself is not consistent  if both   and
  are satisfiable  then it is observed that x   x  is consistent  so  d    d    is not a deal
of g  finally  suppose   is unsatisfiable and   is satisfiable  in this case  x   x  is still
consistent  that means   d    d    is not a deal of g either 

as we can see from the definition  the core of a bargaining plays an essential role in
the construction of the bargaining solution  the following theorem provides the complexity
result of its decision problem 
theorem   let g a bargaining game  deciding whether a given pair of sets of propositional
formulas          is the core of g is dp complete 
s

proof  membership proof  let g    x    x     where x    x i   and x    x j   we

k

x i       check whether

     is consistent  and     check if    x k       x k   is not consistent  clearly     
can be done in polynomial time  checking     is in np and checking     is in conp  so the
problem is in dp 
hardness proof  the hardness proof is similar to that as described in the proof of
theorem   with some variations  given two propositional formulas   and     we reduce
the decision problem of   s satisfiability and   s unsatisfiability to our problem  let
g    x    x     where x           p    q   and x     q    p   where p  q are
propositional atoms not occurring in   and     we specify a pair of sets of formulas 
                   p    q   
now we show that          is the core of g if and only if   is satisfiable and   is
unsatisfiable  suppose that   is satisfiable and   is unsatifiable  then         p  q  
which is consistent  on the other hand      q       p        p  q  p   which is
not consistent  so          is the core of g 
   

fian ordinal bargaining solution with fixed point property

we prove the other direction      both   and   are satisfiable  then       
          p   q   which is consistent  however  we can also see that    q    p 
has at leat one model which satisfies     q and p  this implies that          is no longer
the core of g      both   and   are unsatisfiable  in this case       is not consistent
any more  so          is not the core of g        is unsatisfiable and   is satisfiable 
again  under this situation       is no longer consistent  and hence it is not the core of
g  this completes our proof 

recall that the intuition behind the core is that the final agreement maximizes fairly
each agents demands without violating the overall consistency  then it is interesting to
know whether certain information is derivable from the agents demands that are in the
final agreement  let             is the core of bargaining game g  we define c g    
if and only if      or      
theorem   given a bargaining game g and a propositional formula   deciding whether
c g     is p   o logn   complete 
proof  membership proof  we outline an algorithm of deciding c g     as follows     
compute the core          of g  and     checking if      or       from the definition 
            is the core of g iff

x j   where k is the maximal

number that makes      consistent  clearly  such k can be determinated by binay search
with o logn  np oracle calls  then checking      or      can be done with two np
oracle calls  so the problem is in p   o logn   
hardness proof  we reduce the p   o logn   complete parity b
  kobler  schoning 
  wagner        wagner        to our problem  an instance of parity b
 is a set of
propositional formulas          n such that if i is not satisfiable  then for each j  i  j
is not satisfiable  the problem is to decide whether the number of satisfiable formulas is
odd  without loss of generality  we assume n is an even number  then we construct in
polynomial time a bargaining game g    x    x    as follows 
s

n  

x    x        p          p       n  n   p

x    x     q      q          qn     
where p  q         qn   are propositional atoms not occurring in          n   let    p  now we
show that c g    p if and only if there is an odd number of satisfiable formulas in          n  
first  suppose k is an odd number           k are satisfiable  and k          n are not satisfiable  then it is observed that   

 k

x j  x j       p        p       k   

k  p    q         q k      is consistent  and    k    k    p    q k        is not con k

sistent  so  

j  

x j  

 k   
s
j  

x j   is the core of g  also  since k   is not satisfiable  it follows

that k    k  p is reduced to k  p  which is contained in

 k   
s
j  

x j   so c g    p 

second  we assume that there is an even number of satisfiable formulas in          n   let k
   

fizhang   zhang

be the even number such that          k are satisfiable and k          n are not satisfiable 
in this case  it can be observed that   

k  
s

x j x j       p       p       k 

k   p    q         qk     is consistent  while    k    k    p    qk       is not

x j   is the core of g  then it is obvious that p cannot be derived

x j   that is  c g     p  this completes our proof 



finally  we consider the decision problem for the solution of a given bargaining game 
the following theorem gives its complexity upper bound 
theorem   let g be a bargaining game and  s    s    a strategy profile of g  deciding
whether  s    s    is the solution of g is in p

the core of g  note that for simplicity  here we use the notion of core to represent the
solution

we first consider the complement of deciding s

d    s    we first guess a pair of sets of propositional formulas           and

check if it is the core of g  according to theorem    we know that this is in p    clearly 
t
    holds iff there exists a formula  such that  a    s    and  b    
d   
 d   d    g 

further   b  holds iff there exists a deal  d    d    such that    d       d  and    d   
now we guess  and  d    d     and then check if   s     d    d    is a deal containing the
core  and    d    from thorem   we know that checking  d    d    is a deal can be done
with two np oracle calls  so task     can be solved in p   
t
on the other hand      holds iff there exists some  such that  
d 
 d   d    g 

and  
  s    to solve task      we consider its complement  for all   if    s    then
t
  
d    since there are only  x       x    formulas we need to check  checking
 d   d    g 

all  that are not in s  can be done in linear time  then for each    s    we need to
t
check if   
d    which  as shown above  can be done in p    therefore  for all

that are not in s    there are at most  x       x    checkings of whether

from the proof of theorem     it can be observed that the computation for a bargaining
game is very different from that of nebels prioritized belief revision

theorem    let g be a bargaining game and  s    s    a strategy profile of g  deciding
whether  s    s    is the solution of g is dp hard 
proof  we consider a special game g    x    x    where x    x    x     and x    x    i e 
x  has a singleton partition   and x    x   is consistent but x   x  is not consistent  in
this case  we know that  x     x     is the core of g  so our question is reduced to decide
whether s    x    and s  is the maximal subset of x  containing x   such that s   x  is
consistent  from the proof of theorem    it is easy to see that this is dp hard 

obviously  there is a gap between the lower bound and upper bound for the solution
decision problem  this also sheds a light that our bargaining solution cannot be represented
in terms of the traditional belief revision operators 
theorem    let g be a bargaining game and  s    s    a strategy profile of g  deciding
whether  s    s    is the solution of g is in p   o logn    given that the set of all deals  g 
is provided 
proof  to decide whether  s    s    is a solution of g  we need to do the following     
compute the core          of g      compute  g  from  g  and               compute

the investigation of ordinal bargaining theory diverges in two directions  the first direction
focuses on the existence of ordinal solution in the nash bargaining model  as we have
mentioned in the introduction section  shapley  kibris  safra and samet have shown that
there is a solution to the bargaining problems with three agents or more  which satisfies
ordinal invariance  symmetry and pareto optimality  shubik        ozgur kibris       
safra   samet         this result is interesting because it shows a difference between
bilateral bargaining and multilateral bargaining  however  it does not solve the problem
of ordinal bargaining because the solution is not constructive and  more importantly  no
alternative mean is offered to facilitate the representation of bargainers risk attitude  calvo
and perers investigated the bargaining problems with mixed players  cardinal players and
ordinal players  calvo   peters         a bargaining solution is called utility invariant
if it is ordinally invariant for the ordinal players and cardinally invariant for the cardinal
players  it is proved that there is a solution satisfying utility invariance  pareto optimality
and individual rationality provided at least one player is cardinal  obviously  this result is
only peripheral because a utility invariant solution is not necessarily ordinal invariant 
the other direction of the investigation tries to circumvent shapleys impossibility result
by altering the nash bargaining model  rubinstein et al  reinterpreted the nash bargaining
solution with respect to ordinal preferences  rubinstein et al          by restating nashs

axioms  it is proved that the redefined solution  referred to as ordinal nash solution  satisfies pareto optimality  symmetry and contraction independence  ordinal invariance holds
trivially   however  the result is based on the assumption that the preference ordering of
each player is complete  transitive and continuous on the set of finite lotteries over a topological space  it is unclear that how to use such a specific preference language to describe
players risk attitudes  more important  the advantages of ordinal preferences  such as ease
of elicitation and robustness of corresponded solutions  may be lost once the preference
ordering is extended to the space of lotteries  oneill et al  model a bargaining situation
with a family of nash bargaining games  parameterized by time  oneill et al          a
bargaining solution is then defined as a function that specifies an outcome at each time 
with the model  bargainers risk attitude can be expressed through varying preferences over
time  which is very intuitive  since a solution is no longer a single point but a function
over time  the construction of the proposed ordinal solution relies on the solution of sets of
simultaneous differential equations 
this work is developed based on a series of previous work of the authors  the fixed point
condition discussed in this paper was firstly proposed by zhang et al             zhang and
zhang      a      b  presented a logical solution to the bilateral bargaining problem based
on ordinal preferences  however  that solution does not satisfy the fixed point condition 
zhang        showed that a revision of the solution satisfies the fixed point condition  the
present paper further develops and systemizes the solution and discusses its logical and
game theoretic properties 

   conclusion
we have presented a bargaining solution to the bilateral bargaining problem based on
the logical representation of bargaining demands and ordinal representation of bargainers
preferences  we have shown that the solution satisfies most desirable logical properties 
such as individual rationality  logical version   consistency and collective rationality  and
the desirable game theoretic properties  such as weak pareto optimality  restricted symmetry
and contraction invariance  the ordinal invariance and game theoretic version of individual
rationality hold trivially  due to the discrete nature of logical representation  the solution
is not  strictly  pareto optimal and does not satisfy symmetry  however  if the demand sets
of two players are logically closed  the solution meets a restricted version of symmetry  in
addition  we have demonstrated that under the logical closedness assumption  the outcome
of a negotiation is the result of mutual belief revision in terms of nebels prioritized belief
base revision  this result established a link between bargaining theory and belief revision 
such a link would play an important role in the future on the research of multiagent belief
revision and logic based bargaining theory  our complexity analysis indicates that the
computation of bargaining solution is more difficult than prioritized belief base revision 
a satisfactory model of bargaining should be able to encode the key factors that determine the bargaining outcome  such as bargainers demands  preferences  attitudes towards
    jin et al         also introduced a fixed point condition for negotiation functions  which says that
under certain conditions  negotiating on the outcome of a negotiation generates the same outcome 
obviously our bargaining solution satisfies this fixed point condition because any outcome of bargaining
is consistent  which remains the same in any further negotiation

risk and so on  cardinal utility specifies two sorts of information  preference over possible agreements  via the ordering of utility values  and risk attitudes  via the non linearity
of utility function   however  the second sort of information  which determines players
bargaining power  may be lost after an ordinal transformation  meanwhile  a bargaining
model based purely on ordinal information about preferences does not automatically solve
the problem because bargainers risk attitude is even inexpressible in such a model  therefore an ordinal bargaining theory must supply a facility to describe the information other
than ordinal preferences  including risk attitudes  in this paper  we specify a bargaining
situation in logical structure  bargainers demands  goals and beliefs are described in logical
statements  the conflicts of demands between two players can then be identified through
consistency checking  more importantly  bargainers attitudes towards risk are expressible
in our model in a natural way  a risk averse player tends to give a conflicting demand a
relatively lower priority so that an agreement could be more likely reached while a risk lover
would firmly entrench her demands with less care about whether her demands contradict her
opponents 
a few issues are worth further investigation  firstly  we have shown that our solution
satisfies a set of logical properties and game theoretic properties  it is interesting to know
whether there is an axiomatic system that exactly characterizes the solution  the main
challenge here is that the construction of our solution is syntax dependent  if we simply
impose the logical closedness on the demand sets  we will lose a few desirable properties 
such as the inclusion of irrelevant items and computational results  if we do not apply the
assumption  we shall need the axioms to specify the way of logical representation  in other
words  the axioms have to specify how a demand set should be represented syntactically 
secondly  the present work offers a solution to the bilateral bargaining situations  it
does not supply a model to bargaining agents  therefore the current framework does not
deal with the issues like how a demand is formed   why a demand should be ranked
higher than another  or how to bargain effectively   it is interesting how a logic of
agency can be used or developed to model bargaining agents and how such a logic interacts
with the logic of bargaining 
finally  a few issues on the computational complexity of the proposed solution remain
unsolved  as we have shown in this paper the membership checking of the solution is dphard but in p    it is not clear yet how this upper bound and lower bound gap can be
closed  we think some new complexity proof technique may be needed for this challenge
