great deal written logical representation common sense reasoning

mill        thought possible  least principle  define assemblages
detailed enough ensure effects  every event combination
objects events  given concurrence circumstances  positive negative 
occurrence always followed phenomenon  p       
however  hume        pp         already argued possibility  always
possible regularity  matter long continued past  continue
future  consequently set sentences report observed ever
logically implies anything observed  goodman        p     
puts it  happened imposes logical restrictions happen  so 
deductionism plausible  necessary assume nature uniform 
future resemble past  past regularities continue  now  clearly  uniformity
cannot justified appealing experience  difficult see else
justified  see  goodmans discussion  pp          without justification  deductionism
regarded suspect theory 
deductionism suspect practice  impossible practice define preconditions which  together occurrence event  sufficient ensure
effects follow  example  russell        p     considers problem conflicting
events  put penny slot  draw ticket earthquake upsets machine calculations  order sure expected
effect  must know nothing environment interfere it 
means supposed cause not  itself  adequate insure effect  russell
observes cannot usefully solve problem complicating preconditions because 
soon include environment  probability repetition diminished  until 
last  whole environment included  probability repetition becomes almost
nil  pp       
problem specifying preconditions always sufficient arises mackies
account causal regularities  invariable regularities sequence   example  least
part answer  to question caused particular fire  set
conditions  of positive negative   including presence
inflammable material  absence suitably placed sprinkler  doubt quite
number others  mackie        p       list conditions incomplete because  even
causal regularities hold objects  seldom  ever  known full  causal
knowledge progresses gradually towards formulation regularities  hardly
ever gets there  causal regularities known typically incomplete       know
certain elliptical gappy universal propositions  mackie        p      
sufficient preconditions problem becomes acute consider formal representations intended practical use  preconditions
computationally tractable  mccarthy        p        gives example using boat
cross river  given boat rowing boat  equipped oars 
manned oarsman  used convey two passengers across river  provided
boat leak  provided hit rock  provided
hit another boat  provided overturned hippopotamus 
sunk meteorite  vapourized thermonuclear blast  etc  seems list
qualifications need added limited limits imagination 
accordingly  mccarthy calls sufficient preconditions problem qualification problem

response  deductionists might argue representations abstractions
approach works well simple domains  assumed qualifications arise  domains  might argue  uniformity assumption
reasonable  deductive theories provide useful representation  may well
true  but  theories kind cannot readily extended complex  less uniform 
domains additional complexity required preconditions quickly becomes
overwhelming  thus deductionist approach may appropriate certain applications 
mathematical analysis high level programming languages elementary commands viewed abstract operations data  inappropriate
representation predictive reasoning natural events  events everyday
experience  irregular treated deductively  moreover  deductionist abstraction better thought idealization  problematic one that 
preconditions deductive event hold occurrence  effects logically
guaranteed follow  natural force intervene prevent so 
deductive events thus natural  supernatural  idealization creates technical
difficulties comes representation events variable effects  including
non deterministic context dependent effects  effects always deduced  representation conflicting events  events whose effects individually
consistent jointly inconsistent  joint effects cannot consistently deduced 
consequently deductionist theories phenomena  some discussed
sequel  face unnecessary  self imposed  difficulties  difficult escape conclusion
that  representing natural events deductively  deductionism starts wrong foot 
conclusion hardly surprising consider predictive reasoning
natural events inductive  rather deductive  nature   major purpose
predictive reasoning support practical reasoning  is  reasoning do 
predictive reasoning normally based partial knowledge  or incomplete belief  
causal regularities  mackie observes  contexts events concerned
occur  tends conjectural seeks produce reasonable conclusions
basis known  result tends produce conclusions supradeductive  which may deducible known  defeasible  which may turn
wrong    accordingly  definitions  practical  non omniscient  rationality
typically couched terms utility expected  rather actual  outcomes
actions  russell norvig        p      illustrate point follows  walking
along champs elysees one day see old friend across street 
traffic nearby otherwise engaged  rational  start cross street 
meanwhile        feet  cargo door falls passing airliner  make
   philosophy  term inductive reasoning applied form qualitative non deductive reasoning  thus includes enumerative induction  general rule inferred non exhaustive
set inferences  for example  emeralds observed green  therefore
emeralds green   form reasoning underlies knowledge regularities

primary events occur independently  secondary events invoked  primary
secondary  events appropriate contexts  causally dependent them

natural actions arise due nature world  the laws
nature  etc    guaranteed succeed  use illustrated pintos
treatment lifschitzs        lamp circuit example  switches circuit
position  both down  lamp on  otherwise off  initially
switches opposite positions one flipped  clearly expect lamp
result  however attempts formalize example using domain axioms
inertia axiom fail  intended models switch retains position inertia
lamp comes result flip event  however unintended models
lamp remains inertia consequently switch mysteriously
changes position result  problem essentially posed example   
pintos treatment problem  agent flipping switch results natural action
current flowing circuit  turn results lamp on  natural
action current flowing resolves conflict alternative uses inertia
axiom bringing intermediary state switches  as flowing
current affect position  inertia axiom applied
intended way  as flowing current guaranteed effect lamp on  
proposal aims solve causal directedness problem introducing additional
events can  perhaps  seen lying somewhere thielschers logical approach
representational approach  unlike natural events  natural actions deductive 
difficult see natural actions could used represent qualifications 
example  natural action current flowing guaranteed succeed  turning
lamp on   reality current might flow wire loses conductivity  cut 
etc  clearly complication represented using natural events  context
switches opposite positions  flipping switch invokes secondary event
which  succeeds  results lamp on  lamps coming thus defeasible
secondary effect flipping switch  moreover  natural actions independent
actions agents  secondary events causally dependent  at least one of 
events invoke them 
event preferences  section    introduced previous research  bell        simultaneous events   presentation substantially improved  and  examples

   conclusion
began arguing deductionism logical mistake  made case inductionism  began basic theory inductive events  provides basis
integrated solution qualification frame problems  introduced
distinction primary secondary events order represent causal structure
natural events  thereby providing basis solution ramification problem
problem representing non determinism  finally  introduced event preferences  used express defeasible preferences outcomes conflicting
simultaneous events  development theory illustrates benefit starting
right foot  inductive  rather deductive  events  basic theory simple
intuitive  extensions require addition axioms
refinement one clause formal pragmatics 
simple cases may little choose deductive inductive theories events  produce predictions wrong  however inductive
representation natural events accurate reflects defeasibility 
representation inductive events makes possible define primary secondary events 
defeasible event preferences  turn make possible give accurate representations ramifications  non determinism  conflicting events  turn makes
possible represent complex cases accurately  instance  example    two
stooges attempt move location  one expected succeed  however three
do  none succeeds  always inductive events  example elaborated 
thus two stooges attempt move preferred one fails independent
reason  he slips  say   stooge normally succeeds  unless slips  
case three attempt move  ollie slips  stan expected succeed 
slips  charlie expected succeed  may slip  moreover 
example readily combined others  example  stooge could carry stack
blocks  block moves block beneath it  stooge holding it 
moves  know theory events represent reasoning subtlety
complexity 
future work  model building implementation event theories investigated 
general idea outlined previous research  bell         white et al        
describe implementation  an earlier version of  theory inductive events  essentially idea build finite initial parts representative preferred models given
