abstract
it is well known that utterances convey a great deal of information about the speaker
in addition to their semantic content  one such type of information consists of cues to the
speakers personality traits  the most fundamental dimension of variation between humans 
recent work explores the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic variation in
text and conversation  such as emotion  deception  speaker charisma  dominance  point
of view  subjectivity  opinion and sentiment  personality affects these other aspects of
linguistic production  and thus personality recognition may be useful for these tasks  in
addition to many other potential applications  however  to date  there is little work on the
automatic recognition of personality traits  this article reports experimental results for
recognition of all big five personality traits  in both conversation and text  utilising both
self and observer ratings of personality  while other work reports classification results  we
experiment with classification  regression and ranking models  for each model  we analyse
the effect of different feature sets on accuracy  results show that for some traits  any type
of statistical model performs significantly better than the baseline  but ranking models
perform best overall  we also present an experiment suggesting that ranking models are
more accurate than multi class classifiers for modelling personality  in addition  recognition
models trained on observed personality perform better than models trained using selfreports  and the optimal feature set depends on the personality trait  a qualitative analysis
of the learned models confirms previous findings linking language and personality  while
revealing many new linguistic markers

speakers personality traits  the most fundamental dimension of variation between humans 
personality is typically assessed along five dimensions known as the big five 
 extraversion vs  introversion  sociable  assertive  playful vs  aloof  reserved  shy 
 emotional stability vs  neuroticism  calm  unemotional vs  insecure  anxious 
 agreeableness vs  disagreeable  friendly  cooperative vs  antagonistic  faultfinding 
 conscientiousness vs  unconscientious  self disciplined  organised vs  inefficient  careless 
 openness to experience  intellectual  insightful vs  shallow  unimaginative 
these five personality traits have been repeatedly obtained by applying factor analyses
to various lists of trait adjectives used in personality description questionnaires  sample
adjectives above   norman        peabody   goldberg        goldberg         the basis
for such factor analyses is the lexical hypothesis  allport   odbert         i e  that the
most relevant individual differences are encoded into the language  and the more important
the difference  the more likely it is to be expressed as a single word  despite some known
limits  eysenck        paunonen   jackson         over the last    years the big five model
has become a standard in psychology and experiments using the big five have shown that
personality traits influence many aspects of task related individual behaviour  for example 
the success of most interpersonal tasks depends on the personalities of the participants  and
personality traits influence leadership ability  hogan  curphy    hogan         general job

recent work in ai explores methods for the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic variation in text and conversation  such as emotion  oudeyer        liscombe  venditti    hirschberg         deception  newman  pennebaker  berry    richards

speaker charisma  rosenberg   hirschberg         mood  mishne         dominance in

in contrast with these pragmatic phenomena  which may be relatively contextualised or
short lived  personality is usually considered to be a longer term  more stable  aspect of
individuals  scherer         however  there is evidence that personality interacts with  and
affects  these other aspects of linguistic production  for example  there are strong relations
between the extraversion and conscientiousness traits and the positive affects  and between

neuroticism and disagreeableness and various negative affects  watson   clark         lying leads to inconsistencies in impressions of the agreeableness personality trait across modes
 visual vs  acoustic   and these inconsistencies are used as cues for deception detection by
human judges  heinrich   borkenau         outgoing and energetic people  i e  extravert 
are more successful at deception  while apprehensive  i e  neurotic  individuals are not as
successful  riggio  salinas    tucker         and individuals who score highly on the agreeableness and openness to experience traits are also better at detecting deception  enos
et al          features used to automatically recognise introversion and extraversion in our
studies are also important for automatically identifying deception  newman et al         
speaker charisma has been shown to correlate strongly with extraversion  bono   judge 
       and individuals who dominate meetings have similar characteristics to extraverts 
such as verbosity  rienks   heylen         oberlander and nowson        suggest that
opinion mining could benefit from personality information  thus this evidence suggests
that incorporating personality models into these other tasks may improve accuracy 
we also hypothesise that computational recognition of user personality could be useful in many other computational applications  identification of leaders using personality
dimensions could be useful in analysing meetings and the conversations of suspected terrorists  hogan et al         tucker   whittaker        nunn         dating websites could

identifying the authors personality in a corpus could also improve language generation 
as individual differences in language affect the way that concepts are expressed  reiter  
sripada         studies have also shown that users evaluation of conversational agents
depends on their own personality  reeves   nass        cassell   bickmore         which
suggests a requirement for such systems to adapt to the users personality  like humans do
 funder   sneed        mclarney vesotski  bernieri    rempala        
while in some applications it would be possible to acquire personality information by
asking the user or author directly  john  donahue    kentle        costa   mccrae 
       here we explore whether it is possible to acquire personality models for the big five
personality traits by observation of individual linguistic outputs in text and conversation 
to date  we know of only two studies besides our own on automatic recognition of user
personality  argamon et al         mairesse   walker      a      b  oberlander   nowson 
       other work has applied classification models to the recognition of personality in
texts and blog postings  to our knowledge  the results presented here are the first to
examine the recognition of personality in dialogue  mairesse   walker      a      b   and
to apply regression and ranking models that allow us to model personality recognition
using the continuous scales traditional in psychology  we also systematically examine the
use of different feature sets  suggested by psycholinguistic research  and report statistically
significant results 
we start in section   by reviewing the psychology findings linking personality and
language  these findings motivate the features used in the learning experiments described
in section    section   overviews the methods we use to automatically train personality
models  using both conversation and written language samples  and both self ratings and
observer ratings of personality traits  we explore the use of classification models  section

regression models  section     and ranking models  section     and the effect of different
feature sets on model accuracy  the results show that for some traits  any type of statistical
model performs significantly better than the baseline  but ranking models perform best
overall  in addition  models trained on observed personality scores perform better than
models trained using self reports  and the optimal feature set is dependent on the personality
trait  the rules derived and features used in the learned models confirm previous findings
linking language and personality  while revealing many new linguistic markers  we delay
the review of argamon et al         and oberlander and nowson        to section    when
we can better compare their results with our own  and sum up and discuss future work in
section   

   personality markers in language
why do we believe it might be possible to automatically recognise personality from linguistic
cues  psychologists have documented the existence of such cues by discovering correlations
between a range of linguistic variables and personality traits  across a wide range of linguistic
levels  including acoustic parameters  smith  brown  strong    rencher        scherer 
       lexical categories  pennebaker   king        pennebaker  mehl    niederhoffer 
      mehl  gosling    pennebaker        fast   funder         n grams  oberlander  
gill         and speech act type  vogel   vogel         as the correlations reported in
the literature are generally weak  see section       it is not clear whether these features
will improve accuracies of statistical models on unseen subjects  of all big five traits 
extraversion has received the most attention from researchers  however  studies focusing
systematically on all big five traits are becoming more common 
    markers of extraversion
we summarise various findings linking extraversion and language cues in table    for
different levels of language production such as speech  syntax and content selection  a review by furnham        describes linguistic features linked to extraversion and other traits 
and dewaele and furnham        review studies focusing on the link between extraversion
and both language learning and speech production 
findings include that there is a higher correlation between extraversion and oral language  especially when the study involves a complex task  extraverts talk more  louder
and more repetitively  with fewer pauses and hesitations  they have higher speech rates 
shorter silences  a higher verbal output  a lower type token ratio and a less formal language  while introverts use a broader vocabulary  scherer        furnham        gill  
oberlander         extraverts also use more positive emotion words  and show more agreements and compliments than introverts  pennebaker   king         extravert students
learning french as a second language produce more back channels  and have a more implicit style and a lower lexical richness in formal situations  it seems that the more complex
the task and the higher the level of anxiety  the easier it is to differentiate between introverts
and extraverts  dewaele   furnham        
heylighen and dewaele        also note that extraversion is significantly correlated
with contextuality  as opposed to formality  contextuality can be seen a high reliance
on shared knowledge between conversational partners  leading to the use of many deictic

table    summary of identified language cues for extraversion and various production levels  based on previous studies by scherer         furnham         pennebaker
and king         dewaele and furnham         gill         mehl et al         
asterisks indicate that the cue is only based on a hypothesis  as opposed to study
results 

expressions such as pronouns  verbs  adverbs and interjections  whereas formal language is
less ambiguous and assumes less common knowledge  in order to measure this variation 
heylighen and dewaele suggest the use of a metric called formality  defined as 
f    noun freq   adjective freq   preposition freq   article freq   pronoun freq   verb
freq   adverb freq   interjection freq         
they argue that this measure is the most important dimension of variation between
linguistic expressions  as shown in bibers factor analysis of various genres  biber        
in addition to introversion  the authors also find that formality correlates positively with
the level of education and the femininity of the speaker  situational variables related to
the use of formal language are the audience size  the time span between dialogues  the
unavailability of feedback  difference of backgrounds and spatial location between speakers 
as well as the preceding amount of conversation 
   

fimairesse  walker  mehl   moore

scherer        shows that extraverts are perceived as talking louder and with a more
nasal voice  and that american extraverts tend to make fewer pauses  while german extraverts produce more pauses than introverts  thus personality markers are culture dependent 
even among western societies 
oberlander and gill        use content analysis tools and n gram language models to
identify markers in extravert and introvert emails  they replicate previous findings and
identify new personality markers such as first person singular pronouns  e g   i dont  and
formal greetings  e g   hello  for introversion  while less formal phrases such as take care
and hi characterise extraverts 

    markers of other big five traits
pennebaker and king        identify many linguistic features associated with each of the
big five personality traits  they use their linguistic inquiry and word count  liwc 
tool to count word categories of essays written by students whose personality has been
assessed using a questionnaire  the authors find small but significant correlations between
their linguistic dimensions and personality traits  neurotics use more  st person singular
pronouns  more negative emotion words and less positive emotion words  on the other hand 
agreeable people express more positive and fewer negative emotions  they also use fewer
articles  conscientious people avoid negations  negative emotion words and words reflecting
discrepancies  e g   should and would   finally  openness to experience is characterised by a
preference for longer words and words expressing tentativity  e g   perhaps and maybe   as
well as the avoidance of  st person singular pronouns and present tense forms 
additionally  mehl et al         study markers of personality as perceived by observers 
they find that the use of words related to insight and the avoidance of past tense indicates
openness to experience  and swearing marks disagreeableness  the same authors also show
that some linguistic cues vary greatly across gender  for example  males perceived as
conscientious produce more filler words  while females dont  gender differences are also
found in markers of self assessed personality  the use of  nd person pronouns indicates a
conscientious male  but an unconscientious female 
gill and oberlander        study correlates of emotional stability  they find that neurotics use more concrete and frequent words  however  they also show that observers dont
use those cues correctly  as observer reports of neuroticism correlate negatively with selfreports 
concerning prosody  smith et al         also show that speech rate is positively correlated with perceived competence  conscientiousness   and that speech rate has an inverted u
relationship with benevolence  agreeableness   suggesting a need for non linear models 
some traits have produced more findings than others  a reason for this might be that
some are more reflected through language  like extraversion  however  it is possible that
this focus is a consequence of extraversion being correlated with linguistic cues that can be
analysed more easily  e g   verbosity

   experimental method
we conduct a set of experiments to examine whether automatically trained models can be
used to recognise the personality of unseen subjects  our approach can be summarised in
five steps 
   collect individual corpora 
   collect associated personality ratings for each participant 
   extract relevant features from the texts 
   build statistical models of the personality ratings based on the features 
   test the learned models on the linguistic outputs of unseen individuals 
the following sections describe each of these steps in more detail 
    sources of language and personality
introvert
ive been waking up on time so far  what
has it been    days  dear me  ill never
keep it up  being such not a morning
person and all  but maybe ill adjust 
or not  i want internet access in my
room  i dont have it yet  but i will
on wed    i think  but that aint soon
enough  cause i got calculus homework      

extravert
i have some really random thoughts  i
want the best things out of life 
but i fear that i want too much 
what if i fall flat on my face and
dont amount to anything  but i
feel like i was born to do big things
on this earth  but who knows    there
is this persian party today 

neurotic
one of my friends just barged in  and i
jumped in my seat  this is crazy  i
should tell him not to do that again 
im not that fastidious actually  but
certain things annoy me  the things
that would annoy me would actually
annoy any normal human being  so i
know im not a freak 

emotionally stable
i should excel in this sport because i
know how to push my body harder than
anyone i know  no matter what the test i
always push my body harder than everyone
else  i want to be the best no matter
what the sport or event  i should also
be good at this because i love to ride
my bike

extravert  neurotic  and emotionally stable 

we use the data from pennebaker and king        and mehl et al         in our experiments  the first corpus contains       essays from psychology students      million

was collected and analysed by pennebaker and king         a sample is shown in table

what youre saying 
  on tuesday i have class  i dont know 
  i dont know  a    yeah  that is kind of cool 
  i dont know  i just cant wait to be with
you and not have to do this every night 
you know

  thats my first yogurt experience here 
really watery  why 
  damn  new game 
  oh 
  thats so rude  that 
  yeah  but he  they like each other 
he likes her 
  they are going to end up breaking up
and hes going to be like 

unconscientious
  with the chinese  get it together 
  i tried to yell at you through the window 
oh  xxxxs fucking a dumb ass  look at
him  look at him  dude  look at him  i
wish we had a camera  hes fucking brushing
his t shirt with a tooth brush  get a kick
of it  dont steal nothing 

conscientious
  i dont  i dont know for a fact but
i would imagine that historically women
who have entered prostitution have done
so  not everyone  but for the majority out
of extreme desperation and i think  i dont
know  i think people understand that
desperation and they dont dont see      

table    extracts from the ear corpus  for participants rated as extremely introvert  extravert  unconscientious  and conscientious  only the participants utterances are
shown 

personality was assessed by asking each student to fill in the big five inventory questionnaire  john et al          which asks participants to evaluate on a   point scale how well
their personality matches a series of descriptions 
the second source of data consists of conversation extracts recorded using an electronically activated recorder  ear   mehl  pennebaker  crow  dabbs    price         collected
by mehl et al          to preserve the participants privacy  only random snippets of conversation were recorded  this corpus is much smaller than the essays corpus     participants
for a total of        words and        utterances   while the essays corpus consists only of
texts  the ear corpus contains both sound extracts and transcripts  this corpus therefore
allows us to build models of personality recognition from speech  only the participants utterances were transcribed  not those of their conversational partners   making it impossible
to reconstruct whole conversations  nevertheless  the conversation extracts are less formal
than the essays  and personality may be best observed in the absence of behavioural constraints  table   shows that while the essays corpus is much larger than the ear corpus 
the amount of data per subject is comparable  i e      words per subject for the essays and
      for the ear corpus  table   shows examples of conversations from the ear corpus
for different personality traits 
for personality ratings  the ear corpus contains both self reports and ratings from   
independent observers  psychologists use self reports to facilitate evaluating the personality of a large number of participants  and there are a large number of standard self report
tests  observers were asked to make their judgments by rating descriptions of the big five
inventory  john   srivastava        on a   point scale  from strongly disagree to strongly

agree   without knowing the participants  observers were divided into three groups  each
rating one third of the participants  after listening to each participants entire set of sound
files      files on average   the personality assessment was based on the audio recordings 
which contain more information than the transcripts  e g   ambient sounds  including captured conversations   mehl et al         report strong inter observer reliabilities across all
big five dimensions  intraclass correlations based on one way random effect models  mean
r         p         the observers ratings were averaged for each participant  to produce
the final scores used in our experiments 
interestingly  the average correlations between frequency counts from psycholinguistic
word categories and the big five personality dimensions were considerably larger in the
ear corpus than with the student essays studied by pennebaker and king  moreover 
the correlations reported by mehl et al  seem to be higher for observer reports than for
self reports  based on this observation  we hypothesise that models of observed personality
will outperform models of self assessed personality 
    features
the features used in the experiments are motivated by previous psychological findings
about correlations between measurable linguistic factors and personality traits  features
are divided into subsets depending on their source and described in the subsections below 
the total feature set is summarised in table    the experimental results given in sections   
   and   examine the effect of each feature subset on model accuracy 
      content and syntax
we extracted a set of linguistic features from each essay and conversation transcript 
starting with frequency counts of    word categories from the linguistic inquiry and word
count  liwc  utility  pennebaker et al          these features include both syntactic  e g  
ratio of pronouns  and semantic information  e g   positive emotion words   which were
validated by expert judges  some liwc features are illustrated in table    pennebaker
and king        previously found significant correlations between these features and each
of the big five personality traits  relevant word categories for extraversion include social
words  emotion words  first person pronouns  and present tense verbs  mehl et al        
showed that liwc features extracted from the ear corpus were significantly correlated
with both self and observer reports of personality 
we also added    additional features from the mrc psycholinguistic database  coltheart         which contains statistics for over         words  such as estimates of the age

utterances  heylighen and dewaele        suggest that their vocabulary is richer and more
precise  implying a lower frequency of use  the mrc feature set was previously used by
gill and oberlander         who showed that extraversion is negatively correlated with
concreteness  concreteness also indicates neuroticism  as well as the use of more frequent
words  gill   oberlander         table   shows examples of mrc scales  each mrc

      utterance type
various facets of personality traits seem to depend on the level of initiative of the speaker
and the type of utterance used  e g   assertiveness  argumentativeness  inquisitiveness  etc   
for example  extraverts are more assertive in their emails  gill   oberlander         while
extravert second language learners were shown to produce more back channel behaviour
 vogel   vogel         we therefore introduced features characterising the types of utterance produced  we automatically tagged each utterance of the ear corpus with speech
act categories from walker and whittaker         using heuristic rules based on each utterances parse tree 
 command  utterance using the imperative form  a command verb  e g   must and have to  or

      prosody
personality was also shown to influence speech production  extraversion is associated with
more variation of the fundamental frequency  scherer         with a higher voice quality
and intensity  mallory   miller         and with fewer and shorter silent pauses  siegman
  pope         smith et al         showed that speech rate is positively correlated with
perceived competence  conscientiousness   interestingly  the same authors found that speech
rate has an inverted u relationship with benevolence  agreeableness   suggesting a need for
non linear models  see section     
we added prosodic features based on the audio data of the ear conversation extracts 
as the ear recorded the participants at anytime of the day  it was necessary to automatically remove any non voiced signal  we used praat  boersma        to compute features
characterising the voices pitch and intensity  mean  extremas and standard deviation   and
we added an estimate of the speech rate by dividing the number of words by the voiced time 
as an important aspect of this work is that all features are extracted without any manual
annotation beyond transcription  we didnt filter out utterances from other speakers that
may have been captured by the ear even though it utilised a microphone pointing towards
the participants head  although advances in speaker recognition techniques might improve
the accuracy of prosodic features  we make the assumption that the noise introduced by the
surrounding speakers has little effect on our prosodic features  and that it therefore does not
affect the performance of the statistical models  this assumption still remains to be tested 
as the personality similarity attraction effect  byrne   nelson        might influence the
personality distribution of a participants conversational partners 
we included all the features mentioned in this section       in the models based on
the ear corpus  models computed using the essays corpus contain only liwc and mrc
features        as speech acts are only meaningful in dialogues 
    correlational analysis
in order to assess what individual features are important for modelling personality regardless
of the model used  we report previous correlational studies for the liwc features on the
same data as well as analyses of the new mrc  utterance type and prosodic features  the
liwc features were already analysed by mehl et al         for the ear dataset  and by
   

firecognising personality in conversation and text

pennebaker and king        for the essays   tables   to    show the features correlating
significantly with personality ratings  p        correlations above     only   combining
together results from previous studies and new findings that provide insight into the features
likely to influence the personality recognition models in sections          and     
the correlation magnitudes in tables   and   between liwc and mrc features and
the essays data set show that although extraversion is very well perceived in conversations 
it isnt strongly reflected through written language  as the correlation magnitudes for the
essays dataset are noticeably low  table    shows that word count  wc  is a very important feature for modelling extraversion in conversation  both for observer reports and
self reports  interestingly  this marker doesnt hold for written language  see table    
other markers common to observed and self reported extraversion include the variation
of intensity  int stddev   the mean intensity  int mean   word repetitions  unique   words
with a high concreteness  conc  and imageability  imag   see table     on the other
hand  words related to anger  affect  swearing  and positive and negative emotions  posemo
and negemo  are perceived as extravert  but they dont mark self assessed extraversion in
conversations 
tables    and    show that for emotional stability  only a few markers hold for both
self reports and observer reports  a high word count and a low mean pitch  pitch mean  
surprisingly  observed emotional stability is associated with swearing and anger words  but
not the self assessed ratings  as reported by mehl et al          neurotics are expected to
produce more self references  self and i   pennebaker and king        show that neurotics
use of self references is also observed in the essays  as well as the use of words related to
negative emotions and anxiety  table    shows that in conversations  self assessed neurotics
tend to have a low and constant voice intensity  int mean and int stddev   while these
markers arent used by observers at all 
while emotional stability is expressed differently in various datasets  some markers of
agreeableness are consistent  words related to swearing  swear  and anger  anger  indicate both self assessed and observed disagreeableness  regardless of the source of language 
see tables      and     interestingly  table    shows that agreeable people do more
back channelling  prompt   suggesting that they tend to listen more to their conversational
partners  while observers dont seem to take prosody into account for evaluating agreeableness  table    shows that prosodic cues such as the pitch variation  pitch stddev  and
the maximum voice intensity  max int  indicate self assessed disagreeableness 
as far as markers of conscientiousness are concerned  tables   to    show that they
are similar to those of agreeableness  as unconscientious participants also use words related
to swearing  swear   anger  anger  and negative emotions  negemo   regardless of the
dataset and assessment method  on the other hand  observed conscientiousness is associated
with words expressing insight  back channels  prompt   longer words  nphon  nlet  nsyl
and sixltr  as well as words that are acquired late by children  aoa   while self assessed
conscientiousness is mostly expressed through positive feelings  posfeel  in conversations 
the avoidance of negative language seems to be the main marker of conscientiousness in
essays  as all other features in table   correlate only weakly with the self reports 
   our correlations differ from pennebaker and kings study because we use additional student essays
collected during the following years

    statistical models
various systems require different levels of granularity for modelling personality  it might
be more important to cluster users into large groups as correctly as possible  or the system
might need to discriminate between individual users  depending on the application and the
adaptation capabilities of the target system  it is possible to use different types of personality
models  depending on whether personality modelling is treated as a classification problem  as

table     continuation of table     i e  pearsons correlation coefficients between features
and personality ratings for the ear dataset      significant at the p       level 
     p         only features that correlate significantly with at least one trait
are shown 
in previous work by argamon et al         and oberlander and nowson         or whether
we model personality traits via the scalar values actually generated by the self reports and
observer methods used in the corpus collection described in section     
to support applications in dialogue system adaptation  where the output generation is
limited to a few points at extremes of a personality scale  such as introvert vs  extravert
language or neurotic vs  emotionally stable  we develop classification models by splitting
our subjects into two equal size groups 
however  if we model personality traits as scalar values  we have two choices  we
can treat personality modelling as a regression problem or as a ranking problem  while
regression models can replicate the actual scalar values seen in the personality ratings
data  there is also a good argument for treating personality as a ranking problem because
by definition  personality evaluation assesses relative differences between individuals  e g 
one person is described as an extravert because the average population is not  moreover 
freund  iyer  schapire  and singer        argue that ranking models are a better fit to
learning problems in which scales have arbitrary values  rather than reflecting real world
measures

for classification and regression models  we use the weka toolbox  witten   frank 
      for training and evaluation  in order to evaluate models of personality classification 
we compare six different learning algorithms against a baseline returning the majority class 
the classification algorithms analysed here are c    decision tree learning  j     nearest
neighbour  k       naive bayes  nb   ripper  jrip   adaboost     rounds of boosting 
and support vector machines with linear kernels  smo  
for regression  we compare five algorithms with a baseline model returning the mean
personality score  we focus on a linear regression model  an m  regression tree  an m 
model tree returning a linear model  a reptree decision tree  and a model based on support
vector machines with linear kernels  smoreg   parameters of the algorithms are set to
wekas default values 
concerning the ranking problem  we train personality models for each big five trait
using rankboost  a boosting algorithm for ranking  freund et al         schapire        
given a personality trait to model  the linguistic features and personality scores are converted into a training set t of ordered pairs of examples x  y 
t     x  y   x  y are language samples from two individuals 
x has a higher score than y for that personality trait 
each example x is represented by a set of m indicator functions hs  x  for    s  m 
the indicator functions are calculated by thresholding the feature values  counts  described
in section      for example  one indicator function is 
 

h     x   

  if word per sec x       
  otherwise

so h     x      if xs average speech rate is above      words per second  a single parameter s is associated with each indicator function  and the ranking score for an example
x is calculated as
x
f  x   
s hs  x 
s

this score is used to rank various language samples  written text or conversation extracts  
with the goal of duplicating the ranking found in the training data  and the training examples are used to set the parameter values s   training is the process of setting the
parameters s to minimise the following loss function 
loss  

  x
eval f  x   f  y  
 t    x y t

the eval function returns   if the ranking scores of the  x  y  pair are misordered  and  
otherwise  in other words  the ranking loss is the percentage of misordered pairs  for which
the order of the predicted scores doesnt match the order dictated by the personality scores
from the questionnaire 
most of the techniques used in this work express the learned models as rules or decision
trees  which support the analysis of differences in the personality models  see sections     
    and

   classification results
we evaluate binary classification models based on the essays corpus with self reports of
personality  as well as models based on the ear corpus with both self and observer reports 
all results are averaged over a    fold cross validation  and all significance tests were done
using a two tailed paired t test at the p       level 
    essays corpus
classification results for the essays corpus with self reports are in table     interestingly 
openness to experience is the easiest trait to model as five classifiers out of six significantly
outperform the baseline and four of them produce their best performance for that trait 
with accuracies up to       using support vector machines  smo   emotional stability
produces the second best performance for four classifiers out of six  with       accuracy
for the smo model  conscientiousness is the hardest trait to model as only two classifiers
significantly outperform the baseline  however the smo model performs as well as the best
model for extraversion and agreeableness  with around     correct classifications 
we find that support vector machines generally perform the best  with naive bayes and
adaboostm  in second position  smo significantly outperforms the majority class baseline
for each trait  a j   decision tree for recognising extraversion is shown in figure    and the
rule based jrip model classifying openness to experience with       accuracy is illustrated

figure    j   decision tree for binary classification of extraversion  based on the essays
corpus and self reports 

remarkably  we can see that the liwc features outperform the mrc features for every
trait  and the liwc features on their own always perform slightly better than the full
feature set  this clearly suggests that mrc features arent as helpful as the liwc features
for classifying personality from written text  however table    shows that they can still
outperform the baseline for four traits out of five 
concerning the algorithms  we find that adaboostm  performs the best for extraversion
       correct classifications   while smo produces the best models for all other traits  it
suggests that support vector machines are promising for modelling personality in general 
the easiest trait to model is still openness to experience  with       accuracy using liwc
features only 
    ear corpus
classification accuracies for the ear corpus are in table     we find that extraversion is
the easiest trait to model using observer reports  with both naive bayes and adaboostm

outperforming the baseline with an accuracy of        the j   decision tree for extraversion with a       accuracy is shown in figure    emotional stability is modelled with
comparable success using a naive bayes classifier  however the improvement over the baseline is lower than with extraversion        vs         and other classifiers dont perform as
well  models of observed conscientiousness also outperform the baseline  with       accuracy using a naive bayes classifier  while the best model for agreeableness produces      
correct classifications  none of the models for openness to experience significantly outperform the baseline  which suggests that openness to experience is expressed more clearly in
stream of consciousness essays and self reports than in the ear dataset  support vector
machines dont perform as well as with the essays corpus  probably because of the sparseness of the dataset  self reports are much harder to model than observer reports given the
same dataset size  as none of the self report classifiers significantly outperform the majority
class baseline 
feature set comparison  for the ear corpus we investigated the importance of all  
feature sets  utterance type  liwc  mrc  and prosodic features  we use the naive bayes
models with the observer ratings as they perform the best with all features  interestingly 
table    shows that the good classification accuracies for extraversion come from a combination of liwc  mrc and prosodic features  as they all outperform the baseline on their own 
but dont do as well as the       accuracy with the full feature set  moreover  extraversion
is the only trait for which prosody seems to make a difference  liwc features are the main
indicators of emotional stability  although the model with all features still performs better  mrc features are the most important for classifying conscientiousness          while
prosodic features produce the best model of openness to experience with       accuracy 
improving on the model with all features  although utterance type features never outperform the baseline on their own  the lack of significance could be the result of the small
   although equal size bins were used  the baseline accuracies differ from     because of the random
sampling of the cross validation

table     jrip rule set for binary classification of openness to experience  based on the
essays corpus 

the model of self assessed openness to experience detailed in table    shows that students referring a lot to school work tend to have low scores for that trait  rules     
and     as expected  the avoidance of longer words is also indicative of a lack of cre   

fimairesse  walker  mehl   moore

ativity conventionality  rules   and     as well as the use of high familiarity words and
references to friends  rule    
the model of observed extraversion in figure   shows that word count is the most important feature for classifying that trait as an observer  the model also suggests that given
low verbosity  extraversion can still manifest itself through the use of words related to metaphysical issues together with few articles  as well as through the use of many commas  the
association between extraversion and the avoidance of articles probably reflects the use of
more pronouns over common nouns and confirms previous findings associating extraversion
with implicit language  heylighen   dewaele        
interestingly  the decision tree trained on the essays corpus in figure   for self reported
extraversion differs a lot from the observer model in figure    while word count is the most
important feature for observers  it doesnt seem to be a marker of self assessed extraversion
 see section       although the number of words per sentence is used to discriminate on a
subset of the data  on the other hand  the self report model associates introversion with
the use of articles  which was also the case in the observer model  while sexual content
doesnt affect the observer model  it is the second most important feature for modelling selfreported extraversion  for example  participants using many sex related words are modelled
as introvert  unless they avoid parentheses and words related to sadness 

   regression results
we also trained regression models using the same corpora  the baseline is a model returning
the mean of all personality scores in the training set  we use the relative absolute error for
evaluation  which is the ratio between the models prediction error and the error produced
by the baseline  a low relative error therefore indicates that the model performs better than
the constant mean baseline  while a      relative error implies a performance equivalent
to that baseline  all results are averaged over a    fold cross validation  and all significance
tests were done using a two tailed paired t test at the p       level 
    essays corpus
regression results with the essays corpus and self reports are in table     paired t tests
show that emotional stability and openness to experience produce models that significantly
improve over the baseline  as with the classification task  openness to experience is the
easiest trait to model using essays  four regression models out of five outperform the baseline  the m  model tree produces the best result with a       relative error for openness
to experience       error decrease   and a       relative error for emotional stability 
in terms of correlation between the model predictions and the actual ratings  the model
for emotional stability and openness to experience produce pearsons correlation coefficients
of      and       respectively  although the magnitude of the improvement seems relatively
small  one needs to keep in mind the difficulty of the regression task over the binary classification task  it is the most fine grained personality recognition problem  requiring the
association of an exact scalar value with each individual

fimairesse  walker  mehl   moore

in terms of correlation between the model predictions and the actual ratings  the models
for extraversion  emotional stability and conscientiousness respectively produce pearsons
correlation coefficients of            and       significantly outperforming the baseline  such
correlations are relatively high  given that the average correlations between the ratings of
each pair of observers is      for extraversion       for emotional stability and      for
conscientiousness     observers  between    and    data points for each pair  
linear regression and support vector machines perform poorly  suggesting that they
require a bigger dataset as in the essays corpus  as in the classification task  self reports
of the ear corpus are clearly difficult to model  none of the models show significant
improvement over the baseline

    qualitative analysis
regression trees for extraversion and conscientiousness are in figures   and    as suggested
by the correlations in section      the model in figure   shows that the voices pitch and
variation of intensity play an important role when modelling extraversion  a high verbal
output is perceived as a sign of extraversion  see word count nodes   confirming previous
findings  scherer         on the other hand  a low mean pitch combined with a constant
voice intensity characterises high introverts 
figure   suggests that conscientious people use fewer swear words and content related
to sexuality  while preferring longer words  the same figure also shows that conscientious
people use fewer pronouns  i e  a more explicit style  as well as more words related to
communication  e g   talk and share  

   ranking results
results with both corpora and different feature sets are in tables    and     the models
are trained over     rounds of boosting  the baseline model ranks extracts randomly 
producing a ranking loss of     on average  lower is better   results are averaged over a
   fold cross validation  and all significance tests were done using a two tailed paired t test
at the p       level 
    essays corpus
table    shows that openness to experience produces the best ranking model with the
essays corpus  producing a ranking loss of       lower is better   remarkably  this trait
was the easiest to model for all three recognition tasks with that corpus  as it is not the
case with conversational data  it seems that streams of consciousness  or more generally
personal writings  are likely to exhibit cues relative to the authors openness to experience 
emotional stability produces the second best model with a ranking loss of       followed by
conscientiousness and extraversion  while the model for agreeableness produces the highest

feature set comparison  when looking at individual feature sets  table    shows that
liwc features perform significantly better than the baseline for all dimensions but emotional stability  while emotional stability is best predicted by mrc features only      
ranking loss   interestingly  prosodic features are very good predictors of extraversion  with
a lower ranking error than the full feature set         this model produces the best overall
result  with a     chance that the model will detect the most extravert among any two
unseen conversation extracts  as in the previous recognition tasks  utterance type features

trait by the magnitude of the parameter  associated with that feature  tables    to
   show the rules with the most impact on each of the best models  with the associated

the rule sets presented here contain only the most extreme rules of our ranking models 
which contain many additional personality cues that arent identified through a typical
correlational analysis  for example  a high speech rate and a high mean pitch tend to
contribute to a high extraversion ranking in table   s model  but they dont correlate
significantly with observer ratings  as detailed in table     similarly  positive emotion
words  posemo  and the avoidance of long utterances  wps  indicate agreeableness in the
model in table     while these features dont correlate significantly with agreeableness
ratings 

   related work
to our knowledge  there are only two other studies on the automatic recognition of personality  both of these studies have focused on the classification of written texts based on
self reports  rather than using continuous modelling techniques as we do here 
argamon et al         use the essays corpus of pennebaker and king         so their
results are directly comparable to ours  as in our work  they use a top down approach to
feature definition  their feature set consists of relative frequencies of     function words and
word categories based on networks of the theory of systemic functional grammar  however 
they simplify the task by removing the middle third of the dataset  thereby potentially
increasing precision at the cost of reducing recall to a maximum of      they train smo
models on the top third and lower third of the essays corpus for the two personality traits

of extraversion and emotional stability  achieving accuracies on this subset of the data of
    for both traits 
we believe it is likely that personality recognition models need to be based on the full
range of values to be useful in any practical application  nevertheless  in order to do a
direct comparison  we also removed the middle third of the essays dataset and trained an
smo classifier with the liwc features  we obtain     classification accuracy for extraversion and     for emotional stability  whereas when the same algorithm is applied to the
whole corpus  we obtain accuracies of     for extraversion and     for emotional stability 
significantly outperforming the baseline  see table      using the ear conversational data
and observer reports  accuracies of our smo models remain at     for extraversion but
increase to     for emotional stability  see table     
these results suggest that our feature set in combination with that of argamon et al 
could possibly improve performance  as both feature sets perform comparably  using their
features  argamon et al  identify that relative frequencies of a set of function words are the
best predictor for extraversion  suggesting that those that refer to norms and certainty are
the most salient  concerning emotional stability  the feature set characterising appraisal
produces by far the best results  appraisal features are relative frequencies of positive and
negative words as well as frequencies of each category in the attitude network  e g   affect 
appreciation  judgement  etc    they find that neurotics tend to use more words related to
negative appraisal and affect  but fewer appreciation appraisal words  suggesting that they
focus more on their personal feelings 
oberlander and nowson        follow a bottom up feature discovery method by training naive bayes and smo models for four of the big five traits on a corpus of personal
weblogs  using n gram features extracted from the dataset  in order to be able to compare
with argamon et al   they report experiments where they remove texts with non extreme
personality scores from their corpus  but they also report experiments applying classification
algorithms to seven different ways of partitioning the whole corpus into classes  motivated
as approximating a continuous modelling approach  although  their results arent directly
   

firecognising personality in conversation and text

comparable to ours because they are based on different corpora  we report the results that
use all instances of the dataset  as we believe that discarding some of the test data increases
precision at the cost of making recall unacceptably low 
when building naive bayes models using the most frequent bi grams and tri grams
computed over the full corpus  oberlander and nowson        find that the model of agreeableness is the only one outperforming the baseline      accuracy  no level of significance
mentioned   when keeping only n grams that are distinctive of two extreme sets of a given
trait  accuracies range from     for extraversion to     for emotional stability  finally 
when applying an automatic feature selection algorithm to the filtered set  accuracies increase to range from     for emotional stability to     for agreeableness  when testing
whether these models generalise to a different corpus of weblogs  nowson and oberlander
       report binary classification accuracies ranging from     for extraversion to    
for conscientiousness  interestingly  models trained on the most extreme instances of the
original corpus seem to outperform models trained on the full corpus  although no level of
significance is mentioned  these studies show that careful feature selection greatly improves
classification accuracy  and that n grams can be appropriate to model self reports of personality  although  as oberlander and nowson point out  such features are likely to overfit 
it would therefore be interesting to test in future work whether the feature sets used here
generalise to another dataset 
oberlander and nowson        also report results for   way and   way classification  in
order to approximate the finer grained continuous personality ratings used in psychology
 as we do with the scalar models we present here   they obtain a maximum of      
for extraversion with   bins  using raw n grams  baseline is         these results are not
directly comparable to ours because they are on a different corpus  with different feature
sets  moreover  we have not provided results on such multiple classification experiments 
because such models cannot take into account the fact that the different classes are part
of a total ordering  and thus the resulting models are forced to ignore the importance of
features that correlate with that ordering across all classes  we believe that regression and
ranking models are more appropriate for finer grained personality recognition  see sections
  and    
to evaluate this claim  we first mapped the output of the best classifier to a ranking and
compared it with the rankboost models  we trained a naive bayes classifier on the ear
corpus with observer reports and all features  using   equal size bins   for each test fold
of a    fold cross validation  we computed the ranking loss produced by the classifier based
on the ordering of the five classes  results in table    show that rankboost significantly
outperforms the classifier for four traits out of five  p         with an improvement close to
significance for emotional stability  p         
because rankboosts goal is to minimise the ranking loss  this comparison is likely to
favour ranking models  therefore  we also mapped the output of the rankboost models
to   classification bins to see whether rankboost could perform as well as a classifier for
the classification task  we divided the output ranking into   bins  each containing a    
slice of contiguously ranked instances  results in table    show that the naive bayes
classifier never outperforms rankboost significantly  while the ranking model produces a
   oberlander and nowson use unequal bins defined for each personality trait using standard deviation
from the mean  which may be an easier task than equal size bins

better mean accuracy for agreeableness       and openness to experience        and the
same accuracy for emotional stability        in sum  we find that ranking models perform
as well for classification and better for ranking compared with our best classifier  thus
modelling personality using continuous models is more accurate 

   discussion and future work
we show that personality can be recognised by computers through language cues   while
recent work in ai explores methods for the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic
variation in text and conversation  such as opinion  emotion  and deception  to date  we
know of only two studies besides our own on automatic recognition of user personality  argamon et al         mairesse   walker      a      b  oberlander   nowson         to our
knowledge  the results presented here are the first to demonstrate statistically significant
results for texts and to recognise personality in conversation  mairesse   walker      a 
    b   we present the first results applying regression and ranking models in order to
model personality recognition using the continuous scales traditional in psychology  we
also systematically examine the use of different feature sets  suggested by previous psycholinguistic research  although these features have been suggested by the psycholinguistic
literature  reported correlations with personality ratings are generally weak  it was not
obvious that they would improve accuracies of statistical models on unseen subjects 
computational work on modelling personality has primarily focused on methods for
expressing personality in virtual agents and tutorial systems  and concepts related to personality such as politeness  emotion  or social intelligence  walker  cahn    whittaker

is required  models such as we present here for the automatic recognition of user personality
is one way to acquire such a user model  chu carroll   carberry        thompson  goker 
  langley        zukerman   litman         we plan to test these models as user models
in the context of an adaptive dialogue system 
table    summarises results for all the personality traits and recognition tasks we
analysed  what clearly emerges is that extraversion is the easiest trait to model from
spoken language  followed by emotional stability and conscientiousness  concerning written language  models of openness to experience produce the best results for all recognition
tasks  we can also see that feature selection is very important  as some of the best models
only contain a small subset of the full feature set  prosodic features are important for modelling observed extraversion  emotional stability and openness to experience  mrc features
are useful for models of emotional stability  while liwc features are beneficial for all traits 
we also analysed qualitatively which features had the most influence in specific models  for
all recognition tasks  as well as reporting correlations between each feature and personality
traits in section     
although the parameters of the algorithms have not been optimised  the bottom of
table    seems to indicate that simple models like naive bayes or regression trees tend
to outperform more complex ones  e g   support vector machines   confirming results from
oberlander and nowson         however  our experiments on the larger essays corpus
 more than       texts  show that support vector machines and boosting algorithms produce higher classification accuracies  it is therefore likely that those algorithms would also
perform better on spoken data if they were trained on a much larger corpus than the ear
dataset  and if their parameters were optimised 
we hypothesised that models of observed personality will outperform models of selfassessed personality  our results do suggest that observed personality may be easier to
model than self reports  at least in conversational data  for the ear corpus  we find many
good results with models of observed personality  while models of self assessed personality
never outperform the baseline  this may be due to objective observers using similar cues as
our models  while self reports of personality may be more influenced by factors such as the
desirability of the trait  edwards         hogan        introduced the distinction between
the agents and the observers perspective in personality assessment  while the agents
perspective conceptually taps into a persons identity  or personality from the inside   the
observers perspective in contrast taps into a persons reputation  or personality from the
outside   both facets of personality have important psychological implications  a persons
identity shapes the way the person experiences the world  a persons reputation  however 
is psychologically not less important  it determines whether people get hired or fired  e g  
reputation of honesty   get married or divorced  get adored or stigmatised  because it is
harder to assess  this observers perspective has received comparatively little attention in
psychology  given that in everyday life people act as observers of other peoples behaviours
most of the time  the external perspective naturally has both high theoretical importance
and social relevance  hogan        
recent research exploring this issue in psychology is based on the brunswikian lens
model  brunswik         which has been used extensively in recent years to explain the
kernel of truth in the social perception of strangers  use of the lens model in personality
research reflects the widely shared assumptions that the expression of personality is commu

table     comparison of the best models for each trait  for all three recognition tasks  each
table entry contains the algorithm  the feature set  and the model performance 
see sections     and     for details  depending on the task  the evaluation metric is either the     classification accuracy      percentage of improvement over
the regression baseline      ranking loss  asterisks indicate results that arent
significant at the p       level 

nicatively functional  i e  that  a  latent attributes of persons are expressed via observable
cues   b  observers rely on observable cues to infer the latent attributes of others   c  observers use appropriate cues  that is  their implicit assumptions on the relations between
observable cues and latent attributes are to some extent accurate  the model has also
been useful in identifying observable cues that mediate convergences between judgments of
latent attributes and more direct measures of those attributes  scherer        heinrich  
borkenau        
as there are discrepancies between markers of self assessed and observed personality 
another issue is the identification of the most appropriate model given a specific application 
such a gold standard can be approximated by either observer or self reports  however it is
likely that for a specific trait one type of report will be closer to the true personality  a
hypothesis that remains to be tested is that traits with a high visibility  e g   extraversion 
are more accurately assessed using observer reports  as they tend to yield a higher interjudge agreement  funder         while low visibility traits  e g   emotional stability  are
better assessed by oneself  a personality recogniser aiming to estimate the true personality
would therefore have to switch from observer models to self report models  depending on
the trait under assessment 
beyond practical applications of personality recognition models  this work is also an
attempt to explore different ways of looking at the relation between personality and language  we looked at various personality recognition tasks  and applied different learning
   

firecognising personality in conversation and text

methods in section      the tasks vary in complexity  a ranking model can be directly
derived from a regression model  while a classification model can be derived from either a
ranking or a regression model  is any type of model closer to the actual relation between
language  and more generally behaviour  and personality  does personality vary continuously  or are there clusters of people with similar trait combinations  if the relation is
continuous  classification algorithms will never be able to produce accurate models for more
than two classes  because they dont take into account any ordering between the classes  as
ranking models outperform classifiers  see section     and given the wide range of individual
differences reflected by the literature on the big five  allport   odbert        norman 
      goldberg         we believe that personality varies continuously among members of
the population  suggesting that regression or ranking models should be more accurate in
the long run  this hypothesis is supported by recent work in medical research showing that
antisocial personality disorder varies continuously  marcus  lilienfeld  edens    poythress 
       regression provides the most detailed model of the output variables  but depending on whether absolute differences between personality scores are meaningful  or if only
relative orderings between people matter  ranking may be more appropriate  additional
models could also be tried on the ranking task  such as support vector algorithms for ordinal regression  herbrich  graepel    obermayer         moreover  future work should
assess whether optimising the parameters of the learning algorithms improves performance 
in future work  we would like to improve these models and examine how well they
perform across dialogue domains  it is not clear whether the accuracies are high enough
to be useful  applications involving speech recognition will introduce noise in all features
except for the prosodic features  probably reducing model accuracy  but since the ear
corpus is relatively small  we expect that more training data would improve performance 
additionally  we believe that the inclusion of gender as a feature would produce better
models  as the actual language correlates of perceived personality were shown to depend
on the gender of the speaker  mehl et al          we also believe that future work should
investigate the combination of individual features in a trait dependent way  another issue is
the poor performance of the utterance type featuressince there were significant correlation
results for these features in section      it is unclear why these features are not useful in
the statistical models  this could possibly arise from the small size of the datasets  or
from the relatively low accuracy of our hand crafted automatic tagger  compared to other
work using supervised learning methods  stolcke  ries  coccaro  shriberg  bates  jurafsky 
taylor  martin  ess dykema    meteer        webb  hepple    wilks        
we have begun to test these models on our spoken language generator  mairesse  
walker         in future work  we plan to compare the utility of models trained on out ofdomain corpora  such as those here  with other methods for training such models  in terms
of their utility for the automatic adaptation of the output generation of dialogue systems
