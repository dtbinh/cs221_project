abstract
this paper develops an inductive theory of predictive common sense reasoning  the
theory provides the basis for an integrated solution to the three traditional problems of
reasoning about change  the frame  qualification  and ramification problems  the theory is
also capable of representing non deterministic events  and it provides a means for stating
defeasible preferences over the outcomes of conflicting simultaneous events 

   introduction
a great deal has been written on the logical representation of common sense reasoning
about change since the publication of mccarthy and hayess        seminal paper  and
many theories have been proposed  see  for example  the monographs by sandewall        
shanahan         and reiter        
most theories treat events  deductively  along the lines of the representation of actions
used in the planner strips  fikes   nilsson         each event type is defined by its
preconditions and effects  for example  in the blocks world  the preconditions for unstacking
block x from block y are that x is on y  x is clear  no block is on top of it   and the robot hand
is empty  the effects are that the hand is holding x  y is clear  and each of the preconditions
is false  change is then a matter of deduction  if a particular event  a token of an event
type  occurs and its particular preconditions hold  then its particular effects are deduced 
and so necessarily follow  from it  events of this kind will be called deductive events and
the view that natural events can be represented deductively will be called deductionism 
deductive event types can be thought of as invariable regularities  or uniformities  of sequence  viewed in this way the strips representation of events can be seen to be descended
from those considered by hume and mill in their discussions of causation  hume        bk
i  pt iii  suggests that we inductively acquire knowledge of regularities of succession of the
form  a type events are followed by b type events  we then consider that a type events
cause b type events  because whenever we see an a type event we expect that it will be
followed by a b type event  mill        bk iii  ch    complicates this picture by considering
assemblages of conditions  a single assemblage might consist of an a type event together
with certain conditions which must be present  positive conditions  and certain conditions
which must be absent  negative conditions   for example  an assemblage concerning the
lighting of matches might include the striking of the match  the presence of oxygen  and
the absence of dampness in the match head 
   events are assumed to include the physical actions of agents  whether intentional or unintentional

mill        thought that it was possible  at least in principle  to define assemblages which
are detailed enough to ensure their effects  for every event there is some combination of
objects or events  some given concurrence of circumstances  positive and negative  the
occurrence of which is always followed by that phenomenon  p       
however  hume        pp         had already argued against this possibility  it is always
possible that a regularity  no matter how long it has continued in the past  will not continue
in the future  consequently no set of sentences which report what has been observed ever
logically implies anything about what has not been observed  as goodman        p     
puts it  what has happened imposes no logical restrictions on what will happen  so  if
deductionism is to be plausible  it is necessary to assume that nature is uniform  that the
future will resemble the past  that past regularities will continue  now  clearly  uniformity
cannot be justified by appealing to experience  and it is difficult to see how else it can be
justified  see  goodmans discussion  pp          without such a justification  deductionism
should be regarded as being suspect in theory 
deductionism is also suspect in practice  as it is impossible in practice to define preconditions which  together with the occurrence of the event  are sufficient to ensure that
its effects will follow  for example  russell        p     considers the problem of conflicting
events  i put my penny in the slot  but before i can draw out my ticket there is an earthquake which upsets the machine and my calculations  in order to be sure of the expected
effect  we must know that there is nothing in the environment to interfere with it  but this
means that the supposed cause is not  by itself  adequate to insure the effect  russell also
observes that we cannot usefully solve the problem by complicating preconditions because 
as soon as we include the environment  the probability of repetition is diminished  until  at
last  when the whole environment is included  the probability of repetition becomes almost
nil  pp       
the problem of specifying preconditions which are always sufficient also arises in mackies
account of causal regularities  invariable regularities of sequence   for example  at least
part of the answer  to the question of what caused a particular fire  is that there is a set
of conditions  of which some are positive and some are negative   including the presence
of inflammable material  the absence of a suitably placed sprinkler  and no doubt quite a
number of others  mackie        p       the list of conditions is incomplete because  even
if causal regularities hold in the objects  they are seldom  if ever  known in full  causal
knowledge progresses gradually towards the formulation of such regularities  but it hardly
ever gets there  causal regularities as known are typically incomplete       what we know
are certain elliptical or gappy universal propositions  mackie        p      
the sufficient preconditions problem becomes more acute when we consider formal representations which are intended to be of practical use  because the preconditions have to
be computationally tractable  mccarthy        p        gives the example of using a boat
to cross a river  given that the boat is a rowing boat  that it is equipped with oars  and is
manned by an oarsman  it can be used to convey two passengers across the river  provided
that the boat does not leak  and provided that it does not hit a rock  and provided that
it is not hit by another boat  and provided that it is not overturned by a hippopotamus 
or sunk by a meteorite  or vapourized by a thermonuclear blast  etc  it seems that the list
of qualifications which need to be added is limited only by the limits of our imagination 
accordingly  mccarthy calls the sufficient preconditions problem the qualification problem

in response  deductionists might argue that representations are abstractions and that
their approach works well for simple domains  in which it can be assumed that qualifications do not arise  in such domains  they might argue  the uniformity assumption is
reasonable  and so deductive theories do provide a useful representation  this may well be
true  but  theories of this kind cannot readily be extended to more complex  less uniform 
domains because the additional complexity of the required preconditions quickly becomes
overwhelming  thus the deductionist approach may be appropriate for certain applications 
such as the mathematical analysis of high level programming languages in which elementary commands are viewed as abstract operations on data  but it is inappropriate for
the representation of predictive reasoning about natural events  the events of our everyday
experience  because these are too irregular to be treated deductively  moreover  the deductionist abstraction is better thought of as an idealization  and a problematic one at that 
if the preconditions of a deductive event hold on occurrence  then its effects are logically
guaranteed to follow  and so no natural force can intervene to prevent them from doing so 
deductive events are thus not natural  but supernatural  this idealization creates technical
difficulties when it comes to the representation of events with variable effects  including
non deterministic and context dependent effects  as these effects should not always be deduced  and to the representation of conflicting events  events whose effects are individually
consistent but jointly inconsistent  as their joint effects cannot consistently be deduced 
consequently deductionist theories of these phenomena  some of which are discussed in the
sequel  face unnecessary  self imposed  difficulties  it is difficult to escape the conclusion
that  in representing natural events deductively  deductionism starts off on the wrong foot 
but this conclusion is hardly surprising when we consider that our predictive reasoning
about natural events is inductive  rather than deductive  in nature   the major purpose of
predictive reasoning is to support practical reasoning  that is  reasoning about what to do 
predictive reasoning is normally based on partial knowledge  or incomplete belief   both of
causal regularities  as mackie observes  and of the contexts in which the events concerned
occur  it also tends to be conjectural in that it seeks to produce reasonable conclusions on
the basis of what is known  as a result it tends to produce conclusions which are both supradeductive  which may not be deducible from the known  and defeasible  which may turn
out to be wrong    accordingly  definitions of  practical  non omniscient  rationality are
typically couched in terms of the utility of the expected  rather than the actual  outcomes
of actions  russell and norvig        p      illustrate this point as follows  i am walking
along the champs elysees one day and i see an old friend across the street  there is no
traffic nearby and i am not otherwise engaged  so being rational  i start to cross the street 
meanwhile at        feet  a cargo door falls off a passing airliner  and before i make it to
   in philosophy  the term inductive reasoning is applied to any form of qualitative non deductive reasoning  it thus includes enumerative induction  in which a general rule is inferred from a non exhaustive
set of inferences  for example  all of the emeralds which have been observed have been green  therefore
all emeralds are green   this is the form of reasoning which underlies our knowledge of regularities 
when it comes to inductive events the idea  as explained in the text below  is to produce reasonable
conclusions about their outcomes on the basis of partial information  in ai  inductive reasoning of this
kind is formalized in non monotonic logics 
   j  k  galbraith once remarked that there are two kinds of forecasters  those who dont know  and those
who know that they dont know

the other side of the street i am flattened  was i irrational to cross the street  it is unlikely
that my obituary would read idiot attempts to cross street 
this change in perspective results in a substantial simplification of the problem of specifying preconditions  we are no longer concerned with invariable regularities of sequence 
with necessary connections between events and their effects  but rather with regularities
of sequence which normally hold  with fairly dependable regularities of sequence  russell        p      with expected connections between events and their effects  consequently
we can define preconditions which  together with their associated events  form conditions
which are normally sufficient for the associated effects  and which are otherwise minimal
in the sense that no part of them is redundant  preconditions of this kind tend to be both
tractable  simple  and useful  to occur frequently in practice  
we can now give a humeian account of predictions involving natural events in terms of
 fairly  dependable regularities and the expectations that they engender  if an event occurs 
its preconditions obtain  and we are not aware of anything which will prevent the effects
from following  then we form a clear expectation  we know  that the effects will follow 
and so it is rational  reasonable  to predict them  for example  if block a is unstacked
from block b  the preconditions obtain  and we are not aware of a preventer  then we
clearly expect  and so predict  that a will no longer be on b  more complex cases involve
conflicting events  if  in such a case  we have a clear expectation of the outcome  then it is
rational to predict it  for example  we clearly expect  and so predict  that the airliner door
will crush  rather than bounce off  the intrepid pedestrian  in this example we consider that
two conflicting outcomes are possible  but that only one of them is probable  however  in
other cases our expectations are unclear  we are torn between conflicting expectations and
so do not know what to expect  in such cases it seems reasonable to adopt a cautious
approach  and restrict our predictions to those effects that we clearly expect  for example 
if a fair coin is tossed  then we do not have a clear expectation as to which side it will
land  we half expect that it will land on heads and we half expect that it will land on
tails  we consider that two conflicting outcomes are equally probable  so caution dictates
that we should predict that the coin lands on one side or the other  but that we should
not predict which of the two sides it will land on  note that  as expectations are based on
incomplete knowledge  the predictions which are based on them are defeasible  for example 
if  unbeknown to us  block a is glued to block b when a is unstacked from b  then the
event does not have the effects that we predict it will have 
we can thus begin by thinking of natural events as defeasible strips events  as stripslike events whose effects do not always follow them  when they occur and their preconditions
are true   and inferring their effects inductively  accordingly  events of this kind will be
called inductive events  and the view that natural events should be represented inductively
will be called inductionism  so if logic is understood to include both deductive and inductive inference  then the inductionist objection to deductionism can be stated succinctly 
deductionism is a logical mistake 
this paper can be seen as an argument for inductionism  it begins by presenting a basic
theory of inductive events and then uses this as the basis for a more comprehensive theory
of natural events 
the formal language in which the theory is expressed is defined in the next section  and
the basic theory of inductive events is then given in section    the theory builds on the
   

finatural events

ideas of mccarthy            lifschitz         and shoham         and is logico pragmatic
in nature  that is  it consists of a set of axioms together with a formal pragmatics  which 
given a formal theory containing the axioms  interprets it in a particular way  and in doing
so  generates the predictions of the theory  the basic theory of inductive events provides
the basis of a solution to the qualification problem and integrates this with the basis of
a solution to the complementary frame problem  mccarthy   hayes        p        that
is  the problem of inferring what is unchanged by the occurrence of an event  or  more
generally  by the occurrence of several simultaneously occurring events  
in section    the basic theory of inductive events is extended by introducing a distinction
between inductive events which are primary and those which are secondary  whereas
primary events occur independently  secondary events are invoked by other  primary or
secondary  events in appropriate contexts  and are causally dependent on them  in the
simplest case  a primary event invokes a secondary event and is the only event to do so 
in which case  the secondary event succeeds  is followed by its effects  only if the primary
event which invoked it succeeds  this extension to the basic theory makes it possible for
inductive events to have additional context dependent effects  thereby providing the basis
for a solution to the ramification problem  ginsberg   smith         that is  the problem
of representing the indirect  context dependent  effects of events  for example  if an agent
is holding a block and the agent moves  then the move agent event invokes a causally
dependent move block event  with the effect that the block moves only if the agent does 
this extension also makes it possible to represent events with non deterministic effects  for
example  the non deterministic event of tossing a fair coin can be represented by having the
event invoke two conflicting deterministic events  one of which has the effect that the coin
lands on heads  the other that it lands on tails 
the theory of natural events is completed in section    which deals with the problem
of representing defeasible preferences over the outcomes of conflicting simultaneous events 
when two events conflict we often have a clear expectation about the outcome  for example 
if two agents attempt to go through a door simultaneously and only one of them can succeed 
then it is reasonable to expect that the stronger one will do so  however this expectation
is defeasible  the stronger agent may fail for some independent reason  the agent may slip 
say   in which case the preference is reversed and we expect that the weaker agent will
succeed  although the weaker agent may also slip  etc    in order to represent defeasible
asymmetric expectations of this kind event preferences are introduced  and the formal
pragmatics of the basic theory is refined in order to interpret them correctly 
a philosophical justification of the theory of natural events is given in section    and
related work is discussed in section   
although causal notions underlie much of the development of the theory of natural
events  there is no explicit reference to causation in the theory  this is because it is intended
to provide the basis for a definition of sufficient causation which forms part of a larger theory
of causation  bell                     
   according to the theory  the occurrence of event e in context c is a sufficient cause of effect  if the occurrence of e in c is sufficient to ensure   for instance  if e succeeds at time t and  is a logical consequence of
es effects at t    then e is a sufficient cause of   the definition of causation is then obtained by requiring that sufficient causes also satisfy a refinement of lewiss        ch      counterfactual dependence

   the event language el
the theory of events is expressed in the event language el  which has been developed
in order to represent and reason about events and their effects  on the basis of partial
information  at successive points in time  this section begins with an informal introduction
and then gives a formal account 
in order to represent epistemic partiality in a natural and economical way el is based
on kleenes            strong three valued logic   kleene introduced the truth value undefined in order to accommodate undecidable mathematical sentences  however he also
suggested that undefined could be interpreted as unknown  where  unknown is a category into which we can regard any proposition as falling  whose value we either do not
know or choose for the moment to disregard  and it does not the exclude the other two
possibilities true and false  p        thus understood  undefined is not a truth value
on a par with true and false  and its introduction is intended as a practical  logically
conservative  way of reasoning with partial information  rather than a revolutionary attack
on classical logic  
in keeping with this interpretation  the truth value of a sentence should be classical
 either true or false  if enough is known to determine it  the formal semantics for
the propositional case can thus be given as follows  a model  m   consists of a possibly
partial evaluation function  v   which assigns at most one classical truth value to each
atomic proposition  the truth      and falsity      of sentences in m is then defined by the
following truth and falsity conditions 
m    p iff v  p    true
m    p iff v  p    false
m     iff m    
m     iff m    
condition  the occurrence of event e is a cause of effect  in context c iff  i  e is a sufficient cause of 
in c  and  ii   depends on e in the closest context to c in which e is the only sufficient cause of  
   kleenes logic will be familiar to readers with a background in philosophical logic  it is  for example  used
by kripke        as a basis for his theory of truth   and the choice to use it here is likely to appear a
natural one to them  however  kleenes logic may be unfamiliar to readers in the reasoning about actions
and change community  and they may well wonder why i have not used a more established classical
language such as the situation calculus  mccarthy   hayes         a full justification of my choice
would involve a lengthy comparison of languages  in short  it is simpler to acknowledge that epistemic
partiality is a ubiquitous feature of predictive reasoning and to deal with it directly  as in kleenes
logic  rather than indirectly in a classical logic  by means of syntactic encoding and circumscription  as
in the situation calculus   or by using modal logic  as in tk  shoham         the representation of
partiality in kleenes logic is also optimal  because there is no cost associated with the representation
of what is unknown  by contrast  partiality in classical reasoning requires the consideration of a class
of models  or possible worlds  which is large enough to ensure that unwanted noise  arbitrary  but
compulsory  assignments of classical truth values to sentences whose truth values are not determined by
the theory in question  is eliminated  this profligacy is significant when considering the contemplated
model building implementation of event theories  bell            see the remarks on implementation in
section    finally  as indicated in the introduction and footnote    the theory of events is intended to
form part of a larger theory of causation  in which el is embedded in a partial modal language 
   confirmed classicists can thus rest assured that they are not being threatened with anything radical 
such as the bolshevik menace of brouwer and weyl  remark on intuitionism attributed to f p  ramsey
by blackburne

m       iff m     and m    
m       iff m     or m    

so a sentence  is true if  is false  is false if  is true  and is undefined otherwise  and
the sentence    is true if  and  are both true  false if either is false  and is undefined
otherwise  note that when the evaluation function is total this semantics is equivalent to
the semantics for classical propositional calculus  so the essential difference between the two
semantics is the classical assumption that the evaluation function is total  the additional
requirement that v assigns at least one classical truth value to each atomic proposition 
further operators can be defined as in classical logic  in particular  inclusive disjunction
is defined as      df       so    is true if either disjunct is true  is false if
both disjuncts are false  and is undefined otherwise  and exclusive disjunction is defined
as      df             so    is true if the truth values of  and  are both
defined and are different  false if the truth values of  and  are both defined and are the
same  and is undefined otherwise  
kleenes logic can perhaps be called demi classical  as it becomes classical when the
truth values of all of the constituent atomic sentences are classical  unsurprisingly then 
the use of kleenes logic does not  of itself  solve any of the problems of predictive reasoning
beyond that of representing partiality  there is  for example  no reliance on a special
causal notion of consequence  such as that of linear logic  girard        
the expressiveness of kleenes language is greatly enhanced by adding a classicallyvalued definedness operator to it  the sentence d is true if  is defined  is either true
or false   and is false otherwise 

m    d iff either m     or m    
m    d iff neither m     nor m    

further classically valued operators can now be defined as follows 

t  df d  
    df t  t

f  df d  
u  df d
    df  t  t    f  f    u  u 

thus  for sentences  and   t is true if  is true  and is false otherwise  f is true if 
is false  and is false otherwise  u is true if  is undefined  and is false otherwise     is

   readers who are unfamiliar with kleenes logic may wish to check the definitions against the semantics 
for example  m       iff m         iff m       iff  m     or m      iff  m     or
m

true if  is true or  is not  and is false otherwise   and    is true if  and  have the
same truth value  and is false otherwise  
the first order extension  given by kleene  is straightforward  the universal sentence
x is true if  is true for all assignments to x  false if  is false for some such assignment  and
is undefined otherwise  the existential quantifier is defined as in classical logic  x  df
x  thus x is true if  is true for some assignment to x  is false if  is false for all
such assignments  and is undefined otherwise 
in order to represent change  events and time points are added as an additional sort 
for simplicity  the order of time is assumed to be discrete and linear 
an object atom is an atom of the form r u            un   t   where r is an object relation
symbol  the ui are object terms  and t is a time point term  for example  the object atoms
at o  l     and at o  l     state respectively that object o is at location l at time   
and that o is not at l at time   
an event atom is an atom of the form r u            un   t   where r is an event relation
symbol  the ui are event terms  and t is a time point term  for example  the event atom
occ move o  l   l       states that the event consisting of object o moving from location
l  to location l  occurs at time   
the intuition behind the fact event distinction is that events are active agents  causes 
of change  while facts are passive patients of change which persist through time until
affected by some event  until some event causes them to change    
in order to represent the persistence of facts  second order quantification over object
relations and second order relations are added to el  an object relation atom is an atom
of the form r u            un   t   where r is a second order relation symbol  the ui are object
relation symbols or object terms  and t is a time point term  for example  the objectrelation atom inert at  ho  li     states that the at relation is inert for objects o and l at
time   
   the conditional    captures much of the flavour of classical material implication  this can be
emphasized by defining the weaker conditional of kleenes logic      df     this conditional is
inadequate  at least for present purposes  because it is undefined  rather than false  when  is true and 
is undefined  this is not the case for the stronger conditional    which could equally have been defined
as  t  t  this definition makes it clear that a conditional    states a constraint which must
be satisfied if  is true  but which can otherwise be ignored  the conditional does not quite capture
all of the meaning of classical material implication  as it does not satisfy the  implicitly understood 
condition that if  is false  then so is   if desired  it is possible to define a stronger conditional  which
better represents classical material implication  as follows      df             or 
equivalently      df  t  t    f  f   the equivalence operator can then be defined as
follows      df            
   the addition of a truth value designation operator is not new  bochvar        added a truth operator to
a different system of connectives  and the undefined operator u is a special case of rosser and turquettes
       jk operator  barringer  cheng  and jones        give a natural deduction system for kleenes logic
and the defined operator d  their system is readily extended to include the operators defined above  the
additional introduction and elimination rules for connectives such as  and  simply fold and unfold the
definitions  similar languages have been used as a basis for the formalization of non monotonic reasoning
 doherty        
    the fact event distinction is similar to mccarthys           fluent event distinction  the case for
adding events to the ontology of facts is argued by davidson         lewis        ch      goes further
and treats facts as events

a temporally indexed relation is any relation whose atoms are temporally indexed  whose
atoms are of the form r u            un   t   the primitive atemporal relations of el are temporal
precedence     and identity     further atemporal relations can be defined in terms of
temporally indexed relations as follows

a set of event types  a time frame consisting of a set of time points ordered by a  discrete
and linear  precedence relation  and functions for interpreting terms and relations  the
twin notions of satisfaction and violation of a formula  by a variable assignment in a model 
are defined by means of a parallel recursion  the truth  falsity  of a sentence in a model
is then defined in terms of satisfaction  violation  by all assignments for that model  as in
classical logic  a model m is said to be a model of a sentence   a set of sentences   if 
is true in m  if every sentence in  is true in m    and a set of sentences  semantically

be mutually disjoint  furthermore  vr is assumed to contain variables of each arity n

ht   t i  where t is a set of time points and t is the before after relation on t    and
interpretation functions for terms and relations  for simplicity  time is assumed to be
isomorphic to the integers  the denotations of terms are always defined and do not vary
over time  by contrast  temporally indexed relations may be partial and may vary over
time  consequently each temporally indexed relation is interpreted by a function from time
points to partial characteristic functions  where defined  the partial characteristic function
associated with a time point maps instances of the relation to  true  false

   inductive events
the formal theory of natural events is introduced in stages  beginning  in this section  with
the basic theory of inductive events 
definition   the theory of inductive events  ind   consists of the axioms given in table   
thus ind                    an event theory is any set of el sentences which contains ind  
axiom     defines the notion of success  and states that event e succeeds at time t iff it
is true that e occurs at t  the preconditions of e are true at t  and the effects of e are true
at t      the presence of the truth operator in this axiom ensures that the relation succ
    thus defined  the success or failure of an event is a simple  objective  matter of whether its occurrence is
accompanied by its preconditions and is followed by its effects  so when speaking of the success or failure

is classical in the sense that every instance of it is either true or false  it is thus possible to
reason classically about success and failure on the basis of partial information 
in view of the fact event distinction  it is also necessary to represent inertia  that is 
the temporal persistence of facts which are not changed by events  the definition of inertia
begins with a distinction between physical facts  represented by physical relations  and
theoretical facts  represented by theoretical relations   intuitively  physical facts are facts
about the world as we directly observe it  whereas theoretical facts are the product of
our more complex reflection on  theorizing about  the physical facts    for example  in
a representation of the blocks world the locations of blocks might be represented by the
object relation at  this can then be used to define the relation clear  which is true of a
location at a point in time if there are no blocks at that location at that point in time  in
this theory  the relation at is naturally classified as a physical relation  as it represents the
physical locations of blocks  while the relation clear is naturally classified as a theoretical
relation  as it represents a  comparatively complex  property of locations which is defined in
terms of the locations of blocks   note that  as theoretical facts are  ultimately  defined in
terms of physical facts  the theoretical facts supervene on the physical facts  that is  fixing
the physical facts at any point in time also fixes the theoretical facts at that point in time 
in event theories  physical and theoretical relations are identified by means of the secondorder predicates phys and theo respectively  thus axiom     states that every object
relation is either a physical relation or a theoretical relation  as a matter of notational
convenience the convention is adopted that any object relation which is not declared to be
a theoretical relation is a physical one  this convention is enforced by the formal pragmatics
discussed below 
the inertia of physical facts is defined by axiom schema      which  for simplicity  will
henceforth be called an axiom  in the axiom  r is an n ary object relation symbol  x is
a vector x            xn of object variables  and hxi is the list hx            xn i  the axiom states
that r is inert for the objects referred to by x at time t iff r is a physical relation and
of an event no end or purpose  no teleology  is implied  we could equally talk of an event occurrence
being complete or incomplete  it is natural to talk informally of intentional actions succeeding or failing 
for example of an agent succeeding or failing in their intention to move to a particular location  but no
attempt is made to represent this intentionality formally 
    physical facts can be thought of as quines        chs       observational predications  these are
compounds of more primitive observation sentences  which are the human equivalent of bird calls and
apes cries  p       for example  the observational sentences black  or thats black  and dog
 or thats a dog  might be combined in the observational predication black dog  or the dog is
black   theoretical facts are the result of more complex compounding  involving logical connectives
and  especially  reification 

   

finatural events

the truth values of the object atoms r x  t  and r x  t    are equivalent  note that the
relation inert is classical in event theories  because phys is classical  by axiom      and the
right hand equivalence is classically valued  note also that  for event theories which do not
contain occurrences of the theo relation  axiom     is unnecessary and axiom     can be
simplified accordingly 
we turn now to the intended interpretation of event theories 
on the intended interpretation  axiom     is used to generate the expected outcomes
of events  if pre e  t  and occ e  t  are both true  and it is consistent to assume that
the success atom succ e  t  is true  then this success assumption is made  and the axiom
is used to conclude that the expected effects  eff e  t     are true  thus interpreted the
axiom states that  when accompanied by their preconditions  occurring events are normally
sufficient for  are normally followed by  their effects  when interpreted in this way  the
axiom amounts to a common sense law of change 
similarly  on the intended interpretation  axiom     is used to generate the expected
persistence of physical facts  if r is a physical relation  the object atom r x  t  is defined 
and it is consistent to assume that the inertia atom inert r  hxi  t  is true  then this inertia
assumption is made  and the axiom is used to conclude that the truth value of r x  persists
from t to t      thus interpreted  the axiom states that physical facts normally persist 
and so it amounts to a common sense law of inertia 
the intended interpretations of axioms     and     often conflict  for example  if an
unstack a from b event occurs  its preconditions are true  and no other relevant facts or
events are involved  then it is consistent to assume that the unstack event succeeds  and it
is consistent to assume that the fact that a is on b is inert  but the assumptions cannot
both be made because the success of the unstack event implies that a is no longer on b 
in such cases i suggest that change should always have priority over inertia  that success
assumptions should always have priority over inertia assumptions  this conflict resolution
principle can be defended by appealing to our regularity based  humeian  expectation of
change  thus  in the case at hand  experience has taught us that unstack events of the
sort described normally succeed  and so we form a clear expectation that the effects will
follow  by contrast  giving priority to inertia would  contrary to expectation  result in
nothing changing  and adopting a neutral stance would  contrary to expectation  produce
an unclear outcome 
the intended interpretation of event theories is enforced by their formal pragmatics 
which defines the class of preferred models of any given event theory  in this section the
notion of preference  is defined  this is later refined to preference  in section   
in order to enforce the convention that object relations are physical unless stated otherwise  the preferred  models of an event theory should all be models of the theory in which
the  positive  domain of the phys relation is as large as it can be  let us say that a model
m is a phys maximal model of an event theory  if m is a model of  and  for any model
m  of   if  r   m    phys r     r   m     phys r   then m   m    then the preferred 
models of  should all be phys maximal models of  
    if r x  t  is not defined  then  as will become clear  this atom can safely be ignored  for if inert r  hxi  t 
can consistently be assumed  then the formal pragmatics  in particular  the minimization of evidential
atoms at t    ensures that r x  t    is undefined  thereby satisfying the axiom 

   

fibell

beyond this requirement  we can get a clearer idea of what a preferred  model of an
event theory should look like by considering an inductive version of the canonical example 
known as the yale shooting problem  hanks   mcdermott         at time   a gun is
loaded and pointed at fred  nothing relevant happens at time    at time   the gun is fired 
if the gun is still loaded at time    then  in the absence of further information  we expect
that the shot will prove fatal and that fred will no longer be alive at time    this example
can be represented formally by the theory     ind                   where 
t pre shoot   t    alive t   loaded  t   

   

t eff shoot  t   alive t  

   

alive     loaded      occ shoot     

   

thus the preconditions for a shoot event are that the gun is loaded and the victim is alive
 axiom       and its effect  if successful  is that the victim is not alive  axiom      
for model m and time point t  let m t denote the set of all object or occurs literals
with temporal index t  t which are true in m   and let m  t    m t   m t     so m t
can be thought of as the history that is represented by m up to  and including  t  and 
at t  m  t  can be thought of as representing what is known at the present moment  as the
evidential context on which predictions about t   are based  we can also think of there
being a dynamic conjectural context at t  which consists of the set of success and inertia
assumptions which correspond to our expectations about t    assumptions are added to
the conjectural context if they are consistent with the current context  the union of the
evidential context and the current conjectural context  and the background theory  the laws
of the given event theory  
the generation of a preferred  model  m   of   should proceed as follows 
m      alive     loaded       
m     m     alive     loaded       
m     m     alive     loaded      occ shoot        
m     m     alive     loaded       
m     m     alive     loaded               
thus the only atoms which should be in m    and so in the evidential context m      are
those required by the boundary conditions of     which are stated by axiom      this
restriction of the evidential context  ockhams razor  is appropriate because prediction
should be based on all and only the available evidence  now  alive is not declared to be a
theoretical relation in     so by the notational convention  phys alive  should be true in m  
and it is consistent in the current context m      given the background theory          
to assume inert alive      so this assumption should be added to the conjectural context 
consequently alive    should be in m     by the inertia axiom  axiom       similarly
phys loaded   should be true in m   and it is consistent in the current context m     
 inert alive      to assume inert loaded       so this assumption should be added to the
conjectural context  by inertia  loaded     should be in m      and  in accordance with
    as usual  a literal is either an atom    or its negation   

   

finatural events

ockhams razor  no other atoms should be in m      by analogous reasoning beginning
with the current context m        alive    and loaded     should be in m      as should
the remaining boundary condition occ shoot       and  by ockhams razor  no other atoms
should be in m      now  in the current context m       it is consistent to assume either
succ shoot      or inert alive      however both cannot be assumed  for if they were  then
it would follow by the axioms for change      and      and inertia that both alive    and
alive    would be in m      in keeping with the principle that change is preferred to inertia 
succ shoot      should be assumed and added to the conjectural context  and so alive   
should be in m      it is consistent in the current context m     succ shoot       to assume
inert loaded       so by inertia  loaded     should be in m      and  by ockhams razor  no
further atoms should be in m      the remainder of m  should then be generated by
repeated applications of the inertia axiom and ockhams razor 
the example suggests that event theories should be interpreted chronologically  this
fits naturally with our experience of times arrow  of the asymmetry between the past
 which is fixed  and the future  which is open  which is yet to exist   in particular  our
understanding of events in terms of dependable regularities of sequence is founded on this
asymmetry  the example also suggests that at each successive time point  at each new
present moment  we should first fix the evidential context and then generate the appropriate
conjectural context  the evolving context and the background theory then produce the
expected changes and persistences  fixing the evidential context consists of minimizing it 
that is  restricting it to those object and event literals which are required by the boundary
conditions or the earlier interpretation of the theory  generating the conjectural context
consists of maximizing success and inertia assumptions  that is  assuming them when they
are suggested by the evidential context and they are consistent with the current context
and the background theory  giving priority to the former in case of conflict  the definition
of a preferred  model of an event theory should thus reflect the prioritized chronological
minimaximization involved in its intended interpretation 
we begin by defining the preference relation     in this definition  and in the subsequent
definition of     fewer and more should be understood in terms of set inclusion rather
than cardinality    in keeping with the above discussion  let an evidential atom be either
an object atom or an event atom other than a success atom  and let a conjectural atom be
either a success atom or an inertia atom 
definition    preference    let m and m  be models which differ at most on the interpretation of temporally indexed relations  then m is preferred  to m   written m   m     
iff there is a time point t such that m and m  agree before t  and at t 
   fewer evidential atoms are defined in m   and m and m  agree on the truth values of
all evidential atoms which are defined in m   or
   m and m  differ only on conjectural atoms  and more success atoms are true in m  
or
    thus if at t  v  t  m          is an atom of type t with truth value v at time t in model m    then
fewer atoms of type t have truth value v at time t in model m than do so in model m  if at t  v  t  m   
at t  v  t  m     similarly  but with  replacing   in the case for more 
    this way of writing preferences is based on the comparison of evidential contexts 

   

fibell

   m and m  differ only on inertia atoms  and more inertia atoms are true in m  
for example  suppose that m and m  are models which differ at most on temporally
indexed relations      if m and m  agree before time   and disagree then only in that
occ shoot      is undefined in m and true in m    then m is preferred  to m  by clause  
of the definition      if m and m  agree before time   and disagree then only in that
succ shoot      is true in m and false in m    then m is preferred  to m  by clause   of the
definition      if m and m  agree before time   and disagree then only in that succ shoot     
and inert alive     are true in m whereas succ shoot      and inert alive     are true
in m    then m is preferred  to m  by clause   of the definition      if m and m  agree
before time   and disagree then only in that inert alive     is true in m and false in m   
then m is preferred  to m  by clause   of the definition 
the preferred  models of an event theory  should thus be obtained by focussing on the
class of all phys maximal models of  and then selecting the    minimal models of  from
it  accordingly  the definition of the preferred  models of an event theory and the definition
of the predictions based on them are instances of the following generic definitions 
definition    preferred models  prediction  a model m is said to be a preferredi
model of an event theory  if m is a phys maximal model of  and there is no other model
m  of  which is preferred i to m  which is such that m  i m    if  is an event theory and
 is a sentence  then  predictsi   written   i   iff all preferred i models of  are also
models of  
in keeping with the discussion in the introduction  the definition of prediction is cautious 
a clearer picture of this emerges if we consider the preferredi models of a given event theory
at a more abstract level 
definition     equivalence  determinism  representative preferred model  let
 be an event theory  and let m and m  be preferred i models of   then m and m  are
said to be preferencei equivalent  written m i m    if m and m  agree on the interpretation
of all evidential and conjectural atoms    an event theory  is deterministici if it has a
single i  equivalence class  and is non deterministici otherwise  the representative member
of each i  equivalence class is called a representative preferredi model of  
each i  equivalence class of preferredi models of an event theory represents a possible
history which is defined by the theory  so deterministici theories define a single possible
history  and predictions can safely be based on it  however  non deterministici theories
define more than one possible history  and so caution dictates that their predictions should
be restricted to those sentences which are true in all of the possible histories that they
define    the representative preferredi models of an event theory provide a concrete way of
thinking about possible histories 
we can now return to the  inductive version of the  yale shooting problem 
    any two such models may differ on the interpretation of terms  or on the truth values of atoms not
considered in the definition of preferencei  
    it is possible to define a risky notion of prediction based on a single i  equivalence class c for event theory
  thus    ci  iff  is true in all models in c  this relation can be used to obtain information about a
particular possible history  but it does not serve as a basis for reliable prediction in non deterministici
theories because it does not take other  equally possible  histories into account 

   

finatural events

example   as before  let     ind                   then   is deterministic     the
evidential literals which are true in its representative preferred   model agree with those in
the set m  discussed earlier  thus   predicts   that the shoot event succeeds at time   
with the effect that fred is not alive at time   
proposition      succ shoot       alive    
proof by definition    it is sufficient to prove that the conclusion follows in all preferred  
models of     so  let m be a preferred   model of     then  by definition    phys alive 
and phys loaded   are true in m     by axiom      alive    and loaded     are both true
in m   by definition      inert alive     is true in m     so it follows by axiom     that
alive    is true in m   by similar reasoning  inert loaded      and loaded     are also
true in m  axiom      definition       as alive    is true in m   it follows by inertia
 axiom      definition      that alive    is true in m   similarly  as loaded     is true in
m   it follows by inertia that loaded     is true in m   so  by axiom      pre shoot      is
true in m   by axiom      the occurs atom occ shoot      is true in m   by definition     
succ shoot      is true in m   it follows  by axiom      that eff shoot      is true in m   and
so  by axiom      alive    is true in m  
the yale shooting problem is of interest because  as hanks and mcdermott       
show  it poses problems for theories which do not take account of times arrow  the example
suggests that reasoning about inertia should be chronological  a related example involving
reasoning about change was suggested by lifschitz        p       the point of his example
can be illustrated by adding a second shot to the yale shooting problem  let    
    occ shoot        then we expect that  as before  the first shot will succeed and that
the second shot will fail  because fred is no longer alive when the second shot occurs  
and  indeed  this is what transpires in all preferred  models of     however  if   were not
interpreted chronologically  then there would be preferred models of it in which the second
shot succeeds and the first shot fails  as the success of the second shot requires that fred is
alive at time   
the inductive version of the yale shooting problem considered here  in which the shoot
event is treated inductively rather than deductively  also illustrates the need to give priority
to change  succ assumptions  over inertia  inert assumptions  in case of conflict  without
    as m is a preferred  model of   it follows by definition   that m is a phys maximal model of     so 
if phys alive  were not true in m   then there would be a model m  of   in which phys alive  and all
of the phys atoms which are true in m were true  but then m would not be a phys maximal model of
of     contradicting the assumption that it is  an analogous argument justifies all subsequent appeals
to definition   regarding the relation phys 
    if inert alive     were not true in m   then there would be a model m  of   in which inert alive    
was true and which was therefore preferred  to m on this basis by clause   of definition   at time   
 m and m  would disagree at most on the interpretation of temporally indexed relations  m and m 
would agree on the interpretation of all temporally indexed relations at all time points before time    m
and m  would agree on the interpretation all evidential and success atoms at time    and in m  more
inertia atoms with temporal index    all of those which are true in m together with inert alive     
would be true   but then it would follow by definition   that m would not be a preferred  model of    
contradicting the assumption that it is  an analogous argument justifies all subsequent appeals to some
clause n of the definition of preferencei regarding the truth value of some atom with temporal index t 

   

fibell

this requirement there would be preferred models of   in which inert alive     is true and
succ shoot      is false  and so  contrary to expectation  fred remains alive at time   
in subsequent examples it will often be assumed that different names  whether constants
or functional expressions  denote different individuals  in order to enforce this convention 
uniqueness of names axioms  lifschitz        p      are used  let f            fn be functions
returning values of the same sort  and let x            y          be variables of the appropriate sorts 
then u  f            fn   is the conjunction of the axioms in the set 
 x            xk   y            yl fi  x            xk     fj  y            yl        i   j  n  
 x            xk   y            yk  fi  x            xk     fi  y            yk     x    y          xk   yk     
   i  n   
these axioms express the fact that the functions f            fn are injections with different
ranges  this notation is extended to constants by treating them as   ary functions  thus  for
example  given u  a  b  l   l   and u  move   it follows that the constants a  b  etc   denote
different objects  and that the functional expressions move a  l   l   and move b  l   l  
denote different events 
the next example illustrates the need to restrict the inertia axiom to physical relations 
example   block b is moved from location l  to location l   we expect that l  will be
clear as a result  this example can be represented as follows

axioms     and     define the preconditions and effects of move events  axiom     defines a
location to be clear if it is not true that there exists a block which is at that location  the use
of the truth operator in this definition allows for the fact that the at relation may be partial 
a location is considered to be clear if none of the blocks whose locations are defined are at

by definition      succ move b  l   l       is true in m   so it follows  by axioms     and
    that at b  l      and at b  l      are both true in m   as at b  l      is true in m  
it follows by axiom     that clear l      is true in m   by axiom      theo clear  is
true in m and so  by axiom      phys clear  is true in m   it follows by axiom     that
inert clear  hl i     is true in m  consequently clear l      is no longer true in m by
inertia   by definition     it follows that  for any x other than b  at x  l      is undefined
in m   so  as at b  l      is true in m   it follows that for any x  txat x  l      is
true in m   and so it follows by axiom     that clear l      is true in m  
for the second part  let m be a preferred   model of     then  as before  the atoms
at b  l       clear l       succ move b  l   l        at b  l      and at b  l     
are all true in m   however  in the absence of axiom       it follows by definition   that
phys clear  is true in m   by definition      inert clear  hl i     is true in m   so it
follows by axiom     that clear l      is true in m  
the restriction of the inertia axiom can be justified in terms of the physical theoretical
distinction as follows  the law of inertia is a law of physical inertia  its task is to represent
the persistence of those physical facts which are not changed by events  applying it to
theoretical relations  as in     results in mysterious consequences  which arise because
maintaining the inertia of a theoretical fact  clear l    introduces an additional real
change in a physical fact  a change in the at relation   moreover  as theoretical facts
supervene on physical facts  changes  persistences  in theoretical facts supervene on changes
 persistences  in physical facts  so it is sufficient to represent changes  persistences  in
physical facts  and to let changes  persistences  in theoretical facts take care of themselves 
this is done in the case of     where a change in the at relation results in a change in the
clear relation  in more complex examples  several blocks may be moved to or from a
location simultaneously  and each move event may or may not succeed  in such cases  the
axioms for change and inertia represent changes and persistences in the at relation  and
changes  persistences  in the clear relation take care of themselves once the new at facts
are fixed  once the real changes have occurred and the dust has settled   
    another  more artificial  example involves the interaction between goodmans        p  iii    predicate
grue and common sense inertia  call an object grue if it is green at time t and t is before time   or it
is blue thereafter  now suppose that object o is green at time   and that we dont know of any events
which occur at time   which affect o  then it seems natural to conclude by inertia that o is green at
time    however  as o is green at time    o is also grue at time    so it is equally reasonable to predict
that o will be grue  that is  blue  at time    the example can be represented formally by the theory
g   which consists of ind together with the following axioms 
x  t grue x  t     t      green  x  t     t     blue x  t      
x  t green x  t   blue x  t    
green o      
then there are intended preferred  models of g in which green o     is true  and unintended preferred 
models of g in which blue o     is true  this problem can be solved by declaring that grue is a
theoretical predicate  in keeping with goodmans doctrine of entrenchment and quines advocation of
similarity   and so should not be projected by the law of inertia

   primary and secondary events
the theory of inductive events provides the basis of an integrated solution to the qualification problem and the frame problem  on the intended interpretation of the success axiom 
events are  given their preconditions  normally sufficient for their effects  on the intended
interpretation of the inertia axiom  physical facts which are not affected by events persist 
however  whereas the effects of successful inductive events are certain and invariable  the
effects of natural events may be uncertain and they  or some of them at least  may vary
according to the context in which the events occur 
it may seem that context dependent effects  or ramifications  can be represented by
domain axioms  however  the following example  which is based on lifschitzs        lampcircuit example and bakers        ice cream example  shows that this approach is too
simplistic 
example   ollie is at location l   he is holding block b  and he moves to location l  
we expect that  as a result  ollie will reach l   moreover  as ollie is holding the block when
he moves  we expect that it will move with him to l  
it may seem that this example can be represented by the event theory     ind 
                      where 
x  l  l   t pre move x  l  l    t   at x  l  t  

    

x  l  l   t eff move x  l  l    t   at x  l   t

u  o  b  l   l

thus the effects of move have been simplified  the fact that the moved object is no longer
where it was is now to be inferred from axiom       which states that no object can be at two
different locations simultaneously  together with the appropriate inequality  the intention is
to use axiom      to infer that ollies movement results in the movement of block b  for 
given that ollie is holding b when he gets to l   it follows from the axiom that b is at l 
also  and so  by axioms      and       b is not at l  
however  there are two representative preferred   models of     which can be partially
described as follows 
m    at o  l       holding  o  b      at b  l        
m    at o  l       at b  l        
as change is preferred to inertia  ollie succeeds in moving to l  in both models  in m   
the fact that ollie is holding b is inert  and so it follows that the block moves with him to
l  as expected  in m    the fact that b is at l  is inert  and so  contrary to expectation  b
remains at l  
one reaction to this failure is to seek to strengthen axioms such as axiom      by making
them causally directed  so that they can be interpreted causally  positively  as in m    
   

finatural events

rather than declaratively  positively as in m    or contrapositively as in m     however it
seems to me that this response  which is discussed further in section    is mistaken because
it misdiagnoses the problem  taking it to be a logical problem rather than a representational
one 
let us consider the problem posed by the example afresh  the theory   has two
representative preferred models only one of which corresponds to our expectation  what
accounts for the asymmetry in our expectation  and how is the formal symmetry to be
broken 
the intended positive interpretation of axiom      depends on appropriate reasoning
about inertia  and in particular on the appropriate use of the inertia axiom  it is necessary
to conclude that ollie keeps hold of the block  rather than concluding that it remains at l  
but it seems odd to be using the inertia axiom when reasoning about change  to be using
the inertia axiom  together with axiom       to get a block to move without there being
an event which causes it to move  in doing so we are violating the fundamental intuition
which underlies the fact event distinction  which has it that events are the only causes of
physical change 
this consideration provides the key to the correct understanding of the problem  we
expect that the block will move when ollie does because we are told that he is holding the
block when he moves and are not told that he releases it  consequently we discount the
possibility of the block remaining at l  because an additional event would be required in
order to account for this  however the movement of the block is itself an additional event
which has the additional effect that the block is at l   the missing  symmetry breaking 
causal element in this example is thus an event  and the choice between a move event and
a release event seems clear  but note that the blocks moving differs from ollies moving 
the block moves only because ollie moves and only because he is holding it when he does
so 
in order to reflect this difference  a distinction is drawn between primary and secondary
events  primary and secondary events are inductive events of the kind that we have been
considering so far  however while primary events occur independently  secondary events
are invoked  in the non mystical computer science sense in which one program  procedure 
process          is said to invoke another  by other events  and are causally dependent on
them in the sense that a secondary event can succeed only if it is invoked invoked by a
successful event    given this distinction  ramifications can be represented by invoking
appropriate secondary events in appropriate contexts  thus  in example    ollies moving
can be represented as a primary event which  because he is holding block b when he moves 
invokes the secondary move b event  the move b event occurs because it is invoked  and
it succeeds only if the move ollie event does  note that secondary events may  in turn 
invoke other events which are causally dependent on them  for instance  if in the current
example block b  is placed on top of block b  then the invoked move b event should in turn
invoke a move b  event  there can thus be tertiary events  and events of ever higher order 

    this condition should perhaps be called success dependence or effect dependence in order to distinguish it from counterfactual dependence  lewis        ch

however  for the sake of convenience  all invoked events will be referred to as secondary
events   
invocations are represented in el by invocation atoms  an invocation atom is an event
atom of the form inv   e  e   t   which states that event e directly invokes event e at time t 
secondary events are typically invoked by invocation axioms of the form 
e  e   t  occ e  t      inv   e  e   t    
where  is a formula which distinguishes those contexts in which e invokes e   the properties
of secondary events are stated by axioms           given in table    axiom      requires that
both the invoking and the invoked events occur  axiom      represents  causal  dependence 
and states that a secondary event succeeds only if one of the events which invoked it
succeeds  the axiom is stated in this way in order to allow for cases in which a secondary
event is invoked by more than one event  axioms      and      ensure that invocation is
acyclic  this is achieved by defining the auxiliary  indirect invocation  relation inv to be
the transitive closure of the  direct invocation  relation inv   axiom       and requiring
that inv is irreflexive  axiom         
events which invoke others can be thought of in two ways  as elementary inductive
events  or as complex events which have a causal structure  the invocation graph for an
    primary and secondary events are so called by loose analogy with the philosophical distinction between
primary and secondary qualities  primary qualities  such as size  shape and motion  are the fundamental
qualities used in science  by contrast  secondary qualities are sensory qualities  such as colour  taste 
smell  felt warmth or texture  and sound  which exist only in certain contexts  to individual observers
under specific conditions  and which are causally dependent on primary qualities  similarly  tertiary
qualities are qualities which an object has in virtue of its secondary qualities  for example a flower
may be attractive to a butterfly because of its colour  or a wine may be expensive because of its taste
 blackburne        
    the axiomatization of secondary events is intended to be minimal  for example  there is no prohibition
on an event occurring as both a primary event and as a secondary event  if this were to happen  then it
would follow from axiom      that the event would have secondary status  in certain circumstances it
may be desirable to define the order of an event  and to require that each event has exactly one order 
this can be done by adding axioms such as the following 
e  t ord e  n  t     n      occ e  t   te inv   e   e  t  
  n      e  ord e   n   t   inv   e   e  t       
e  n  m  t  ord e  n  t   n   m   tord e  m  t    

   

finatural events

event e  at some time point t  is a directed acyclic graph whose initial vertex is e  whose
remaining vertices are the events invoked by e  either directly or indirectly   and whose edges
represent the direct invocation relation  event es success graph  at t  is the subgraph of
es invocation graph which consists of all those chains in the invocation graph which begin
with e and which consist entirely of successful events  the direct effects of e are its defined
 invariant  effects  the indirect effects of e are the effects of all other events in its success
subgraph  so  in particular  successful inductive events can be thought of as having all of
the effects of the successful secondary events that they invoke  either directly or indirectly  
thus  in the working example  the move ollie event has the direct effect that he moves 
and can be thought of as having the indirect context dependent effects that b and b  move
with him  note that the effects of an event may now be context dependent in two ways  an
event may invoke different events in different contexts  recall that invocation axioms may
be context dependent   and so its invocation graph may vary according to the context in
which it occurs  moreover  the same invocation graph may result in different success graphs
if the context varies in other ways  for instance  in the working example  move b  may be
invoked in two different contexts  in both of which b  is on b   and succeed in one  the
one we have been contemplating  but fail in another  say because b is also being held by
another agent  
definition    the theory of invocation  inv   consists of the axioms given in table   
thus inv                        
as invocation atoms are event atoms  the pragmatics given in the last section can be
used without change 
we can now give a formal version of an extension of the block carrying example 
example   ollie is at location l   he is holding block b   block b  is stacked on b   and
block b  is stacked on b   ollie moves to location l   we expect that the move event will
succeed and that the stack of blocks will move with him  however if  for some independent
reason  b  does not move  then we expect that b  will also remain at l  
the first part of this example can be represented by the event theory     ind  inv 
                                            where 
x  y  l  t  on x  y  t   at y  l  t    at x  l  t  


    



x  y  l  l   t  occ move x  l  l    t   holding  x  y  t

x  y  l  l   t  occ move x  l  l    t   on y  x  t

axiom      states that if object x is on object y then x is at the same location as y is  while
axioms      and      are invocation axioms representing ramifications  axiom      states
that a move x event invokes a move y event in contexts in which x is holding y  similarly 
   

fibell

axiom      states that a move x event invokes a move y event in contexts in which y is on
x 
there is a single representative preferred   model of     in which ollies movement
successfully invokes the movement of b   because ollie is holding b  when he moves   this
in turn successfully invokes the movement of b   because b  is on b  when b  moves  
and this in turn successfully invokes the movement of b   because b  is on b  when b 
moves   thus  in accordance with expectation    predicts that ollie succeeds in moving to
l  with the entire stack of blocks  note that the success of each invoked event depends on
the success of the event which invoked it  thus  for example  if   is extended such that b 
remains at l   then the extended theory predicts that b  also remains at l  
proposition      at b   l       and     at b   l           at b   l      
proof for the first part  let m be a preferred   model of     then occ move o  l   l      
and holding o  b      are true in m  axiom        so it follows  axioms            
that inv   move o  l   l    move  b   l   l       and occ move b   l   l       are true
in m   so  as on b   b      is true in m  axiom        it follows  axioms             
that inv   move b   l   l    move  b   l   l       and occ move b   l   l       are true
in m   and so  as on b   b      is true in m  axiom        it follows  axioms      
      that inv   move b   l   l    move  b   l   l       and occ move b   l   l      are
true in m   no further invocation atoms with temporal index   are defined in m  definition       so the four events move o  l   l    move b   l   l    move b   l   l   
move b   l   l    which occur at time   in m   are linked by a chain of invocations at
time   in m     moreover  the preconditions of each of the four events are true in m  axioms                          as move o  l   l   is the only primary event at time   in
m   it follows  definition      that succ move o  l   l       is true in m   moreover  as
move b   l   l   is directly invoked by a successful event at time   in m   it follows  definition      that succ move b   l   l       is true in m   similar reasoning shows that success
is propagated down the rest of the invocation chain  that  in turn  succ move b   l   l      
and hence succ move b   l   l       are true in m   so  as succ move b   l   l       is
true in m   it follows  axioms            that at b   l      is true in m  
for the second part  let m be a preferred   model of         at b   l       
then  as above  the events move o  l   l    move b   l   l    move b   l   l    and
move b   l   l   all occur at time   in m   their preconditions are all true at time   in
m   and they are all linked by a unique invocation chain at time   in m   as above  the
first two events in the chain succeed  however  as m is a model of     at b   l      is
true in m   so it follows  axioms             that at b   l      is true in m   it therefore follows  axioms     and       that succ move b   l   l       is true in m   so  as
move b   l   l   is the only event which directly invokes move b   l   l   at time   in
m   it follows that te inv   e  move b   l   l        succ e      is true in m   and
so t succ move b   l   l        e inv   e  move b   l   l        is true in m  axiom        as inv   move b   l   l    move  b   l   l       is true in m and the succ
    the unique names axiom for move in axiom      ensures that the events are distinct  in view of
axioms      and      this appeal to the unique names axiom is not strictly necessary  however  in
this and in subsequent examples involving multiple events it is simpler to add unique names axioms for
events  and then assume in the proofs that distinct event terms denote distinct events

relation is classical  axiom       it follows that succ move b   l   l       is true in m  
however  phys at  and at b   l      are true in m  axioms                   definition     so it follows by inertia  axiom      definition      that at b   l      is true in

note that with the introduction of secondary events as the missing causal elements in
this example  the inertia axiom and the domain axioms             and       are confined to
their proper tasks  namely  representing inertia  and defining or constraining the at relation
respectively 
in philosophical terms  invocations provide a means for representing contemporaneous
sufficient causation between events  thus if event e directly invokes event e at time t 
then e is a sufficient cause of e at t  the direct invocation relation  inv    thus represents
causal directedness  causal priority  between contemporaneous events  axioms      and
     respectively ensure that contemporaneous causation occurs between actual events  and
that an invoked event is efficacious only if it is invoked by an efficacious event  this account
of contemporaneous sufficient causation can be thought of in terms of regularities  however
the reasoning is now more complex  for example  we might discover that event e directly
invokes event e by noting that whenever e occurs and condition  is true e also occurs 
and that whenever this is the case e succeeds only if e does 
contemporaneous  sufficient  causation between events is naturally required to be asymmetric  axioms      and        however  it has been suggested that there are also cases of
symmetric contemporaneous causation between events  taylor        gives the example of
a locomotive and a caboose which are coupled together in such a way that the locomotive
moves iff the caboose does  an analogous example  suggested by denecker  dupre  and
belleghem         involves a pair of gears which are interlocked  so that each gear rotates
iff the other does 
as will become clear  it is better to view these as cases involving symmetric constraints
on contemporaneous events  rather than symmetric causation between them  now  clearly 
symmetric constraints cannot be represented as invocations    however  they can be represented on an individual basis by adding particular axioms  for example  the symmetric
constraint on the rotation of the gears can be represented by the following axiom 
g  g   t intl  g  g   t     occ rot  g   t   occ rot  g    t  
  succ rot  g   t   succ rot  g    t      
the first conjunct of the consequent of this axiom is required in order to ensure that the
rotations of pairs of interlocked gears co occur  without it  it would be possible for one
of the rotate events to occur and fail without the other occurring  note also that  when
introducing the problem  denecker et al         p      require that the representation of the
behaviour of the interlocked gears should not be such that they can rotate spontaneously 
this can present a problem for theories based on classical logic  because of the semantics of
    an attempt to do so in the case of the gears would be to use the following axiom 
g  g    t  occ rot  g   t   intl  g  g    t    inv   rot  g   rot  g     t    
but clearly if intl g  g    t   intl g    g  t  and occ e  t  hold  then a contradiction results by the above
axiom and axioms            and

a more general treatment of symmetric constraints on events can be given by introducing
the symmetric constraint relation scon  this relation represents the co occurrence of and
co dependence between pairs of events  accordingly we expect scon to be irreflexive 
symmetric  and to hold between pairs of co occurring events which are also co dependent 
these properties are stated by axioms           in table   
when considered in isolation  the fact that two events are symmetrically constrained
provides no compelling evidence that either is the cause of the other  for example  in the
gears case  if all we know is that g and g are interlocked and that g is rotating  then it is
reasonable to conclude that g is also rotating  but it is not reasonable to conclude that the
rotation of g is the cause of the rotation of g or vice versa  indeed  the two events may not
even be causally connected  each of the gears might be rotating because the shaft that it is
attached to is being driven 
however  if we have additional  external  information about the direction of causation 
then we can use it to infer the direction of causation between pairs of symmetrically constrained events    for example  if we know that gear g is being driven  say by rotating
the shaft that it is attached to   and we dont know that gear g is being driven  then it
is reasonable to conclude that the driving of g is causally prior to the rotation of g  and
that the rotation of g is in turn causally prior to the rotation of g   more formally  if we
have just inv   drive g   rot  g   t  and scon rot  g   rot  g    t   then it seems reasonable
    taylor makes a similar appeal to an external cause in his discussion of the locomotive caboose example 

   

finatural events

to conclude that inv   rot  g   rot  g    t   the external invocation chain is thus extended
across the symmetric constraint link  the construction of invocation chains of this kind is
defined by axioms           given in table   
axiom      states that  at time t  events e and e are in the same symmetrically constrained set iff they are symmetrically constrained or they both occur in a chain of symmetric
constrained events 
axiom      defines the conditions for an external invocation of a symmetrically constrained event  thus  at time t  event e externally invokes event e iff e invokes e and e is
in a symmetric constraint set which does not include e 
an invocation path in a symmetrically constrained set begins with an externally invoked
event and consists of a chain of events each of which symmetrically constrains its neighbour 
the length of an invocation path is determined by the number of links that it contains  so
that an invocation path consisting only of an externally invoked event has length    one
consisting of such an event and its neighbour has length    etc  accordingly  axiom     
states the conditions under which there is an invocation path of length n between events e
and e  
finally  axiom      defines invocation paths in symmetrically constrained sets  it does
so by requiring that an invocation link exist between symmetrically constrained events e
and e whenever the shortest invocation path to e in their symmetrically constrained set is
shorter than the shortest invocation path to e in that set 
definition    the theory of symmetric constraints  scon   consists of the axioms given
in table    thus scon                        
these ideas are illustrated by the following elaboration of the gears example 
example   five interlocking gears  g            g    are arranged in a row  if only g  is
driven  then this invokes the rotation of g    and  for each hgi   gi   i pair  the rotation of
gi invokes the rotation of gi     however if both g  and g  are driven  then the rotation
of each invokes the rotation of its neighbour  and  in turn  each of these rotations invokes
the rotation of g

for the sake of simplicity the preconditions and effects of drive events are the same as
those of rotate events and all objects are assumed to be gears  thus a gear can be driven
 can rotate  if it is free to do so  and the effect of its being driven  rotating  is that it has
rotated  in a direction and by a degree which are  again for simplicity  not represented  
axiom      states that the intl relation  which represents pairs of interlocked gears  is
symmetric  axiom      states that a drive g event invokes a rotate g event  and axiom     
states that if gears g and g are interlocked  then their rotation is symmetrically constrained

by axioms            and       pre drive g        is true in m   as is each pre rot  gi      
where    i     so by definition      succ drive g        is true in m   as is each
succ rot  gi       where    i    
by axiom       the set si    rot  gi        i     is a symmetric constraint set at

that einv drive g     rot  g        is true in m   moreover it follows  by definition    
and axiom       that rot  g    is the only initially invoked event in si  so it follows by
axiom      that hrot  g     rot  g   i is an influence path of length   in si  and that the
shortest influence path to g  in si is hrot  g     rot  g   i which is of length    so it follows
by axiom      that inv   rot  g     rot  g        is true in m   by analogous reasoning  the
shortest influence path to g  in si is the path hrot  g     rot  g     rot  g   i which is of

inv   rot  g     rot  g        and inv   rot  g     rot  g        are true in m   so it follows by

now let m be a preferred   model of     by reasoning analogous to that given above 
succ drive g        is true in m   as is each succ rot  gi       where    i     we also
have that si    rot  gi        i     is the only symmetric constraint set at time  
in m   however this time rot  g    and rot  g    are both initially invoked events in si 
the shortest influence path to g  in si is the path hrot  g     rot  g   i of length    and
so  as before  inv   rot  g     rot  g        is true in m   analogous reasoning shows that

hrot  g     rot  g   i is an influence path in si of length   and that the shortest influence path
to g  in si is the path hrot  g     rot  g   i of length    and so inv   rot  g     rot  g       
is true in m   moreover  the shortest influence paths to rot  g    in si are the paths
hrot  g     rot  g     rot  g   i and hrot  g     rot  g     rot  g   i  each of length    so it follows by axiom      that inv   rot  g     rot  g        and inv   rot  g     rot  g        are true
in m   thus by axiom       inv rot  g     rot  g        and inv rot  g     rot  g        are
both true in m  
secondary events can also be used to represent non deterministic effects 
non deterministic effects may arise because of uncertainty in the preconditions  suppose  for example  that the initial positions of blocks b and b  are uncertain  either b is
on b  or conversely  and that b is moved  intuitively the resulting location of b  should be
uncertain  if b  was on b  then b  should have moved to the same location as b  otherwise
b  should have remained where it was  it is easy to see how example   can be adapted
to represent this example faithfully  if b  is on b initially  then the move b event invokes
a secondary move b  event  axiom       which results in b  moving with b  otherwise
the location of b  remains unchanged  the resulting theory thus has two representative
preferred  models  one in which b  moves  and one in which b  does not move 
non deterministic effects may also arise because the outcome of the events in question
is uncertain  if successful  a non deterministic event is not regularly followed by a definite
effect  but rather by any one of a set of mutually exclusive possible effects  as in the classic
example of tossing a fair coin  in the terms used in the introduction  our expectations
regarding the outcome of such events are unclear  in order to see why secondary events are
needed to represent these  consider the following attempt to represent coin tossing 
example   suppose that a fair coin is showing heads initially and that the coin is tossed 
as the coin is fair  the result should be uncertain  the coin may show heads or it may show
tails  let     ind                     where 
t pre toss  t    heads t   tails t   

    

t eff toss  t    heads t   tails t   

    

heads     tails     occ toss    

    

then  contrary to intention    is deterministic       has a single representative preferred  
model in which the toss event succeeds and its effect heads     tails    is true  however 
as heads    is true in the model  the normal application of the inertia axiom removes the
uncertainty by determining that heads    is true 
if  as in this example  one of the alternative effects of an event preserves the status
quo  then inertia will favour that outcome and so determine the outcome of the event  the
fact that inertia intervenes in this way in the example suggests that something is missing
from the representation of the toss event  as defined  the event does not do what it is
intended to do  in succeeding it does not ensure that there are two distinct outcomes 
metaphorically speaking  it does not introduce a fork at this point in history  resulting in
two alternative futures  there seems to be a hidden causal element which accounts for our
intuitive understanding of the example but which is missing from the formalization of it 
   

fibell

i suggest that the missing component is the causal structure of the toss event  and that
this can be faithfully represented by two conflicting secondary events  that tossing the coin
invokes two conflicting deterministic events  one resulting in the coin showing heads  the
other resulting in the coin showing tails 
when formalizing this and subsequent examples involving nondeterministic events  the
following abbreviation is useful 
inv   e   e            en    t   df

inv   e  e    t          inv   e  en   t   

example   let     ind  inv                       where 
t pre tossh   t   pre toss  t    t eff tossh   t   heads t  

    

t pre tosst   t   pre toss  t    t eff tosst   t   tails t  

    

t occ toss  t   inv   toss   tossh   tosst    t  

    

u  toss  tossh   tosst  

    

then there are two representative preferred   models of     in both models  the primary
event toss succeeds and invokes the conflicting secondary events tossh and tosst   in one
of the models  tossh succeeds and tosst fails  in the other model  tosst succeeds and
tossh fails 
proposition      heads     tails           heads     and       tails    
proof for the first part  let m be a preferred   model of     then the toss event occurs
at time   in m  axiom       and its occurrence invokes the secondary tossh and tosst
events  axiom        which also occur at time   in m  axiom        the preconditions of
all three events are true at time   in m  axioms                   however  in view of their
effects  axioms                    all three events cannot succeed at time   in m   as toss
invokes the other two events  and is the only event which does so  definition       tossh
or tosst can only succeed if toss does  axiom        moreover  it is consistent to assume
that toss does succeed at time   in m   so it follows  definition      that toss does succeed
at time   in m   with the effect that heads     tails    is true in m  axioms            
for the second part it is sufficient to show that there is a preferred   model of   in which
heads    is false  so  let m be an el model in which r phys r  is true  which satisfies
axiom       and which satisfies the following conditions  the only evidential atoms which
are defined in m are those which satisfy the following set of literals 
 heads     tails      occ toss      inv   toss  tossh       occ tossh      
inv   toss  tosst       occ tosst         tails t    t       heads t    t      
thus  for example  heads    is true in m and tails    is false in m   the success atoms in
the set 
 succ toss      succ tosst      
are both true in m   and every other success atom is false in m   finally the inertia atoms
in the set 
 inert heads      inert tails      inert heads      inert tails     
   

finatural events

are all false in m   and every other inertia atom is true in m   clearly m exists  moreover 
inspection shows that m is a preferred   model of     in particular  the success of toss at
time   in m is required  on the grounds given in the proof of the first part  as is the success
of either tossh or tosst at time   in m  axioms                        definition      
in the given model  tosst succeeds at time    and the combined effect of the two successful
events is that heads    is false in m  axioms                  
the proof of the third part is similar  but with tossh  rather than tosst   succeeding
at time   in the given model 
a similar problem is posed by the russian shooting problem  sandewall         a
revolver is loaded with a single bullet and the cylinder is spun  the result should be
uncertain  as the cylinder could come to rest with the bullet in any one of six possible
positions  however in the naive representation  inertia will  once again  favour the outcome
in which the bullet returns to  and so effectively remains in  its original position  a faithful
representation of the expected outcome of the spin event can be obtained by having it invoke
six conflicting secondary spin events  with the result that the bullet is equally likely to come
to rest in any of the six possible positions 
more generally  a non deterministic event can be seen as invoking a set of conflicting
deterministic events  each resulting in one of its possible outcomes 
when there are more than two possible outcomes  the following general form of exclusive
alternation is useful 
                n  df

n
 

m 
 

 

m   i  

i  m 

n
 

j    

j m  

thus                 n is true if exactly one of the alternatives is true and the remainder are
all false  is false if all of the alternatives are false or if more than one of them is true  and
is undefined otherwise   
the techniques for representing ramifications and non deterministic events can readily
be combined to represent events with conditional effects  such as crossing the points on
a railway line  suppose that point p has entry point pe   left exit point pl  and right
exit point pr  suppose further that if p is set to left  then a train crossing p should
emerge at pl  otherwise if p is set to right  then the train should emerge at pr  then
the preconditions for crossing p can simply be that the train is at pe and that p is set to
either left or right  and the effect can be that the train is at either pl or pr  if p is set
to left when the train crosses  then this event should invoke a cross p  left event  which
has the precondition that the train is at pe and that p is set to left  and the effect that
the train is at pl  similarly  if p is set to right when the train crosses  then this event
should invoke a cross p  right event with the effect that the train emerges at pr 

   event preferences
conflicts are the reductio ad absurdum of deductionism  if two events conflict  then their
effects cannot  on pain of inconsistency  be deduced  consequently  deductionists wishing
    so  if n      then exclusive alternation is just exclusive disjunction  but if n      then the two notions
differ  for example  the exclusive disjunction            is true if         is

to represent simultaneous events are forced to police their events and to regulate their
effects  gelfond  lifschitz  and rabinov        suggest that this can be done by means of
cancellations  suppose  for example  that we have a bowl full of soup  if only one side
of the bowl is lifted  then the soup is spilt  however  if both sides of the bowl are lifted
simultaneously  then the soup is not spilt  these interactions are represented by means
of two elementary lift events  lift left side  lift right side  and their composition  lift bothsides   if either of the elementary events occurs in isolation  then it has the effect that the
soup is spilt  but if the complex event occurs  then the spill effects of its component actions
should be cancelled  with the result that the bowl is lifted and the soup is not spilt 
however cancellations are only appropriate if we ignore the possibility of failure  suppose
that in reality one of the elementary lift events fails because a hand slips  then the effects
of the other component event should not be cancelled and the soup should be spilt  but
how can a cancellation be cancelled 
conflicts do not pose the same problem for inductive events  when faced with conflicting events we do not expect that they will both succeed  some  and possibly all  of our
expectations regarding these events are uncertain  this is reflected in the formal theory 
conflicting effects give rise to conflicting success atoms  resulting in failure rather than inconsistency  however the possibility of failure raises the problem of over weak predictions
 which amusingly complements the over strong problem of deductionism   if two inductive events conflict  and there are no other interactions involving them   then each succeeds
in a preferred model in which the other fails  consequently nothing more definite than the
disjunction of their effects is predicted  this is appropriate when the events are of equal
status  indeed  it provides the basis for the representation of non deterministic events given
in the previous section  but it is not appropriate when we expect that one of the events will
succeed  suppose  for example  that stan and ollie attempt to move to the same location
simultaneously but that only one of them can succeed  suppose further that ollies success
is more likely than stans  say because he is bigger  then we normally expect that ollie will
succeed and that stan will fail  however  if there are abnormal independent circumstances
which lead us to expect that ollie will fail  then these do not lead us to expect that stan will
fail also  indeed  under the circumstances  we expect that stan will succeed  for example 
if ollie trips  then we expect that stan will succeed  although  of course  he may also trip 
etc 
asymmetric expectations of this kind can be thought of as event preferences  as preferences over the outcomes of events  thus if events e and e conflict  and we expect that
e will succeed  then the success of e is preferred to that of e   however  as the examples
show  preferences of this kind should be defeasible in order not to prejudice the success of
the non preferred event should the preferred event fail for some independent reason 
event preferences can be represented in el by preference atoms  event atoms of the
form pref e  e   t   in keeping with the above discussion  these should be interpreted as
stating that the success of event e is normally preferred to that of event e should they
conflict at time t  the temporal index accommodates the possibility that event preferences
may vary over time  as in example    below 
the only logical restriction on event preferences is that they are required to be asymmetric  axiom      in table     further conditions  such as transitivity  can  of course  be
added where appropriate

definition    the theory of event preferences is given by the axioms in table    thus

the intended interpretation of event preferences cannot be enforced by adding the axiom 
e  e   t  pref e  e   t   pre e  t   occ e  t   succ e   t    succ e  t    
adding this axiom would ensure that if e and e were to conflict  then e would succeed  and
so e would fail   however  if e were to fail for some independent reason  then the axiom
would have the undesirable effect of forcing the failure of e  
clearly  if event preferences are to be interpreted correctly  then a more flexible approach
is needed  and so it is necessary to extend the pragmatics of event theories which contain
them  in doing so the aim is to produce a consistent interpretation of the applicable event
preferences where possible  and to ignore them otherwise 
to begin with  a distinction is drawn between preferential events  the events to which
the preferences can consistently be applied  and non preferential events  all of the remaining
events under consideration  an event e is said to be supported in model m at time t if e
occurs at t and es preconditions are true in m at t  if pre e  t  and occ e  t  are both true
in m    if e is supported at some time point in a model  and the time point and model are
clear from the context  then e will simply be said to be supported  now  if the applicable
event preferences form an acyclic chain pref e  e   t   pref e   e   t           then the supported
events occurring in them can be ordered lexicographically  thus given that e  e and e are
all supported  e has order    e order    and e order    more generally  for model m and
time point t  a supported event e may  or may not  be assigned a preference rank as follows 
 e has preference rank   if there is some event e such that pref e  e   t  is true and
there is no supported event e such that pref e   e  t  is true  and
 e has preference rank n if e does not have a preference rank m   n and there is a
supported event e with preference rank n    which is directly preferred to e  which
is such that pref e   e  t  is true and there is no supported event e such that the
preferences pref e  e   t  and pref e   e   t  are both true  
let e be a supported event  at time t in model m    then e is a preferential event  at t in
m   if e has a preference rank  at t in m    otherwise e is a non preferential event  at time
t in model m   
now suppose that at time t models m and m  agree on event preferences  preferential
events  and non preferential events  then  at t

 m is better than m  on preferential events if there is some preference rank n such
that m and m  agree on the success of all events with preference rank m   n  and
more events with preference rank n succeed in m  
 m is as good as m  on preferential events if m is better than m  on preferential
events  or m and m  agree on the success of preferential events 
 m is better than m  on non preferential events if more non preferential events succeed
in m  
 m is as good as m  on non preferential events if m is better than m  on nonpreferential events  or m and m  agree on the success of non preferential events 
the definition of a preferred model can now be refined 
definition     preference    let m and m  be models which differ at most on the interpretation of temporally indexed relations  then m is preferred  to m   written m   m   
iff there is a time point t such that m and m  agree before t  and at t 
   fewer evidential atoms are defined in m   and m and m  agree on the truth values of
all evidential atoms which are defined in m   or
   m and m  differ only on conjectural atoms  and either
 a  m is better than m  on preferential events  and m is as good as m  on nonpreferential events  or
 b  m is as good as m  on preferential events  and m is better than m  on nonpreferential events  or
   m and m  differ only on inertia atoms  and more inertia atoms are true in m  
note that preference  reduces to preference  when event theories do not include event
preferences 
four examples are now given  the first illustrates the interpretation of event preferences 
example   suppose that three agents  stan  ollie  and charlie  are at locations l   l  and
l  respectively  it is assumed that at most one of the agents can be at a location at a point
in time  so if any two of them attempt to move to the same location simultaneously  then at
most one of them can succeed  if ollie and stan both attempt to move to location l  then 
as ollie is bigger  ollies success is expected  similarly  if stan and charlie both attempt
to move to l  simultaneously  then  as stan is bigger  stans success is expected  however 
charlie is much faster than ollie  so if they both attempt to move to l  simultaneously 
then charlies success is expected  now  suppose that in fact stan and ollie both attempt
to move to l  simultaneously  then  as indicated  ollies success is expected  however  if
charlie also attempts to move to l   then the result is uncertain because the preferences

event e such that pref move o  l   l    e     is true in m   and  as move c  l   l   is not
supported at time   in m   there is no supported event e such that pref e  move o  l   l      
is true in m   so move o  l   l   has preference rank   at time   in m   moreover 
move s  l   l   does not have preference rank   at time   in m   because move o  l   l  
is a supported event at time   in m and pref move o  l   l    move  s  l   l       is true
in m   so  as move o  l   l   is directly preferred to move s  l   l   at time   in m  
it follows move s  l   l   has preference rank   at time   in m   it therefore follows by

that m is a preferred   model of     in particular  the success of move s  l   l   at time  
can be justified as follows  the only three events which are supported at time   in m are
move o  l   l    move s  l   l    and move c  l   l    axioms             definition of

set given above  axioms            definition        so none of the three supported events
has preference rank   at time   in m   move o  l   l   does not because move c  l   l  
is supported and is preferred to it  move s  l   l   does not because move o  l   l   is
supported and is preferred to it  and move c  l   l   does not because move s  l   l   is
supported and is preferred to it  it follows that all three events are non preferential at time  
in m   at most one of these events can succeed at time   in m  axioms                        
and it follows by definition      b  that one of them does succeed  in m   move s  l   l  
succeeds at time    with the effect that at s  l      and consequently at o  l      are both
true in m                         
the given model also establishes the fourth part of the proposition  for the third part
a preferred   model of   can be given in which either move o  l   l   or move c  l   l  
succeeds at time   
the next example shows how event preferences and secondary events can be combined

thus axioms           define elementary lift left  liftl   lift right  liftr  and spill events 
axiom      states that if the soup is not spilt  then the occurrence of either elementary lift
event invokes a spill event  axioms           define the complex lift both event  lift   and
axiom      states that the success of a lift both event is normally preferred to that of a spill
event 
let     ind  inv  pref                        then   has a single representative
preferred   model in which the lift event succeeds and the spill event fails  with the result
that the soup is not spilt  thus the success of the lift event implicitly cancels the  secondary 
spilt effect of its component liftl and liftr events  moreover  the extended theory   
 succ lift      has two representative preferred   models  in one liftl succeeds  and liftr
fails   in the other liftr succeeds  and liftl fails   so in both spill succeeds with the effect
that the soup is spilt  the implicit cancellation of the spilt effect is thus itself implicitly

with temporal index   which is true in m  axiom       definition        consequently  at
time   in m   lift and spill have preference ranks   and   respectively  and liftl and liftr
are non preferential  the success of lift implies the success of its component events  axioms                         so  definition      a   lift succeeds  and spill fails  at time  
in m   and so  as phys spilt   and spilt     are true in m  axiom       definition     it
follows by inertia  axiom      definition       that spilt    is true in m  
for the second part  let m be a preferred   model of     succ lift       then  as

the next example shows how event preferences and secondary events can be used to
represent changing expectations regarding the outcome of non deterministic events 
example    a race between a fast horse and a strong horse will be run the day after
tomorrow  the course is currently dry  given that this remains the case  the fast horse
is expected to win  however if it were to rain tomorrow  then the strong horse would be
expected to win 
this example can be represented by the theory      ind  inv  pref

thus axiom      states that the outcome of a successful race between the two horses
 racefs   results in either the fast horse winning  winnerf   or the strong horse winning
 winners    the causal structure of the racefs event  the fact that it involves the competition between two horses  is represented by its invocation of the conflicting winf and wins

proposition       winnerf      and      occ rain         winners     
proof for the first part  let m be a preferred   model of      then phys dry  and dry

 definition      b   that racefs succeeds at time   in m   the success of exactly one of the

as dry    is true in m it follows  axiom       that pref winf   wins      is true in m  
moreover this is the only preference atom with temporal index   which is true in m  definition        so  as winf and wins are both supported at time   in m   it follows that
winf has preference rank   and wins has preference rank   at time   in m   consequently
 definition      a   winf succeeds in m at time    with the effect that winnerf     is true

more generally  event preferences can be combined with secondary events in order to
give a qualitative representation of conditional probabilities  a probability judgment of
the form p  succ e  t  succ e   t     n states that the probability of event e succeeding at
time t  given that event e does  is n  judgments of this kind can be represented in el by
event atoms of the form prob e  e   n  t   conditional probabilities can then be translated
into event preferences by means of the following axiom 
e  e   e   n  m  t  prob e  e   n  t   prob e   e   m  t   n   m   pref e  e   t  

    

together with the appropriate invocations  the use of this technique is illustrated by the
final example  which is a probabilistic extension of an example attributed to reiter  shanahan        p       
example    a chessman is placed haphazardly on a chessboard  it may end up on  within 
a single square  but it is more likely that it will overlap four squares  and more likely still
that it will overlap just two squares  this situation can be represented by the theory     
ind  inv  pref                              where 
t pre place  t   occ place  t  

    

t eff place  t    one t    two t    four  t

 prob place    place       t  
u  place  place    place    place     occ place    

    
    

thus axiom      states the three mutually exclusive outcomes of placing the chessman 
axiom      states that an occurrence of the place event invokes the three conflicting secondary events  place    place    and place    axiom      associates a conditional probability
judgment with each of them  and axiom      translates these judgments into qualitative
event preferences 
proposition       two    
proof let m be a preferred   model of      then the place event occurs and invokes
the three secondary events place    place    and place  at time   in m  axioms      
       all four events are supported at time   in m  axioms                            
but  in view of their effects they cannot all succeed at time   in m  axioms           
            now the preference atoms pref place    place        pref place    place        and
pref place    place       are all true in m  axioms             and these are the only preference atoms with temporal index   which are defined in m  definition        consequently 
at time   in m   the three events place    place    and place  have preference ranks

it does  axiom        so it follows that place succeeds at time   in m  definition      b   
the success of place  at time   is consistent with the success of place  axioms           
       consequently  given its preference rank  place  succeeds at time   in m  definition      a    with the effect that two    is true in m  axioms            

   philosophical justification
in this section the justification of formal theories of prediction is discussed and a justification
of the theory of events is given 
goodman        iii    discusses the related problem of the justification of formal theories of enumerative induction  and suggests that we start by considering how we justify
a deductive inference  clearly we can do so by showing that it conforms to a set of valid
general rules of deduction    but then the question arises as to how we justify the rules
themselves  to suggest that we do so by appealing to some more fundamental underlying
rules simply postpones the question and so invites a regress    but if we cannot give a
foundational justification of deduction  then how can we proceed  goodman suggests that
we can do so by showing that the rules for deduction conform with particular deductive
inferences which we actually make and sanction  this is circular  but virtuously so  the
point is that rules and particular inferences alike are justified by being brought into agreement with one another  a rule is amended if it yields an inference we are unwilling to
accept  an inference is rejected if it violates a rule we are unwilling to amend  the process of justification is the delicate one of making mutual adjustments between rules and
accepted inferences  and in the agreement achieved lies the only justification needed for either  p       note however that there is no general consensus as to what counts as a valid
deductive argument  classical logicians accept the inference from  to  as valid  intuitionists do not  similarly  intuitionists accept the inference from  to    as valid  but
relevantists do not  these differences can be explained by the fact that those concerned are
attempting to formalize different notions of validity  as there tends to be agreement among
those who agree on a given intuitive notion of deduction    this suggests that a justification
of a given form of deductive inference will be partly philosophical and partly empirical  as
it will consist of an analysis of the concept of deductive validity and the consideration of
examples of deductive inference 
similarly then  in order to justify a formal theory of prediction  we should seek to
show  by means of a combination of conceptual analysis and empirical evidence  that its
predictions agree with those which we actually make and consider to be reasonable  in the
case of a logico pragmatic theory this amounts to arguing that its pragmatics is appropriate 
    or  equally  that it conforms to a notion of entailment defined in terms of a given formal semantics  such
as the tarski semantics for classical predicate logic 
    given a formal semantics and accompanying notion of entailment  we can justify a set of rules by proving
that they are both sound and complete relative to the semantics  but then again the question arises as
to how the semantics and notion of entailment are justified 
    for example  a valid argument is one in which  if you accept the premises  then you must  on pain of
inconsistency  accept the conclusion  a valid argument is one which admits of a constructive proof of the
conclusion given the premises  a valid argument is one in which the premises are all required in order to
establish the conclusion

let  be a logico pragmatic theory of prediction  then an extension of  is any theory
 which includes  and which satisfies certain stated restrictions  for instance  we might
require that  is a semantic extension of   meaning that the additional axioms in  are
intended to be interpreted semantically  rather than pragmatically   thus  for example   
is a semantic extension of inv   we can tentatively define the intended models of a given
extension  of  to be those models of  which accord with our expectations given     
we can then say that a pragmatics is pragmatically sound for a class of extensions of 
if  for every extension  in the class  the pragmatics selects all of the intended models
of    and that the pragmatics is pragmatically complete for a class of extensions of  if 
for every extension  in the class  the pragmatics selects only the intended models of   
thus pragmatic soundness ensures that the theory produces only those predictions which
we would consider to be reasonable  and pragmatic completeness ensures that the theory
produces all such predictions 
in the case of event theories it seems to be appropriate to concentrate on the pragmatic soundness and completeness of preference  for semantic extensions of ind   for  given
that preference  does have these properties  the pragmatic soundness and completeness of
preference  for extensions of ind which include event preferences but are otherwise semantic seems to be uncontentious 
in order to argue for the pragmatic soundness of preference  we have to show that the
restrictions that it imposes are all necessary  now the intuitive notion of prediction that
event theories endeavour to formalize is that of a context dependent activity  prediction
takes place at a point in time  the present  the past is considered to be fixed and the future
is considered to be open  moreover prediction should be based on all and only the available
evidence  it then consists of making regularity based speculations about change given the
context  and then  quietly  assuming that facts which are not affected by the changes
will persist  these properties are captured by the restrictions imposed by preference   
location in time and the idea of a closed past and open future are captured by preferring
models of an event theory in which it is interpreted chronologically  the restriction of
the evidential context and subsequent preference for change over inertia is captured by
prioritorized minimaximization at the present time point  first restricting the evidential
context to that required by the earlier interpretation of the theory  then assuming whenever
possible that events succeed  and finally assuming wherever possible that facts persist 
finally  the physical theoretical distinction is necessary when a theory contains both kinds
of relations  as inertia is a property of the physical world and so should be restricted to
physical relations  the need for doing so is illustrated by example   
the need to maximize inertia assumptions chronologically when attempting to represent
inductive reasoning about inertia was already clear to hanks and mcdermott        in their
discussion of the yale shooting problem  moreover  the inductive extension of this example
 in which the events are inductive rather than deductive   given as example    illustrates the
need to prefer change to inertia at any given time point  however  it might be objected that
it is not clear that earlier events should succeed in favour of later ones  that is  that success
    the question of what counts as an intended model of a theory can be a vexed one  see  for example  the
discussions by sandewall        pp         and collins  hall  and paul        pp          however  in
the following discussion  it is sufficient to focus on cases where there is general agreement on expected
outcomes

assumptions should be made chronologically  but if we consider the extension of example  
in which a second  later  shot occurs  as in the discussion of   following the example  
then it seems clear that we expect that the first shot will prove fatal  with the consequence
that the second shot fails because fred is already dead when it occurs  although  of course 
if the first shot were to fail for some independent reason  then we would expect the second
shot to succeed  when predicting that the first shot will succeed we do not consider that
its success may be jeopardized by a later shot  to allow later events to influence earlier
events in this way would be to allow a mysterious form of backwards causation 
a long standing objection to the chronological assumption of inertia is that this does
not fit with the generation of explanations  the standard example of this is kautzs       
stolen car problem  where a car is parked  left unattended  and discovered to be stolen at
some later point in time  it has since become part of the folklore that the chronological
assumption of inertia is pragmatically unsound because it results in the conclusion that
the car was stolen just before this was discovered  when  intuitively  it seems reasonable to
conclude that the car could have been stolen at any earlier point at which it was unattended 
in consequence  proponents of the chronological maximization of inertia have been prompted
to qualify its application  for example  sandewall        suggests that certain occluded
relations should be exempt from the law of inertia  at least for certain intervals of time   
however it seems to me that there is a better response  namely to argue that examples
involving explanation are irrelevant when considering the pragmatic soundness of a theory
of prediction because prediction and explanation are different forms of reasoning  bell 
        
another long standing objection to the chronological assumption of inertia involves nondeterminism  thus it is claimed  as illustrated by example    that the chronological minimization of inertia can determine the outcome of non deterministic events  thereby eliminating intended models  however  rather than seek to weaken the preference criterion  i suggest
that we should take care to represent the causal structure of non deterministic events  the
fact that they introduce branching histories  correctly  as illustrated by example   
on the basis of these considerations it seems reasonable to conjecture that preference 
is pragmatically sound 
    this idea is different from the physical theoretical distinction  to say that a fact is occluded at a point
in time is  indeed  to say that it is not subject to the law of inertia at that point in time  however  the
occluded fact could naturally be classified as a physical one  such as those represented by the at relation
in example   
    prediction is a form of inductive reasoning  given an epistemic context  the task is to produce reasonable conclusions on the basis of it  by contrast  explanation is a form of abductive reasoning  given a
conclusion and an epistemic context which does not imply it  the task is to generate appropriate explanations of the conclusion  doing so when reasoning about events and their effects involves extending the
epistemic context in appropriate ways  so that the conclusion can be induced  predicted  from each of
the extensions  in order to ensure that an explanation is appropriate it is reasonable to require that an
extension should be such that some event therein causes the conclusion  consequently i suggest  bell 
      causal counterfactuals  that explanations are best dealt with counterfactually in the more comprehensive setting provided by the theory of causation sketched in footnote    on this view  an event
occurrence  together with conditions  explain  at a world w iff  causes  at all closest    worlds
to w  thus  in the case of the stolen car problem  the occurrence of an additional steal event at any
time point in the interval during which the car is unattended is a cause of  and so explains  the absence
of the car at the next time point

in order to argue for the pragmatic completeness of preference  we have to show that
the restrictions that it imposes are sufficient  examples involving ramifications  such as
lifschitzs        lamp circuit and bakers        ice cream eating pedestrian appear to
show otherwise  the point of these examples is illustrated by example   where unintended
models are selected by the pragmatics  however  i suggest that the problem lies not with
the definition of preference  but with the fact that we need to represent the causal nature
of ramifications  as arising from events which are contemporaneously caused  ultimately 
by primary events  correctly  as illustrated by example     
in the absence of counterexamples it seems reasonable to conjecture that preference  is
pragmatically complete  although  of course  it is always possible that some new example
will show that preference  is too liberal  if so  then this will not be disastrous for the
theory proposed here  on analysis  the example will reveal some further property of prediction which is not captured by preference    and preference  can be refined accordingly  in
goodmans terms  this would simply be part of the delicate process of bringing theory and
practice into agreement   
rather than seeking for justifications of this kind  sandewall        proposes a radically
different methodology  he begins by suggesting a series of ontological characteristics of
instances of predictive reasoning  these include context free inertia  i   alternative results
 a   ramification  d   concurrency  c   surprises  s   and normality  n   examples of
reasoning which include several of these characteristics can be classified as belonging to
the corresponding family  for example  the inductive version of the yale shooting problem
 example   above  belongs to the family in  as it involves reasoning about inertia and about
the normal outcome of the shoot event  sandewall then proposes a formal pragmatics  the
trajectory semantics  which defines the class of intended models for any given example of the
family iad  and uses this to prove the correctness of  to provide validations for  various
formal pragmatics for theories expressed in appropriate formal languages  for example  a
simple form of chronological minimization called pcm is proved to be valid for the family
iad  by showing that  for any given example of the iad family  pcm selects exactly the
same models as the trajectory semantics does  thus the range of applicability of pcm is
established  that is  pcm is proved to be applicable for all instances of prediction which
have the characteristics of the iad family 
    the discussion of the gears example  culminating in example    shows that the theory of events is not
restricted by the presence of symmetric constraints  but rather that it can be used to represent our
reasoning about the direction of causation among symmetrically constrained events 
    a sceptical reader might object that all i have done is to show that the theory works for a few toy
examples  however  this is to overlook the care taken to represent prediction accurately  and to misunderstand the motivation behind the choice of examples  the examples referred to in the justification
given above were not chosen because they are easily represented  but because they are well know benchmark examples which are specifically designed to probe for weaknesses  in goodmans        p      terms 
they represent clinically pure cases that       display to best advantage the symptoms of a widespread and
destructive malady  so the fact that a theory represents them correctly provides significant empirical
evidence in its favour  if the representations are also intuitively convincing  then they provide significant
evidence in favour of the conceptual basis of the theory 
a related objection is that the theory has only been shown to work for small scale examples  and
there is no guarantee that it will scale up easily to larger examples  but i know of no inherent
limitations of scale  in particular  the definitions of events  their preconditions and effects  can be
extended in a modular way  and the fact that events are inductive  rather than deductive  means that a
given theory can be extended such that additional events occur without fear of contradiction 

   

fibell

however this methodology is limited in two ways 
firstly  there is the question of how the trajectory semantics itself is justified  it provides
a formal definition of the intended models of any given example  of the iad family   but
how can we be sure that the models that it selects for any given example correspond to the
ones that we would select  it is not sufficient to simply stipulate that this is the case  it
is possible to justify a formal pragmatics by proving it to be equivalent to another  as in
the case of pcm and trajectory semantics   however at some point a formal pragmatics has
to be squared with our intuitions by means of an argument of the kind employed above 
thus the best that we can hope for is a thesis relating a formal theory of prediction and
our intuitive notion of it    as kripke once remarked  there is no mathematical substitute
for philosophy 
secondly  as the trajectory semantics is restricted to the iad family  essentially to
strips events   it would need to be extended to the iadcsn family before it could be
applied to event theories 
nevertheless  it would be worthwhile to attempt to undertake a mathematical assessment of event theories relative to some other formal theory  such as the above extension of
trajectory semantics  if possible  mathematical investigations of this kind provide an additional means of justifying formal theories  if the attempt to prove an equivalence between
two theories fails  then this will typically highlight inadequacies in one or both of them 
and so will suggest that the intuitions behind them need to be refined  alternatively  if
it is possible to prove that the theories are equivalent  then this would provide mutuallysupporting evidence for the robustness of the intuitions underlying each of them  as it would
suggest that  despite appearances to the contrary  the two formal theories capture the same
properties of our intuitive notion of predictive causal reasoning    there is no philosophical
substitute for mathematics 

   related work
the theory of natural events presented in this paper has been developed over many years 
and earlier versions of parts of it have appeared elsewhere  these earlier fragments have
been revised and combined here into a unified whole 
an earlier version of the theory of inductive events  section    was suggested in previous research  bell         and its model building implementation was discussed by white 
bell  and hodges         the theory has its intellectual origins in the work of mccarthy
              who suggested that circumscription could be used to approach the qualification problem and the frame problem  this proposal was developed by shoham        
who introduced the notion of chronological minimization in a classical  temporal  modal
language  shohams theory offers the promise of a simple and intuitive approach to the two
problems  however  his theory is limited in many ways  in particular  it is propositional
and has no fact event distinction  so it is not possible to state general axioms for change and
    similarly  the chuch turing thesis is a thesis  rather than a theorem  as it claims an equivalence between
an informal intuitive notion  effective computability  and a formal theory of computability  recursive
functions  turing machines  
    just as the equivalence results between the rival formalizations of effective computability  recursive
functions  turing machines  etc   provide mutually supportive evidence of the soundness of the intuitions
which underlie each of them 

   

finatural events

inertia in it  also  shoham requires that his theories meet a number of syntactic restrictions  including the restriction that no two causal rules conflict  see his definition         
his reason for doing so is to ensure that his theories are deterministic  so that the process
of chronological minimization interprets them correctly  but this makes it impossible to
express problems involving both  inductive  change and inertia  such as the inductive version of the yale shooting problem  discussed in section   above  in his theory  lifting the
restriction would allow the problem to be expressed  but the chronological minimization
of the theory would have the counter intuitive result that fred remained alive after the
shooting in one class of models  and died in another  in short  chronological minimization
is too simple  the theory of inductive events can thus be thought of as a generalization and
refinement of shohams theory which fulfills its promise 
the first general common sense theory of change and inertia was proposed by lifschitz
        the axioms that he defines  in the situation calculus  are substantially different
from those of the theory of inductive events  however an important similarity is his restriction of his inertia axiom  on the basis of a distinction between primitive and defined
fluents  the situation calculus counterparts of object relations   he later  lifschitz       
p       says that this distinction should be regarded as a technical trick  and suggests an
alternative  more principled  distinction based on frames  mccarthy   hayes         however it seems that his primitive defined distinction can be justified by identifying it with
the physical theoretical distinction introduced in section     
secondary events  section    were suggested in previous research  bell              
their use in the representation of ramifications should be compared with thielschers       
treatment  thielscher views the problem of ramifications as a logical one  which arises  as
discussed in section    because of the lack of causal directedness in material conditionals 
his solution starts with a deductive strips like representation of events  the ramifications
of an event are then brought about by applying a series of causal constraints until a stable
state is reached  causal constraints can be thought of as directed conditionals between two
single effects  stating the circumstances under which the first causes the second  thus  the
problem posed by example   is solved by having ollie at l  as a direct effect of moving from
l  to l   and having the fact that he is at l  and is holding the block cause the additional
effect of its being at l  also  while this may have the same effect as the invocation of
secondary events in some cases  the two approaches are radically different  thielschers
causal constraints are deductive in nature  so  once begun  their application runs to its
conclusion without possible interruption  there is thus no possibility of representing failure
at any stage of the indirect effect propagation process  so  as it stands  his solution is limited
to deterministic deductive events  which either occur in isolation or which do not  directly
or indirectly  conflict with each other  sandewalls        causal propagation semantics is
similar to thielschers approach and suffers from the same limitations  by contrast  on my
approach  success is propagated along an invocation chain  producing the associated effects 
but at some point an event may fail  in which case the propagation terminates  as illustrated
    readers familiar with goodmans        ch     paradox will know that the logical complexity of predicates is relative to a choice of language  but here  like quine  footnote      we can appeal to ordinary
language and its scientific refinements  and refrain from venturing into the fly bottle   wittgenstein 
           what is your aim in philosophy to shew the fly the way out of the fly bottle  

   

fibell

by example   above  this representation of ramifications can thus be freely combined with
non deterministic events and with conflicting events 
several formal theories of events employ a primitive causation relation  notable examples
are the a language family originating with gelfond and lifschitz        and lins       
extension of  toronto  situation calculus  lin   reiter         the appearance of an
unanalyzed causation relation in a formal theory of events seems to beg the question  as
an appeal is made to a more complex notion  causation  in order to give an analysis of a
simpler one  change   however  rather than view the causation relation as an appeal to
full blown causation  see footnote     it is better to view it as a means of encoding detailed
causal knowledge  in lins theory the ternary relation caused  p  v  s  is true if the fluent p
is caused  by something unspecified  to have the truth value v in the situation s  p        
in keeping with this interpretation  two axioms are given 
caused  p  true  s   holds p  s   
caused  p  f alse  s   holds p  s   
thus if fluent p is caused to have the value true  false  in situation s  then p holds  does
not hold  in situation s  by way of illustration  lin discusses the example of a spring
loaded suitcase  if both of its locks are up  the suitcase opens  initially the suitcase is
closed  one lock is up  the other is down  and the down lock is flipped  naturally we expect
that the suitcase will open as a result  however  attempts to formalize this example using
an ordinary domain axiom and inertia fail  as in the lamp circuit example  the other lock
remains up in the intended models  but there are also unintended models in which the
suitcase remains closed and the other lock changes position as a result  consequently lin
proposes a causal domain axiom 
up l   s   up l   s   caused  open  true  s   

    

which states that if locks l  and l  are both up in situation s  then the suitcase is caused
to be open in s  the intention is that axioms such as this are interpreted causally
 positively   and this effect is achieved by circumscribing the caused relation and by adding
an inertia axiom which states that fluents which are not caused to change persist  thus
according to lins account  ramifications arise as a result of causally directed domain axioms
such as       in which facts cause other facts to change  indeed  lin  p        says of     
that 
 t he physical spring loaded mechanism behind the causal rule has been abstracted away  for all we care  it may just as well be that the device is not
made of spring  but of bombs that will blow open the suitcase each time the two
locks are in the up position  it then seems natural to say that the fluent open
is caused to be true by the fact that the two locks are both in the up position 
however this seems odd from a common sense point of view  which has it that events
cause change and that facts are otherwise inert  moreover  as the actual cause has been
abstracted away  it is difficult to see how lins account could be extended in order to include
the treatment of qualifications  for example  the suitcase may fail to open when both locks
are up because the mechanism is rusty  someone is sitting on the suitcase  etc  by contrast 
   

finatural events

it is obvious how to represent the problem using primary and secondary events  in a context
in which one lock is up and the other is down  flipping the down lock invokes a secondary
event which  if it succeeds  has the additional effect that the suitcase is open  moreover 
as noted above  the introduction of secondary events makes it possible to represent more
complex examples of ramifications  such as those of example   
secondary events should also be compared with the natural actions proposed by reiter
        lin         and pinto         in addition to actions initiated by agents  they suggest
that there are also natural actions which arise due to the nature of the world  the laws
of nature  etc    and which are guaranteed to succeed  their use is illustrated by pintos
treatment of lifschitzs        lamp circuit example  if the switches in a circuit are in the
same position  both up or both down  then the lamp is on  otherwise it is off  initially the
switches are in opposite positions and one of them is flipped  clearly we expect the lamp to
be on as a result  however attempts to formalize this example using domain axioms with an
inertia axiom fail  in the intended models the other switch retains its position by inertia and
so the lamp comes on as a result of the flip event  however there are also unintended models
in which the lamp remains off by inertia and consequently the other switch mysteriously
changes position as a result  this problem is essentially the same as that posed by example   
in pintos treatment of the problem  the agent flipping a switch results in the natural action
of current flowing in the circuit  and this in turn results in the lamp being on  the natural
action of the current flowing resolves the conflict between alternative uses of the inertia
axiom by bringing about an intermediary state in which both switches are up  as the flowing
current does not affect their position  and in which the inertia axiom can only be applied in
the intended way  as the flowing current is guaranteed to have the effect that the lamp is on  
as this proposal aims to solve the causal directedness problem by introducing additional
events it can  perhaps  be seen as lying somewhere between thielschers logical approach
and my representational approach  unlike natural events  natural actions are deductive 
so it is difficult to see how natural actions could be used to represent qualifications  for
example  the natural action of the current flowing is guaranteed to succeed  turning the
lamp on   but in reality the current might not flow if the wire loses its conductivity  is cut 
etc  but clearly this complication can be represented using natural events  in a context
in which the switches are in opposite positions  flipping a switch invokes a secondary event
which  if it succeeds  results in the lamp being on  the lamps coming on is thus a defeasible
secondary effect of flipping the switch  moreover  while natural actions are independent
of the actions of agents  secondary events are causally dependent on  at least one of  the
events which invoke them 
event preferences  section    were introduced in previous research  bell        simultaneous events   the presentation has been substantially improved  and  as the examples
show  the combination of event preferences and secondary events provides interesting new
possibilities 
recently vo and foo        have suggested an inductive theory of reasoning about action
which  they suggest  provides the basis for a unified solution to the frame  qualification  and
ramification problems  their theory is based on the theory of argumentation developed by
bondarenko  dung  kowalski  and toni         and so it differs radically from mine in terms
of its technical realization  at the conceptual level there are interesting similarities  like
me  vo and foo suggest that event occurrences should be minimized and that the inertia of
   

fibell

fluents  their counterpart of object relations  should be maximized  p        furthermore 
in order to integrate their solution to the frame and qualification problems  they  in effect
 p        adopt the principle that change is preferred to inertia  bell         however  in
their theory there is no suggestion that the minimization and maximization should be done
chronologically  indeed  they suggest that not doing so is a strength of their approach as
it enables them to provide explanations by reasoning backwards  or antichronologically 
in examples such as the stolen car problem  however  as reasoning chronologically is an
essential feature of predictive reasoning  i suspect that this will prove to be a problem for
vo and foos theory  instead i suggest  footnote     that explanations should be treated
as counterfactual causes 

   conclusion
i began by arguing that deductionism is a logical mistake  and have made a case for inductionism  this began with the basic theory of inductive events  which provides the basis
for an integrated solution to the qualification and frame problems  i then introduced the
distinction between primary and secondary events in order to represent the causal structure
of natural events  thereby providing the basis for a solution to the ramification problem
and to the problem of representing non determinism  finally  i introduced event preferences  which can be used to express defeasible preferences over the outcomes of conflicting
simultaneous events  the development of the theory illustrates the benefit of starting off
on the right foot  with inductive  rather than deductive  events  the basic theory is simple
and intuitive  and its extensions require no more than the addition of a few axioms and the
refinement of one clause of the formal pragmatics 
in simple cases there may be little to choose between deductive and inductive theories of events  as both can produce predictions which are wrong  however the inductive
representation of natural events is more accurate because it reflects their defeasibility  the
representation of inductive events makes it possible to define primary and secondary events 
and defeasible event preferences  these in turn make it possible to give accurate representations of ramifications  non determinism  and conflicting events  and this in turn makes it
possible to represent complex cases accurately  for instance  in example    if any two of the
stooges attempt to move to a location  then one is expected to succeed  however if all three
do  then none succeeds  as always with inductive events  the example can be elaborated 
thus if two stooges attempt the move and the preferred one fails for some independent
reason  he slips  say   then the other stooge normally succeeds  unless he also slips   or in
the case where all three attempt the move  if ollie slips  then stan is expected to succeed 
but if he also slips  then charlie is expected to succeed  but may also slip  moreover  the
example can readily be combined with others  for example  each stooge could carry a stack
of blocks  where each block moves only if the block beneath it  or the stooge holding it 
moves  i know of no other theory of events which can represent reasoning of this subtlety
and complexity 
in future work  the model building implementation of event theories will be investigated 
the general idea was outlined in previous research  bell         and white et al        
describe the implementation of  an earlier version of  the theory of inductive events  essentially the idea is to build finite initial parts of the representative preferred models of a given
   

finatural events

event theory chronologically  as suggested by the informal discussion of the yale shooting
problem in section   
as suggested in the introduction  and in footnote     the theory of natural events forms
part of a larger theory of causation  bell                     event theories are used to
represent detailed  regularity based  causal knowledge about events  expressed in the form
of preconditions and effects  invocations  and event preferences  this is used as the basis of
a general definition of sufficient causation  which is combined with a refinement of lewiss
       ch      counterfactual dependence condition to give the definition of causation
