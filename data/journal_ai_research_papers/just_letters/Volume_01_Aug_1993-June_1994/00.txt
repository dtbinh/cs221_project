abstract

market price systems constitute a well understood class of mechanisms that under
certain conditions provide effective decentralization of decision making with minimal communication overhead  in a market oriented programming approach to distributed problem
solving  we derive the activities and resource allocations for a set of computational agents
by computing the competitive equilibrium of an artificial economy  walras provides basic
constructs for defining computational market structures  and protocols for deriving their
corresponding price equilibria  in a particular realization of this approach for a form of
multicommodity ow problem  we see that careful construction of the decision process according to economic principles can lead to ecient distributed resource allocation  and that
the behavior of the system can be meaningfully analyzed in economic terms 

   distributed planning and economics
in a distributed or multiagent planning system  the plan for the system as a whole is a composite of plans produced by its constituent agents  these plans may interact significantly in
both the resources required by each of the agents  activities  preconditions  and the products resulting from these activities  postconditions   despite these interactions  it is often
advantageous or necessary to distribute the planning process because agents are separated
geographically  have different information  possess distinct capabilities or authority  or have
been designed and implemented separately  in any case  because each agent has limited
competence and awareness of the decisions produced by others  some sort of coordination is
required to maximize the performance of the overall system  however  allocating resources
via central control or extensive communication is deemed infeasible  as it violates whatever
constraints dictated distribution of the planning task in the first place 
the task facing the designer of a distributed planning system is to define a computationally ecient coordination mechanism and its realization for a collection of agents  the
agent configuration may be given  or may itself be a design parameter  by the term agent 
i refer to a module that acts within the mechanism according to its own knowledge and
interests  the capabilities of the agents and their organization in an overall decision making
structure determine the behavior of the system as a whole  because it concerns the collective behavior of self interested decision makers  the design of this decentralized structure is
fundamentally an exercise in economics or incentive engineering  the problem of developing
architectures for distributed planning fits within the framework of mechanism design  hurwicz        reiter         and many ideas and results from economics are directly applicable 
in particular  the class of mechanisms based on price systems and competition has been
deeply investigated by economists  who have characterized the conditions for its eciency

and compatibility with other features of the economy  when applicable  the competitive
mechanism achieves coordination with minimal communication requirements  in a precise
sense related to the dimensionality of messages transmitted among agents  reiter         
the theory of general equilibrium  hildenbrand   kirman        provides the foundation for a general approach to the construction of distributed planning systems based on
price mechanisms  in this approach  we regard the constituent planning agents as consumers
and producers in an artificial economy  and define their individual activities in terms of production and consumption of commodities  interactions among agents are cast as exchanges 
the terms of which are mediated by the underlying economic mechanism  or protocol  by
specifying the universe of commodities  the configuration of agents  and the interaction
protocol  we can achieve a variety of interesting and often effective decentralized behaviors 
furthermore  we can apply economic theory to the analysis of alternative architectures  and
thus exploit a wealth of existing knowledge in the design of distributed planners 
i use the phrase market oriented programming to refer to the general approach of deriving solutions to distributed resource allocation problems by computing the competitive
equilibrium of an artificial economy   in the following  i describe this general approach
and a primitive programming environment supporting the specification of computational
markets and derivation of equilibrium prices  an example problem in distributed transportation planning demonstrates the feasibility of decentralizing a problem with nontrivial
interactions  and the applicability of economic principles to distributed problem solving 

   walras  a market oriented programming environment
to explore the use of market mechanisms for the coordination of distributed planning modules  i have developed a prototype environment for specifying and simulating computational
markets  the system is called walras  after the   th century french economist leon walras  who was the first to envision a system of interconnected markets in price equilibrium 
walras provides basic mechanisms implementing various sorts of agents  auctions  and
bidding protocols  to specify a computational economy  one defines a set of goods and
instantiates a collection of agents that produce or consume those goods  depending on the
context  some of the goods or agents may be fixed exogenously  for example  they could correspond to real world goods or agents participating in the planning process  others might
be completely artificial ones invented by the designer to decentralize the problem solving
process in a particular way  given a market configuration  walras then runs these agents
to determine an equilibrium allocation of goods and activities  this distribution of goods
and activities constitutes the market solution to the planning problem 
   the name was inspired by shoham s use of agent oriented programming to refer to a specialization of
object oriented programming where the entities are described in terms of agent concepts and interact
via speech acts  shoham         market oriented programming is an analogous specialization  where the
entities are economic agents that interact according to market concepts of production and exchange  the
phrase has also been invoked by lavoie  baetjer  and tulloh        to refer to real markets in software
components

    general equilibrium

the walras framework is patterned directly after general equilibrium theory  a brief exposition  glossing over many fine points  follows  for elaboration see any text on microeconomic
theory  e g    varian         
we start with k goods and n agents  agents fall in two general classes  consumers can
buy  sell  and consume goods  and their preferences for consuming various combinations or
bundles of goods are specified by their utility function  if agent i is a consumer  then its
utility function  u           ranks the various bundles of goods according to preference 
consumers may also start with an initial allocation of some goods  termed their endowment  let e denote agent i s endowment of good j   and x the amount of good j that i
ultimately consumes  the objective of consumer i is to choose a feasible bundle of goods 
 x           x    rendered in vector notation as x    so as to maximize its utility  a bundle
is feasible for consumer i if its total cost at the going prices does not exceed the value of
i s endowment at these prices  the consumer s choice can be expressed as the following
constrained optimization problem

where p    p          p   is the vector of prices for the k goods 
agents of the second type  producers  can transform some sorts of goods into some
others  according to their technology  the technology specifies the feasible combinations of
inputs and outputs for the producer  let us consider the special case where there is one
output good  indexed j   and the remaining goods are potential inputs  in that case  the
technology for producer i can be described by a production function

specifying the maximum output producible from the given inputs   when a good is an
input in its own production  the production function characterizes net output   in this
case  the producer s objective is to choose a production plan that maximizes profits subject
to its technology and the going price of its output and input goods  this involves choosing a
production level  y   along with the levels of inputs that can produce y at the minimum cost 
let x  and p denote the consumption and prices  respectively  of the input goods  then
the corresponding constrained optimization problem is to maximize profits  the difference
between revenues and costs

an agent acts competitively when it takes prices as given  neglecting any impact of its
own behavior on prices  the above formulation implicitly assumes perfect competition  in
that the prices are parameters of the agents  constrained optimization problems  perfect
competition realistically reects individual rationality when there are numerous agents  each
small with respect to the entire economy  even when this is not the case  however  we can
 

fiwellman

implement competitive behavior in individual agents if we so choose  the implications of
the restriction to perfect competition are discussed further below 
a pair  p  x  of a price vector and vector of demands for each agent constitutes a
competitive equilibrium for the economy if and only if 
   for each agent i  x is a solution to its constrained optimization problem     or
    at prices p  and

in other words  the total amount consumed equals the total amount produced  counted
as negative quantities in the consumption bundles of producers   plus the total amount
the economy started out with  the endowments  
under certain  classical  assumptions  essentially continuity  monotonicity  and concavity of the utility and production functions  see  e g    hildenbrand   kirman        varian 
        competitive equilibria exist  and are unique given strictness of these conditions 
from the perspective of mechanism design  competitive equilibria possess several desirable
properties  in particular  the two fundamental welfare theorems of general equilibrium theory      all competitive equilibria are pareto optimal  no agent can do better without some
other doing worse   and     any feasible pareto optimum is a competitive equilibrium for
some initial allocation of the endowments  these properties seem to offer exactly what
we need  a bound on the quality of the solution  plus the prospect that we can achieve
the most desired behavior by carefully engineering the configuration of the computational
market  moreover  in equilibrium  the prices reect exactly the information required for
distributed agents to optimally evaluate perturbations in their behavior without resorting
to communication or reconsideration of their full set of possibilities  koopmans        

    computing competitive equilibria

competitive equilibria are also computable  and algorithms based on fixed point methods  scarf        and optimization techniques  nagurney        have been developed  both
sorts of algorithms in effect operate by collecting and solving the simultaneous equilibrium equations           and       without an expressly distributed formulation  however 
these techniques may violate the decentralization considerations underlying our distributed
problem solving context  this is quite acceptable for the purposes these algorithms were
originally designed  namely to analyze existing decentralized structures  such as transportation industries or even entire economies  shoven   whalley         but because our purpose
is to implement a distributed system  we must obey computational distributivity constraints
not relevant to the usual purposes of applied general equilibrium analysis  in general  explicitly examining the space of commodity bundle allocations in the search for equilibrium
undercuts our original motive for decomposing complex activities into consumption and
production of separate goods 
 

fimarket oriented programming

another important constraint is that internal details of the agents  state  such as utility
or production functions and bidding policy  should be considered private in order to maximize modularity and permit inclusion of agents not under the designers  direct control  a
consequence of this is that computationally exploiting global properties arising from special features of agents would not generally be permissible for our purposes  for example 
the constraint that profits be zero is a consequence of competitive behavior and constantreturns production technology  since information about the form of the technology and
bidding policy is private to producer agents  it could be considered cheating to embed the
zero profit condition into the equilibrium derivation procedure 
walras s procedure is a decentralized relaxation method  akin to the mechanism of
tatonnement originally sketched by leon walras to explain how prices might be derived 
in the basic tatonnement method  we begin with an initial vector of prices  p    the agents
determine their demands at those prices  by solving their corresponding constrained optimization problems   and report the quantities demanded to the  auctioneer   based on
these reports  the auctioneer iteratively adjusts the prices up or down as there is an excess
of demand or supply  respectively  for instance  an adjustment proportional to the excess
could be modeled by the difference equation
n

if the sequence p    p         converges  then the excess demand in each market approaches zero 
and the result is a competitive equilibrium  it is well known  however  that tatonnement
processes do not converge to equilibrium in general  scarf         the class of economies in
which tatonnement works are those with so called stable equilibria  hicks         a sucient
condition for stability is gross substitutability  arrow   hurwicz         that if the price
for one good rises  then the net demands for the other goods do not decrease  intuitively 
gross substitutability will be violated when there are complementarities in preferences or
technologies such that reduced consumption for one good will cause reduced consumption
in others as well  samuelson        

    walras bidding protocol

the method employed by walras successively computes an equilibrium price in each separate market  in a manner detailed below  like tatonnement  it involves an iterative adjustment of prices based on reactions of the agents in the market  however  it differs from
traditional tatonnement procedures in that     agents submit supply and demand curves
rather than single point quantities for a particular price  and     the auction adjusts individual prices to clear  rather than adjusting the entire price vector by some increment
 usually a function of summary statistics such as excess demand   
walras associates an auction with each distinct good  agents act in the market by
submitting bids to auctions  in walras  bids specify a correspondence between prices and
   this general approach is called progressive equilibration by dafermos and nagurney         who applied
it to a particular transportation network equilibrium problem  although this model of market dynamics
does not appear to have been investigated very extensively in general equilibrium theory  it does seem
to match the kind of price adjustment process envisioned by hicks in his pioneering study of dynamics
and stability  hicks

quantities of the good that the agent offers to demand or supply  the bid for a particular
good corresponds to one dimension of the agent s optimal demand  which is parametrized
by the prices for all relevant goods  let x  p  be the solution to equation     or      as
appropriate  for prices p  a walras agent bids for good j under the assumption that prices
for the remaining goods are fixed at their current values  p  formally  agent i s bid for
good j is a function x           from prices to quantities satisfying

j

where the subscript j on the right hand side selects the quantity demanded of good j from
the overall demand vector  the agent computes and sends this function  encoded in any of
a variety of formats  to the auction for good j  
given bids from all interested agents  the auction derives a market clearing price  at
which the quantity demanded balances that supplied  within some prespecified tolerance 
this clearing price is simply the zero crossing of the aggregate demand function  which is the
sum of the demands from all agents  such a zero crossing will exist as long as the aggregate
demand is suciently well behaved  in particular  if it is continuous and decreasing in price 
gross substitutability  along with the classical conditions for existence of equilibrium  is
sucient to ensure the existence of a clearing price at any stage of the bidding protocol 
walras calculates the zero crossing of the aggregate demand function via binary search 
if aggregate demand is not well behaved  the result of the auction may be a non clearing
price 
when the current price is clearing with respect to the current bids  we say the market
for that commodity is in equilibrium  we say that an agent is in equilibrium if its set of
outstanding bids corresponds to the solution of its optimization problem at the going prices 
if all the agents and commodity markets are in equilibrium  the allocation of goods dictated
by the auction results is a competitive equilibrium 
figure   presents a schematic view of the walras bidding process  there is an auction
for each distinct good  and for each agent  a link to all auctions in which it has an interest 
there is also a  tote board  of current prices  kept up to date by the various auctions  in
the current implementation the tote board is a global data structure  however  since price
change notifications are explicitly transmitted to interested agents  this central information
could be easily dispensed with 
each agent maintains an agenda of bid tasks  specifying the markets in which it must
update its bid or compute a new one  in figure    agent a has pending tasks to submit
bids to auctions g    g   and g   the bidding process is highly distributed  in that each
agent need communicate directly only with the auctions for the goods of interest  those in
the domain of its utility or production function  or for which it has nonzero endowments  
each of these interactions concerns only a single good  auctions never coordinate with each
other  agents need not negotiate directly with other agents  nor even know of each other s
existence 
as new bids are received at auction  the previously computed clearing price becomes
obsolete  periodically  each auction computes a new clearing price  if any new or updated
bids have been received  and posts it on the tote board  when a price is updated  this
may invalidate some of an agent s outstanding bids  since these were computed under the
assumption that prices for remaining goods were fixed at previous values  on finding out

about a price change  an agent augments its task agenda to include the potentially affected

at all times  walras maintains a vector of going prices and quantities that would be
exchanged at those prices  while the agents have nonempty bid agendas or the auctions new
bids  some or all goods may be in disequilibrium  when all auctions clear and all agendas
are exhausted  however  the economy is in competitive equilibrium  up to some numeric
tolerance   using a recent result of milgrom and roberts        theorem      it can be
shown that the condition sucient for convergence of tatonnement gross substitutability 
is also sucient for convergence of walras s price adjustment process  the key observation
is that in progressive equilibration  synchronous or not  the price at each time is based on
some set of previous supply and demand bids 
although i have no precise results to this effect  the computational effort required for
convergence to a fixed tolerance seems highly sensitive to the number of goods  and much
less so to the number of agents  eydeland and nagurney        have analyzed in detail
the convergence pattern of progressive equilibration algorithms related to walras for particular special cases  and found roughly linear growth in the number of agents  however 
general conclusions are dicult to draw as the cost of computing the equilibrium for a particular computational economy may well depend on the interconnectedness and strength of
interactions among agents and goods 

    market oriented programming

as described above  walras provides facilities for specifying market configurations and
computing their competitive equilibrium  we can also view walras as a programming
environment for decentralized resource allocation procedures  the environment provides
constructs for specifying various sorts of agents and defining their interactions via their
 

fiwellman

relations to common commodities  after setting up the initial configuration  the market
can be run to determine the equilibrium level of activities and distribution of resources
throughout the economy 
to cast a distributed planning problem as a market  one needs to identify     the goods
traded      the agents trading  and     the agents  bidding behavior  these design steps
are serially dependent  as the definition of what constitutes an exchangeable or producible
commodity severely restricts the type of agents that it makes sense to include  and as
mentioned above  sometimes we have to take as fixed some real world agents and goods
presented as part of the problem specification  once the configuration is determined  it
might be advantageous to adjust some general parameters of the bidding protocol  below  i
illustrate the design task with a walras formulation of the multicommodity ow problem 

    implementation

walras is implemented in common lisp and the common lisp object system  clos  

the current version provides basic infrastructure for running computational economies 
including the underlying bidding protocol and a library of clos classes implementing a
variety of agent types  the object oriented implementation supports incremental development of market configurations  in particular  new types of agents can often be defined as
slight variations on existing types  for example by modifying isolated features of the demand
behavior  bidding strategies  e g   management of task agenda   or bid format  wang and
slagle        present a detailed case for the use of object oriented languages to represent
general equilibrium models  their proposed system is similar to walras with respect to
formulation  although it is designed as an interface to conventional model solving packages 
rather than to support a decentralized computation of equilibrium directly 
although it models a distributed system  walras runs serially on a single processor 
distribution constraints on information and communication are enforced by programming
and specification conventions rather than by fundamental mechanisms of the software environment  asynchrony is simulated by randomizing the bidding sequences so that agents
are called on unpredictably  indeed  artificial synchronization can lead to an undesirable
oscillation in the clearing prices  as agents collectively overcompensate for imbalances in
the preceding iteration  
the current experimental system runs transportation models of the sort described below  as well as some abstract exchange and production economies with parametrized utility
and production functions  including the expository examples of scarf        and shoven
and whalley          customized tuning of the basic bidding protocol has not been necessary  in the process of getting walras to run on these examples  i have added some
generically useful building blocks to the class libraries  but much more is required to fill out
a comprehensive taxonomy of agents  bidding strategies  and auction policies 
   in some formal dynamic models  huberman        kephart  hogg    huberman         homogeneous
agents choose instantaneously optimal policies without accounting for others that are simultaneously
making the same choice  since the value of a particular choice varies inversely with the number of agents
choosing it  this delayed feedback about the others  decisions leads to systematic errors  and hence
oscillation  i have also observed this phenomenon empirically in a synchronized version of walras 
by eliminating the synchronization  agents tend to work on different markets at any one time  and hence
do not suffer as much from delayed feedback about prices

   example  multicommodity flow
in a simple version of the multicommodity ow problem  the task is to allocate a given
set of cargo movements over a given transportation network  the transportation network
is a collection of locations  with links  directed edges  identifying feasible transportation
operations  associated with each link is a specification of the cost of moving cargo along it 
we suppose further that the cargo is homogeneous  and that amounts of cargo are arbitrarily
divisible  a movement requirement associates an amount of cargo with an origin destination
pair  the planning problem is to determine the amount to transport on each link in order to
move all the cargo at the minimum cost  this simplification ignores salient aspects of real
transportation planning  for instance  this model is completely atemporal  and is hence
more suitable for planning steady state ows than for planning dynamic movements 
a distributed version of the problem would decentralize the responsibility for transporting separate cargo elements  for example  planning modules corresponding to geographically or organizationally disparate units might arrange the transportation for cargo
within their respective spheres of authority  or decision making activity might be decomposed along hierarchical levels of abstraction  gross functional characteristics  or according
to any other relevant distinction  this decentralization might result from real distribution
of authority within a human organization  from inherent informational asymmetries and
communication barriers  or from modularity imposed to facilitate software engineering 
consider  for example  the abstract transportation network of figure    taken from
harker         there are four locations  with directed links as shown  consider two movement requirements  the first is to transport cargo from location   to location    and the
second in the reverse direction  suppose we wish to decentralize authority so that separate
agents  called shippers  decide how to allocate the cargo for each movement  the first shipper decides how to split its cargo units between the paths           and               
while the second figures the split between paths           and                note that
the latter paths for each shipper share a common resource  the link       
 

 

 

 

figure    a simple network  from harker         
because of their overlapping resource demands  the shippers  decisions appear to be
necessarily intertwined  in a congested network  for example  the cost for transporting a
unit of cargo over a link is increasing in the overall usage of the link  a shipper planning
its cargo movements as if it were the only user on a network would thus underestimate its
costs and potentially misallocate transportation resources 
 

fiwellman

for the analysis of networks such as this  transportation researchers have developed
equilibrium concepts describing the collective behavior of the shippers  in a system equilibrium  the overall transportation of cargo proceeds as if there were an omniscient central
planner directing the movement of each shipment so as to minimize the total aggregate
cost of meeting the requirements  in a user equilibrium  the overall allocation of cargo
movements is such that each shipper minimizes its own total cost  sharing proportionately
the cost of shared resources  the system equilibrium is thus a global optimum  while the
user equilibrium corresponds to a composition of locally optimal solutions to subproblems 
there are also some intermediate possibilities  corresponding to game theoretic equilibrium
concepts such as the nash equilibrium  where each shipper behaves optimally given the
transportation policies of the remaining shippers  harker         
from our perspective as designer of the distributed planner  we seek a decentralization
mechanism that will reach the system equilibrium  or come as close as possible given the
distributed decision making structure  in general  however  we cannot expect to derive a
system equilibrium or globally optimal solution without central control  limits on coordination and communication may prevent the distributed resource allocation from exploiting
all opportunities and inhibiting agents from acting at cross purposes  but under certain
conditions decision making can indeed be decentralized effectively via market mechanisms 
general equilibrium analysis can help us to recognize and take advantage of these opportunities 
note that for the multicommodity ow problem  there is an effective distributed solution
due to gallager         one of the market structures described below effectively mimics this
solution  even though gallager s algorithm was not formulated expressly in market terms 
the point here is not to crack a hitherto unsolved distributed optimization problem  though
that would be nice   but rather to illustrate a general approach on a simply described yet
nontrivial task 

   walras transportation market

in this section  i present a series of three transportation market structures implemented in
walras  the first and simplest model comprises the basic transportation goods and shipper
agents  which are augmented in the succeeding models to include other agent types  comparative analysis of the three market structures reveals the qualitatively distinct economic
and computational behaviors realized by alternate walras configurations 

    basic shipper model

the resource of primary interest in the multicommodity ow problem is movement of cargo 
because the value and cost of a cargo movement depends on location  we designate as a
distinct good the capacity on each origin destination pair in the network  see figure     to
capture the cost or input required to move cargo  we define another good denoting generic
transportation resources  in a more concrete model  these might consist of vehicles  fuel 
labor  or other factors contributing to transportation 
   in the nash solution  shippers correctly anticipate the effect of their own cargo movements on the average
cost on each link  the resulting equilibrium converges to the user equilibrium as the number of shippers
increases and the effect of any individual s behavior on prices diminishes  haurie   marcotte        

  

fimarket oriented programming

to decentralize the decision making  we identify each movement requirement with a
distinct shipper agent  these shippers  or consumers  have an interest in moving various
units of cargo between specified origins and destinations 
the interconnectedness of agents and goods defines the market configuration  figure  
depicts the walras configuration for the basic shipper model corresponding to the example
network of figure    in this model there are two shippers  s    and s     where s denotes
a shipper with a requirement to move goods from origin i to destination j   shippers connect
to goods that might serve their objectives  in this case  movement along links that belong to
some simple path from the shipper s origin to its destination  in the diagram  g denotes
the good representing an amount of cargo moved over the link i   j   g  denotes the special
transportation resource good  notice that the only goods of interest to both shippers are
g   for which they both have endowments  and g     transportation on the link serving
both origin destination pairs

walras basic shipper market configuration for the example transportation network 

the model we employ for transportation costs is based on a network with congestion 
thus exhibiting diseconomies of scale  in other words  the marginal and average costs  in
terms of transportation resources required  are both increasing in the level of service on a
link  using harker s data  we take costs to be quadratic  the quadratic cost model is posed
simply for concreteness  and does not represent any substantive claim about transportation
networks  the important qualitative feature of this model  and the only one necessary
for the example to work  is that it exhibits decreasing returns  a defining characteristic of
congested networks  note also that harker s model is in terms of monetary costs  whereas
we introduce an abstract input good 
let c  x  denote the cost in transportation resources  good g    required to transport
x units of cargo on the link from i to j   the complete cost functions are 
c    x    c    x    c    x    c    x    x      x 
c    x    c    x    c    x     x     x 
finally  each shipper s objective is to transport    units of cargo from its origin to its
destination

fiwellman

in the basic shipper model  we assume that the shippers pay proportionately  in units
of g    for the total cost on each link  this amounts to a policy of average cost pricing 
we take the shipper s objective to be to ship as much as possible  up to its movement
requirement  in the least costly manner  notice that this objective is not expressible in
terms of the consumer s optimization problem  equation      and hence this model is not
technically an instance of the general equilibrium framework 
given a network with prices on each link  the cheapest cargo movement corresponds to
the shortest path in the graph  where distances are equated with prices  thus  for a given
link  a shipper would prefer to ship its entire quota on the link if it is on the shortest path 
and zero otherwise  in the case of ties  it is indifferent among the possible allocations  to
bid on link i  j   the shipper can derive the threshold price that determines whether the link
is on a shortest path by taking the difference in shortest path distance between the networks
where link i  j  s distance is set to zero and infinity  respectively 
in incrementally changing its bids  the shipper should also consider its outstanding bids
and the current prices  the value of reserving capacity on a particular link is zero if it
cannot get service on the other links on the path  similarly  if it is already committed to
shipping cargo on a parallel path  it does not gain by obtaining more capacity  even at a
lower price  until it withdraws these other bids   therefore  the actual demand policy of
a shipper is to spend its uncommitted income on the potential ow increase  derived from
maximum ow calculations  it could obtain by purchasing capacity on the given link  it is
willing to spend up to the threshold value of the link  as described above  this determines
one point on its demand curve  if it has some unsatisfied requirement and uncommitted
income it also indicates a willingness to pay a lower price for a greater amount of capacity 
boundary points such as this serve to bootstrap the economy  from the initial conditions it
is typically the case that no individual link contributes to overall ow between the shipper s
origin and destination  finally  the demand curve is completed by a smoothing operation
on these points 
details of the boundary points and smoothing operation are rather arbitrary  and i
make no claim that this particular bidding policy is ideal or guaranteed to work for a broad
class of problems  this crude approach appears sucient for the present example and some
similar ones  as long as the shippers  policies become more accurate as the prices approach
equilibrium 
walras successfully computes the competitive equilibrium for this example  which
in the case of the basic shipper model corresponds to a user equilibrium  ue  for the
transportation network  in the ue for the example network  each shipper sends      units
of cargo over the shared link        and the remaining cargo over the direct link from
location   to the destination  this allocation is inecient  as its total cost is      resource
   even if a shipper could simultaneously update its bids in all markets  it would not be a good idea to do
so here  a competitive shipper would send all its cargo on the least costly path  neglecting the possibility
that this demand may increase the prices so that it is no longer cheapest  the outstanding bids provide
some sensitivity to this effect  as they are functions of price  but they cannot respond to changes in
many prices at once  and thus the policy of updating all bids simultaneously can lead to perpetual
oscillation  for example  in the network considered here  the unique competitive equilibrium has each
shipper splitting its cargo between two different paths  policies allocating all cargo to one path can never
lead to this result  and hence convergence to competitive equilibrium depends on the incrementality of
bidding behavior

units  which is somewhat greater than the global minimum cost solution of      units  in
economic terms  the cause of the ineciency is an externality with respect to usage of the
shared link  because the shippers are effectively charged average cost which in the case
of decreasing returns is below marginal cost the price they face does not reect the full
incremental social cost of additional usage of the resource  in effect  incremental usage of
the resource by one agent is subsidized by the other  the steeper the decreasing returns 
the more the agents have an incentive to overutilize the resource   this is a simple example
of the classic tragedy of the commons 
the classical remedy to such problems is to internalize the externality by allocating
ownership of the shared resource to some decision maker who has the proper incentives to
use it eciently  we can implement such a solution in walras by augmenting the market
structure with another type of agent 

    carrier agents
we extend the basic shipper model by introducing carriers  agents of type producer who
have the capability to transport cargo units over specified links  given varying amounts
of transportation resources  in the model described here  we associate one carrier with
each available link  the production function for each carrier is simply the inverse of the
cost function described above  to achieve a global movement of cargo  shippers obtain
transportation services from carriers in exchange for the necessary transportation resources 
let c denote the carrier that transports cargo from location i to location j   each
carrier c is connected to the auction for g   its output good  along with g  its input
in the production process  shipper agents are also connected to g    as they are endowed
with transportation resources to exchange for transportation services  figure   depicts the
walras market structure when carriers are included in the economy

walras market configuration for the example transportation network in an economy with shippers and carriers 

   average cost pricing is perhaps the most common mechanism for allocating costs of a shared resource 
shenker        points out problems with this scheme with respect to both eciency and strategic
behavior in the context of allocating access to congested computer networks  a problem analogous to
our transportation task 

  

fiwellman

in the case of a decreasing returns technology  the producer s  carrier s  optimization
problem has a unique solution  the optimal level of activity maximizes revenues minus costs 
which occurs at the point where the output price equals marginal cost  using this result 
carriers submit supply bids specifying transportation services as a function of link prices
 with resource price fixed   and demand bids specifying required resources as a function of
input prices  for activity level computed with output price fixed  
for example  consider carrier c     at output price p    and input price p    the carrier s
profit is
p   y   p c    y  
where y is the level of service it chooses to supply  given the cost function above  this
expression is maximized at y    p        p    p   taking p  as fixed  the carrier submits a
supply bid with y a function of p     on the demand side  the carrier takes p    as fixed and
submits a demand bid for enough good g  to produce y   where y is treated as a function
of p  
with the revised configuration and agent behaviors described  walras derives the system equilibrium  se   that is  the cargo allocation minimizing overall transportation costs 
the derived cargo movements are correct to within     in    bidding cycles  and to   
in     where in each cycle every agent submits an average of one bid to one auction  the
total cost  in units of g     its division between shippers  expenditures and carriers  profits 
and the equilibrium prices are presented in table    data for the ue solution of the basic shipper model are included for comparison  that the decentralized process produces a
global optimum is perfectly consistent with competitive behavior the carriers price their
outputs at marginal cost  and the technologies are convex

as a simple check on the prices of table    we can verify that p      p      p    and
p      p      p     both these relationships must hold in equilibrium  assuming all links have
nonzero movements   else a shipper could reduce its cost by rerouting some cargo  indeed 
for a simple  small and symmetric  example such as this  it is easy to derive the equilibrium
analytically using global equations such as these  but as argued above  it would be improper
to exploit these relationships in the implementation of a truly distributed decision process 
the lesson from this exercise is that we can achieve qualitatively distinct results by simple variations in the market configuration or agent policies  from our designers  perspective 
we prefer the configuration that leads to the more transportation ecient se  examination
of table   reveals that we can achieve this result by allowing the carriers to earn nonzero
profits  economically speaking  these are really rents on the fixed factor represented by the

congested channel  and redistributing these profits to the shippers to cover their increased
expenditures   in the model of general equilibrium with production  consumers own shares
in the producers  profits  this closes the loop so that all value is ultimately realized in
consumption  we can specify these shares as part of the initial configuration  just like the
endowment   in this example  we distribute the profits evenly between the two shippers 

    arbitrageur agents

the preceding results demonstrate that walras can indeed implement a decentralized
solution to the multicommodity ow problem  but the market structure in figure   is not
as distributed as it might be  in that     all agents are connected to g   and     shippers
need to know about all links potentially serving their origin destination pair  the first of
these concerns is easily remedied  as the choice of a single transportation resource good was
completely arbitrary  for example  it would be straightforward to consider some collection
of resources  e g   fuel  labor  vehicles   and endow each shipper with only subsets of these 
the second concern can also be addressed within walras  to do so  we introduce yet
another sort of producer agent  these new agents  called arbitrageurs  act as specialized
middlemen  monitoring isolated pieces of the network for ineciencies  an arbitrageur
a produces transportation from i to k by buying capacity from i to j and j to k  its
production function simply specifies that the amount of its output good  g   is equal to
the minimum of its two inputs  g and g   if p   p   p   then its production
is profitable  its bidding policy in walras is to increment its level of activity at each
iteration by an amount proportional to its current profitability  or decrement proportional
to the loss   such incremental behavior is necessary for all constant returns producers in
walras  as the profit maximization problem has no interior solution in the linear case  
to incorporate arbitrageurs into the transportation market structure  we first create new
goods corresponding to the transitive closure of the transportation network  in the example
network  this leads to goods for every location pair  next  we add an arbitrageur a for
every triple of locations such that     i   j is in the original network  and     there exists a
path from j to k that does not traverse location i  these two conditions ensure that there
is an arbitrageur a for every pair i  k connected by a path with more than one link  and
eliminate some combinations that are either redundant or clearly unprofitable 
the revised market structure for the running example is depicted in figure    with new
goods and agents shaded  some goods and agents that are inactive in the market solution
have been omitted from the diagram to avoid clutter 
notice that in figure   the connectivity of the shippers has been significantly decreased 
as the shippers now need be aware of only the good directly serving their origin destination
pair  this dramatically simplifies their bidding problem  as they can avoid all analysis of the
price network  the structure as a whole seems more distributed  as no agent is concerned
with more than three goods

   without such a restriction on its bidding behavior  the competitive constant returns producer would
choose to operate at a level of infinity or zero  depending on whether its activity were profitable or
unprofitable at the going prices  at break even  the producer is indifferent among all levels   this
would lead to perpetual oscillation  a problem noticed  and solved  by paul samuelson in      when he
considered the use of market mechanisms to solve linear programming problems  samuelson

figure    the revised walras market configuration with arbitrageurs 
despite the simplified shipper behavior  walras still converges to the se  or optimal
solution  in this configuration  although the resulting allocation of resources is identical 
a qualitative change in market structure here corresponds to a qualitative change in the
degree of decentralization 
in fact  the behavior of walras on the market configuration with arbitrageurs is virtually identical to a standard distributed algorithm  gallager        for multicommodity
ow  minimum delay on communication networks   in gallager s algorithm  distributed
modules expressly differentiate the cost function to derive the marginal cost of increasing
ow on a communication link  flows are adjusted up or down so to equate the marginal
costs along competing subpaths  this procedure provably converges to the optimal solution
as long as the iterative adjustment parameter is suciently small  similarly  convergence
in walras for this model requires that the arbitrageurs do not adjust their activity levels
too quickly in response to profit opportunities or loss situations 

    summary

the preceding sections have developed three progressively elaborate market configurations
for the multicommodity ow problem  table   summarizes the size and shape of the configuration for a transportation network with v locations and e links  and m movement
requirements  the basic shipper model results in the user equilibrium  while both of the
augmented models produce the globally optimal system equilibrium  the carrier model requires e new producer agents to produce the superior result  the arbitrageur model adds
o v e   more producers and potentially some new goods as well  but reduces the number of
goods of interest to any individual agent from o e   to a small constant 
these market models represent three qualitatively distinct points on the spectrum of
potential configurations  hybrid models are also conceivable  for example  where a partial
set of arbitrageurs are included  perhaps arranged in a hierarchy or some other regular

specific models studied here  with respect to both equilibrium produced and degree of
decentralization 

   limitations

one serious limitation of walras is the assumption that agents act competitively  as
mentioned above  this behavior is rational when there are many agents  each small with
respect to the overall economy  however  when an individual agent is large enough to affect
prices significantly  i e   possesses market power   it forfeits utility or profits by failing to
take this into account  there are two approaches toward alleviating the restriction of perfect
competition in a computational economy  first  we could simply adopt models of imperfect
competition  perhaps based on specific forms of imperfection  e g   spatial monopolistic
competition  or on general game theoretic models  second  as architects we can configure
the markets to promote competitive behavior  for example  decreasing the agent s grain size
and enabling free entry of agents should enhance the degree of competition  perhaps most
interestingly  by controlling the agents  knowledge of the market structure  via standard
information encapsulation techniques   we can degrade their ability to exploit whatever
market power they possess  uncertainty has been shown to increase competitiveness among
risk averse agents in some formal bidding models  mcafee   mcmillan         and in a
computational environment we have substantial control over this uncertainty 
the existence of competitive equilibria and ecient market allocations also depends
critically on the assumption of nonincreasing returns to scale  although congestion is a
real factor in transportation networks  for example  for many modes of transport there
are often other economies of scale and density that may lead to returns that are increasing
overall  harker         note that strategic interactions  increasing returns  and other factors
degrading the effectiveness of market mechanisms also inhibit decentralization in general 
and so would need to be addressed directly in any approach 
having cast walras as a general environment for distributed planning  it is natural to
ask how universal  market oriented programming  is as a computational paradigm  we can
characterize the computational power of this model easily enough  by correspondence to the
class of convex programming problems represented by economies satisfying the classical conditions  however  the more interesting issue is how well the conceptual framework of market
  

fiwellman

equilibrium corresponds to the salient features of distributed planning problems  although
it is too early to make a definitive assertion about this  it seems clear that many planning
tasks are fundamentally problems in resource allocation  and that the units of distribution
often correspond well with units of agency  economics has been the most prominent  and
arguably the most successful  approach to modeling resource allocation with decentralized
decision making  and it is reasonable to suppose that the concepts economists find useful
in the social context will prove similarly useful in our analogous computational context 
of course  just as economics is not ideal for analyzing all aspects of social interaction  we
should expect that many issues in the organization of distributed planning will not be well
accounted for in this framework 
finally  the transportation network model presented here is a highly simplified version of the actual planning problem for this domain  a more realistic treatment would
cover multiple commodity types  discrete movements  temporal extent  hierarchical network structure  and other critical features of the problem  some of these may be captured
by incremental extensions to the simple model  perhaps applying elaborations developed
by the transportation science community  for example  many transportation models  including harker s more elaborate formulation  harker         allow for variable supply and
demand of the commodities and more complex shipper carrier relationships  concepts of
spatial price equilibrium  based on markets for commodities in each location  seem to offer
the most direct approach toward extending the transportation model within walras 

   related work
    distributed optimization
the techniques and models described here obviously build on much work in economics 
transportation science  and operations research  the intended research contribution here is
not to these fields  but rather in their application to the construction of a computational
framework for decentralized decision making in general  nevertheless  a few words are in
order regarding the relation of the approach described here to extant methods for distributed
optimization 
although the most elaborate walras model is essentially equivalent to existing algorithms for distributed multicommodity ow  bertsekas   tsitsiklis        gallager        
the market framework offers an approach toward extensions beyond the strict scope of this
particular optimization problem  for example  we could reduce the number of arbitrageurs 
and while this would eliminate the guarantees of optimality  we might still have a reasonable
expectation for graceful degradation  similarly  we could realize conceptual extensions to
the structure of the problem  such as distributed production of goods in addition to transportation  by adding new types of agents  for any given extension  there may very well be
a customized distributed optimization algorithm that would outperform the computational
market  but coming up with this algorithm would likely involve a completely new analysis 
nevertheless  it must be stated that speculations regarding the methodological advantages
of the market oriented framework are indeed just speculations at this point  and the relative
exibility of applications programming in this paradigm must ultimately be demonstrated
empirically 
  

fimarket oriented programming

finally  there is a large literature on decomposition methods for mathematical programming problems  which is perhaps the most common approach to distributed optimization 
many of these techniques can themselves be interpreted in economic terms  using the close
relationship between prices and lagrange multipliers  again  the main distinction of the
approach advocated here is conceptual  rather than taking a global optimization problem and decentralizing it  our aim is to provide a framework for formulating a task in a
distributed manner in the first place 

    market based computation
the basic idea of applying economic mechanisms to coordinate distributed problem solving
is not new to the ai community  starting with the contract net  davis   smith        
many have found the metaphor of markets appealing  and have built systems organized
around markets or market like mechanisms  malone  fikes  grant    howard         the
original contract net actually did not include any economic notions at all in its bidding
mechanism  however  recent work by sandholm        has shown how cost and price can
be incorporated in the contract net protocol to make it more like a true market mechanism  miller and drexler  drexler   miller        miller   drexler        have examined
the market based approach in depth  presenting some underlying rationale and addressing
specific issues salient in a computational environment  waldspurger  hogg  huberman 
kephart  and stornetta        investigated the concepts further by actually implementing
market mechanisms to allocate computational resources in a distributed operating system 
researchers in distributed computing  kurose   simha        have also applied specialized
algorithms based on economic analyses to specific resource allocation problems arising in
distributed systems  for further remarks on this line of work  see  wellman        
recently  kuwabara and ishida        have experimented with demand adjustment
methods for a task very similar to the multicommodity ow problem considered here  one
significant difference is that their method would consider each path in the network as a
separate resource  whereas the market structures here manipulate only links or location
pairs  although they do not cast their system in a competitive equilibrium framework  the
results are congruent with those obtained by walras 
walras is distinct from these prior efforts in two primary respects  first  it is constructed expressly in terms of concepts from general equilibrium theory  to promote mathematical analysis of the system and facilitate the application of economic principles to
architectural design  second  walras is designed to serve as a general programming environment for implementing computational economies  although not developed specifically
to allocate computational resources  there is no reason these could not be included in market structures configured for particular application domains  indeed  the idea of grounding
measures of the value of computation in real world values  e g   cargo movements  follows
naturally from the general equilibrium view of interconnected markets  and is one of the
more exciting prospects for future applications of walras to distributed problem solving 
organizational theorists have studied markets as mechanisms for coordinating activities
and allocating resources within firms  for example  malone        models information
requirements  exibility and other performance characteristics of a variety of market and
non market structures  in his terminology  walras implements a centralized market  where
  

fiwellman

the allocation of each good is mediated by an auction  using such models  we can determine
whether this gross form of organization is advantageous  given information about the cost
of communication  the exibility of individual modules  and other related features  in this
paper  we examine in greater detail the coordination process in computational markets 
elaborating on the criteria for designing decentralized allocation mechanisms  we take the
distributivity constraint as exogenously imposed  when the constraint is relaxable  both
organizational and economic analysis illuminate the tradeoffs underlying the mechanism
design problem 
finally  market oriented programming shares with shoham s agent oriented programming  shoham        the view that distributed problem solving modules are best designed
and understood as rational agents  the two approaches support different agent operations
 transactions versus speech acts   adopt different rationality criteria  and emphasize different agent descriptors  but are ultimately aimed at achieving the same goal of specifying
complex behavior in terms of agent concepts  e g   belief  desire  capability  and social organizations  combining individual rationality with laws of social interaction provides perhaps
the most natural approach to generalizing newell s  knowledge level analysis  idea  newell 
      to distributed computation 

   conclusion

in summary  walras represents a general approach to the construction and analysis of
distributed planning systems  based on general equilibrium theory and competitive mechanisms  the approach works by deriving the competitive equilibrium corresponding to a
particular configuration of agents and commodities  specified using walras s basic constructs for defining computational market structures  in a particular realization of this
approach for a simplified form of distributed transportation planning  we see that qualitative differences in economic structure  e g   cost sharing among shippers versus ownership
of shared resources by profit maximizing carriers  correspond to qualitatively distinct behaviors  user versus system equilibrium   this exercise demonstrates that careful design of
the distributed decision structure according to economic principles can sometimes lead to
effective decentralization  and that the behaviors of alternative systems can be meaningfully
analyzed in economic terms 
the contribution of the work reported here lies in the idea of market oriented programming  an algorithm for distributed computation of competitive equilibria of computational
economies  and an initial illustration of the approach on a simple problem in distributed
resource allocation  a great deal of additional work will be required to understand the precise capabilities and limitations of the approach  and to establish a broader methodology
for configuration of computational economies
