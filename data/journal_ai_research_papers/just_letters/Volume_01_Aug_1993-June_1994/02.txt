abstract

we describe an extensive study of search in gsat  an approximation procedure for
propositional satisfiability  gsat performs greedy hill climbing on the number of satisfied
clauses in a truth assignment  our experiments provide a more complete picture of gsat s
search than previous accounts  we describe in detail the two phases of search  rapid hillclimbing followed by a long plateau search  we demonstrate that when applied to randomly
generated   sat problems  there is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the
mean number of satisfied clauses and the mean branching rate  our results allow us to
make detailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill climbingphase  the average
gradient of this phase  and to conjecture that both the average score and average branching
rate decay exponentially during plateau search  we end by showing how these results can
be used to direct future theoretical analysis  this work provides a case study of how
computer experiments can be used to improve understanding of the theoretical properties
of algorithms 

   introduction

mathematicians are increasingly recognizing the usefulness of experiments with computers
to help advance mathematical theory  it is surprising therefore that one area of mathematics
which has benefitted little from empirical results is the theory of algorithms  especially those
used in ai  since the objects of this theory are abstract descriptions of computer programs 
we should in principle be able to reason about programs entirely deductively  however 
such theoretical analysis is often too complex for our current mathematical tools  where
theoretical analysis is practical  it is often limited to  unrealistically  simple cases  for
example  results presented in  koutsoupias   papadimitriou        for the greedy algorithm
for satisfiability do not apply to interesting and hard region of problems as described in x  
in addition  actual behaviour on real problems is sometimes quite different to worst and
average case analyses  we therefore support the calls of mcgeoch  mcgeoch         hooker
 hooker        and others for the development of an empirical science of algorithms  in
such a science  experiments as well as theory are used to advance our understanding of
the properties of algorithms  one of the aims of this paper is to demonstrate the benefits
of such an empirical approach  we will present some surprising experimental results and
demonstrate how such results can direct future efforts for a theoretical analysis 
the algorithm studied in this paper is gsat  a randomized hill climbing procedure for
propositional satisfiability  or sat   selman  levesque    mitchell        selman   kautz

the variables in a propositional formula that makes the formula true  recently  there has
been considerable interest in gsat as it appears to be able to solve large and dicult satisfiability problems beyond the range of conventional procedures like davis putnam  selman
et al          we believe that the results we give here will actually apply to a larger family
of procedures for satisfiability called gensat  gent   walsh         understanding such
procedures more fully is of considerable practical interest since sat is  in many ways  the
archetypical  and intractable  np hard problem  in addition  many ai problems can be
encoded quite naturally in sat  eg  constraint satisfaction  diagnosis and vision interpretation  refutational theorem proving  planning  
this paper is structured as follows  in x  we introduce gsat  the algorithm studied
in the rest of the paper  in x  we define and motivate the choice of problems used in our
experiments  the experiments themselves are described in x   these experiments provide
a more complete picture of gsat s search than previous informal accounts  the results
of these experiments are analysed more closely in x  using some powerful statistical tools 
this analysis allow us to make various experimentally verifiable conjectures about gsat s
search  for example  we are able to conjecture  the length of gsat s initial hill climbing
phase  the average gradient of this phase  the simple scaling of various important features
like the score  on which hill climbing is performed  and the branching rate  in x  we suggest
how such results can be used to direct future theoretical analysis  finally  in x  we describe
related work and end with some brief conclusions in x  

   gsat

gsat is a random greedy hill climbing procedure  gsat deals with formulae in conjunct 

ive normal form  cnf   a formula   is in cnf iff it is a conjunction of clauses  where a
clause is a disjunction of literals  gsat starts with a randomly generated truth assignment 
then hill climbs by  ipping  the variable assignment which gives the largest increase in
the number of clauses satisfied  called the  score  from now on   given the choice between
several equally good ips  gsat picks one at random  if no ip can increase the score 
then a variable is ipped which does not change the score or  failing that  which decreases
the score the least  thus gsat starts in a random part of the search space and searches
for a global solution using only local information  despite its simplicity  this procedure has
been shown to give good performance on hard satisfiability problems  selman et al         
procedure gsat  
for i      to max tries
t    random truth assignment
for j      to max ips
if t satisfies  then return t
else poss ips    set of vars which increase satisfiability most
v    a random element of poss ips
t    t with v s truth assignment ipped
end
end
return

 no satisfying assignment found 
  

fian empirical analysis of search in gsat

in  gent   walsh        we describe a large number of experiments which suggest
that neither greediness not randomness is important for the performance of this procedure 
these experiments also suggest various other conjectures  for instance  for random   sat
problems  see x   the log of the runtime appears to scale with a less than linear dependency
on the problem size  conjectures such as these could  as we noted in the introduction 
be very profitably used to direct future efforts to analyse gsat theoretically  indeed 
we believe that the experiments reported here suggest various conjectures which would be
useful in a proof of the relationship between runtime and problem size  see x  for more
details 

   problem space
to be able to perform experiments on an algorithm  you need a source of problems on which
to run the algorithm  ideally the problems should come from a probability distribution
with some well defined properties  contain a few simple parameters and be representative of
problems which occur in real situations  unfortunately  it is often dicult to meet all these
criteria  in practice  one is usually forced to accept either problems from a well defined
distribution with a few simple parameters or a benchmark set of real problems  necessarily
from some unknown distribution  in these experiments we adopt the former approach and
use cnf formulae randomly generated according to the random k sat model 
problems in random k sat with n variables and l clauses are generated as follows 
a random subset of size k of the n variables is selected for each clause  and each variable is made positive or negative with probability      for random   sat  there is a phase
transition from satisfiable to unsatisfiable when l is approximately    n  mitchell  selman 
  levesque        larrabee   tsuji        crawford   auton         at lower l  most
problems generated are under constrained and are thus satisfiable  at higher l  most problems generated are over constrained and are thus unsatisfiable  as with many np complete
problems  problems in the phase transition are typically much more dicult to solve than
problems away from the transition  cheeseman  kanefsky    taylor         the region
l    n is thus generally considered to be a good source of hard sat problems and has
been the focus of much recent experimental effort 

   gsat s search

when gsat was first introduced  it was noted that search in each try is divided into two
phases  in the first phase of a try  each ip increases the score  however  this phase is
relatively short and is followed by a second phase in which most ips do not increase the
score  but are instead sideways moves which leave the same number of clauses satisfied 
this phase is a search of a  plateau  for the occasional ip that can increase the score  
one of the aims of this paper is to improve upon such informal observations by making
quantitative measurements of gsat s search  and by using these measurements to make
several experimentally testable predictions 
   informal observations to this effect were made by bart selman during the presentation of  selman et al  
      at aaai     these observations were enlarged upon in  gent   walsh        

  

figent   walsh

in our experiments  we followed three methodological principles from  mcgeoch        
first  we performed experiments with large problem sizes and many repetitions  to reduce
variance and allow for emergent properties  second  we sought good views of the data  that
is  we looked for features of performance which are meaningful and which are as predictable
as possible  third  we analysed our results closely  suitable analysis of data may show
features which are not clear from a simple presentation  in the rest of this paper we show
how these principles enabled us to make very detailed conjectures about gsat s search 
many features of gsat s search space can be graphically illustrated by plotting how
they vary during a try  the most obvious feature to plot is the score  the number of satisfied
clauses  in our quest for a good view of gsat s search space  we also decided to plot  possips  at each ip  that is  the number of equally good ips between which gsat randomly
picks  this is an interesting measure since it indicates the branching rate of gsat s search
space 
we begin with one try of gsat on a     variable random   sat problem in the
dicult region of l      n  figure  a   although there is considerable variation between
tries  this graph illustrates features common to all tries  both score  in figure  a  and
poss ips  in figure  b  are plotted as percentages of their maximal values  that is l and n
respectively  the percentage score starts just above        which might seem surprisingly
high 
theoretically  however  we expect a random truth assignment in k sat to satisfy
 k    of all clauses  in this instance       as expected from the earlier informal description 
 
 k
the score climbs rapidly at first  and then attens off as we mount the plateau  the graph
is discrete since positive moves increase the score by a fixed amount  but some of this
discreteness is lost due to the small scale  to illustrate the discreteness  in figure  b we
plot the change in the number of satisfied clauses made by each ip  as its exact value 
unscaled   note that the x axis for both plots in figure  b is the same 
change in score

figure    gsat s behaviour during one try  n        l         first     ips
the behaviour of poss ips is considerably more complicated than that of the score  it
is easiest first to consider poss ips once on the plateau  the start of plateau search  after
    ips  coincides with a very large increase in poss ips  corresponding to a change from
  

fian empirical analysis of search in gsat

the region where a small number of ips can increase the score by   to a region where a
large number of ips can be made which leave the score unchanged  once on the plateau 
there are several sharp dips in poss ips  these correspond to ips where an increase by  
in the score was effected  as can be seen from figure  b  it seems that if you can increase
the score on the plateau  you only have a very small number of ways to do it  also  the
dominance of ips which make no change in score graphically illustrates the need for such
 sideways  ips  a need that has been noted before  selman et al         gent   walsh 
      
perhaps the most fascinating feature is the initial behaviour of poss ips  there are
four well defined wedges starting at            and    ips  with occasional sharp dips 
these wedges demonstrate behaviour analogous to the that of poss ips on the plateau 
the plateau spans the region where ips typically do not change the score  we call this
region h  since hill climbing typically makes zero change to the score  the last wedge
spans the region h  where hill climbing typically increases the score by    as can be seen
very clearly from figure  b  again figure  b shows that the next three wedges  reading
right to left  span regions h   h    and h    as with the transition onto the plateau  the
transition between each region is marked by a sharp increase in poss ips  dips in the
wedges represent unusual ips which increase the score by more than the characteristic
value for that region  just as the dips in poss ips on the plateau represent ips where an
increase in score was possible  this exact correlation can be seen clearly in figure  b  note
that in this experiment  in no region h did a change in score of j     occur  and that there
was no change in score of    at all  in addition  each wedge in poss ips appears to decay
close to linearly  this is explained by the facts that once a variable is ipped it no longer
appears in poss ips  ipping it back would decrease score   that most of the variables in
poss ips can be ipped independently of each other  and that new variables are rarely
added to poss ips as a consequence of an earlier ip  on the plateau  however  when a
variable is ipped which does not change the score  it remains in poss ips since ipping it
back also does not change the score 
to determine if this behaviour is typical  we generated     random   sat problems
with n     and l    n  and ran    tries of gsat on each problem  figure  a shows the
mean percentage score  while figure  b presents the mean percentage poss ips together
with the mean change in score at each ip   the small discreteness in this figure is due to
the discreteness of postscript s plotting  
the average percentage score is very similar to the behaviour on the individual run of
figure    naturally being somewhat smoother  the graph of average poss ips seems quite
different  but it is to be expected that you will neither observe the sharply defined dips
in poss ips from figure  b  nor the very sharply defined start to the wedges  since these
happen at varying times  it is remarkable that the wedges are consistent enough to be
visible when averaged over       tries  the smoothing in the wedges and the start of the
plateau is caused by the regions not starting at exactly the same time in each try 
figure   does not distinguish between satisfiable and unsatisfiable problems  there
is no current technique for determining the satisfiability of     variable   sat problems
in feasible time  from instances we have been able to test  we do not believe that large
j

   in this paper we assign a score of      to ips which were not performed because a satisfying truth
assignment had already been found

differences from figure   will be seen when it is possible to plot satisfiable and unsatisfiable
problems separately  but this remains an interesting topic to investigate in the future 
experiments with other values of n with the same ratio of clauses to variables demonstrated qualitatively similar behaviour  more careful analysis shows the remarkable fact that
not only is the behaviour qualitatively similar  but quantitatively similar  with a simple linear dependency on n  if graphs similar to figure   are plotted for each n with the x axis
scaled by n  behaviour is almost identical  to illustrate this  figure   shows the mean
percentage score  percentage poss ips  and change in score  for n             and       for
l      n and for the first    n ips      ips at n         both figure  a and figure  b
demonstrate the closeness of the scaling  to the extent that they may appear to contain just
one thick line  in figure  b there is a slight tendency for the different regions of hill climbing
to become better defined with increasing n 
the figures we have presented only reach a very early stage of plateau search  to
investigate further along the plateau  we performed experiments with                    
and     variables from   to    n ips   in figure  a shows the mean percentage score in
each case  while figure  b shows the mean percentage poss ips  magnified on the y  axis
for clarity  both these figures demonstrate the closeness of the scaling on the plateau  in
figure  b the graphs are not quite so close together as in figure  a  the phases of hillclimbing become much better defined with increasing n  during plateau search  although
separate lines are distinguishable  the difference is always considerably less than    of the
total number of variables 
the problems used in these experiments  random   sat with l    n  are believed to
be unusually hard and are satisfiable with probability approximately      neither of these
facts appears to be relevant to the scaling of gsat s search  to check this we performed
a similar range of experiments with a ratio of clauses to variables of    although almost all
such problems are unsatisfiable  we observed exactly the same scaling behaviour  the score
   at     variables     n ips is close to the optimal value for max ips  however  experiments have
suggested that max ips may need to vary quadratically for larger n  gent   walsh

does not reach such a high value as in figure  a  as is to be expected  but nevertheless shows
the same linear scaling  on the plateau  the mean value of poss ips is lower than before 
we again observed this behaviour for l    n  where almost all problems are satisfiable 
the score approaches      faster than before  and a higher value of poss ips is reached
on the plateau  but the decay in the value of poss ips seen in figure  b does not seem to
be present 
to summarise  we have shown that gsat s hill climbing goes through several distinct
phases  and that the average behaviour of certain important features scale in linear fashion
with n  these results provide a considerable advance on previous informal descriptions of
gsat s search

   numerical conjectures
in this section  we will show that detailed numerical conjectures can be made if the data
presented graphically in x  is analysed numerically  we divide our analysis into two parts 
first we deal with the plateau search  where behaviour is relatively simple  then we analyse
the hill climbing search 
on the plateau  both average score and poss ips seem to decay exponentially with a
simple linear dependency on problem size  to test this  we performed regression analysis
on our experimental data  using the models

s  x    n   b   c  e  axn  
p  x    n   e   f  e  dxn  




   
   

where x represents the number of ips  s  x  the average score at ip x and p  x  the average
number of possible ips  to determine gsat s behaviour just on the plateau  we analysed
data on mean score  starting from    n ips  a time when plateau search always appears to
have started  see x    our experimental data fitted the model very well  detailed results for
n       are given in table   to three significant figures  the values of a  b  and c change
only slightly with n  providing further evidence for the scaling of gsat s behaviour  for l
   n the asymptotic mean percentage score is very close to      of clauses being satisfied 
while for l      n it is approximately       of clauses and for l    n it is approximately
      of clauses  a good fit was also found for mean poss ips behaviour  see table   for
n         except for l    n  where the mean value of poss ips on the plateau may be
constant  it seems that for l      n the asymptotic value of poss ips is about     of n
and that for   it is about    of n 
it is important to note that the behaviour we analysed was for mean behaviour over
both satisfiable and unsatisfiable problems  it is likely that individual problems will exhibit
similar behaviour with different asymptotes  but we do not expect even satisfiable problems
to yield a mean score of      asymptotically  note that as n increases a small error in
percentage terms may correspond to a large error in the actual score  as a result  our
predictions of asymptotic score may be inaccurate for large n  or for very large numbers of
ips  further experimentation is necessary to examine these issues in detail

formula fits the data very well

table    regression results on average poss ips of gsat 
we have also analysed gsat s behaviour during its hill climbing phase  figure  b
shows regions where most ips increase the score by    then by    then by    then by   
analysis of our data suggested that each phase lasts roughly twice the length of the previous
one  this motivates the following conjectures  gsat moves through a sequence of regions
h for j                in which the majority of ips increase the score by j   and where the
length of each region h is proportional to     except for the region h  which represents
plateau search  
to investigate this conjecture  we analysed    tries each on    different problems for
random   sat problems at n     and l    n  we very rarely observe ips in h that
increase the score by less than j   and so define h as the region between the first ip which
increases the score by exactly j and the first ip which increases the score by less than
j  unless the latter actually appears before the former  in which case h is empty   one
simple test of our conjecture is to compare the total time spent in h with the total time up
to the end of h   we predict that this ratio will be      for j     to   the mean and standard
deviations of this ratio  and the length of each region are shown in table     this data
supports our conjecture although as j increases each region is slightly longer than predicted 
the total length of hill climbing at n     is     n ips  while at n     it is     n  this
is consistent with the scaling behaviour observed in x

our conjecture has an appealing corollary  namely  that if there are i non empty hillclimbing regions  the average change in score per ip during hill climbing is

this might correspond to a model of gsat s search in which there are a certain number
of ips of size j     in each region h   and the probability of making a j     ip is merely
dependent on the number of such ips left  the rest of the time  gsat is obliged to make
a ip of size j   our data from      tries fitted this model well  giving values of r  of

data was too noisy to obtain a better fit with the model     than with one of linear decay 
these results support our conjecture  but more experiments on larger problems are needed
to lengthen the region h for j

   theoretical conjectures

empirical results like those given in x  can be used to direct efforts to analyse algorithms
theoretically  for example  consider the plateau region of gsat s search  if the model    
applies also to successful tries  the asymptotic score is l  giving
s  x    l   c  n  e  axn
differentiating with respect to x we get

plateau  thus  a good  first order  approximation for d is as follows  where prob d   j  
is the probability that a ip at x is of size j

fian empirical analysis of search in gsat

that is  on the plateau the probability of making a ip of size    may be directly proportional to l   s  x   the average number of clauses remaining unsatisfied and inversely
proportional n  to the number of variables  a similar analysis and result can be given for
prob d   j     in the hill climbing region h   which would explain the model     proposed
in x  
if our theoretical conjecture is correct  it can be used to show that the mean number
of ips on successful tries will be proportional to n ln n  further investigation  both experimental and theoretical  will be needed to determine the accuracy of this prediction 
our conjectures in this section should be seen as conjectures as to what a formal theory
of gsat s search might look like  and should be useful in determining results such as average runtime and the optimal setting for a parameter like max ips  in addition  if we
can develop a model of gsat s search in which prob d   j   is related to the number
of unsatisfied clauses and n as in the above equation  then the experimentally observed
exponential behaviour and linear scaling of the score will follow immediately

   related work
prior to the introduction of gsat in  selman et al          a closely related set of procedures were studied by gu  gu         these procedures have a different control structure
to gsat which allows them  for instance  to make sideways moves when upwards moves
are possible  this makes it dicult to compare our results directly  nevertheless  we are
confident that the approach taken here would apply equally well to these procedures  and
that similar results could be expected  another  greedy algorithm for satisfiability  has
been analysed in  koutsoupias   papadimitriou         but our results are not directly
applicable to it because  unlike gsat  it disallows sideways ips 
in  gent   walsh        we describe an empirical study of gensat  a family of procedures related to gsat  this study focuses on the importance of randomness  greediness
and hill climbing for the effectiveness of these procedures  in addition  we determine how
performance depends on parameters like max tries and max ips  we showed also that
certain variants of gensat could outperform gsat on random problems  it would be
very interesting to perform a similar analysis to that given here of these closely related
procedures 
gsat is closely related to simulated annealing  van laarhoven   aarts        and
the metropolis algorithm  which both use greedy local search with a randomised method of
allowing non optimal ips  theoretical work on these algorithms has not applied to sat
problems  for example  jerrum        jerrum   sorkin         while experimental studies of
the relationship between gsat and simulated annealing have as yet only reached tentative
conclusions  selman   kautz      b  spears        
procedures like gsat have also been successfully applied to constraint satisfaction
problems other than satisfiability  for example   minton  johnston  philips    laird       
proposed a greedy local search procedure which performed well scheduling observations on
the hubble space telescope  and other constraint problems like the million queens  and
  colourability  it would be very interesting to see how the results given here map across
to these new problem domains

   conclusions

we have described an empirical study of search in gsat  an approximation procedure for
satisfiability  we performed detailed analysis of the two basic phases of gsat s search 
an initial period of fast hill climbing followed by a longer period of plateau search  we
have shown that the hill climbing phases can be broken down further into a number of
distinct phases each corresponding to progressively slower climbing  and each phase lasting
twice as long as the last  we have also shown that  in certain well defined problem classes 
the average behaviour of certain important features of gsat s search  the average score
and the average branching rate at a given point  scale in a remarkably simple way with
the problem size we have also demonstrated that the behaviour of these features can be
modelled very well by simple exponential decay  both in the plateau and in the hill climbing
phase  finally  we used our experiments to conjecture various properties  eg  the probability
of making a ip of a certain size  that will be useful in a theoretical analysis of gsat  these
results illustrate how carefully performed experiments can be used to guide theory  and how
computers have an increasingly important r ole to play in the analysis of algorithms
