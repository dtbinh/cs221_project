   gsat

gsat random greedy hill climbing procedure  gsat deals formulae conjunct 

ive normal form  cnf   formula  cnf iff conjunction clauses 
clause disjunction literals  gsat starts randomly generated truth assignment 
hill climbs   ipping  variable assignment gives largest increase
number clauses satisfied  called  score  on   given choice
several equally good ips  gsat picks one random  ip increase score 
variable ipped change score  failing that  decreases
score least  thus gsat starts random part search space searches
global solution using local information  despite simplicity  procedure
shown give good performance hard satisfiability problems  selman et al

phases  first phase try  ip increases score  however  phase
relatively short followed second phase ips increase
score  instead sideways moves leave number clauses satisfied 
phase search  plateau  occasional ip increase score
