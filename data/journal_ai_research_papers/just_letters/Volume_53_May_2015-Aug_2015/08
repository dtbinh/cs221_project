   obs    a  b     act   a      obs    a  b     act   b      obs    a  b  
must case act   a      act   a     otherwise either     could
reduced changing first action  similarly  must case act   b     
act   b     otherwise either     would minimal  so  rewrite
sums follows

   obs    a  b     act   a      obs    a  b     act   b      obs    a  b  
   obs    a  b     act   a      obs    a  b     act   b      obs    a  b  
     follows basic algebra
act   b      obs    a  b     act   b      obs    a  b   
substituting   gives another minimal sum 
obs    a  b     act   a      obs    a  b     act   b      obs    a  b   
corresponds trajectory
h a  b    a  b    a  b i 
hence  graded world view assigning minimum plausibility      must assign
minimum plausibility fourth trajectory  informally      preferred trajectories
according graded world view  forced accept another preferred trajectory 
already saw raj  l  consists      therefore l representable
