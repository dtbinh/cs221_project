abstract
the article introduces a ceteris paribus modal logic  called cp  interpreted on the
equivalence classes induced by finite sets of propositional atoms  this logic is studied
and then used to embed three logics of strategic interaction  namely atemporal stit  the
coalition logic of propositional control  clpc  and the starless fragment of the dynamic
logic of propositional assignments  dlpa   the embeddings highlight a common ceteris
paribus structure underpinning the key operators of all these apparently very different logics
and show  we argue  remarkable similarities behind some of the most influential formalisms
for reasoning about strategic interaction 

   introduction
the logical analysis of agency and gamesfor an expository introduction to the field see van
der hoek and paulys overview paper       has boomed in the last two decades giving
rise to a plethora of different logics in particular within the multi agent systems field   at
the heart of these logics are always representations of the possible choices  or actions  of
groups of players  or agents  and their powers to force specific outcomes of the game  some
logics take the former as primitives  like stit  the logic of seeing to it that  belnap  perloff 
  xu        horty         some take the latter like cl  coalition logic  pauly        goranko 
jamroga    turrini        and atl  alternating time temporal logic  alur  henzinger   
kupferman        
in these formalisms the power of players is modeled in terms of the notion of effectivity 
in a strategic game  the  effectivity of a group of players consists of those sets of outcomes
of the game for which the players have some collective action which forces the outcome of
the game to end up in that set  no matter what the other players do  moulin   peleg 
       so  if a set of outcomes x belongs to the  effectivity of a set of players j  there
exists an individual action for each agent in j such that  for all actions of the other players 
the outcome of the game will be contained in x  if we keep the actions of the other agents
   the richness of this logical landscape was the object of the ijcai   invited talk by a  herzig logics
for multi agent systems  a critical overview

fixed  then the selection of an individual action for each agent in j corresponds to a choice
of j under the assumption that the other agents stick to their choices 
it was already observed by van benthem  girard  and roy        that this formalization
of choice and power in games is of an all other things being equal  or ceteris paribus  nature 
considering which outcomes of a game are possible for a set of players j once the other
players have fixed their actions  amounts to considering what may be the case under the
ceteris paribus condition all actions of the agents not in j being equal  to their current
ones   in the aforementioned work van benthem et al  also show how this intuition can
be used  for instance  to give a modal formulation of nash equilibria of one shot games  
in the current paper we leverage this intuition further and show how it can provide a novel
systematization of many of the most influential formalisms in the field of logic and games 
    scientific context
formal relationships linking the logics  or fragments thereof  we mentioned above have
been object of several publications  notable examples are  the embedding of cl into the
next time fragment of atl  goranko        and the embedding of cl into ncl  normal
coalition logic  broersen  herzig    troquard        balbiani  gasquet  herzig  schwarzentruber    troquard      a   the embedding of cl and atl into stit  broersen  herzig 
  troquard               earlier contributions have also attempted more comprehensive
systematizations of the field of logic and games  two in particular are worth mentioning 
goranko and jamrogas work         which compares game logics based on the computation tree abstraction like atl and its variants  and herzigs work         which provides
a conceptual and syntax basedwhile we favor here semantic methodscomparison of all
the main formalisms in the literature 
    aim of the paper
the aim of the paper is to provide a technical contribution towards a unification of the field
of logic and games  we set out to develop a series of embeddings which highlight a common
structure in the representation of choice and power  which underpins the semantics of all
the logics mentioned above 
we focus on the components of the semantics of those logics that have directly to do
with the representation of choice and power  and we abstract away from the representation
of time and repeated interaction  so the logics we will be working with are  the atemporal
fragment of stit  logic clpc  coalition logic of propositional control  van der hoek  
wooldridge        and the starless fragment of dlpa  dynamic logic of propositional
assignments  van eijck        balbiani  herzig    troquard         these logics cover 
arguably  a large spectrum of the most influential existing formalisms   logic stit is often
considered a standard in the literature  as it embeds both cl and atl  broersen et al        
   we refer the reader to osborne and rubinsteins textbook        for an introduction to the basic notions
of game theory 
   it is worth stressing that we focus here on logics of choice and power  that is  on the notion of effectivity  and not on formalisms incorporating also an explicit representation of how choice and power are
implemented  that is  an explicit notion of strategy   such as for instance atl with explicit strategies

to articulate our analysis  whose main technical tool consists of satisfiability preserving
embeddings  the paper introduces and studiesin its axiomatization and complexitya
simple ceteris paribus logic based on propositional equivalence  which we call cp  such
logic is the yardstick allowing us to compare and unify stit  clpc and dlpa 
    outline and summary of results
section   introduces logic cp  the logic will be compared to s  and axiomatized 
section   provides a study of the relationship between the atemporal version of stit and
cp  we show that cp embeds atemporal group stitthe fragment of atemporal stit
in which actions of both individuals and groups are representedunder the assumption
that the agents choices are bounded  we call the latter atemporal bounded group stit 
moreover  we show that cp embeds atemporal individual stitthe variant of atemporal

stit in which only the actions of individuals are represented  the former embedding is
used to transfer complexity results to cp  we also present an embedding in cp of a variant
of atemporal group stit in which groups are nested  i e   given two sets of agents j and j  
either j  j   or viceversa  
section   provides an embedding of the coalition logic of propositional control into atemporal
bounded group stitand therefore  indirectly  into cpas well as a direct embedding
of clpc into cp 
section   provides an embedding of the starless fragment of dlpa into cp as well as an
embedding of cp into dlpa and therefore  indirectly  of stit  on bounded models  and
clpc into dlpa 
finally  in section   we discuss the obtained results  put them in perspective with related
work and draw some general implications for the field  we conclude in section    longer
proofs are collected in a technical appendix at the end of the paper 
figure   gives a graphical presentation of the embeddings established in the paper
as well as relevant ones already known in the literature  two embeddings are known for
the above logics  the embedding of clpc into dlpa  balbiani et al          and the
embedding of stit into ncl  and vice versa  when the language of stit  and of ncl  are
restricted to a fragment which does not allow nesting modalities  

   a ceteris paribus logic based on propositional equivalence
in this section we introduce and study the logic that will be used as target logic in all the
embeddings we will present  the section starts with the definition of equivalence modulo
a set of atoms  then we present our ceteric paribus logic cp whose semantics is based on
these equivalence relations  the section finishes with an exponentially embedding of ceteris
paribus logic cp into s  proving that the cp satisfiability problem is decidable 
    equivalence modulo a set of atoms
consider a structure  w  v   where w is a set of states  and v   p   w a valuation
function from a countable set of atomic propositions p to subsets of w   
definition     equivalence modulo x  given a pair  w  v    x  p and  x      the
relation vx  w   is defined as 

w vx w   p  x   w  v  p   w   v  p 
when x is a singleton  e g  p   we will often write vp instead of v p    also  in order to
avoid clutter  we will often drop the reference to v in vx when clear from the context 
intuitively  two states w and w  are equivalent up to set x  or x equivalent  if and only
if they satisfy the same atoms in x  according to a given valuation v    the finiteness of
   the reader is referred to lorini and schwarzentrubers paper        for the bnf of this language 
   in the literature game logics are sometimes defined over a countable set of atoms  e g   balbiani et al  
      and sometimes over a finite set of atoms  e g   van der hoek   wooldridge         here we opt for
generality and define the language of cp over a countable set  under the assumption of a finite supply
of atoms some of the results we present later would trivialize  for instance the cp satisfiability problem
would be in ptime  and would therefore hide some of the interesting technical features of cp 

  

fithe ceteris paribus structure of logics of game forms

x is clearly not essential in the definition  it is assumed because  as we will see  each set
x will be taken to model a set of actions of some agent in a game form and sets of actions
are always assumed to be finite 
we state the following simple fact without proof  it highlights some interesting features
of the notion of propositional equivalence modulo subsets of p  some of which will be of use
later on in the paper 
fact     properties of p   the following holds for any set of states w   valuation v  
p   w and finite sets x  y  p 
 i  x is reflexive  transitive and symmetric 
 ii  if x  y then y  x  
 iii  if x is a singleton  x induces a partition of w with at most   cells 
 iv  x  y   xy  
 v     w    
intuitively   i  states that each x is an equivalence relation   ii  states that the larger
the set of atoms  the more refined is the equivalence relation indexed by it   iii  states that
if the set of atom is a singleton  then its equivalence relation would induce a partition of
one  if the proposition in the singleton is globally true or globally false in the model  or two
cells  otherwise    iv  states that the relation indexed by the union of two sets of atoms is
the relation one obtains by intersecting the relations of the two sets  finally  v  states that
the relation of the empty set of atoms is the global relation 
    a modal logic of the x relation
in this section we consider a simple modal language interpreted on relations x and axiomatize its logic on the class of structures  w  v    the key modal operator of the language
will be hxi  whose intuitive meaning is  is the case in some state which is x equivalent to
the current one or  to stress a ceteris paribus reading   is possible all things expressed in
x being equal  we call the resulting logic propositional ceteris paribus logic  cp in short 
      syntax of cp 
let p be a countable set of atomic propositions  the language lcp  p  is defined by the
following bnf 
lcp  p         p             hxi
where p ranges over p and x is a finite subset of atomic propositions  x  p and x finite  
note that as the set of finite subsets of atomic propositions is countable  the language
lcp  p  is also countable  the boolean connectives         and the dual operators  x 
are defined as usual  although we have taken diamond operators as primitive  we will for
convenience also make use of box operators to state some results in later sections 
the set sf    of subformulas of a formula  is defined inductively as follows 
 sf  p     p  
  

figrossi  lorini    schwarzentruber

 sf          sf    
 sf              sf     sf    
 sf  hxi     hxi   sf    
we say that a signature x appears in  if there exists a formula  such that hxi  sf    
      semantics of cp
this is the class of models we will be working with 
definition     cp models  given a countable set p  a cp model for lcp  p  is a tuple
m    w  v   where 
 w is a non empty set of states 
 v   p   w is a valuation function 
a cp model is called universal if w    p and v is s t  v  p     w   p  w   it is called
non redundant if p is the identity relation in w    
intuitively  a cp model consists just of a state space and a valuation function for a given
set of atoms  the satisfaction relation is defined as follows 
definition     satisfaction for cp models  let m    w  v   be an cp model for lcp  p  
w  w and     lcp  p  
m  w   cp p  w  v  p  
m  w   cp   m  w    cp  
m  w   cp     m  w   cp  and m  w     
m  w   cp hxi  w   w   w vx w  and m  w    cp 
formula  is cp satisfiable  if and only if there exists a model m and a state w such that
m  w   cp   formula  is valid in m  noted m   cp   if and only if for all w  w  
m  w   cp   finally   is cp valid  noted   cp   if and only if it is valid in all cp models 
the logical consequence of formula  from a set of formulae  noted    cp   is defined as
usual 
so  modal operators are interpreted on the equivalence relations x induced by the
valuation of the model  it is worth observing that the logic of this class of models is not
closed under uniform substitution   that is  logic cp is not uniform   to witness that  notice
that formula   p  p    p  p is valid  whereas   p      p   is not 
let us give a simple illustration of the above semantics 
example    let us consider the following model m made up of   states w  x  u  y  z 
   for the definition of uniform substitution the reader is referred to the textbook by blackburn  de rijke 
and venema        def        
   the terminology comes from goldblatts work

for instance  we have m  w   cp h p  q ir and m  z   cp   p  r 
the following lemmas state simple facts concerning the relation of logic cp with logic
s  and isolate an interesting class of cp models 
lemma    let lcp  p  the set of formulae   lcp  p  containing only hi operators  the
set of formulae of lcp  p  which are cp valid is the modal logic of kripke frames  w  w     
i e   logic s  
proof  it follows directly from fact   item  v  
in other words  the hi operator of lcp is nothing but the global modality  blackburn
et al         pp           the next lemma states that cp is actually the logic of the class
of relevant cp models 
lemma    every satisfiable cp formula is satisfiable on a non redundant model 
proof  assume m  w      we show that mp    w p     of m where mp is the quotient
of m by the equivalence relation p  defined in the natural way  and  w p is the set
of states which are p  equivalent to w  we proceed by induction on the structure of  
the propositional and boolean cases are obvious  let    hxi with x  p  from the
assumption and the semantics of cp operators we have that there exists v such that w x v
and m  v      by construction we directly have that  w p x  v p   by ih mp    v p     
and therefore mp    w p    hxi 
      axiomatics of cp
we can obtain an axiom system for cp by a standard reduction technique exploiting lemma
   the axiom system is given in figure    the first thing to notice is that the system consists
of the usual s  axioms plus the reduce axiom  logic s  is known to be sound and strongly
complete for the class of models where the accessibility relation is the total relation w  
 blackburn et al          and modality hi can therefore be axiomatized as the  dual of 
the global modality 
having said this  soundness and strong completeness of the above system are easy to
establish 
theorem    the axiom system given in figure   is sound and strongly complete for the
class of cp models 
proof  soundness it suffices to show that reduce is cp valid  which follows straightforwardly from definition    completeness to obtain completeness we proceed as customary

we also write tr     for  tr            notice that the translation removes occurrences
of hxi and  x  operators from formulae where x     and it has the same structure of axiom

if  cp     then  cp        

where       is the formula that results from  by replacing zero or more occurrences of

proof of this claim is provided in appendix a  by using axiom reduce and rule rep we
obtain by    that  for any   lcp  p    cp   tr         we can then proceed as follows 
if    cp  then tr       cp tr     by     by lemma   and the strong completeness of
s  we thus obtain tr      s  tr     and therefore tr      cp tr      finally by    again it
follows that   cp   which proves strong completeness 
  

fithe ceteris paribus structure of logics of game forms

the crux of the above reduction argument lies in the use of axiom reduce  what the
axiom does is to enable the reduction of  x  formulae by taking care of all the possible truth

is true at a given state  for some y    then in all accessible states  if that combination is
true  then what occurs in the scope of  x  is also true 
we opted for the above axiomatization in virtue of its simplicity  but alternative systems
are of course possible  one in particular is worth mentioning  it first reduces hpi operators
by axiom 
hpi    p  hi p       p  hi p     

   

this states that hpi is equivalent to either the case in which the current state satisfies p
and there exists a  possibly different  p state where  is true  or the case where p is true
and there exists a  possibly different  p state where  is true  recall property  iii  in fact
    given the above reduction  one can then use axioms to enforce the appropriate behavior
of x relations where x consists of more than one atom  to this aim  axioms can be used
that are known to be canonical for properties  ii  and  iv  of fact    namely 
hx  y i  hxi

   

hxii  hy ii  hx  y ii

   

where i ranges over a set of nominals  a complete system could then be obtained by
axiomatizing the behavior of nominalsthrough axioms and rules used in hybrid logic
 areces   ten cate         from that system  a named canonical model could be built
 i e   a canonical model where all maximal consistent sets contain exactly one nominal 
where the axioms in formulae     would enforce the desirable properties on the canonical
relations 
    exponentially embedding cp into s 
the property expressed by axiom reduce enables a truth preserving translation of cp into
s  via the translation tr  provided in the proof of theorem    this translation is  however 
such that the length of the translated formula grows exponentially by a tower of exponents
of height equal to the modal depth of the original formula 
in this section we propose a translation that is single exponential and preserves satisfiability  take the standard modal language l  p  with one modal operator  defined on
the set of atoms p  s  models are structures m    w  v   where w is a set of states  and
v   p   w a valuation function  given an s  model m    w  v   and a state w  w  
the truth conditions are defined as follows 
m  w   s    u  w   m  u   s  
s  satisfiability is defined as usual  it is possible to define an exponential truth preserving
reduction tr   lcp  p   l  p  as follows 
 
tr       p  
 p  tr     
sf

where p are fresh atomic proposition  note that p  is p when  is the formula   itself

intuitively  the translation is designed to operate like axiom reduce but avoiding exponential blow up to pile up with the modal depth of the formula  the atomic propositions
p in tr    x   avoid the non elementary size of tr      the definition of tr       corresponds to the degenerated case of tr    x   where x    the following theorem states the
satisfiability preservation  the proof is given in appendix b 
theorem     tr preserves satisfiability  let   be a cp formula  the two following statements are equivalent    is cp satisfiable  tr     is s  satisfiable 
as a consequence  we also obtain the following result 
corollary     decidability  the satisfiability problem for cp is decidable and in nexptime 
proof  the satisfiability problem for s  is decidable and in np  blackburn et al         ch 
    the result follows from theorem   and a decision procedure may work as follows  in
order to check that  is satisfiable we compute the formula tr   and we apply a np decision
procedure to check whether tr   is s  satisfiable or not 
notice that if the cardinality of each x that appears in operators  x  of  is bounded
by a fixed integer  then the translation tr becomes polynomial in the size of   thus 
as s  satisfiability problem is np complete  the cp satisfiability problem with a bounded
cardinality restrictions over set of atomic propositions in modal operators is in np  as it is
trivially np hard  it is np complete 
in section    we will embed the atemporal version of stit  the logic of seeing to it that 
into cp thereby obtaining lower bounds results 

   the ceteris paribus structure of stit logic
in this section  we investigate the possibility of embedding the logic of agency stit into
cp  stit logic  the logic of seeing to it that  belnap et al         horty        is one of
the most prominent logical accounts of agency  it is the logic of constructions of the form
agent i  or group j  sees to it that   stit has a non standard modal semantics based on
the concepts of moment and history  however  as shown by balbiani  herzig  and troquard
     b  and herzig and schwarzentruber         the basic stit language without temporal
operators can be simulated in a standard kripke semantics 
   such a use of fresh atomic propositions to obtain more efficient satisfiability preserving translations is
based on the propositional logic technique known as tseitin transformation  tseitin

    atemporal group stit
first let us recall the syntax and the semantics of atemporal group stit  the language of
this logic is built from a countable set of atomic propositions p and a finite set of agents
agt               n  and is defined by the following bnf 
lgstit  p  agt          p              j   stit 
where p ranges over p and j ranges over  agt   the construction  j   stit  is read group
j sees to it that  is true regardless of what the other agents choose  we define the dual
def
operator hj   stiti    j   stit   when j     the construction     stit  is read 
is true regardless of what every agent chooses or simply  is necessarily true 
definition    stit kripke model  herzig   schwarzentruber         a stit kripke model
m    w   rj  jagt   v   is a   tuple where 
 w is a non empty set of worlds 
 for all j  agt   rj is an equivalence relation such that

 v   p   w is a valuation function for atomic propositions 
with rj  w     u  w    w  u   rj   for any j   agt  
the partition induced by the equivalence relation rj is the set of possible choices of
the group j   indeed  in stit a choice of a group j at a given world w is identified with
the set of possible worlds rj  w   we call rj  w  the set of possible outcomes of group
js choice at world w  in the sense that group js current choice at w forces the possible
worlds to be in rj  w   the set r  w  is simply the set of possible outcomes at w  or said
differently  the set of outcomes of the current game at w  according to condition  i   the
set of possible outcomes of a group js choice is a subset of the set of possible outcomes 
condition  ii   called additivity  means that the choices of the agents in a group j is made
up of the choices of each individual agent and no more  condition  iii  corresponds to the
property of independence of agents  whatever each agent decides to do  the set of outcomes
corresponding to the joint action of all agents is non empty  more intuitively  this means
that agents can never be deprived of choices due to the choices made by other agents  in
lorini and schwarzentrubers work        determinism for the group agt was assumed 
that is to say that the set of outcomes corresponding to a joint action of all agents is a
singleton  hortys group stit logic  horty        does not suppose this  here we deal with
hortys version of stit  so a stit model is a game form in which a joint action of all
agents might determine more than one outcome 
   one can also see the partition induced by the equivalence relation rj as the set of actions that agent j
can try  where the notion of trying corresponds to the notion of volition studied in philosophy of action

    embedding atemporal stit into cp
we are not able to embed group stit into cp because of many reasons  the first one is
that the group stit satisfiability problem is undecidable if there are more than   agents
 herzig   schwarzentruber           the second one is that group stit does not have
the finite model property  indeed herzig and schwarzentruber        provide a translation
from the product logic s n to group stit logic  and as s n does not have the finite model
property  gabbay  kurucz  wolter    zakharyaschev         so atemporal group stit will
not have it  on the contrary cp inherits the finite model property from s   indeed  if a
formula  is cp satisfiable  theorem   says that tr   is s  satisfiable  but as s  has the
polynomial model property  there exists a polynomial sized s  model for tr   in the size
of tr    in other words  there exists an exponential s  model for tr   in the size of  
theorem   ensures that there exists an exponential cp model for  in the size of  
we will nevertheless embed a variant of group stit under the assumption that every
agent has a finite and bounded number of actions in his repertoire  for every agent j  a
rj  equivalence class rj  u  corresponds to an action of agent j  we say that agent j has kj
actions in a stit model if and only if there are exactly kj rj  equivalence classes in m 
the game structure in stit models should be enforced in cp models  that is why
we introduce special atomic propositions to encode the game structure  without loss of
generality  we assume that the set p contains special atomic propositions rep j    rep j          for
all agents j which are used to represent the actions of the agents  let k be the maximal
number of actions  k   maxjagt kj   for every agent  we represent its actions by numbers
  in             k     and some atomic propositions encode the binary representation of   
let m be an integer that represents the number of digits we need to represent an action 
for instance let m   dlog  ke  the ceiling of the logarithm of k   for a given agent j 
rjm    rep j            rep jm   is the set atomic propositions that represent the binary digits of an
action of agent j  we suppose that if j    i then rjm  rim    
example    for example  in the model of example    agent   has k      actions and agent
  has k      actions  so k     and m   dlog   e      we have r m    rep      rep      and
r m    rep      rep       then for instance  we may represent the action of agent   corresponding
to r     w     w  u  v  by the valuation rep     rep      the action of agent   corresponding
to  r  s  by rep     rep      the action of agent   corresponding to  t  z  by rep     rep     
the action of agent   corresponding to  w  r  t  by rep     rep    and the action of agent  
corresponding to  u  v  s  z  by rep     rep

let rm   jagt rjm be the set of all atomic propositions used to denote actions  let
us define the following cp formula 
def

gridm  

v

xrm     x

 hrm    x ix    x  hrm    x ix  

   

this formula enforces a cp model to be universal  over rm    that is  to contain all possible
valuations over rm  recall definition     a model that satisfies gridm is then interpreted
as a game form where each valuation of rjm represents an action of player j 
    see lorini and schwarzentrubers paper        for a study of some decidable fragments of group stit

    atemporal individual stit
in this subsection  we consider the following fragment of stit called atemporal individual
stit     
listit  p  agt          p               j    stit 
where p ranges over p and j ranges over agt  
this fragment of stit  axiomatized by xu         has the exponential finite model
property  see lemma   in balbiani et al       b   moreover  as the following theorem
highlights  it can be embedded in the logic cp 
theorem    let us consider a stit formula  of the individual stit fragment  let m be
the length of   then the following three items are equivalent 
    is stit satisfiable
    is stit satisfiable in a model where each agent has at most  m actions 
   gridm  tr     is cp satisfiable 
proof       consider a stit formula  of the individual stit fragment  if  is stitsatisfiable and m is the length of   then  is stit satisfiable in a model where there are
at most  m worlds  see lemma   in balbiani et al       b   this implies that there are at
most  m actions in that model  the implications      and      come from theorem
  
thanks to theorem    we reduce the nexptime complete satisfiability problem of
individual stit  balbiani et al       b  to the cp satisfiability problem  as the reduction
is polynomial  we obtain the following lower bound complexity result for the cp satisfiability
problem 
corollary    the cp satisfiability problem is nexptime hard 
    group stit where coalitions are nested
in this subsection we address the satisfiability problem of the fragment of cp consisting of
formulae  of lcp such that the sets of atomic propositions that appear in any operator  x 
occurring in  form a linear set of sets of atomic propositions  more formally  if  x  and  x    
are two operators occurring in  then either x  x   or x    x  for instance  the formula
  p  q       p    p  q  r  s    belongs to the fragment because  p    p  q    p  q  r  s  
on the contrary  the formula   p  p    q  p is not an element of this fragment of cp 
we call the satisfiability problem of this fragment of cp the cp nested satisfiability
problem  due to the embedding proposed in theorem   of stit into cp  we provide the
following lower bound complexity result for the cp nested satisfiability problem  the proof
is given in appendix d 
theorem    the cp nested satisfiability problem is pspace hard 
    some authors  e g   broersen        wansing        use the term multi agent stit to designate the
logic where operators are of the form   j    stit   here we prefer to use the more explicit term individual
stit as in herzig and schwarzentrubers work        

   

figrossi  lorini    schwarzentruber

the following theorem provides an upper bound complexity result for this fragment of
cp  the proof is given in appendix e 
theorem    the cp nested satisfiability problem is in pspace 
this concludes our analysis of stit logics via cp  in the next section we move to normal
coalition logic 
    normal coalition logic
we conclude this section on stit by briefly mentioning a related system  normal coalition
logic  normal coalition logic ncl was introduced by broersen et al         to provide
an embedding in a normal modal logic of the influentialand non normalcoalition logic
 pauly         the embedding was based on a general simulation technique developed
by gasquet and herzig        and showed for the first time how coalition logicwhich
had already been recognized as the fragment of atl containing only the next operator
 goranko       could actually be interpreted on very traditional structures such as kripke
frames based on equivalence relations  ncl was further studied by balbiani et al       a  
also ncl has a known atemporal variant  introduced and studied by balbiani et al       a 
and lorini and schwarzentruber        
two results on atemporal ncl from the literature are worth mentioning in this context 
first  balbiani et al       a  thm      show that the satisfiability problem for atemporal
ncl  when  agt       is nexptime complete  like cp  second  lorini and schwarzentruber        prop     show that when the  agt       then atemporal stit is embeddable
in atemporal ncl and vice versa  and that an embedding  in both directions  in the general
case is possible only by considerably restricting the syntax of lstit  

   the ceteris paribus structure of coalition logic of propositional
control
in this section we study the relationships between cp  atemporal bounded group stit 
and another well known game logic  the logic clpc  coalition logic of propositional control      specifically  we show that clpc can be embedded  preserving satisfiability  into
atemporal bounded group stit and  by the fact that atemporal bounded group stit
can be embedded into cp  section       we indirectly show that clpc can be embedded
into cp  to complete the picture we also provide a direct embedding from clpc to cp 
this latter embedding is of particular interest to highlight the striking similarities between
the models of cp and of clpc 
clpc was introduced by van der hoek and wooldridge        as a formal language
for reasoning about capabilities of agents and coalitions in multiagent environments  in this
logic the notion of capability is modeled by means of the concept of control  in particular  it
is assumed that each agent i is associated with a specific finite subset pi of the finite set of
all propositions p  pi is the set of propositions controlled by the agent i  that is  the agent
i has the ability to assign a  truth  value to each proposition pi but cannot affect the truth
    in gerbrandys work        generalizations of some of the assumptions underlying clpc have been
studied  here we only consider the original version of clpc proposed by van der hoek and wooldridge 

   

fithe ceteris paribus structure of logics of game forms

values of the propositions in p   pi   in the variant of clpc studied by van der hoek and
wooldridge        it is also assumed that control over propositions is exclusive  that is  two
agents cannot control the same proposition  i e   if i    j then pi  pj      moreover  it is
assumed that control over propositions is complete  that is  every proposition is controlled
by at least one agent  i e   for every p  p there exists an agent i such that p  pi   
the preceding concepts and assumptions are precisely formulated in the following section  which illustrates the syntax and the formal semantics of clpc 
    syntax and semantics of clpc
the language of clpc is built from a finite set of atomic propositions p and a finite set
of agents agt               n   and is defined by the following bnf 
lclpc  p  agt          p             j 
where p ranges over p and j ranges over  agt   operator j is called cooperation modality 
and the construction j  means that group j has the contigent ability to achieve  
definition    clpc model   a model for clpc is a tuple m    p            pn   x  where 
 p            pn is a partition of p among the agents in agt  
 x  p is the set of propositions which are true in the initial state 
s
for every group of agents j  agt   let pj   ij pi be the set of atomic propositions
controlled by the group j  moreover  for every group j  agt and for every set of atomic
propositions x  p  let xj   x  pj be the set of atomic propositions in x controlled by
the group j  sets xj are called j valuations 
given a clpc model m    p            pn   x   the truth conditions of clpc formulae
are the following 
m   clpc p  p  x 
m   clpc   m    clpc

that is  j  is true at a given model m if and only if  the coalition j can change the truth
values of the atoms that it controls in such a way that  will be true afterwards  i e   given
the actual truth value combination of the atoms which are not controlled by j  there exists
a truth value combination of the atoms controlled by j which ensures   
let us illustrate the clpc semantics with an example

    embedding clpc into stit
the aim of this section is to provide an embedding of clpc into the variant of atemporal group stit with bounded choices  atemporal bounded group stit  that have been

formulae exc   and exc  mean that control over atomic propositions in p is exclusive
 i e   there is no proposition in p which can be forced to be true or false by more than one
agent   whereas formula compl means that exercise of control over atomic propositions in
p is complete  i e   for every proposition in p there exists at least one agent who either forces
it to be true or forces it to be false   finally  formula grid  means that all the possible
truth value combinations of the atomic propositions in p are possible  note that exc    
exc    compl and grid  are well formed stit formulae because of the assumption that
the set p is finite

agent has at most  m actions 
as cp embeds atemporal bounded group stit  theorem   in section       from theorem   it follows that cp also embeds clpc  indeed  given a clpc satisfiable formula
  one can use the translation tr  given in section     in order to find a corresponding stit
formula which is stit satisfiable  then  one uses the preceding translation tr  in order to
find a corresponding cp formula which is cp satisfiable

    directly embedding clpc into cp
to complete the picture  we study here a direct embedding of clpc into cp 
definition    from clpc to cp models   let m    p            pn   x  be a clpc model 
define mcp    w  v   as follows 
 w    p  
 v is such that v  p     w   p  w  for all p  p 
intuitively  v is such that any truth assignment on p is witnessed by exactly one
w  w and wx is the witness of the truth assignment represented by x  i e   makes
all atoms in x true and the rest false   so mcp is a non redundant universal cp model and
mcp   x is a pointed cp model  definition     now define the following translation from

   the ceteris paribus structure of dynamic logic of propositional
assignments
the dynamic logic of propositional assignments  dlpa  is the concrete variant of propositional dynamic logic  pdl   harel et al         in which atomic programs are assignments of
propositional variables to true or to false    the complexities of the model checking and of
the satisfiability problem for dlpa have been recently studied by balbiani et al         
the starless version of dlpa was previously studied by van eijck        and recently
put to use by herzig et al          who have shown that it embeds clpc  in the next
section we study the relationship between cp and dlpa  specifically  we provide a truthpreserving embedding of starless dlpa into cp as well as a truth preserving embedding
of cp into dlpa 
dlpa  it has been argued by herzig et al          represents a very general and
because of its direct link with pdlnatural formalism for reasoning about agency  the
results in this section  we argue  point to a similar status for clpc  modulo the use of the
kleene star about which we will comment in section   

    programs in standard pdl are abstract as they are just letters a  b        from some alphabet 

   

fithe ceteris paribus structure of logics of game forms

    syntax and semantics of dlpa
the language of dlpa is built from a finite set of atomic propositions p and is defined
by the following bnf 
      p   p                  
ldlpa  p         p             hi
we will use p to denote   p  p  
definition    dlpa model   a dlpa model is a set x  p 
that is  a dlpa model is a propositional valuation 
the semantics is given by induction as follows 
 j pk     x  x       x     x   p

 jhik    x   there exists x   s th   x  x      jk and x    jk  

we write x   dlpa  for x  jk  we will refer to the fragment of dlpa without 
operator as starless dlpa 
    some properties of dlpa
like in pdl  program constructors      and   are eliminable 
fact    the following are dlpa validities 
h     i  hih   i
h     i  hi  h   i
h i    
however  unlike in pdl  the  operator is also eliminable in dlpa 
fact    balbiani et al          for every   lclpc  p  there exists    lclpc  p  such
that     is dlpa valid

notice that the translation from starless dlpa to cp does not need to include the cases
for sequential composition      nondeterministic choice    and test     since they are
eliminable in dlpa  therefore  it guarantees that in cp we could do the same kind of

    embedding of cp into starless dlpa
the above subsection has shown that the semantics of cp and dlpa are closely related 
however  dlpa has a built in assumption to the effect that any valuation  i e   set of
atoms  is feasible  from the point of view of cp this means that dlpa actually works with
universal models  cf  definition     here  we establish an embedding from cp interpreted
on universal models    to starless dlpa  consider the following translation from lcp  p 
    it must be observed that for this translation to work p should be finite  if not  then  p  is co finite
and  p  would not belong to lcp  
    this is the class of models one can axiomatize by extending the axiom system of figure   with axioms
of form hi where  ranges over propositional formulae encoding one single valuation

   discussion and related work
in this section we provide a summary of the results presented and discuss their implications 
we also position our work with respect to existing contributions in the literature on logic
and games 
    discussion
the paper has introduced a modal logic that arises naturally by interpreting modal operators on the equivalence relations induced by finite sets of propositional atoms  this logic 
called cp  has been axiomatized and embedded  exponentially  into s   cp has then been
used as a tool to compare three logics of one shot strategic interactionatemporal stit 
the coalitional logic of propositional control clpc and the dynamic logic of propositional
assignments dlpa  all these logics have been embedded into cp 
these embeddings  recall figure    put us in the position to to draw the following
general remarks 
 it appears to be justified to talk about a common ceteris paribus structure underpinning several of the main logics of game forms as they are all embeddable into cp 
this illustrates a striking uniformity in the logical tools needed for expressing choice
and effectivity of games in logical languages  and cp appears to offer a well suited
abstraction for systematizing existing formalisms 
 furthermore  all these logics are embeddable in s   either directly or via cp   highlighting the fact that in order to reason about choice and effectivity in games one
essentially reasons over suitably defined partitions of the state space 
 new interesting and so far unexplored embeddings are obtainable as corollaries  in
particular  it follows from our results that atemporal stit on bounded models can be
embedded into starless dlpa via cp 
 via logic s   one can easily show that embeddings in the other directions are also
possible  albeit at exponential cost   so that all arrows in figure   may actually
be made symmetric  s  embeds cp  but it is also directly embeddable in all the
mentioned logic  as they all contain the universal modality  in the following forms  hi
in cp  hagt      stiti in atemporal stit  agt in clpc and hp  i       hpn i in
dlpa  where p            pn is an enumeration of p  
all in all our results unveil a strikingand to some extent unexpecteduniformity
underpinning all the formalisms we considered 
    related work
we review two sets of related contributions 
      cp and modal ceteris paribus logics
there are two logics in the modal logic literature that are strictly related to cp  release
logic  and the logic of ceteris paribus preference 
   

fithe ceteris paribus structure of logics of game forms

release logic is a relatively less known formalism in the landscape of modal logics for
artificial intelligence  it has been introduced and studied by krabbendam and meyer       
      in order to provide a modal logic characterization of a general notion of irrelevancy 
modal operators in release logic are s  operators indexed by subsets of a finite set iss of
abstract elements denoting the issues that are taken to be irrelevant  or that can be released 
while evaluating the formula in the scope of the operator  a release model is therefore a tuple
 w   rx  xiss   v   where all rx are equivalence relations with the additional constraint
that if x  y then rx ry   that is  by releasing more issues one obtains a more coarse
equivalence relation  formally  this is the semantics of release operators 
m  w    x   w   w   w rx w  and m  w     
where x  iss and m    w   rx  xiss   v   
one can easily observe that  by fact    clause  ii    cp models are release models where
iss   p and where the release relation rx  x   vice versa  for iss   p  not all release
models are cp models  as a consequence  the logic of hxi operators in cp is a conservative
extension of the logic of x release operators 
preference logic has also long been concerned with so called ceteris paribus preferences 
that is  preferences incorporating an all other things being equal condition  a first logical
analysis of such preferences dates back to von wrights work         where dyadic modal
operators are studied representing statements like  is preferred to   ceteris paribus  more
recently  van benthem et al         studied a modal logic of ceteris paribus preferences based
on standard unary modal operators  leaving the preferential component of such logic aside 
its ceteris paribus fragment concerns sentences of the form hi whose intuitive meaning
is there exists a state which is equivalent to the current  evaluation  state with respect to
all the formulae in the  finite  set  and which satisfies   where the formulae in  are not
only atoms but formulae from the full language  logic cp is  therefore  a fragment of the
ceteris paribus logic studied by van benthem et al  where  is allowed to consist only of a
finite set of atoms 
      other contributions to a systematization of game logics
despite the wealth of approaches that can be found in the literature on game logics  only very
few papers have attempted some form of comparison spanning across several formalisms 
and attempting some kind of systematization  two in particular are worth mentioning here 
the most recent one is herzigs work         which provides a very comprehensive
analysis of the field by classifying the existing logics depending on what aspects of agency
 e g   whether they capture strategic interaction or not  whether they handle uncertainty
and epistemic attitudes  they capture in their languages  the logics we considered in this
paper  for instance  would fall into the strategic and no uncertainty categories according to
the terminology used by herzig  this analysis is conceptual and predominantly driven by
syntactic features of the logics  that is  by the theorems about agency that they enable 
an earlier work which is methodologically closer to ours in its focus on semantics is
goranko and jamrogas work         that paper compares atl  its epistemic variant atel
 epistemic atl  van der hoek   wooldridge        and ecl  extended cl    pauly       
    this is cl extended with a kleene star operator 

   

figrossi  lorini    schwarzentruber

providing constructive transformations between their models and establishing  in particular 
that atl subsumes ecl and that atel can be embedded into atl preserving satisfiability 

   conclusions and future work
the paper has provided a unification of the  to date  most influential logics for the representation of one shot strategic interactionatemporal stit  clpc and starless dlpa
under the ceteris paribus abstraction formalized in logic cp 
one natural future research direction presents itself  which consists in extending logic
cp with a kleene star operator  in analogy with dlpa  we conjecture dlpa to be
embeddable into cp with kleene star and it remains to be investigated whether such new
logic could play the same unifying role for logics of extensive form games  that we show it
plays in the atemporal case  this will complete the systematization program initiated by
the current paper 
related to the above question  but in a somewhat more technical vein  we have shown
in this paper that cp and atemporal individual stit have the same high complexity of
the satisfiability problem when we consider the whole languages  the study of efficient
syntactic fragments is then important and we intend to pursue this study in parallel both
for cp and for atemporal individual stit  we expect that several complexity results about
fragments of atemporal stit may be transferred to fragments of cp and viceversa

proof   i  let us suppose that p   ctrlj   we are going to prove that p  ctrlagt  j  
from p   ctrlj it follows that for all w  w we have m  v   stit p for some v  rj  w  
this implies that for all i  j and for all w  w we have m  w   stit   i    stit p 
  i    stit p  from m  w    stit compl it follows that there is i  agt   j such
that m  w   stit   i    stit p    i    stit p for all w  w   the latter implies that
p  ctrlagt  j   the other direction  i e   p  ctrlj implies p   ctrlagt  j   follows from

that relations rj are reflexive  it follows that  for all p  x
  there exists i  j such that

m  w   stit   i    stit p and for all p  x there exists i  j such that m  v   stit   i

we have m  w   stit  j   stit p and

for all p  v

we transform the stit model m in a clpc model m    p            pn   x    as follows 
 for all p  p  p  x  if and only if w   v  p  
 for all p  p and for all i  agt   p  pi if and only if p  ctrli  
by the item  i  of lemma   it is easy to check that m is indeed a clpc model  in
particular  p            pn is a partition of p among the agents in agt  
by induction on the structure of  and by using lemma   it is straightforward to prove
that m   cp   the only interesting case is    j  
m  w    stit hagt   j   stititr    
iff m  v   stit tr     for some v  ragt  j  w   
iff there exists xj  pj s t

 by i h   and items  ii  and  iii 
of lemma   
iff m   cp j 
this completes the proof
