abstract
for many election systems  bribery  and related  attacks have been shown np hard using constructions on combinatorially rich structures such as partitions and covers  this paper shows that for voters who follow the most central political science model of electorates
single peaked preferencesthose hardness protections vanish  by using single peaked preferences to simplify combinatorial covering challenges  we for the first time show that nphard bribery problemsincluding those for kemeny and llull electionsfall to polynomial
time for single peaked electorates  by using single peaked preferences to simplify combinatorial partition challenges  we for the first time show that np hard partition of voters problems fall to polynomial time for single peaked electorates  we show that for single peaked
electorates  the winner problems for dodgson and kemeny elections  though p   complete
in the general case  fall to polynomial time  and we completely classify the complexity of
weighted coalition manipulation for scoring protocols in single peaked electorates 

   introduction
elections are perhaps the most important framework for preference aggregation  an election
system  or election rule  is a mapping that takes as input the preferences of the voters with
respect to the set of candidates  alternatives  and returns a set of winners  which is some
subset of the candidate set  elections are central in preference aggregation among humans
in everything from political elections to selecting good singers on popular television shows 
elections are rapidly increasing in importance in electronic settings such as multiagent
systems  and have been used or proposed for such varied tasks as recommender systems

elections may have huge numbers of voters and alternatives

np hardness results  which apply to many important election systems such as plurality 
single transferable voting  and approval voting 
in the past few years  a flurry of papers have come out asking whether the np hardness
protections are satisfying  in particular  the papers explore the possibility that heuristic
algorithms may do well frequently or that approximation algorithms may exist  these
papers can themselves be questioned  for example  the most influential frequency paper  friedgut  kalai    nisan        see also its journal version  friedgut  kalai  keller 
  nisan        assumes each voter has a random and independent candidate preference
ordering  and that model does not seem to reflect typical voter behavior  and as to approximations  there is work showing that for certain voter control settings  different than those
studied in this paper  there are polynomial time algorithms that use  for example  at most
the log of the number of candidates times as many added voters as an optimal approach
would need  faliszewski  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra         however  a campaign
manager might well not have the financial resources to motivate that many extra people to
come out and vote  but rather would want to know the smallest possible number of votes
to add to reach victory 
the present paper questions the np hardness results from a completely different direction  in political science  perhaps the most canonical model of electorates is the unidimensional single peaked model  in that model  the electorate has preferences over some
one dimensional spectrum  e g   very liberal through very conservative  along which the
candidates are also located  and in which each voters preferences  loosely put  have a
peak  with affinity declining as one moves away from the peak  a brilliant paper by walsh
       recently asked whether np hardness protections against manipulation fall apart if
electorates are single peaked  for the case walsh looked at  the answer he proved is no 
he looked at a particular np hardness manipulation protection and proved it holds even
for single peaked societies  faliszewski  hemaspaandra  hemaspaandra  and rothe

table    how single peakedness  often  lowers the complexity of some key election problems 

fering conclusion that for many crucial cases  np hardness protections against manipulation
and control vanish for single peaked electorates 
the present paper is in this young line of research on complexity of manipulative actions
in the context of single peaked electorates  our work seeks to take this line of research in
new directions  and to improve one existing direction  through the following contributions 
   we  section    show that checking who the winner is in dodgson  young  and kemeny elections  which is known to be p   complete in the general case  respectively due
to hemaspaandra  hemaspaandra    rothe        due to this papers theorem a  
based on adapting a proof of rothe  spakowski    vogel        and due to hemaspaandra  spakowski    vogel         is in polynomial time for single peaked electorates
 corollary     and theorem      
our algorithm that shows this for dodgson elections is a good example of the general
technical theme of this paper  that single peakedness often precludes combinatorial explosion  in this particular case  single peakedness will simplify the seemingly
exponential sized search space over series of exchanges to provide upper bounds on
dodgson scores  and will allow us to instead search over a polynomial sized possibility space related to a particular  simple set of exchanges happening and limited to at
most two voters 
   we  section    for the first time study the effect of single peaked electorates on the
complexity of bribery  we show that many np hardness protections against bribery
   

fibrandt  brill  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra

in the general case vanish for single peaked electorates   table   provides some key
examples of this and other examples of lowering complexity   to show this  we
give polynomial time bribery algorithms for single peaked electorates in many settings  our polynomial time algorithms apply to approval voting  theorem     and
theorem      and to the rich range of weak condorcet consistent election systems
and even to systems that are merely known to be weak condorcet consistent when
the electorate is single peaked  corollary       including weakblack  weakdodgson 
fishburn  kemeny  llull  maximin  schwartz  young  and the two variants of nanson
due to fishburn and schwartz 
the right general interpretation of what underlies this is that the np hardness results
use  in the outputs of the reductions establishing np hardness  sets of voter preferences
that are so intricate that they simply cannot be realized by single peaked societies  the
practical lesson is that we should be very skeptical about np completeness results if
our electorate may have limitations  such as single peakedness  on the ensembles of
votes it produces  and the specific technical reason we can obtain polynomial time
bribery algorithms is that the np hardness proofs were based on the combinatorially
rich structure of covering problems  whose core challenge is the incomparability of
voters   but we will  see the proof of theorem      use single peakedness to create
a directional attack on covering problems that has the effect of locally removing
incomparability 
   we  section    for the first time study the effect of single peaked electorates on the
complexity of control by partition of voters  in which the voters are partitioned into
two groups that vote on the candidates in primary elections  and only the winners
of the primaries compete in the final election  this is one of the seven types of control
introduced in the seminal control paper of bartholdi et al          but control by
partition of voters has not been previously addressed for the single peaked case  we
show that some known np hardness protections against control by partition vanish
for single peaked electorates  and we do so by giving polynomial time algorithms for
single peaked control by partition  theorems     and      and corollary      
the general interpretation and practical lesson from this are the same as was just
mentioned for the bribery case  however  the technical way we obtain this control bypartition result differs here  the technical challenge here is the exponential number
of partitions  and our algorithms circumvent this by using single peakedness to allow
us to in effect structure that huge number of partitions into a polynomial number of
classes of partitions such that for each class we can look just at the class rather than
having to explore each of its member partitions 
the shared technical theme here and in the bribery case is that single peakedness can
be used to tame the combinatorial explosion  of partitions and covers  that in the
general case protected elections from attack  and in particular single peakedness yields
polynomial time attack algorithms 
   our final contribution  section    is a strong extension of an important result from
faliszewski et al          for the broad class of election systems known as scoring
protocols  faliszewski et al  gave a complete characterization of the computational
   

fibypassing combinatorial protections

complexity of the  weighted  coalition  manipulation problem in the case of singlepeaked elections with three candidates  such characterizations are important as they
tell both which systems are easily manipulable and what it is about the systems
that makes them easily manipulable  we extend this by providing  for single peaked
electorates  a complete characterization of easy manipulability for scoring protocols
 theorem       that is  we extend the three candidate theorem of faliszewski et al 
       to a result that holds for any number of candidates  and that allows one to
immediately read off the complexity of manipulation of any scoring protocol  for
single peaked electorates 
our proof organization is as follows  each of our four result sections contains one
spotlight theorem  whose proof we give within the section itself  these proofs seek to
give the key flavor of our techniques  and in text just before these proofs we will often try to
informally describe these proofs ideas or approaches  the first three of the four spotlight
proofs directly support  as does the fourth spotlight proof in part  this papers technical
theme that single peakedness tames combinatorial explosion  the appendix contains  for
completeness  proofs of all our other results  and some definitions omitted from the main
text 

   preliminaries
this section presents preliminaries on such topics as election systems  preferences  notions
related to condorcet consistency  and single peakedness 
    election systems  preferences  and weakcondorcet consistency
an election system  or election rule  is a mapping from a finite set of candidates c and
a finite collection v of voter preferences over those candidates to a collection w  c
called the winner set   for all but one of the election systems we cover  each voters
preference is a linear order  by which we always mean a strict linear order  an irreflexive 
antisymmetric  complete  transitive relation  over the candidates  for the election system
called approval voting  each voter votes by a bit vector  approving or disapproving of each
candidate separately  voters preferences are input as a list of ballots  i e   votes   so if
multiple voters have the same preference  the ballot of each will appear separately in v  
we now very briefly describe the election systems most central to this paper  in approval
voting  preferences are approval vectors  and each candidate who gets the highest number of
approvals among the candidates belongs to the winner set  in all the other systems we use 
voters will vote by linear orders  a candidate is said to be a condorcet winner  respectively 
weak condorcet winner    if that candidate is preferred to each other candidate by a strict
majority  respectively  by at least half  of the voters  in condorcet voting  or condorcet
elections  the winners are precisely the set of condorcet winners  in the election system
   in social choice theory  this is called a social choice correspondence  social choice theorists often exclude
the case allowing the function to have an empty set of winners  but following bartholdi et al        
and many computationally oriented papers  we do not artificially exclude that case in our definitions 
however  except for elections with zero candidates  the only systems we discuss that might ever output
an empty set of winners are condorcet and weakcondorcet 

   

fibrandt  brill  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra

weakcondorcet  the winners are precisely the set of weak condorcet winners  it has been
known for two hundred years that some election instances have neither condorcet winners
nor weak condorcet winners  condorcet         and of course  no election instance can
have more than one condorcet winner  whereas there might be several weak condorcet
winners 
let           be a rational number  copeland  copeland        for        
faliszewski et al       a  for general rational   is the election system defined as follows 
for each pair of distinct candidates  consider the one  if any  who is preferred between
the two by a strict majority of the voters  that one gets one copeland point from
the pairwise contest and the other gets zero copeland points  if the candidates in the
pair tie in their pairwise contest  which can happen only when the number of voters is
even   each gets  points  when       copeland is known as llull  a system defined
by the mystic ramon llull in the thirteenth century  see hagele   pukelsheim        
llulls election system is known to be remarkably resistant  computationally  to bribery
and control attacks  faliszewski et al       a  although see also erdelyi  nowak    rothe 
      erdelyi   rothe        erdelyi  piras    rothe        and menton        for different
highly resistant systems  and see hemaspaandra  hemaspaandra    rothe        regarding
how extremely resistant artificial systems can be constructed  
an important class of elections  which we will focus on in section    is the class of
scoring protocols  each scoring protocol has a fixed number m of candidates and is defined
by a scoring vector                     m    nm             m   voters votes are
linear orders  and each voter contributes   points to his or her most preferred candidate 
  points to his or her next most preferred candidate  and so on  each candidate whose
total number of points is at least as great as the totals of each other candidate is a winner 
for example  m candidate plurality voting is the scoring protocol defined by the scoring
m 
z     
vector                       and m candidate borda voting is the scoring protocol defined by
the scoring vector     m     m                
kemeny elections are based on the
p concept of a kemeny consensus  each linear order   with minimum kemeny score  a bc  a   b k v  v   v prefers b to a k  is said to be
a kemeny consensus  as usual  ksk denotes the cardinality of finite set s  a candidate c
is a kemeny winner if c is ranked first in some kemeny consensus  kemeny elections were
introduced by kemeny        see also kemeny   snell        
in black elections  respectively  weakblack elections   if there is a condorcet winner  respectively  if there are weak condorcet winners   then that defines the winners  and otherwise bordas method is used to select the winners  black elections were introduced by black
       and weakblack elections  somewhat confusingly called black elections there  were
introduced by fishburn         in dodgson elections  respectively  weakdodgson elections  
whichever candidates can by the fewest repeated transpositions of adjacent candidates in
voters orders become condorcet winners  respectively  weak condorcet winners  are the
winners  dodgson elections were introduced in the     s by dodgson        and weakdodgson elections  somewhat confusingly called dodgson elections there  were introduced
by fishburn        and further studied by mccabe dansted  pritchard  and slinko        
in young elections  respectively  strongyoung elections   whichever candidates can by the
deletion of the fewest voters become weak condorcet  respectively  condorcet  winners are
   

fibypassing combinatorial protections

the winners  young elections were introduced by young        and strongyoung elections
 somewhat confusingly called young elections there  were introduced by rothe et al         
an important notion in this paper is that of being weakcondorcet consistent  an election system is said to be weakcondorcet consistent  which we earlier wrote  equivalently  as
weak condorcet consistent   if on every input that has at least one weak condorcet winner  the winners of the election system are exactly the set of weak condorcet winners  
some of our bribery results will hold for all election systems that are weakcondorcetconsistent  and even for all election systems that when restricted to single peaked electorates
are weakcondorcet consistent 
fishburn        has noted that the election systems weakblack  weakdodgson  fishburn  maximin  and young are weakcondorcet consistent  we add to that the observation
that llull elections are easily seen from their definition to be weakcondorcet consistent 
we also make the  new  observation that the election systems kemeny  schwartz  and the
two variants of nanson due to fishburn and schwartz are weakcondorcet consistent when
restricted to single peaked electorates   by fishburn        and niou        those systems
are known not to be weakcondorcet consistent in the general case   we also note that
black  dodgson  the original version of nanson  and for each            copeland elections are not weakcondorcet consistent even when restricted to single peaked electorates 
this is seen by the following universal counterexample  let there be two voters with preferences b   a   c and c   b   a  these preferences are single peaked with respect to
the societal ordering a l b l c  the notion of societal orders will be explained two paragraphs after the present one   candidates b and c are weak condorcet winners  but each
of the mentioned election systems chooses only b  similarly  we note that strongyoung is
not weakcondorcet consistent for single peaked electorates because in an election with two
voters whose preferences are a   b   c and c   b   a  all candidates are weak condorcet
winners  but strongyoung yields only candidates a and c  the appendix includes definitions
of the election systems fishburn  maximin  a k a  simpson   and nanson  and proves all of
the new observations made in this paragraph 
    single peaked preferences
this papers theme is that combinatorial protections crumble for the case of single peaked
electorates  we now briefly define what single peaked preferences are and what their motivation is 
the single peaked preference model was introduced over half a century ago by black
             and has been influential ever since  the model captures the case where the
electorate is polarized by a single issue or dimension  and each voters utility along that
dimension has either one peak or just rises or just falls  candidates have positions  locations 
along that dimension  and a voters preferences  in the linear order model  simply order the
candidates by utility  except with no ties allowed   since the utility curves are very flexible 
what this amounts to is that there is an overall societal ordering l of the candidates  and
each voter can be placed in some location such that for all the candidates to his or her
   the nomenclature in the literature is varied here  some authors use the term weak condorcetconsistent to mean systems that always select all weak condorcet winners but perhaps have additional winners  and what we denote weakcondorcet consistent is precisely what fishburn        calls
 obeying the  strict condorcet principle

right the preferences drop off and the same to the left  although within that framework 
the right and the left candidates can be interspersed with each other  a picture will make
this clearer  figure   shows an electorate with four voters and five candidates  in which
societys polarization is on a  liberal to conservative  axis  from the picture  we can see
that v  has preferences c    c    c    c    c    v  has preferences c    c    c    c    c   
v  has preferences  note the interleaving  c    c    c    c    c    and v  has preferences
c    c    c    c    c   
formally  there are many equivalent ways to capture this behavior  and we use the
following as our definition  a collection v of votes  each a linear ordering  i of the
candidates  over candidate set c is said to be single peaked exactly if there exists a linear ordering l over c such that for each triple of candidates a  b  and c  it holds that
 a l b l c  c l b l a    i   a  i b  b  i c  
the single peaked model has been intensely studied  and has both strengths and limitations  on the positive side  it is an excellent rough model for a wide range of elections 
votes ranging from american presidential elections to us supreme court votes to hiring
votes within a cs department are often shockingly close to reflecting single peaked preferences  it certainly is a vastly more reasonable model in most settings than is assuming
that all voters are random and independent  although the latter model has been receiving
a huge amount of study recently  in fact  a wide range of scholarly studies have argued for
the value of the single peaked model  black              davis  hinich    ordeshook       
niemi   wright        procaccia   rosenschein        krehbiel         and the model is
one of the first taught to students in positive  i e   theoretical  political science courses  on
the other hand  some electorates certainly are driven by multidimensional concerns  and
even a heavily unidimensional electorate may have a few outside the box voters  e g   voters
who in an election polarized on a liberal conservative axis decide their votes instead based
on  for example  religion or race   simply put  it is a model  and so it speaks of a simplified
version of the world 
   

fibypassing combinatorial protections

the single peaked model also makes sense for approval voting  faliszewski et al         
there  a voter intuitively may be thought to have some utility threshold starting at which he
or she approves of candidates  what this means is that each voters approved candidates
must be contiguous within societys linear order l  formally  we define this by saying
that an election instance  of approval voters  is single peaked exactly if there exists a linear
order l such that for each triple of candidates a  b  and c  we have a l b l c   i    a  c  
approvesi  b  approvesi    where approvesi is the set of candidates voter i approves 
following the suggestion in walshs        seminal work  we will assume  except when
we make something else clear  that societys linear order is part of the input in our singlepeaked winner  bribery  manipulation  and control problems  however  we mention in
passing that given an election instance  one can in polynomial time tell whether the voters
are single peaked and when so can also in polynomial time compute a societal linear order
instantiating the single peakedness  by bartholdi and trick        doignon and falmagne 
      and escoffier  lang  and ozturk        for linear order preferences and  as pointed
out in theorem     of faliszewski et al         by fulkerson and gross        and booth
and lueker        for approval preferences   one of course also can easily  in polynomial
time  check whether a given linear order is one with respect to which a given set of votes is
single peaked 
because we want to get to the results as quickly as possible  we will define the needed
notions of winner  bribery  control  and manipulation each at the start of the section on the
particular topic 

   weakcondorcet elections  single peaked electorates  and bypassing
winner problem complexity
the main results sections of this paper study whether single peakedness bypasses
complexity theoretic protections against attacks on elections  before moving to those sections  we quickly present some results showing that single peakedness also bypasses the
complexity results some systems have for even telling who won  unlike the protection
from attack complexity shield bypassings  which are in some sense bad news  for the security of the election systems   these winner hardness complexity shield bypassings are
good newstaming the complexity of election systems such as dodgson and kemeny for the
single peaked case  despite the fact that they are known to have np hard winner problems
in the general case 
for a given election system e  the winner problem takes as input an election   c  v   
and a candidate p  c  and asks if p is a winner in the election whose candidates are c and
whose votes are v  where v is a collection of votes over the candidate set c   when we
speak of the single peaked case of the winner problem  the input will also contain a linear
order l relative to which the election is single peaked   formally  part of the winner problem
task is to check that the input indeed is single peaked relative to l  however  since that
is a polynomial time check for all caseslinear orders and approval vectorsthat we deal
with  we will tacitly view the appropriateness of l as a syntactic condition on the input 
although it is not really syntactic   note that the weakcondorcet winner problem is in p
in the general case and thus certainly in the single peaked case  furthermore  something

used often in our papers proofs is the following standard fact about condorcet voting and
medians 
fact      let  c  v   be an election with votes being linear orders over c  and let l be
a linear order with respect to which  c  v   is single peaked  associate each voter with the
candidate at the top of that voters preference ordering  order the voters with respect to l
in terms of that association 
if kv k is odd there is a unique weakcondorcet and condorcet winner and that winner
is the top preference of the median voter  if kv k is even the weakcondorcet winner set is
the set of all candidates who in l fall in the range  inclusively  from the top preference of
the leftmost of the two median voters through the top preference of the rightmost of the two
median voters  and if those two coincide  then that candidate is a condorcet winner and
otherwise there is no condorcet winner  
for example  if this is our ordered by l picture of the candidates and what the voters
top choices are 
v

then c    c    and c  are weak condorcet winners  since each of these candidates is preferred
to all candidates to its right by v    v    and v    and to all candidates to its left by v    v   
and v    c  is not a weak condorcet winner  since all voters other than v  prefer c  to c   
c  and c  are not weak condorcet winners  since v    v    v    and v  prefer c  to c  and c   
finally  note that there is no condorcet winner  since any condorcet winner is a unique
weak condorcet winner 
an immediate consequence of fact     is the well known fact that for single peaked
elections  there is always at least one weak condorcet winner  we are tacitly here assuming
c       since we earlier noted that the winner problem is in p for weakcondorcet elections 
the following holds 
theorem      for each election system e that is weakcondorcet consistent when restricted
to single peaked electorates  the winner problem is in p when restricted to single peaked
elections 
of course  for many such systems the winner problem is obviously in p even in general 
yet we do get some interesting consequences from theorem     such as the following  recall
from section   that young and weakdodgson are weakcondorcet consistent  and kemeny
is weakcondorcet consistent when restricted to single peaked electorates  
corollary      when restricted to single peaked electorates  the winner problems for kemeny  young  and weakdodgson elections are in p 
in contrast  the general case kemeny winner problem problem was proven by hemaspaandra et al         to be p   complete   and we prove in this paper that the generalcase winner problems for young and weakdodgson elections are p   complete as well  see

theorems a   and a   in the appendix   so  theorem     implies sharp complexity simplifications for these three election systems  we mention in passing that for even the generalization of single peakedness known as bounded single peaked width  cornaz  galand 
  spanjaard         work of cornaz  galand  and spanjaard        that was done subsequent to our corollary      brandt  brill  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra        shows
that in polynomial time one can find a kemeny winner  and can find the score that that
winnerand thus all kemeny winnerswill have   this does not necessarily mean that one
has a polynomial time algorithm for testing  in their generalized setting  whether a given
candidate is a kemeny winner  
the identify with weakcondorcet approach that just worked on young and weakdodgson elections does not apply to dodgson and strongyoung elections  however  we
have constructed direct algorithms that solve their winner problems in polynomial time
in the single peaked case  we state that as a theorem  and prove it immediately as our
spotlight proof for this section 
theorem      when restricted to single peaked electorates  the winner problems for dodgson and strongyoung elections are in p 
proof  recall the following easy characterization of condorcet winners in the singlepeaked setting  if kv k is odd  the top choice of the median voter is a condorcet winner 
if kv k is even  there are two cases  either both median voters have the same top choice or
not  in the former case  the median voters preferred candidate is a condorcet winner  and
in the latter case there is no condorcet winner  since the top choices of two medians  if
different  will tie each other  
given an election instance  c  v   and a valid single peaked order l  we now show how
to compute all strongyoung winners in polynomial time  recall that strongyoung winners
are all candidates that can be made condorcet winners by the fewest voter deletions  we
mention that if c    there can never be winners  if there are zero voters  all candidates
are strongyoung winners  as they all tie at distance   by convention   if  c  v   has a
condorcet winner  then that is the unique strongyoung winner  otherwise kv k    is even
and the two median voters have different top choices  say m  and mr   then the strongyoung
winner set is  m    mr    as those two candidates have a strongyoung score of    no one has
score    and everyone else has score at least   
we now show that algorithm    which clearly runs in polynomial time  computes all
dodgson winners  recall that dodgson winners are the candidates who can by the fewest
repeated transpositions of adjacent candidates in voters orders  so called switches  become
condorcet winners  if kck      then there are no winners  if kv k      all of c ties
as winners  and if  c  v   has a condorcet winner  this candidate is the unique dodgson
winner  so assume kv k    is even and the two median voters have different top choices 
say m  and mr   m  l mr   and no candidate has dodgson score    the intuition behind the
   regarding this and the line in algorithm   handling the zero voter or zero candidate case  one might
wonder why we dont just define all our election problems to not allow those cases  the answer is  first 
that it is unattractive to simplify proofs by altering problems  but  more compellingly  control problems
are important to our and other papers  and control problems on inputs not having a small number
of candidates  respectively  voters  can themselves create situations with small numbers of candidates
 respectively  voters   in particular  legal partitions within partition control types can leave one with no
candidates or no voters

algorithm is as follows  we show that every dodgson winner is a weak condorcet winner 
and we show that we can always turn a weak condorcet winner into a condorcet winner
with a minimum number of switches by making changes in only two voters   the proof
of correctness follows immediately from claims     and     below  note that by fact     
the set of weak condorcet winners consists of all candidates who in l fall in the range 
inclusively  from m  to mr   we will denote this set by  m    mr  l  
claim      algorithm   will find the correct dodgson score of each candidate p   m    mr  l  
claim      every dodgson winner is in  m    mr  l  
in our proofs of these two claims  we use the following simple claim 
claim     

   let p   m    mr  l   if  a l b l p or p l b l a  and a ties p  then b ties p 

   if mr l d  then mr beats d  if d l m    then m  beats d  
proof of claim     
   we know that half of the voters prefer a to p and half of the voters prefer p to a  all
voters that prefer a to p also prefer b to p  this implies that p at best ties b  by
fact      p is a weak condorcet winner  it follows that p ties b 
   we prove the first statement  the proof of the second statement is analogous  suppose
for a contradiction that that mr does not beat d  since mr is a weak condorcet winner 
mr ties d  let db be the candidate immediately to the right of mr  with respect to l  
using part   of this claim  it follows that db ties mr  
since db is not a weak condorcet winner  there exists a candidate c such that c beats
b note that c l mr l db or mr l db l c  if c l mr l d 
b then every voter who prefers c
d 
b and so mr beats d 
b which contradicts the fact that mr ties
to db also prefers mr to d 
b
b
d  if mr l d l c  then every voter who prefers c to db also prefers db to mr   and so c
and db beat mr   which contradicts the fact that mr is a weak condorcet winner 
q claim    
proof of claim      consider an optimal  with respect to the number of switches  way
to turn p into a condorcet winner  we first assume that t      and that tr      let c  be
the leftmost candidate in t  and let cr be the rightmost candidate in tr   since p needs to
gain a vote over c    there exists a voter v  such that c   v  p and p gets switched beyond c 
in v    since p needs to gain a vote over cr   there exists a voter vr such that cr  vr p and p
gets switched beyond cr in vr   let a    b    and c  be sets of candidates such that v  s order
is of the form
a    c    b    p   c   
   one might think that turning a weak condorcet winner into a condorcet winner would be equivalent
to making sure that the median voters have this candidate as their top choice  however  note that
the electorate may no longer be single peaked after switches  and so the footnoted statement is more
surprising and harder to prove then one might think 
   note that it is possible for a candidate that is not a weak condorcet winner to tie a weak condorcet
winner  for example  in the universal counterexample at the end of section a    candidate a  which
is not a weak condorcet winner  ties weak condorcet winner c

that the algorithm computes an upper bound on the dodgson score  since p is made a

in both cases  the algorithm uses kb  k       ka   t  k switches on v    the same argument
shows that the algorithm uses kbr k       kar  tr k switches on vr   this clearly makes p
a condorcet winner using kb  k   kbr k       ka   t  k   kar  tr k switches  since this is

q theorem    
both claims in theorem     contrast directly with the known p   completeness of the
general case dodgson  hemaspaandra et al         and strongyoung  rothe et al        
winner problems  and thus reflect a substantial complexity simplification that holds when
electorates are single peaked  in this section we have focused on the election systems of
dodgson  kemeny  and young  which are natural  important and were the first three election
systems to be proven to have p   complete winner problems  for at least one of their strong
or weak variants   we commend to the reader the issue of obtaining  for other election
systems with hard winner problems  reductions in winner complexity for the single peaked
case 
although theorem     is about winners rather than about bribery manipulation control
protections  its proof is a good  simple example of this papers theme that single peakedness
tames combinatorial explosions  taking dodgson as an example  in the general case  not
necessarily single peaked votes   the set of paths to potentially implement best dodgson
scores is combinatorially explosive  to the best of current knowledge   in contrast  in the
single peaked case in searching for paths to implement best dodgson scores it turns out
we can restrict ourselves to changing just two voters in a particularly simple way that yields
a polynomial sized set of options in our search space

    notions
all bribery notions presented here  except negative approval bribery  are from the paper that started the complexity theoretic study of bribery  faliszewski  hemaspaandra   
hemaspaandra         given an election system e  the e bribery problem takes as input
c  v   p  c  and k                    and asks if  by changing the votes of at most k members of v   p can be made a winner of this election with respect to e  that is the basic
bribery problem  and it can be modified by any combination of the following items   
means each voter has a price  belonging to                   and the question is whether there
is some set of voters whose total price is at most k such that by changing their votes we
can make p be a winner  the intuition for prices is that some voters can be swayed more
easily than others  weighted means each vote has a weight  belonging to                   
and each weight w vote is bribed as an indivisible object  but when applying e  is viewed
as w identical regular votes  the intuition for weights is that in some electionse g   by
stockholdersvoters have differing weights 
for the case where v consists of linear orders  by negative we mean that if we bribe a
voter then after that bribe the voter must not have p as his or her top choice unless p already
was the top choice before the bribe   the intuition is that in negative bribery one is trying
to stay under the radar by not directly helping ones candidate  for voting by approval
vectors  we give definitions to capture both the analog of the linear preference negative
notion we just defined  negative  and of the one one would get by taking faliszewski
et al         utterly literally  strong negative see footnote   for more background 
for approval vector votes  by negative we mean that when you bribe a voter  his or her
after bribe vector can approve p only if his or her before bribe vector approved p  by
strongnegative we mean that when you bribe a voter the voter after being bribed cannot
approve p  the notions described above can occur in any combination  e g   we can speak
of llull negative weighted  bribery 
when we speak of the single peaked case of any of the above  we mean the electorate
is single peaked  and an l relative to which the votes are single peaked is itself part of
the input  further  all bribes must result only in votes that are consistent with the input
societal order l  taking l as part of the input  and as binding the legal bribes  is the
natural bribery analog of the manipulation model of walsh        and faliszewski et al 
        binding the bribes to respect l is natural  e g   if l is widely known  the central
authority may simply reject  as obviously manipulative votes  votes that violate l  but
although this is our core model  many of our results carry over to models more flexible on
these points  and we will at times point that outsee footnote    footnote    and the final
paragraph of section     
   the faliszewski et al         definition of negative bribery more naturally can be read to have the quite
different semantics that each bribed voter must  after the bribe  not have p as his or her top choice 
since that paper used negative bribery only for plurality  this issue made no difference in that paper  and
indeed since we look at negative bribery for linear orders here mostly with respect to weakcondorcet
in single peaked contexts  it is not a key issue here either  but we have switched to a definition that
captures a more attractive notion  you cannot directly boost your preferred candidate p to the top  but
for votes where p is already at the top you can shift the remaining preferences  the distinction between
these two approaches to negative does change proofs for the case of approval voting  and so for that
we will give separate definitions that capture each notion 

   

fibypassing combinatorial protections

we will often speak about bribery  or  later  manipulation and control  problems being
in p  or in polynomial time   although formally that just asserts that a p algorithm
exists to say whether a successful bribery  or manipulation or control  action exists  in fact
in every such instance we in our proof show how to in addition obtain an actual  successful
bribery  or manipulation or control  action when one exists  the reason this is worth
mentioning is that  even in the context of elections  search can plausibly be harder than
decision  hemaspaandra  hemaspaandra    menton        
    approval bribery results
as our spotlight result for approval bribery  we will prove that the bribery protection that
complexity gives there fails on single peaked electorates 
theorem      faliszewski et al          approval bribery is np complete 
theorem      approval bribery is in p for single peaked electorates  
before we prove theorem      we will informally explain what key challenge  namely 
incomparability  exists regarding proving it and how our proof overcomes that challenge
 namely  by using directionality  
so  recall that in approval bribery in the single peaked setting  the societal order  l  is
part of the input and each voter approves of some  possibly empty  set of candidates that are
contiguous with respect to l  suppose the input linear order l is c  l c  l c  l    l c   
with respect to which the society is single peaked  suppose the candidate the briber is trying
to make win is c     suppose that the input limit on the number of people the briber can
bribe is      and suppose our input election has      voters of which       call them v  
initially do not approve of c   and       call them v    initially do approve of c     now 
clearly  we will not spend any of our      bribes on voters from v    as those voters already
approve of c     and so bribing a voter from v  is never better than bribing a voter from
v   so  our goal is to seek a good set of      voters from v   if such exists 
the key challenge  even given single peakedness  can be stated in a word  incomparability  that is  given that we know that the number of approvals for c   will go up by exactly
     after the bribe  and given we know the total number of approvals each other candidate
gets before the bribe  we for each candidate ci other than c   have a target number ni
such that among the      votes we choose to bribe from v   at least ni must initially have
approved of ci  in order for c   to beat ci after the bribe  
now  here is the rub  consider two voters from v   one of whom approves of c   through
c   and the other of whom approves of c   through c     among these two votes  only the
former helps us address positive ni values for     i      and only the latter helps us
address positive ni values for     i      since neither voters approval set contains
the others  they offer differing advantages  and neither is  at first glance  obviously one
we should include in our       and in fact the      voters of v are a thicket of such
incomparabilities  indeed  trying to find a subset of size       in this particular example 
   this result holds both in the model where l is part of the input and the model in which we must find
an l consistent with the input and relative to which bribery is possible  the result also holds even in
the modelnot our core model for which we will prove itin which the bribed voters need not respect
the societal order after being bribed 

   

fibrandt  brill  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra

the number will vary with the input  feels very much like a covering problem  which in fact
is exactly the path by which the general case was proven np hard by faliszewski et al 
       
however  we will use single peakedness to tame the combinatorial challenge of choosing
a good subset  we in particular will use single peakedness to induce a directional attack
that will locally make incomparability disappear at each moment at which we need to make
a decision about choosing some of the        although the focus here is bribery  and our
construction and arguments are tailored to that  we mention that our line of attack is
modeled on what faliszewski et al         call smart greedy algorithms and that they
use to study control attacks   our full proof is in the appendix  but the key idea can be
easily conveyed if the reader will be so kind as to visualize along with us for a moment 
consider the largest i such that ni      and  for the purpose of this example  suppose
that i is strictly greater than   let us say that it is     and suppose n        then we
must include in the      at least three members of v who approve of c     but which
three  isnt incomparability still a problem  no  since we chose the largest i for which
ni      clearly n          n         so although among the voters in v who approve
of c   there may be incomparability of approval ranges  range differences to the right of
c   are utterly irrelevant  as c   is already beating all those candidates anyway  the only
interesting issue is  among the voters of v who approve of c     what their leftmost approved
candidate isthe more leftward the better as that will help on the most possible ni deficits 
but now we can do direct comparisons and take action  we will put into our      the
three voters  among the v voters who initially approve of c     whose approval range is the
leftmost   if v lacks three voters who approve c     then since n        successful bribery
is impossible   and the process now continues as one would expect  based on those three
votes  all ni values are updated and the next leftmost ni     satisfying i     is similarly
handled  and so until all ni     with i     are handled  and then starting from the other
end of l we will analogously handle c  through c     if we neutralize all ni     within
     bribes among v   we have a successful bribery  and otherwise none is possible  this
concludes our example of how single peakedness creates a directionality that tames the rich
covering problem caused by incomparability 
in fact  this example is essentially  if one removes the particular integer values we
used  a complete proof for the case that k  kv k  and note that if k  kv k  we can
always make p a winner by bribing all voters from v   since after the bribe all voters approve
of p  the following proof of theorem     gives a more careful exposition of the process 
however  a reader comfortable with the somewhat informal presentation just given may
wish to at least initially simply skip over the following detailed proof 
proof of theorem      let  c  v   be an instance of a single peaked election where the
societal order l is given by c  l c  l    l ckck and let k be our bribe limit  we have to
decide whether a designated candidate p  c can be made an approval winner by bribing
at most k voters  without loss of generality  we can assume that after the bribe  all bribed
voters approve of p and disapprove of all other candidates 
partition the multiset v of all voters into the multiset v  of voters that approve of p
and the multiset v of voters that disapprove of p  if k  kv k  we can obviously make p a
winner by bribing all voters from v   since after the bribe all voters approve of p   the only
case in which we need to bribe a voter from v  is if everybody approves p  i e   v     
   

fibypassing combinatorial protections

there exists a candidate other than p that is also approved by every voter  and we want
to make p the unique approval winner  in this case  bribing one arbitrary voter obviously
suffices  
now assume that k   kv k  without loss of generality  we can assume that we bribe
exactly k voters  because there is a successful bribe that involves at most k voters if and only
if there is a successful bribe that involves exactly k voters  we can also argue that bribing
a voter from v  is never more profitable than bribing a voter from v   the reason is that
for each ci  c   p   bribing a voter from v  lowers the quantity number of approvals
for ci  number of approvals for p by at most    whereas bribing a voter from v lowers
this quantity by at least    thus we assume without loss of generality that we bribe only
voters from v and we know that after the bribe  p has exactly b
k   kv  k   k approvals 
for each candidate ci  c   p   let vci be the multiset of voters that approve of ci and
define the surplus ni of ci as ni   kvci k  b
k  in order to make p a winner  we have to bribe
at least ni voters from vci  v for all candidates ci that have a positive surplus 
let us first consider candidates to the right of p  i e   candidates c with p l c  in order
to avoid incomparability problems  we start at the right end of l  let ci be the rightmost
candidate that has a positive surplus ni      we know that we have to bribe at least ni
voters from vci  v   but the question is which ones  as nj    for all j   i  we can solely
focus on candidates to the left of ci and bribe the ni voters from vci  v whose approval
range extends the furthest to the left of ci   after the bribe  those voters approve of p only 
we have thereby achieved that ni     and it is clear that our choice was optimal in the sense
that no other choice would have removed a greater number of approvals from candidates
other than p  ignoring candidates to the right of ci   
we now update the surplus for all candidates and move to the next rightmost candidate ci  to the right of p with a positive surplus   observe that i    i because for all j   i 
nj was initially nonpositive and the surplus of a candidate never grows when bribing a voter
to approve only of p   we repeat this procedure until all candidates to the right of p have
a nonpositive surplus  at which point we mirror the societal order and repeat the whole
process  thereby handling all candidates c with c l p 
if we exceed our bribe limit k during this process  there cannot be a successful bribery
action  all the choices we have made during the algorithm are provably at least as good
as any other choice would have been  if  on the other hand  bribing k    k voters suffices
to make all surpluses nonpositive  we bribe  k  k     additional voters chosen arbitrarily
from v  to ensure that p has b
k approvals  and have thereby found a successful bribery
action 
q theorem    
by the same general approach used to prove theorem    using a directional attack
to in the single peaked setting tame the incomparability challenges of covering problems
we can establish the following two additional cases in which np hard bribery problems fall
to p for the single peaked case 
theorem      the following hold  
   the claim is in our standard model  nonunique winner model  i e   we ask if the preferred candidate p can
be made to be a winner   the societal order l is given as part of the input  and bribed voters must still
respect l  however  we note in passing that the claim still holds with any of the choices one can make

we now state the following eight case result  the membership in p claims of theorem

and median voters  that theorems np completeness claims are shown by reductions from
the np complete problems knapsack and partition 
theorem      for single peaked electorates  weakcondorcet weighted  bribery  weakcondorcet negative weighted bribery  and weakcondorcet negative weighted  bribery are
np complete  and the remaining five cases  weakcondorcet bribery  weakcondorcet bribery  weakcondorcet weighted bribery  weakcondorcet negative bribery  weakcondorcetnegative  bribery  are in p 
theorem     is most interesting not for what it says about weakcondorcet elections 
but for its immediate consequences on other election systems 
corollary      let e be any election system that is weakcondorcet consistent or that is
merely weakcondorcet consistent on single peaked inputs  then the three np completeness
and five p results of theorem     hold  for single peaked electorates  for e 
from our discussions earlier in the paper  corollary     applies to the llull  kemeny 
young  weakdodgson  maximin  schwartz  weakblack  fishburn  and the two variants of
nanson due to fishburn and schwartz  in light of this  corollary     is quietly establishing
a large number of claims about np hardness shields failing for single peaked electorates 
for example  we have the following claims 
theorem      faliszewski et al          llull bribery  llull  bribery  llull weighted bribery 
and llull weighted  bribery are each np complete 
theorem      follows from corollary       for single peaked electorates  llull bribery 
llull  bribery  and llull weighted bribery are each in p and llull weighted  bribery is npcomplete 
regarding  nonunique winner model vs  unique winner model  l is part of the input vs  we are asking
whether there exists a valid l with respect to which a successful bribery can be accomplished  and the
bribed voters respect l model vs  the model in which the bribed voters may violate l  seeing that the
result holds in these various alternate models requires natural modifications of the proof in some cases
 e g   nonunique vs  unique   and requires taking advantage of specific properties of the construction in
other cases  e g   regarding allowing bribed voters to violate l  the constructions actually only bribe
voters to end up approving zero or one candidate  and such votes are consistent with every ordering

to the best of our knowledge  bribery of kemeny elections has never been studied  note 
however  that the winner problem for any election system e many one reduces to each of the
eight types of bribery problems mentioned in theorem      except with weakcondorcet
replaced by e  this holds because we can ask whether the preferred candidate wins
given the bribe limit of    and this captures the winner problem  so  from the known
p   completeness of the winner problem for kemeny elections  hemaspaandra et al         
we have the following result  which gives us eight contrasts of hardness  three between
p   hardness and np membership and five between p   hardness and p membership  
theorem      for kemeny elections  all eight types of bribery mentioned in theorem    
are p   hard 
theorem      follows from corollary       for single peaked electorates  kemeny weighted bribery  kemeny negative weighted bribery  kemeny negative weighted  bribery are npcomplete  and so in particular each belongs to np   for single peaked electorates  the
remaining five types of bribery of kemeny elections are in p 
as a final remark regarding theorem      we note that even within the single peaked
cases that it studies  there is one twist  in which changing from bribery to negative bribery
changes the complexity  namely  for single peaked electorates  weakcondorcet weightedbribery is in p but weakcondorcet negative weighted bribery is np complete  here  decreasing the set of bribes available to the briber actually boosts the complexity of the
bribers task   the explanation for this is  very loosely and intuitively speaking  that
among the set of bribes that negativity removes from the search space are the set of bribes
used in the p time nonnegative case bribery attack  

   control by partition of single peaked electorates
the control problems for elections ask whether by various types of changes in an elections
structure a given candidate can be made a winner   in some papers  seeking to make a
candidate a winner through structural changes is called constructive control to distinguish
it from the destructive case in which we are trying to preclude a candidate from winning 
however  in this paper we always use control in the constructive sense  unless we explicitly
mention otherwise   the types of control that were introduced in      by bartholdi  tovey 
and trick  and that  give or take some slight refinements  have been studied in subsequent
papers  are addition deletion partition of voters candidates  however  to the best of our
knowledge previous study of the complexity of control for single peaked electorates  such as
that of faliszewski et al         focused exclusively on additions and deletions of candidates
and voters 
we for the first time study the complexity of partition problems for the case of singlepeaked electorates  and we show that for a broad range of election systems the control by
partition of voters problem is in p for single peaked electorates  among the systems we do
this for are llull and condorcet elections  whose control by partition of voters problem is
known to be np complete for general electorates  our proofs again work by using singlepeakedness to tame combinatorial explosionin this case  the number of partitions that
must be examined is reduced from an exponential number of partitions to a polynomial
number of classes of partitions each of which can be checked as a block 
   

fibrandt  brill  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra

    notions
we will now define the key types of control that we will study  control by partition of
voters  control by adding voters  and control by deleting voters 
partition of voters models the case where the partitioned electorate has primaries  an
example from faliszewski et al       a  is a business group where a powerful manager studies
an issue by splitting his or her group into two task forces each to  by voting  recommend
alternatives to be part of a final vote to be conducted by the entire group  this  loosely 
corresponds to control by partition  control by adding voters loosely models such actions
as targeted get out the vote drives  control by deleting voters loosely models such actions
as targeted attempts at voter suppression 
for the partition case  in which there are two first round elections and a second round
election  there are two different approaches to which candidates move forward from each
first round election  one is the ties promote  tp  model  in which all winners of a firstround election move forward  the other is the ties eliminate  te  model  in which  for
each first round election  its unique winner moves forward if it has a unique winner and
otherwise no one moves forward from that first round election  for consistency  these control
definitions are adopted  often word for word  from those in the papers by hemaspaandra
et al          faliszewski et al       a   and faliszewski  hemaspaandra  and hemaspaandra
       
definition      let e be an election system 
   in the control by partition of voters problem for e  in the tp or te tie handling rule
model  we are given an election  c  v   and a candidate p  c  is there a partition   of
v into v  and v  such that p is a winner of the two stage election where the winners
of election  c  v    that survive the tie handling rule compete against the winners of
 c  v    that survive the tie handling rule  each of the two first round and the one
second round elections is conducted using election system e   
   in the control by adding voters problem for e we are given a set of candidates c 
two collections of voters  v  often referred to as the collection of registered voters 
and w  often referred to as the collection of unregistered voters   with preferences
over c  a candidate p  c  and a nonnegative integer k  we ask whether there is a
subcollection w    w such that  a  kw   k  k  and  b  p is a winner of e election
 c  v  w     
   in the control by deleting voters problem for e we are given an election  c  v    a
candidate p  c  and a nonnegative integer k  we ask whether there is a collection
v   of voters that can be obtained from v by deleting at most k voters such that p is
a winner of e election  c  v     
    a partition of a collection a is a pair of collections  a    a    such that a   a    a and a   a     
since different voters can have the same preferences  these are multiset operations 
    it is very important to note that in this definition and when we draw on it  when we speak of an election 
 c     v      we always implicitly mean that each vote in v   is passed to the election system only as the
version of itself restricted to the candidates in c     in particular  this is relevant to the second round
election here 

   

fibypassing combinatorial protections

the above three definitions are all for what is called the nonunique winner model 
namely  the question is  can p be made a winner of the final election  another model
that has been studied in the literature is called the unique winner model  in which the
questions above are replaced with  can p be made to uniquely win the final election  we
find most natural for study the tp  nonunique winner model   tp and nonunique winner
pair naturally  as do te and unique winner   in contrast  the seminal control paper of
bartholdi et al         used the unique winner model  to be as clear and broad as possible
as to which of these models our results hold in  we have checked that our results hold for all
four model combinations  i e   tp and unique winner  tp and nonunique winner  te and
unique winner  and te and nonunique winner  
when we speak about a control problem for single peaked electorates  we will mean that
the societal order l is part of the input  and we mean that single peakedness must hold
for the entire input  including any potentially added candidates and voters   however  for
control  it turns out that in the just mentioned model polynomial time membership holds if
and only if polynomial time membership holds in the model in which one is not given an l
as part of the input but rather one is asked whether there exists some linear order l relative
to which the input  as before  even including all potentially added candidates and voters 
is single peaked and is such that the goal can be achieved by the given control action  this
claim is formalized as theorem a   and proven in the appendix  in light of theorem a   
we will simply assume all our control results are in the default model  societal order is part
of the input  
    control results related to weakcondorcet elections
in this section we present our control results  with a focus on control by partition of voters  we will see that although llull and condorcet elections have np hard voter partition
control problems  those problems fall to polynomial time for single peaked electorates  our
spotlight result for this section states that partition by voters control for weakcondorcet
elections is in p 
theorem      for weakcondorcet elections  control by partition of voters is in p for singlepeaked electorates  in both the nonunique winner model and the unique winner model  and
in both the ties promote model and the ties eliminate model 
before giving theorem    s proof  let us note some consequences and contrasts 
corollary      let e be any election system that is weakcondorcet consistent on singlepeaked inputs  then for election system e  control by partition of voters is in p for singlepeaked electorates  in both the nonunique winner model and the unique winner model  and
in both the ties promote model and the ties eliminate model  in particular  this holds for
the election systems llull  kemeny  young  weakdodgson  maximin  schwartz  weakblack 
fishburn  and the two variants of nanson due to fishburn and schwartz 
for llull elections  this provides a clear contrast with the known np completeness for
that same control type in the general case 
theorem      faliszewski et al       a   for llull elections  control by partition of voters
is np complete  in both the nonunique winner model and the unique winner model  and in
both the ties promote model and the ties eliminate model

set of weakcondorcet winners of  c  v    equals  c  d  then
  
return  v    v   
    return there is no partition of voters that makes p a weakcondorcet winner

we now turn to the proof of theorem      the idea behind the proof differs completely
from the approach used in the polynomial time control proofs in faliszewski et al         
and is  we think  novel 
proof of theorem      let  c  v   be an election and l a linear order of c with respect
to which the electorate is single peaked  we have to decide whether a designated candidate
p  c can be made an overall winner by partitioning the set of voters in an appropriate
way 
our algorithm is tailored to the natural ties promote  nonunique winner model  but
we will at the end of the proof mention how it can be adapted to the other models  in our
natural model  we want to find a partition  v    v    such that p is a weakcondorcet winner
in the election  c     v   where c   is the union of the weakcondorcet winners in  c  v    and
 c  v    
we show that algorithm   returns a partition with this property whenever one exists 
algorithm   loops over all   tuples a  b  c  d of candidates and tests whether the voters can
be partitioned into  v    v    in such a way that  a  the weakcondorcet winners of  c  v   
are  a  b   i e   all candidates in  x  c   a l x l b   writing y l z for  y   z or y l z   
 b  the weakcondorcet winners of  c  v    are  c  d   and  c  p is a weakcondorcet winner in
  a  b    c  d   v   
for each   tuple a  b  c  d  we divide the set c of candidates into disjoint interesting
regions  regions are defined as follows  each of the candidates a  b  c  d constitutes a
region in itself  furthermore  each contiguous  with respect to l  interval between two
of those four candidates is a region  finally  there are two additional regions  namely one
interval consisting of all candidates that are to the left of a  b  c  d and one interval consisting
of all candidates that are to the right of a  b  c  d 
note that all of the intervals not containing a  b  c  or d may be empty  because the
set  a  b  c  d  may contain adjacent or even identical candidates  it is easy to see that the
number of interesting  i e   nonempty  regions is at most nine  and is equal to nine if and
only if there are no adjacent or identical candidates among a  b  c  d  assuming that this is

if the set  a  b  c  d  contains adjacent or identical elements  some of the regions pictured
above will be empty or identical  and so there will be less than nine interesting regions  if
there are r interesting regions  we will denote them by r            rr   from left to right with
respect to l 
associate each voter with the candidate at the top of that voters preference order  the
following observation turns out to be helpful  if  a  b  is the set of weakcondorcet winners
in  c  v     then there can be no voters in v  that have a top choice x with a  l x  l b 
similarly  no voter in v  can have a top choice strictly between c and d  that is  a region
that consists of voters whose top choice lies strictly between either a and b or c and d is fully
determined with regard to the question of how many voters are in v  and v    for example 
in the case where  c  d  is contained in  a  b   five of the nine regions are fully determined 
all voters from r    r    r    and r  have to be in v  and there must not be any voters in
region r    as such voters would lie both between a and b and between c and d  by this
argument  one can see that the maximum number of regions that are not fully determined
is    in the case where the intervals  a  b  and  c  d  are disjoint   clearly  the number of
ways that kv k can be divided into   ordered numbers is bounded by kv k   
the fact that the weakcondorcet winners in  c  v    and  c  v    can be efficiently checked
is due to the following key observation  within each region  the only thing that affects the
winner set is the number of voters we put into v    not which voters we use to achieve
that number  that is  we do not need to check each partition individually  there are an
exponential number of them   but rather deal with a large number of partitions simultaneously  more formally  suppose we have r interesting regions and let                         r   be
   

fibrandt  brill  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra

an r dimensional vector of natural numbers  we now define p  as the set of all partitions
 v    v    of v such that for each i   i is the number of the voters from v  whose top choice
is in ri  
for p       our key observation can now be restated as follows   a  b  is the set of
weakcondorcet winners in some election  c  v    with  v    v     p  if and only if  a  b  is
the set of weakcondorcet winners in every election  c  v    with  v    v     p    that is  if
we want to check whether  a  b  is the set of weakcondorcet winners in any of the primary
elections  c  v    induced by any of the partitions  v    v     p    it suffices to check just one
of them to obtain the answer  this check can easily be done just by counting  by symmetry 
the same statement holds for  c  d  and for weakcondorcet winners of the elections  c  v   
 all four combinations  
the reason why this is true is that  given the number of voters in each region  it is easy
to recognize the region s  of the median voter s   just by counting   since a  b  c  and d all
constitute a region on their own  it is equally easy to tell whether a median voter has any
of these four candidates as his or her top choice 
implementing this idea  the algorithm loops over all possible sizes k of v   line    and
over all possibilities how k can be divided into r numbers                    r   and checks  line   
if this gives a partition as required  as we have argued in the last paragraphs  this query
can be efficiently answered 
the running time of algorithm   can thus be bounded as follows  the number of
iterations for the loops in lines       and    are bounded by kck    kv k      and kv k   
respectively  moreover  we have just shown that the queries in line   can be answered in
polynomial time  altogether  this yields a running time that is obviously polynomial in the
size of the input 
correctness of algorithm   should be clear from the explanations above  we find a
partition that makes p an overall weakcondorcet winner if and only if such a partition
exists  in particular  observe that setting k     in line   handles the case where p is
already a weakcondorcet winner in the original election    note that the algorithms theme
perfectly supports the theme of this paper  the algorithm used single peakedness to bypass
the combinatorial richness of partitions 
this completes the proof for the tp  nonunique winner model  for the tp  uniquewinner model  line   of algorithm   needs to be adapted to only loop over all choices of
a  b  c  d that make p a unique weakcondorcet winner in  c     v    the te  unique winner
model is dealt with in theorem     on page       by fact     on page      being a
unique weakcondorcet winner is tantamount to being a condorcet winner for single peaked
electorates  
the same is true for the te  nonunique winner model  here  being a weakcondorcet
winner in the final election suffices  but algorithm    which can be found in the appendix 
can easily be adapted to take that into consideration 
q theorem    
    to see this  assume that p   m    mr    where  m    mr   is the interval of all weakcondorcet winners in
 c  v    observe that if we set a  b  c  d such that  a  b    c and  c  d     m    mr    then c      e  c  
a l e l b  c l e l d    c and obviously p is a weakcondorcet winner of  c     v    thus  this
choice of a  b  c  d is considered in line    now setting k to   uniquely defines   to be                and p 
consists of the partition    v   only  due to the choice of a  b  c  d  the answer to the query in line   is
yes and    v   is correctly output as a partition that makes p an overall winner

before we turn from weakcondorcet to condorcet elections  we state a result that will
quickly give us a number of additional contrasts between general case control complexity
and single peaked control complexity 
theorem      for weakcondorcet elections  control by adding voters and control by deleting voters are each in p for single peaked electorates  in both the nonunique winner model
and the unique winner model 
as usual  it immediately follows that the above result applies to our standard long
list of systems  e g   kemeny  young  and weakdodgson elections  that are weakcondorcetconsistent on single peaked electorates  the appendix contains similar results for condorcet
elections  however  the winner problem in the general case trivially many one polynomialtime reduces to control by adding voters  via asking if p can be made to win by adding  
voters  see hemaspaandra et al         section       thus  the existing p   hardness results
for the kemeny winner problem  both in the nonunique winner model  hemaspaandra et al  
      and in the unique winner model  hemaspaandra et al          the young winner
problem  both in the nonunique winner model and in the unique winner model  see this
papers theorem a     and the weakdodgson winner problem  both in the nonunique winner
model and in the unique winner model  see this papers theorem a     themselves imply
that control by adding voters is p   hard for kemeny  young  and weakdodgson elections
 in both the nonunique winner model and the unique winner model   the same comments
hold for control by deleting voters  thus the single peaked and general cases of control by
adding and deleting voters differ for kemeny  young  and weakdodgson elections 
    control results related to condorcet elections
control of condorcet elections has been studied in much detail  bartholdi et al        
hemaspaandra  hemaspaandra    rothe         and  see table   of hemaspaandra et al  
      each standard control type is known to either never change the outcome at all or
to have a polynomial time algorithm  with three exceptions  namely  as bartholdi et al 
       proved in their seminal paper on control  control by addition of voters and control by
deletion of voters are both np complete for condorcet elections  and control by partition of
voters is also np complete for condorcet elections  due to bartholdi et al         for a nownonstandard partition model  and due to faliszewski et al       a  for the now standard
partition model     however  the following results show that these resistance results vanish
for single peaked electorates 
theorem      for condorcet elections  control by partition of voters is in p for singlepeaked electorates  in both the nonunique winner model and the unique winner model  and
in both the ties promote model and the ties eliminate model  note that all four cases
coincide here  
    that entire bartholdi  tovey  and trick paper is in the unique winner model  and so all the above discussion is in the unique winner model  and we will thus need to establish our contrasting polynomial time
results in the unique winner model if we want a meaningful contrast  to address this  we will ensure
that our contrasting results hold in both models  but that holds trivially if we prove it in either model 
as for condorcet elections  nonunique winner and unique winner coincide and ties promote and ties
eliminate coincideboth because one can never have two or more winners

theorem      for condorcet elections  control by adding voters and control by deleting
voters are each in p for single peaked electorates  in both the nonunique winner model and
the unique winner model 
so  for all the standard control cases that condorcet voting is known to be np hard for
in the general case  bartholdi et al         faliszewski et al       a   we have shown that
condorcet voting control falls to polynomial time for single peaked electorates

faliszewski et al         completely characterized  for three candidate elections  which scoring protocols have polynomial time constructive coalition weighted manipulation problems
and which have np complete constructive coalition weighted manipulation problems  we
achieve a far more sweeping dichotomy theoremour result applies to all scoring protocols 
regardless of the number of candidates  scoring protocols are arguably the most important
broad class of election systems 
in the constructive coalition weighted manipulation problem  the input is the candidate
set c  the nonmanipulative voters  each a preference order over c and a weight   the
manipulative voters  each just a weight   and a candidate p  c  and the question is
whether there is a way of setting the preferences of the manipulative voters such that p is a
winner under the given election rule when all the manipulative and nonmanipulative voters
vote in a weighted election

namely                                n     n     n  for the single peaked case 
the constructive coalition weighted manipulation problem  in both the nonunique winner
model and the unique winner model  is np complete when                     and is
in polynomial time otherwise 
our extension of this three candidate  single peaked electorate result to the case of any
scoring protocol over single peaked electorates is somewhat complicated  yet  since it is
a complete characterizationa dichotomization of the complexities  in factit is in some
sense simply reflecting the subtlety and complexity of scoring systems   for the general
i e   not necessarily single peakedcase  the known characterization is simple regardless
of the number of candidates  np completeness holds when kck    and      kck and
otherwise the problem is in p  hemaspaandra   hemaspaandra        see also conitzer

    the sharp eyed reader may wonder whether it is in concept possible that some of the general case
polynomial time results for control  e g   condorcet control by deleting candidates  might suddenly 
freakishly get harder in the single peaked case  after all  faliszewski et al         show a freakish case
where limiting to the single peaked case increases manipulation complexity  however  it is not hard to
seeby reasoning related to that used to prove theorem a  that if a control type is in polynomial
time in the general case then in the single peaked case it remains in polynomial time

 if m    and     b m  c   and there exist integers i  j     such that i   j  m    
 
and    i     j      i i     j j      then the constructive coalition weighted
manipulation problem for the single peaked case is np complete 
 if m    and     b m  c   and         m and      m  or    m  
 
     m     then the constructive coalition weighted manipulation problem for the
single peaked case is np complete 
 in all other cases  the constructive coalition weighted manipulation problem for the
single peaked case is in p 
for example  the constructive coalition weighted manipulation for the single peaked case
for m candidate plurality and m candidate veto is in p  and for m candidate borda it is in
p if m    and np complete otherwise 
note that theorem     follows from theorem      since               is equivalent
to               we also note that the specific cases of more than three candidate
scoring protocolssuch as four candidate borda and m candidate vetothat were analyzed
for the single peaked case by faliszewski et al         yielded results completely consistent
with theorem    s characterization  the p cases of theorem    s dichotomy align with
our theme of single peakedness often foiling combinatorial protections 
proof of theorem      we first give some intuition for the conditions of this theorem 
the p cases are exactly the cases where there is an optimal manipulator vote  for example 
we will show in lemma     that if     i      j     i  i     j  j     for all i  j    
such that i   j  m      then the candidates scoring higher than p are all on one side of p 
say on the left  in the societal order  in that case it is optimal for the manipulators to rank
p first  then all candidates on ps right  and then all candidates on ps left 
in contrast  for the np complete cases there exists a societal order for which we can
construct elections where p has two main rivals  say a and b  and there are two different
types of optimal votes for the manipulators that have different effects on the scores of a
and b  our np hardness proofs follow via reductions from the well known np complete
problem partition  see  e g   garey and johnson         in this problem  we are given a
nonempty collection  k            kn   of positive integers that sum to  k  and we ask whether
there exists a subcollection of k            kn that sums to k  in all these cases we will carefully
define the societal order  the weights and votes of the nonmanipulators  and the weights
of the manipulators such that the weights of the manipulators voting for one of the two
optimal vote types in a successful manipulation correspond to a partition and vice versa 
we now turn to the formal proof of the theorem  for m     the problem is trivial and
thus in p  so  assume that m     we split the proof of theorem     into three lemmas 
the     b m  c   np complete cases  lemma       the     b m  c   p cases  follow
 
 
from lemma       and the     b m  c   cases  lemma      
 
in the proof  we use the following notation  for v a collection of voters and c a candidate 
scorev  c  denotes the score of c in v   i e   the number of points that c receives from the
voters in v   if v is clear from context  we will simply write score c   in this section  we
usually denote the collection of nonmanipulators by s and the collection of manipulators
by t  
first we prove the following simple lemma

lemma      in the constructive coalition weighted manipulation problem for the singlepeaked case for scoring protocols  if p can be made a winner  then p can be made a winner
by a manipulation in which all manipulators rank p first 
proof of lemma      let a   p   b         b  be a single peaked vote  where
a is a set of candidates in some order  then there exists an ordering of a such that
p   a   b         b  is also single peaked  note that in this new vote  for every candidate
c  score p   score c  does not decrease  so  if p is a winner of an election  then p is a still
a winner if we replace every single peaked vote of the form a   p   b         b  by a
single peaked vote of the form p   a   b         b   
q lemma    
lemma      let                     m   be a scoring protocol such that m    and    
b m  c     if there exist integers i    i      such that i   i   m   and    i      i     
 
 i   i       i   i        then the constructive coalition weighted manipulation problem
for the single peaked case is np complete 
proof of lemma      let i    i  be integers that fulfill the conditions of the lemma such
that i   i  and i  is minimal  i e       i   i    i    i   m          i       i     
 i   i       i   i        and for all i     i   such that     i    i     i  and i     i    m     
it holds that     i        i       i    i        i    i        
we will now reduce partition to the constructive coalition weighted manipulation
problem for single peaked electorates  let  k            kn   be an instance of partition  i e  
 k            kn   is a nonempty collection of positive integers that sum to  k  let societys
order be
am  l    l a  l p l b  l    l bm   
where m    max d m 
  e  i      and m    m  m      note that i   m       since
i   i   m    it follows immediately that i   m      also note that    m   m   m  
to make the reduction work  we also need the following claim 
claim      m          
proof of claim     

if m    b m 
  c  this is immediate  since     b m  c     if not 
 

then m    i     and i       d m 
  e     since i  is minimal  the conditions of the lemma
can not be fulfilled with i    i       and so                   if     m       then
        and it follows that       and thus     m       but then this choice of i    i 
does not fulfill the conditions of the lemma  since    i      
q claim    
let s consist of two voters  one voter of weight    with preference order
a         ai      p   b      
 the    at the end of the vote denotes that the remaining candidates are listed in arbitrary 
single peaked order  and one voter with weight    with preference order
b         bi      p   a

and let the weights of t be k    k            kn   where
       i       i      i   i       i   i       
              m          i       i   i              m       k  and
          i           m          i   i              m       k 
these values were chosen  using cramers rule  so that
    i        i   i                   m      k and
 i   i               i                m      k 
note that  is positive  since     i       i       i   i       i   i        note
that    and    are also positive  since     i    and     i    are positive  and so are
        m       and         m        by claim     and the fact that m   m   
to prove that the reduction works  first suppose that k            kn has a partition  i e  
there is a subcollection of k            kn that sums to k  we show that p can be made a winner
as follows  let k weight of t vote
p   a         am    b      
and let k weight vote
p   b         bm    a        
note that for all i     i  m    score ai    score a    and that for all i     i  m   
score bi    score b    and so it suffices to show that score a     score p  and that score b    
score p   note that
score p    i       i          k 
score a             i            k   m     k  and
score b             i            k   m     k 
from the choice of        and      it follows that score a      score p  and score b      score p  
for the converse  suppose that the voters in t vote such that p becomes a winner in
s  t   from the observations above  it follows that
scoret  a          m      k and that
scoret  b          m      k 
by lemma     we can assume that p is ranked first by every voter in t   this implies that
every voter in t ranks a  or b  second  let wa be the total weight of all t voters that rank
a  second  it follows that
scoret  a       wa   m       k  wa   and
scoret  b         k  wa     m     wa  
from these observations  and the fact that      and that     m      by claim       and
thus also     m        it follows that wa  k and that   k  wa    k  so  exactly
half of the vote weight of t ranks a  second  then the weights of the voters in t that rank
a  second correspond to a partition 
q lemma

lemma      let                     m   be a scoring protocol  if for all i  j     such that
i   j  m      it holds that
    i      j     i  i     j  j     
then the constructive coalition weighted manipulation problem for the single peaked case is
in p 
proof of lemma      let am  l    l a  l p l b  l    l bm  be societys order  it is
immediate that if scores  ai    scores  p  for all i     i  m    then p can be made a winner
if and only if p is a winner if every voter in t votes
p   a         am    b         bm   
similarly  if scores  bi    scores  p  for all i     i  m    then p can be made a winner if
and only if p is a winner if every voter in t votes
p   b         bm    a         am   
we will show that these are the only cases that can occur  this immediately implies
lemma     
so  for the remainder of the proof  suppose for a contradiction that we have a collection of
voters s and integers i  and i  such that    i   m       i   m    scores  ai      scores  p  
and scores  bi      scores  p  
for     i  m      let  i be the total weight of the voters in s that rank some candidate
in  a            am    first and that rank p in ith place  note that these voters rank all candidates
in  b            bm    after p  for     i  m       let   i be the total weight of the voters in s that
rank some candidate in  b            bm    first and that rank p in ith place  note that these
voters rank all candidates in  a            am    after p  it follows immediately that

q lemma    
lemma     handles all     b m  c   p cases of theorem      note that this lemma is of
 
limited use if     b m  c     since in that case the lemma applies only if m     or        
 
b m  c     the     b m  c   cases of theorem     are handled by the following lemma in
 
 
combination with the standard observation that the scoring protocol                  m   has
the same behavior as the scoring protocol     m      m           m   m      
lemma      let                     m   be a scoring protocol such that m     m      and
    b m  c     if       or       or      m  and         then the constructive
 
coalition weighted manipulation problem for the single peaked case is in p  otherwise  it is
np complete 
proof of lemma      if        then any vote of the form p      is an optimal
manipulator vote  if         then     b m  c     let i and j be such that i  j     and
 

m 
i   j  m      then min i  j   b m  
  c   b   c     and so     i      j        it
follows from lemma     that this case is in p 
for the remainder of the proof  we assume that           
now consider the case that     m  and         consider societys order  if p is
the leftmost or rightmost candidate  then there is exactly one vote that puts p first  and
this is an optimal manipulator vote  otherwise  let a be the leftmost candidate in societys
order  and b the rightmost  then a and b are the only candidates that can occur last in a
vote  since         it follows that scores  a    scores  b    scores  p   without loss of
generality  let scores  a   scores  b   then scores  a   scores  p  and any vote of the form
p        b is an optimal manipulator vote 
this concludes the p cases  we now turn to the np complete cases  in both cases  we
will reduce from partition 
first assume that     m  and that          let k            kn be a nonempty
collection of positive integers that sum to  k  we construct the following election  societys
order is a l p l    l b  s consists of two voters  each of weight         k  one
voter votes a   p        b and the other voter votes b        p   a  note that
for all candidates c    a  b   scores  c    scores  p   the weights of the manipulators are
        k                    kn   the proof of the correctness of the reduction is similar to

 but easier than  the corresponding proof in lemma      first suppose that there exists a
subcollection of k            kn that sums to k  then set k vote weight of t to p   a        b
and k vote weight to p        b   a  note that in the resulting election 
score p                               k              k and
score a    score b                             k              k 
for the converse  suppose that p can be made a winner  from the observations above 
it is immediate that
scoret  a             k and scoret  b             k 
let wa be the total weight of the voters in t that rank b last  it follows that
scoret  a     wa and scoret  b             k  wa     
from these observations  and the assumption that        it follows that wa          k 
so  exactly half of the vote weight of t ranks b last  then the weights of the voters that
rank b last correspond to a partition 
finally  we handle the last case  namely          m    let m

if k            kn has a partition  then set        k vote weight of t to

so  p is a winner of the resulting election 
for the converse  suppose that p can be made a winner  assume  using lemma     
that p is ranked first by every manipulator  from the observations above  it is immediate
that

from these observations  and the fact that     m   it follows that wa          k

interesting issues  such as possible and necessary winners  konczak   lang        in singlepeaked settings  the issue of the effect of single peaked electorates on manipulation  for
the particular case he looked atweighted coalition manipulation under single transferable vote electionshe showed that manipulation remains hard even for single peaked electorates  faliszewski et al  showed cases where single peakedness removes complexity shields
against manipulation  and also opened the study of  nonpartition  control  our paper in
contrast with walshs stresses cases where single peakedness removes combinatorial protections  and we go beyond faliszewski et al         by for the first time studying bribery
of single peaked electorates and partition control of single peaked electorates  for both
these new cases  we show that many election systems  for example llull elections  have
polynomial time algorithms for single peaked electorates  even if the system is known to
be np hard in the analogous general case  we also generalize the faliszewski et al

dichotomy theorem for manipulation of three candidate scoring protocols to the case of
arbitrary scoring protocols 
although it is more closely related to faliszewski et al         than to the present paper 
and came after the present paper  it is important to mention that the work of faliszewski
et al       b        explores the interesting issue of seeing whether results such as those
of faliszewski et al         still hold even when the electorate is merely near to being

since large real world electorates are unlikely to be  perfectly  single peaked  it is natural
and important to study such weaker forms of single peakedness 
although walsh        and faliszewski et al         are by far the most related work 
other work is much worth mentioning  bartholdi and trick         doignon and falmagne
        and escoffier et al         provided efficient algorithms for finding single peaked
orderings  and conitzer        studied the effect of single peaked electorates on preference
elicitation  indeed  single peakedness is of much current interest in computational settings 
for example  at least four papers in the ijcai      conference  including the bredereck
et al         paper mentioned above are related to single peakedness 
the p   completeness of the winner problems of dodgson  kemeny  and strongyoung
elections was established  respectively  by hemaspaandra et al          hemaspaandra et al 
        and rothe et al          the literature now contains many papers on the complexity
 when single peaked preferences are not assumed  of manipulation and control  as a pointer
to some of those  see faliszewski et al       b  and faliszewski  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra        and the citations therein   and even contains a number of papers on the
younger topic of the complexity of bribery  e g   faliszewski et al         faliszewski       
faliszewski et al       a   although the nonunique winner model and the unique winner
model very typically have the same complexity results  faliszewski  hemaspaandra  and
schnoor        drawing also on conitzer et al         show that this is not always the case 
np completeness and p   completeness are worst case notions  so it is natural to wonder
whether problems in those classes can be solved frequently by heuristic algorithms  there
has been much experimental study on that theme  see  e g   walsh         on the other
hand  it is known  see hemaspaandra and williams        that if any polynomial time deterministic heuristic algorithm for any np complete  or p   complete  problem asymptotically
makes subexponentially many errors  then the polynomial hierarchy collapses 
a worry that comes immediate to the minds of social choice theorists can be expressed as
follows  since it is known that  for single peaked electorates  median voting leaves voters
with voting sincerely being an optimal strategy  single peaked elections are not interesting in
terms of other election systems  since median voting should be used  a detailed discussion
of this worry would itself fill a paper  but we briefly mention three reasons why the above
objection is not as serious as it might at first seem  first  the nonmanipulability claims
regarding single peaked elections and median voting are about manipulability  and so say
nothing at all about  for example  control  indeed  weakcondorcet in effect is a type of
median voting on single peaked electorates  and so for example our partition of voters
algorithm makes it clear that control can be exercised in interesting ways    second  even if
    to be more explicit  under the most natural way of framing median voting  median voting and weakcondorcet  and so all weakcondorcet consistent rules  are exactly the same on single peaked electorates

median voting does have nice properties  the simple truth is that in the real world  society
for virtually all elections and electorateshas chosen  perhaps due to transparency  comfort 
or tradition  to use voting systems that clash sharply with median voting  the prominence
of plurality voting is the most dramatic such case  so since in the real world we do use a
rich range of election systems  it does make sense to understand their behavior  third  one
must be very careful with terms such as strategy proof  the paper people most commonly
mention as showing that median voting is strategy proof is that of barbera         but that
papers results are about social choice functions  election rules that when kck    always
have exactly one winner   notas this paper isabout election rules that select a set of
winners  so one cannot simply assume that for our case median voting  say  weakcondorcet
elections  never gives an incentive to misrepresent preferences 
actually  in certain problem settings  one never has an incentive to misrepresent ones
top choice  in single peaked weakcondorcet elections ones top choice is all that affects
the outcome  in weakcondorcet elections  which are a social choice correspondence   for
example  if ones goal is seek to make your top choice be a weakcondorcet winner  then
one never has an incentive to misstate ones top choice  as another example  if ones
goal is  for any fixed k  seek to make at least one of your first k choices be among
the weakcondorcet winners  then again one never has an incentive to misstate ones top
choice  which is the only thing that matters about ones vote     on the other hand  in
some reasonable problem settings  misstating may make sense  if ones goal is make your
top choice the unique winner or failing that make your second choice the unique winner or
    or failing that make your last choice the unique winner or failing that make there be
multiple winners  then the two candidate single peaked election where voter   votes a   b
but voter   prefers b to a already gives voter   an incentive to vote  insincerely  a   b  before
leaving this topic  we should stress that this and the previous paragraphs discussions are
for the model in which manipulators come in with complete preference orders  however  in
the bartholdi et al         model  which this paper and most complexity papers use when
studying manipulation   the manipulative coalition is a blank slate with its only goal being
to make a certain candidate p be a winner 
an open issue not already mentioned in this paper is the following  section   provided for
single peaked electorates a manipulation complexity dichotomy that applies to all scoring
rules  and see hemaspaandra   hemaspaandra        for what holds without the singlepeaked restriction   although that is a broad set of rules  our theorem is connecting the
specification of the system to the systems complexitya natural connection  however  it
and this paper establishes many results regarding bribery and control of weakcondorcet in the context
of single peaked electorates 
    we mention in passing that the two no incentive to manipulate claims we just made for weakcondorcet
elections for single peaked electorates also hold for a family of related election systems for single peaked
electorates  in weakcondorcet  after sorting the voters by first choice  under the single peaked ordering
of candidates   all candidates who are or fall between the median voter s  are winners  if we think about
that as being medianvoting     then for each rational             for single peaked voting we can
 
consider the rule  medianvoting   that after ordering the voters by first choice makes the winners be all
candidates that in the societal order l fall in the inclusive interval between  a  the leftmost voter vleft
such that at least d  kv ke voters have first preference the same as vleft or to the left under l as that of
vleft   and  b  the rightmost voter vright such that at least d  kv ke voters have first preference the same
as vright or to the right under l as that of vright   each rule medianvoting will share the no incentive
to manipulate properties mentioned in the text

is also natural to wonder whether one can tightly link the social choice favored properties of
a rule to its manipulation  or bribery or control  complexity  to give an idea of the kind of
theorem we are thinking of  we mention the following known theorem linking social choiceproperties to winner problem complexity  the statement involves some notions we will not
define here   every election system that is neutral  condorcet consistent  and consistent
has a p   complete winner problem  hemaspaandra et al         see also the discussion
of hemaspaandra and hemaspaandra         however  the just quoted winner result is
something of a cheat as there is just one system that satisfies those propertieskemeny
elections  the dream case for manipulationand bribery and controlwould be to find
a broad link between social choice properties and complexity in the single peaked case or
in the general case  in the true dream case  we might completely characterize in terms of
some statement about social choice properties the election systems with easy manipulation
 or bribery or control  problems  in the single peaked case or in the general case 
a final open direction is to find cases where partition of candidates control shifts from
np hard to polynomial time when restricted to single peaked electorates 

   conclusions
the theme of this paper is that single peaked electorates often tame combinatorial explosion 
we saw this first for the case of the winner problem  in that case  this taming is good 
it shows that for single peaked electorates  election systems such as kemeny have efficient
winner algorithms  despite their p   hardness in the general case  but then for bribery
and control  and in part  manipulation   we saw many cases where np hard problems fell
to polynomial time for single peaked electorates  via algorithms that bypassed the generalcase combinatorial explosions of covers and partitions  since those np hardness results were
protections against attacks on elections  our results should serve as a warning that those
protections are at their very core dependent on the extreme flexibility of voter preference
collections the general case allows  for single peaked electorates  those protections vanish

appendix a  additional definitions and proofs
this appendix provides additional definitions and proofs 
a   additional definitions
let us define some additional election systems mentioned in section   
nanson elections are runoff methods based on bordas scoring protocol  in nansons
       original definition  a series of borda elections is held and all candidates who at
any stage have not more than the average borda score are excluded unless all candidates
have identical borda scores  in which case these candidates are declared the winners of the
election  there exist two variants of nanson due to fishburn and schwartz  which exclude
candidates with the lowest borda score and candidates whose borda score is less than the
average score  respectively  all three versions fail to be weakcondorcet consistent  niou 
      
maximin  a k a  simpson kramer  elections  simpson        kramer        choose those
candidates that fare best in their worst pairwise comparison against any other candidate 
the remaining three election systems are based on the pairwise majority relation  in
schwartz        elections  sometimes also called the top cycle   the winners are defined
as the maximal elements of the asymmetric part of the transitive closure of the majority relation  the winners in fishburn        elections are the maximal elements of the fishburn
relation f   which is defined by letting a f b if every candidate that beats a in a pairwise
comparison also beats b and there exists a candidate that beats b but not a 
a   proofs for section  
theorem a    kemeny  schwartz  and fishburns and schwartzs versions of nanson are
weakcondorcet consistent for single peaked electorates 
proof  all statements rely on the observation that the pairwise majority relation   m  
for single peaked electorates is transitive  black               further observe that weak
condorcet winners are precisely the maximal elements of the pairwise majority relation  it
follows immediately that schwartz is weakcondorcet consistent 
p in the case of kemeny  note that  again writing  m for the pairwise majority relation 
 a b c a  b am b k v  v   v prefers b to a k is a lower bound on the kemeny score of any
linear order  this score is realized by linear order   if and only if   is consistent with  m  
i e   for every a  b  c  if a  m b then a   b  if the pairwise majority relation is transitive
and c is a weak condorcet winner  then c is a kemeny winner  as evidenced by the following
kemeny consensus  rank c first and then greedily keep adding  in the successive positions
in the consensus  maximal  with respect to  m   unranked candidates  since   is consistent
with  m     is a kemeny consensus  it is immediate that if d is not a weak condorcet
winner  then d can not be ranked first in any linear order consistent with  m  
for nanson  we prove that no weak condorcet winner is eliminated at any stage of the
election  first let us normalize borda scores by subtracting  kv k   m        from the
   

fibrandt  brill  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra

borda score of every candidate  this ensures that the average normalized borda score is
precisely zero  now  observe that the normalized borda score of candidate a is simply half
of the sum  over all candidates b  of the number of voters who prefer a to b minus the
number of voters who prefer b to a  as a consequence  the normalized borda score of every
weak condorcet winner is at least zero  moreover  in the case of a single peaked electorate 
due to the transitivity of the majority relation  there is always a candidate with a negative
normalized borda score unless all candidates have an identical score of zero  in the latter
case  all three versions of nanson will terminate  in the former case  neither fishburns nor
schwartzs variant will exclude weak condorcet winners because their score is at least as
large as the average score 
q
the fact that black  dodgson  the original version of nanson  and copeland elections
for all          are not weakcondorcet consistent for single peaked electorates is seen by
the following universal counterexample  let there be two voters with preferences b   a   c
and c   b   a  these preferences are single peaked with respect to the societal ordering
a l b l c  candidates b and c are weak condorcet winners  but each of the mentioned
election systems chooses only b  similarly  strongyoung is not weakcondorcet consistent
for single peaked electorates because in an election with two voters whose preferences are
a   b   c and c   b   a  all candidates are weak condorcet winners  but strongyoung
yields only candidates a and c 
a   additional proofs for section  
theorem a    the winner problem for young elections is p   complete  both in the
nonunique winner model and the unique winner model 
proof  p   completeness of the  nonunique  winner problem for strongyoung elections
 somewhat confusingly called young elections there  was shown by rothe et al          the
same proof also establishes p   completeness in the unique winner model  hemaspaandra
et al          the p  upper bound is easy to show  and the same argument can be used
to show a p  upper bound for the young winner problem  in both the nonunique winner
model and the unique winner model   p   hardness of the winner problem for strongyoung
elections was shown as theorem     of rothe et al         via a reduction from the p  complete problem maximum set packing compare  mspc  for short   given two sets  b 
and b    and two collections of sets s  and s    where each s  si is a nonempty  finite
subset of bi   is it the case that  s      s     here   si   denotes the maximum number
of pairwise disjoint sets in si   as in rothe et al   we assume that  si       
the proofs of theorems     and     of rothe et al         show how to construct
from a given mspc instance i    b    b    s    s    an election  d  w   with two designated
candidates  c and d  such that  a  if  s      s    then c and d are strongyoung winners
of  d  w    and  b  if  s       s    then d is the unique strongyoung winner of  d  w   
we now show how this proof can be adapted to work for young elections  please
refer to rothe et al         for definitions and details of the construction  as we will only
point out the differences here  given an mspc instance i    b    b    s    s     we construct

an election  c     v     such that c and d are designated candidates in c     and it holds that
youngscore c     c  v           s    and youngscore c     d  v           s      
let c     c and v     v   v        v         where  c  v   is the election constructed
in the proof of theorem     of rothe et al          v      is one of the two voters in v
referred to as voters of the form       in rothe et al  and v      is one of the two voters
in v referred to as voters of the form       in rothe et al    one can then define a
submultiset v  of the voters v   as v    v   v         where v is defined on page

implying that youngscore c     c  v          s    
to show that youngscore c     c  v          s     we adapt lemma     of rothe et al 
       in the following way   the proof of lemma a   is similar to the proof of lemma    
of rothe et al         and we omit it here  
lemma a    for any  with       ks  k      let v be a submultiset of v   such that v
contains exactly     voters of the form       or       and c is a weak condorcet winner in
 c     v      then v contains exactly     voters of the form       and no voters of the form
              or        moreover  the     voters of the form       in v represent pairwise
disjoint sets from s   
let v   v   be such kv  k      s    and such that c is a weak condorcet winner in
suppose there are exactly     voters of the form       or       in v    since
 s         it follows that kv  k     and thus      in order for a to not beat c  also 
   ks  k  since there are exactly ks  k voters of the form       or       in v     lemma a  
then implies that there are exactly   voters of the form       in v    those voters represent
pairwise disjoint sets from s    and v  contains no voters of the form               or       
hence  kv  k                 s    
we thus have youngscore c     c  v           s     analogously  one can show that
youngscore c     d  v           s     thus
 c     v    

 s      s   

if and only if

youngscore c     c  v      youngscore c     d  v     

which proves the p   hardness of comparing young scores  to show that the winner problem
for young elections is p   hard  we alter the election  c     v     in the same way as  c  v   is
    note that in this proof  we follow rothe et al s        convention for young scores and define the
youngscore c  c  v   of a candidate c in an election  c  v   as the size of the maximal submultiset of
voters for which c is a weak condorcet winner  hence  the set of young winners consists of all candidates
whose youngscore is at least as large as the youngscore of each other candidate 
    for completeness  we give the definition of  c     v      c     b   b    a  b  c  d  and v   consists of the

altered in theorem     of rothe et al          let  d    w     be the altered election    one
can then show that the young scores of c and d in  d    w     are the same as in  c     v     
and that all other candidates have a young score in  d    w     of at most    thus  since the
young scores of c and d are at least    comparing the young scores of c and d in  d    w    
is tantamount to deciding if c is a young winner 
altogether  we have that  a  if  s      s    then c is a young winner of  d    w     
and  b  if  s       s    then d is the unique young winner of  d    w      it follows that
an mspc instance i is in mspc if and only if c is a young winner of  d    w      implying
p   hardness of the young winner problem in the nonunique winner model  for the uniquewinner model  we follow the argument from the proof of theorem     of hemaspaandra
et al          observe that i is in mspc if and only if d is not the unique winner of
 d    w      thus the complement of the unique winner problem for young elections is p  hard  since p  is closed under complement  this proves that the unique winner problem for
young elections is p   hard as well

theorem a    the winner problem for weakdodgson elections is p   complete  both in the
nonunique winner model and the unique winner model 
proof  p   completeness of the  nonunique  winner problem for dodgson elections was
shown in hemaspaandra et al          the same proof also establishes p   completeness
in the unique winner model  hemaspaandra et al          the p  upper bound is easy to
show  and the same argument can be used to show a p  upper bound for the weakdodgson
winner problem  in both the nonunique winner model and the unique winner model   p  hardness of the winner problem for dodgson was shown by a reduction from the p   hard
problem two election ranking   er  for short   hemaspaandra et al          given two
dodgson triples  c  c  v   and  d  d  w    where both kv k and kw k are odd and c    d  is
the dodgson score of c in  c  v   less than or equal to the dodgson score of d in  d  w   
here  a dodgson triple  c  c  v   is an election  c  v   with a designated candidate c  c 
the reduction from  er to the winner problem for dodgson elections works by merging
the elections e     c  v   and e     d  w   into a new election e     c     v     such that
c  d  c   and the following properties are satisfied 
 i  dodgson scoree   c    dodgson scoree   c      
 ii  dodgson scoree   d    dodgson scoree   d       and
 iii  dodgson scoree   x    dodgson scoree   c  for all x  c     c  d  
here  dodgson scoree  x  denotes the minimal number of switches required to make candidate x a condorcet winner in election e  thus  we immediately have that c is a dodgson
winner in e  if and only if dodgson scoree   c   dodgson scoree   d    
    for completeness   d    w     is defined as follows  we replace every candidate g  c     c  d  by kv   k
 
candidates g             g kv k    and we replace each occurrence of candidate g in the ith voter of v   by
 
 
 
 
g i mod kv k   g  i    mod kv k        g  i kv k   mod kv k  
    we have noted a fixable problem in the construction of hemaspaandra et al          the problem is on

we now show how the approach from hemaspaandra et al         can be adapted
to work for weakdodgson  first  observe that the problem weak two election ranking
 w er   which is defined like  er except with dodgson score replaced by weakdodgson
score  inherits p   hardness from  er because dodgson scores and weakdodgson scores
coincide for all instances with an odd number of voters   if the number of voters is odd 
being a weak condorcet winner is tantamount to being a condorcet winner  since there
are no ties in pairwise comparisons   also observe  by inspection of the p   hardness proof
from hemaspaandra et al          that  er and w er are still p   hard if we restrict the
dodgson scoree   c   it is claimed that the same argument applies to each candidate in  c d   c  d  
though this claim is clearly true for each candidate in d d   it is not true for each candidate in c  c  
since in the preference orders of voter groups  b  and  c   candidates in c   c  are not separated from
candidates in d by a set of separating candidates  as a consequence  it may be possible to make a
candidate in c   c  a condorcet winner by less than ksk   switches in those voter groups 
this problem can be avoided by changing the t         tkt k   c   s         sksk   c        
ckck  prefix in the preference orders of the voters in groups  b  and  c  to c   t         tkt k  
c         ckck    s         sksk   this gives the following set of voters   in this footnote we use
a   b   c notation in specifying votes  rather than c   b   a notation as is used throughout the rest
of our paper  in order to match the approach to expressing votes used by hemaspaandra et al        
we do this to make comparisons with that paper as straightforward as possible

intuitively  the changed construction is more symmetrical than the original one  as the preferences of
voter groups  a  and  b  are defined analogously  with the roles of c and d  and those of s and t  
interchanged 
using the proof of lemma     of hemaspaandra et al          it is easy to see that the three
properties mentioned above hold  in particular  c is preferred to each t  t by more than half of the
voters  and so the dodgson score of c does not change  for every candidate d   d  d  does not occur
in the prefix of the preference order that is changed and so the dodgson score of d  does not change  it
remains to show that dodgson scoree   x    dodgson scoree   c  for all x  t  s   c   c    from
the proof of lemma      we know that dodgson scoree   c    ksk   and that ksk   kt k  in order for
t  t to become a condorcet winner  t needs to gain at least one vote over d  note that in the changed
preferences  we need more than ksk switches to switch t beyond d  and so the change in preferences will
not lower the dodgson score of t below ksk    in order for s  s to become a condorcet winner  it
is shown in hemaspaandra et al  that s needs to gain at least one vote over c and that we need more
than ksk   switches to do that  since s is preferred to c by the voters in groups  b  and  c  in both the
original and the changed election  these voters can not be used for s to gain a vote over c  it follows that
in the changed election  s needs more than ksk   switches to become a condorcet winner  finally  let
c   c   c   the argument from hemaspaandra et al  that every d   d   d  needs to gain at least
one vote over c in order to become a condorcet winner  and that we need more than ksk   switches to
do that can be used  by symmetry of the construction  to show that every c   c   c  needs to gain
at least one vote over d in order to become a condorcet winner  and that we need more than ksk  
switches to do that

problem to dodgson triples with at least three voters  let w er  be the thus restricted
version of of w er 
here is a reduction from w er  to the winner problem for weakdodgson elections 
given two dodgson triples  c  c  v   and  d  d  w    denote the corresponding elections by
e     c  v   and e     d  w    for convenience  denote v   kv k and w   kw k  recall
that both v and w are odd and at least three and assume without loss of generality that
c  d    and that v  w  define m   v  kck   w  kdk and observe that m is a strict
upper bound for all weakdodgson
in e  and e    even in the worst case  a candidate
 scores

is least preferred by all voters   v    kck       m switches suffice
to make a candidate a

weak condorcet winner in e   by making it the top choice of v  voters   and an analogous
statement holds for e   
we now define the new election e     c     v      the set c   of candidates of e  is defined
as c     c  d  s  t  u   where c and d are the candidates from elections e  and e 
and s    s            sm    t    t            tm    and u    u            um   are  m new candidates 
in order to define the voters of e    we introduce the following abbreviations for notational convenience  for a  ordered  set m    m            mk    a   m   b is shorthand for
a   mk        m    b  furthermore  let c            ckck  and d            dkdk  be arbitrary
enumerations of c   c   c  and d   d   d   respectively  the voters v   of e  consist
of the following subgroups 
 a  for every voter in e  with preference order ci over c  there is one voter with preference order
ci   t   d   s   d   u 
 b  for every voter in e  with preference order dj over d  there is one voter with preference order
dj   s   c   t   c   u 
   
 c  there are v   w  voters with preference order
d   d   s   c   t   c   u 
 d  there are

v
 

voters with preference order
d   c   u   s   d   c   t 

 e  there are

w
 

   voters with preference order
c   d   u   s   d   c   t 

 f  there is one voter with preference order
s   d   c   t   c   d   u 
since v is odd  the total number of voters is kv   k    v   w      as both v and w are odd 
kv   k is even and a weak condorcet winner has to be preferred to every other candidate
 
 
by at least kv  k   v   w  voters  we now show that the following three properties are
satisfied 
   

fibypassing combinatorial protections

 i  weakdodgson scoree   c    weakdodgson scoree   c  
 ii  weakdodgson scoree   d    weakdodgson scoree   d   and
 iii  weakdodgson scoree   x    weakdodgson scoree   c  for all x  c     c  d  
 

for  i   observe that c is preferred to every candidate in c    c by at least kv  k of
the voters  thus  in computing the weakdodgson score of c  we only have to take care
of candidates in c    c            ckck     let xi be the number of voters in group
  a  that
prefer c to ci   then the number of voters in v   that prefer c to ci is xi   v    w     
candidate c is a weak condorcet winner in e  if and only if this number is greater than
 
 
 
or equal to kv  k   v   w    and this is the case if and only if xi  v  for each i 
            kck      but this means that c is a condorcet winner in e    by definition 
this can be achieved by k switches  where k   weakdodgson scoree   c   we have thus
shown the upper bound weakdodgson scoree   c   weakdodgson scoree   c   now assume
that weakdodgson scoree   c    weakdodgson scoree   c   due to the construction  all
the switches in an optimal sequence occur in voters of group  a   as making c beat any
candidate in c would require more than m switches in all the other relevant voter groups
 b    c   and  f   this means that there is a way to make c a weak condorcet winner in e 
with less than weakdodgson scoree   c  switches  a contradiction  we have thereby shown
that weakdodgson scoree   c    weakdodgson scoree   c   the proof of property  ii  is
analogous 
for  iii   recall that m was chosen sufficiently large to be a strict upper bound on
weakdodgson scoree   c  and thus  by  i   on weakdodgson scoree   c   we now show that
all candidates in c   other than c and d have a weakdodgson score of at least m in e   
consider a candidate s  s  in order to become a weak condorcet winner  s must
 v  in
beat
contest  as s is preferred
to c by only w     
particular

 v  or tie
 c in their pairwise
 
w
w
    it needs to gain at least v extra votes over c in voter
 
 
 
 
voters
in
v
 
 
 
 
groups  a    d   and  e   but gaining just one extra vote over c would require more than
m switches  because s is separated from c by at least m other candidates in all these voter
groups 
 
a similar argument applies to all other candidates  candidates in t need w  extra
votes over d in  b    c    d   and  e   but one extra
vote requires more than m switches in

v
each of these voters  candidates in u need   extra votes over di  d in  a    b    c  
and  f   but one extra vote requires more than m switches  candidates in d need v 
extra votes over c in  a    d  
 and  e   but one extra vote requires more than m switches 
w
candidates in c need   extra votes over d in  b    c    d   and  e   but one extra vote
requires more than m switches  thus  we have shown that weakdodgson scoree   x    m  
weakdodgson scoree   c  for all x  c     c  d  
it is now easy to see that     if weakdodgson scoree   c   weakdodgson scoree   d  
then c is a weakdodgson winner in e    and     if weakdodgson scoree   c   
weakdodgson scoree   d   then d is the unique weakdodgson winner in e    let i  
  c  c  v     d  d  w    be an instance of w er    we have just argued that i is in w er 
if and only if c is a weakdodgson winner in e    which immediately implies p   hardness of
the weakdodgson winner problem in the nonunique winner model  for the unique winner
model  we follow the argument from the proof of theorem     of hemaspaandra et al 
   

fibrandt  brill  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra

        observe that i is in w er  if and only if d is not the unique weakdodgson winner
in e    thus the complement of the unique winner problem for weakdodgson elections is
p   hard  since p  is closed under complement  this proves that the unique winner problem
for weakdodgson elections is also p   hard 
q

a   additional proofs for section  
theorem      the following hold  see footnote    
   approval negative bribery and approval strongnegative bribery are np complete 
   for single peaked electorates  approval negative bribery and approval strongnegativebribery are in p 
proof  the polynomial time algorithms witnessing p membership of approval negativebribery and approval strongnegative bribery have the same flavor as the algorithm for
approval bribery  theorem       and we present them first 
let  c  v   be an instance of a single peaked approval election and l a valid single peaked
ordering of the candidates  we have to decide whether a designated candidate p  c can
be made a winner by bribing at most k voters  as in the proof of theorem      we define vc
as the multiset of voters who approve of candidate c  v    vp is the multiset of voters
approving p and v   v  v  is the multiset of voters disapproving p 
approval strongnegative bribery is like approval bribery  except that bribed voters after
the bribe are not allowed to approve of p  consequently  bribing a voter who approves of p
is always pointless and we will bribe only voters from v   also  we can without loss of
generality assume that all bribed voters disapprove of all candidates after the bribe  as this
is clearly the best possible action with regard to our goal to make p a winner  the algorithm
is similar to the one presented in the proof of theorem      define the surplus n c  of a
candidate c  c   p  as n c    kvc k  kvp k and consider the rightmost candidate c  to
the right of p that has a positive surplus  in order to make p a winner  we obviously have
to bribe at least n c    voters from vc   v   by definition  all candidates to the right of c 
have a nonpositive surplus  and that is whyin deciding which n c    voters from vc   v to
bribewe can solely focus on candidates to the left of c  and choose the n c    voters from
vc   v whose approval range extends the furthest to the left  as mentioned above  we
bribe these voters to disapprove of everyone  thereby making n c         we then recalculate
the surpluses of all candidates to the left of c   note that a candidates surplus never grows
and we can thus ignore the candidates to the right of c    and repeat the process with the
now rightmost candidate to the right of p that has a positive surplus 
by the time when all candidates to the right of p have a nonpositive surplus  we will
mirror the societal order l and repeat the same procedure for all nonpositive surplus candidates that were originally to the left of p with respect to l  if we can make all surpluses
nonpositive without exceeding the bribe limit of k  we have found a successful bribery action  otherwise  a successful bribery action does not exist  as all our decisions  concerning
which voters to bribe  were provably optimal 
in the case of approval negative bribery  bribed candidates may approve of p after the
bribe only if they approved of p before the bribe  in this model  it does sometimes make sense
   

fibypassing combinatorial protections

to bribe voters from v    but that does not pose a problem  as the following observation
shows  the approval score of p remains unchanged for every optimal bribe  here  an optimal
bribe is defined as either bribing a voter from v  to disapprove of everyone except p  or
bribing a voter from v to disapprove of everyone  again  as in the case of strongnegativebribery  we can without loss of generality assume that all our bribes are optimal  thus 
the observation tells us that we do not have to differentiate between bribing voters from v 
and v   as in both cases the only thing we care about is the removal of approvals of
candidates other than p  hence  the algorithm is the same as for strongnegative bribery 
except that when considering a positive surplus candidate c and deciding which voters
from vc to bribe  we not only consider voters that disapprove of p but also voters that
approve of p 
we now go on to show that both bribery problems are np complete in the general  i e  
not necessarily single peaked  case  membership in np is obvious for both problems 
the hardness proof of approval strongnegative bribery is an adaptation from the proof
that approval bribery is np hard  faliszewski et al         thm        please refer to that
proof as we here only point out the differences  in the reduction from the np hard problem
exact cover by   sets  x c   define the bribery instance as in theorem     of faliszewski
et al          except that the number of voters who approve only of s
p is changed from m  t
to instead m  then if there exists a cover a with kak   t and ia si   b  we bribe
each vi with i  a to approve of zero candidates  this is a slight additional change   so all
candidates tie at m approvals and all win  looking at the other direction  if there exists a
successful bribe of t voters  then since p has m approvals and each of the  t candidates in
b has m     approvals  and no bribe can increase the number of approvals of p  in both
the negative and the strongnegative bribery setting   then clearly p still has m approvals
after the bribes  so  each of the  t candidates in b  that started with m     approvals 
must have lost exactly one approval  if any lost more than one approval  one would have
lost zero approvals and would beat p  if any lost zero approvals  it would beat p   so  we
have an exact cover by   sets 
due to the construction  one can use the same proof to show np hardness of approvalnegative bribery  the only voters approving p are voters who approve only p and are obviously never bribed 
q
theorem      for single peaked electorates  weakcondorcet weighted  bribery  weakcondorcet negative weighted bribery  and weakcondorcet negative weighted  bribery are
np complete  and the remaining five cases  weakcondorcet bribery  weakcondorcet bribery  weakcondorcet weighted bribery  weakcondorcet negative bribery  weakcondorcetnegative  bribery  are in p 
proof  the general setting is the same in all of the eight bribery problems and we describe
it here  let  c  v   be an election instance and let l be a linear order over the candidates
such that the electorate is single peaked with respect to l  the question is whether a
designated candidate p  c can be made a weakcondorcet winner by bribing at most k
voters 
if p is a weakcondorcet winner of the election  c  v    a successful bribery action is obviously possible as we do not have to bribe any voter  we can thus focus on the case where p
   

fibrandt  brill  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra

is not a weakcondorcet winner of  c  v    in this case  the definition of weakcondorcet
implies that p is not contained in the median interval  i e   p 
   m    mr  l   where m  and
mr are the top choices of the median voters   assume without loss of generality that p lies
strictly to the right of the median interval  i e   mr l p  otherwise  we can just mirror the
societal order l  
identify each voter with his or her most preferred candidate  define v     v  v   v l p 
as the multiset of voters lying to the left of p with respect to l and vr   v  v     v 
v   v   p or p l v  as the multiset of voters lying on p or to the right of p  in settings
where voters have no weights  mr l p immediately implies that
l kv  k  m kvr k and that  in
rk
order to make p a weakcondorcet winner  we need to bribe kv  kkv
voters from v  to
 
make p their top choice  or  in the negative bribery settings  to make the candidate to the
right
of p their
m top choice   if voters have weights  we have to shift a total weight of at least
l
w v   w vr  
  where w v     for a submultiset v    v of voters is defined in the natural way
 
p
as the sum of the weights of voters contained in v     i e   w v       vv   w v  
observe that all eight bribery problems are easily seen to be in np  we now prove the
assertions of theorem     in the order in which they are mentioned in the statement of the
theorem 
 i  weakcondorcet weighted  bribery is np complete 
define k as the weight that needs to be shifted from v  to p  i e

the problem weakcondorcet weighted  bribery can now be stated as follows  we
are given a collection of objects  voters   each with a positive integer weight and a
positive integer price  and bounds k and k  and the question is whether there exists
a subset whose price is at most k and whose weight is at least k  if so  bribe them
all to first choose p  if this holds  or if p initially wins   we succeed  else we fail 
it is straightforward to show that the np hard problem knapsack  see  e g   garey
  johnson        reduces directly to this problem  establishing the np hardness of
weakcondorcet weighted  bribery 
 ii  weakcondorcet negative weighted bribery is np complete 
we give a reduction from the np complete problem partition  see the proof
theorem       given a collection  k    k            kn   of positive integers that sum to
 k  define the single peaked election  c  v   with c    a  p  c   a l p l c  and for
each ki we have one voter vi whose first choice is a and whose weight is ki   set the
budget k equal to n  it is easy to see that p can win via negative bribery if and only
if  k    k            kn   can be partitioned into two equal sum parts 
 iii  weakcondorcet negative weighted  bribery is np complete 
this follows from  ii  
 iv  weakcondorcet bribery is in p 
   

fibypassing combinatorial protections

the algorithm is easy  bribe k voters chosen arbitrarily from v  to make p their top
choice  if  after the bribe  p is a weakcondorcet winner  we were successful  otherwise 
no successful bribery action exists 
 v  weakcondorcet  bribery is in p 
the algorithm is the same as in  iv   except that we bribe voters in the order of their
price tags  starting with the cheapest voter 
 vi  weakcondorcet weighted bribery is in p 
the algorithm is the same as in  iv   except that we bribe voters in the order of their
weights  starting with the voter that has the highest weight 
 vii  weakcondorcet negative bribery is in p 
this follows from  viii  
 viii  weakcondorcet negative  bribery is in p 
recall that p lies strictly to the right of the median interval  in the case of negative
bribery  bribed voters must not have p as their top choice  thus  p can never be made
a weakcondorcet winner if either  a  no voter has p as his or her first choice and kv k
is odd  or  b  p is on the right end of the societal order l   since p lies strictly to the
right of the median interval  p cannot be on the left end of l  
otherwise  let p be the candidate to the right of p with respect to l  successful
bribery is possible if and only if  by greedily bribing voters from v   starting with the
cheapest voter  to have p as their top choice  we can make p a weakcondorcet winner 
q
as a final comment  we note that it is easy to see that these problems can be solved
in pseudo polynomial time by dynamic programming  and so the np completeness results
above can not be strengthened to strong np completeness unless p   np 
a   additional proofs for section  
let t be one of the    control types defined by faliszewski et al       a   i e   the eleven
types  adding deleting candidates voters    types   unlimited adding of candidates   
type   and three partition types each with tp and te    types    each for both the constructive cases  making c win or uniquely win  and the destructive cases  making c not win
or not be a unique winner   let e be any election system  the following holds for both the
unique winner model and the nonunique winner model   recall from section     that when
we speak of a control problem being single peaked  we mean that the single peakedness
holds even including all potentially added candidates and voters  
theorem a    the t control problem for e is in p for single peaked electorates in our
default model  in which the societal order l is part of the input  if and only if the t control
problem for e is in p for single peaked electorates in the exists l model  in which we ask
if there exists some order l relative to which the input is single peaked and is such that the
goal can be achieved by a type t control action  
   

fibrandt  brill  hemaspaandra    hemaspaandra

proof  note that for any control problem instance and any l  and l   that are valid
societal orders relative to the instance  and here it is crucial that our notion is that all of
the instancenot just the voters candidates left in at the endmust respect an order for
it to be valid   then the set of successful  resp   unsuccessful  control actions under l  is
exactly the same as under l     thus  we have the following key observation 
    there exists a valid single peaked order relative to which the control problem instance can be successfully controlled if and only if the control problem instance can
be successfully controlled for every valid single peaked order 
so  if a control problem is in p for the model in which l is part of the input via algorithm a 
then for the exists l model  we can on a given instance i compute a valid l  e g   using the
algorithm of escoffier et al         and hand it to a  by     and the correctness of a  we
know that a gives the correct answer 
as to the other direction  if a control problem is in p for the exists l model  then thanks
to      we can simply strip l off the input in the model in which l is part of the input and
can safely  knowing the answer is correct for our original issue  ask the existential question
to the hypothetical p algorithm for the exists l version 
q
some particular instances of theorem a   were argued directly for particular cases of e
and t by faliszewski et al          but theorem a   provides a tool that removes the need
for case specific arguments 
theorem      for weakcondorcet elections  control by adding voters and control by deleting voters are each in p for single peaked electorates  in both the nonunique winner model
and the unique winner model 
proof  we here give algorithms for the nonunique winner model  for the unique winner
model  see the proof of theorem      by fact     on page      being a unique weakcondorcet
winner is tantamount to being a condorcet winner for single peaked electorates  
associate each voter with his or her most preferred candidate  our goal is to make p a
weakcondorcet winner  i e   we want to end up in one of the following two situations 
   kv k is odd and the median voter has p as his or her top choice 
   kv k is even and p lies in the  inclusive  interval  m    mr  l   where m  and mr are the
median voters   this includes the case where m    mr    in the following  we will
refer to  m    mr  l as the median interval 
here is an easy algorithm for the case of control by addition of voters  see where the
current median  or median interval  is  if p is the median  or if p lies in the median interval  
we are done  otherwise  assume without loss of generality that the median  interval  lies to
the left of p  then add unregistered voters whose top choice is either p or some candidate
to the right of p until p is a weakcondorcet winner or we hit our addition bound or we
have added all the unregistered voters of this sort  if at this point we have not succeeded 
success is impossible 
the algorithm for the control by deletion of voters case is similar  see where the current
median  or median interval  is  if p is the median  or if p lies in the median interval   we are
   

fibypassing combinatorial protections

done  otherwise  we need to shift the location of the median voter s  towards p  without
loss of generality assume that the median  interval  lies to the left of p  then we start
deleting voters at the left end of l until we make p a weakcondorcet winner or we hit our
deletion bound without success 
q
theorem      for condorcet elections  control by partition of voters is in p for singlepeaked electorates  in both the nonunique winner model and the unique winner model  and
in both the ties promote model and the ties eliminate model  note that all four cases
coincide here  
proof  let  c  v   be an instance of a condorcet election and let l be a linear order with
respect to which the electorate is single peaked  without loss of generality assume kck   
 otherwise  the problem is trivial   furthermore  p  c is a designated candidate and the
question is whether there exists some partition  v    v    such that p is a condorcet winner
of the overall election  it is clear that this is the case if and only if there exists a partition
 v    v    such that p is a condorcet winner in  c  v    and  c  v    has no condorcet winner  a
condorcet winner that p beats in a pairwise comparison  or p itself as a condorcet winner 
we show that algorithm   returns a partition with this property whenever one exists 
algorithm   loops over all candidates c that p beats in a pairwise comparison and over
all possible sizes of v   line     then the set c of candidates is divided into five regions
r    r            r  that are defined as follows  without loss of generality assume that p  l c 
i e   c lies to the right of p with respect to the societal order l  otherwise  just mirror
everything   region r  consists of all candidates to the left of p  i e   r     x  c   x  l p  
and region r  consists of p only  similarly  r  consists of all candidates to the right of c
and r  consists of c only  finally  r  consists of all remaining candidates  namely  the
candidates that lie between p and c with respect to l  note that all regions except r  and
r  may be empty  we have the following picture 
p
r

associate each voter with the candidate at the top of that voters preference order 
we now define p    a set of partitions of v with respect to the regions just defined  let
                            be a five dimensional vector of natural numbers  define p  as the set of
all partitions  v    v    of v that have the property that  for each i   i is the number of voters
in v  whose top choice is in ri  
for p       the key observation is the following  for x   p  c  it holds that x is a
condorcet winner in some election  c  v    with  v    v     p  if and only if x is a condorcet
winner in every election  c  v    with  v    v     p    that is  if we want to check whether x is
a condorcet winner in any of the primary elections  c  v    induced by any of the partitions
 v    v     p    it suffices to check just one of them to obtain the answer  by symmetry  the
same statement holds for condorcet winners of the elections  c  v    
the reason why this is true is that  given the number of voters in each region  it is
easy to compute the region s  of the median voter s   just by counting   since both p

for all                              n  with  i    i   k do
  
define p  as the set of partitions  v    v    of v such that for each i   i is
the number of voters in v  whose top choice is in ri
  
if p      then
  
let  v    v    be an arbitrary partition from p 
  
if p is a condorcet winner of  c  v    then
  
if either c or p is a condorcet winner of  c  v    then
  
return  v    v   
   
else if   v    v     p     c  v    has no condorcet winner then
   
return  v    v   
    return there is no partition that makes p an overall condorcet winner

and c constitute a region on their own  it is equally easy to tell whether they are condorcet
winners  using fact      
we have just shown that the queries in lines   and   of algorithm   can be efficiently
answered  we now go on to show how the query in line    can be efficiently answered 
i e   given    is there a partition  v    v     p  such that  c  v    has no condorcet winner 
clearly  this cannot happen if there are an odd number of voters in v    so assume kv  k to
be even and let m  and m  be the median voters  for each region ri   we know the number
of v   voters whose top choice is in ri  this number is kri k   i    thus we know in which
regions the median voters fall  again just by counting   now  if at least one of m  or m  fall
in r  or r   i e   are p or c   then  c  v    cannot possibly have a condorcet winner other
than p or c  there may be no condorcet winners   in any of these three cases  our partition
action was successful   and we can return an arbitrary partition in p   
the only remaining cases are that m  and m  both fall in r   r   r    if m  and
m  fall in different regions  there can obviously be no condorcet winner and we are done 
assume  therefore  that m  and m  both fall in ri with i             our goal is to assign
qi   kri k   i voters with top choice in ri to v  in such a way that the median pair in
v  does not fall on the same candidate  let the median pair be the rth and  r     st
v   voter in ri   here  r     r  qi     is known  by the numbers of v   voters to the left
and right of ri   and we count from left to right with respect to the societal order l  we
will try to accomplish our goal by brute force  namely  for each pair of candidates  d    dr  
in ri with d   l dr   let us try to ensure that the rth v   voter in ri from the left falls
on or left of d  and the  r     st falls on or right of dr   we can do this if and only if
k x  v   x falls in ri  x l d   k  r and k x  v   x falls in ri  dr l x k  qi  r 
the cost of this check is in o kck     as for each pair of candidates in ri   we do some easy
counting 
summing up  the running time of algorithm   can be bounded as follows  the number of
iterations for the loops in lines       and    are bounded by kck  kv k  and kv k    respectively 
the cost of one iteration of the inner loop is clearly dominated by the cost of answering
    in fact  if either p or c is a condorcet winner in  c  v     this would already have been detected in line   

   

fibypassing combinatorial protections

the query in line     this cost is bounded by o kck     as argued in the last paragraph 
altogether  this yields a running time that is obviously polynomial in the size of the input 
correctness of algorithm   should be clear from the explanations above  as we have
argued that we find a partition that makes p an overall condorcet winner if and only if
such a partition exists  in particular  observe that we never need to consider cases with
k     as p can never be a condorcet winner of  c     and the case where p is already a
condorcet winner of the original election  c  v   is handled by setting k to kv k in line  
 and c to some arbitrary candidate from c   p  in line    
q
theorem      for condorcet elections  control by adding voters and control by deleting
voters are each in p for single peaked electorates  in both the nonunique winner model and
the unique winner model 
proof  associate each voter with his or her most preferred candidate  our goal is to
make p a condorcet winner  i e   we want to end up in a situation where p is the most
preferred candidate of the median voter s  
here is an easy algorithm for the case of control by addition of voters  see where the
current median  or median pair  is  if it is on p  we are done  otherwise  add unregistered
voters whose top choice is p until we have added all those or we succeed or we hit our
addition bound  if we succeed or hit our addition bound  we are done  with or without
success   if we have not yet hit our addition bound  move on as follows  if p is strictly
between two median voters at this point  success is impossible  but if it is one of two distinct
median voters  without loss of generality say it is the rightmost of the two median voters 
or the median interval does not contain p  without loss of generality say the interval lies to
the left of p   then add unregistered voters to the right of p until we make p a condorcet
winner or we hit our addition bound or we have added all the unregistered voters of this
sort  if at this point we have not succeeded  success is impossible 
the algorithm for the control by deletion of voters case is similar  see where the current
median  or median pair  is  if it is on p  we are done  otherwise  we need to shift the location
of the median voter s  towards p  without loss of generality assume that the median  or
median interval  lies to the left of p  then we start deleting voters at the left end of l until
we make p a condorcet winner or we hit our deletion bound without success  note that if p
initially lies in between the two median voters  it can never be made a condorcet winner
by deleting voters
