abstract
we consider the iterated belief change that occurs following an alternating sequence
of actions and observations  at each instant  an agent has beliefs about the actions that
have occurred as well as beliefs about the resulting state of the world  we represent such
problems by a sequence of ranking functions  so an agent assigns a quantitative plausibility
value to every action and every state at each point in time  the resulting formalism is able
to represent fallible belief  erroneous perception  exogenous actions  and failed actions 
we illustrate that our framework is a generalization of several existing approaches to belief
change  and it appropriately captures the non elementary interaction between belief update
and belief revision 

   introduction
many formal approaches have been introduced for reasoning about belief change in the context of actions and observations  jin   thielscher        shapiro  pagnucco  lesperance 
  levesque        delgrande   levesque         in general  the underlying assumption
is that agents perform belief update following actions and belief revision following observations  existing formalisms  for the most part  have treated actions and observations
independently  with little explicit discussion about the interaction between the two  in this
paper  we consider the belief change that occurs due to an alternating sequence of actions
and observations  we are interested in action domains where an agent may have erroneous
beliefs  both about the state of the world as well as the action history 
let k denote the beliefs of an agent  given by a set of possible worlds  for    i  n 
let ai denote an action and let oi denote an observation  informally  we are interested in
sequences of the form
k  a   o       an  on
   
where  is an update operator and  is a revision operator  our interpretation of this
expression is flexible in that the actions may be understood to represent actions executed
by a particular agent  or they may be exogenous  note that such sequences may contain
conflicting information  for example  the observation on may not be possible following the
actions a            an   in this case  there are two options 
   reject on  
   accept on   and modify a            an

in order to determine which option is preferable for a specific problem  an agent needs to
be able to compare the plausibility of on with the plausibility of each ai  
expressions of the form     have previously been addressed  under the assumption that
ontic action histories are infallible and recent observations take precedence over older observations  hunter   delgrande         clearly  there are action domains in which these
assumptions are not reasonable  in this paper  we propose a more flexible approach in
which actions and observations are both represented by spohn style ranking functions  we
take this approach because it gives a uniform treatment of the plausibility of beliefs  observations  and actions  when presented with conflicting information  an agent can simply
compare the relative plausibility of each action and observation  a uniform representation
of all events makes it straightforward to determine the most plausible sequence  moreover  with quantitative plausibility values  we can encode a variety of distinct scenarios by
manipulating the magnitudes of the plausibility values for alternative events 
this paper makes several contributions to existing work on epistemic action effects 
the main contribution is a formal mechanism for reasoning about incorrect or weakly held
beliefs related to action histories  existing formalisms are generally unable to compare
the plausibility of an action occurrence with the plausibility of a state of the world  this
is a problem because  in practical reasoning problems  agents are often put in a position
where they can either believe a certain fact holds or they can believe that some action has
occurred  by using the same formal tool to represent beliefs about actions and states  we
explicitly address the manner in which prior action occurrences are postulated or retracted
in response to new observations 
a second contribution of this work is a flexible treatment of weak or unreliable observations  while some revision operators incorporate each new observation  it is obvious that
this is not a desirable feature in many reasoning domains  in many cases  it is preferable to
discard an unreliable observation if it conflicts with current  strongly held beliefs  however 
our approach does not simply allow an unreliable observation to be discarded  since we
use ranking functions to represent observations  each observation also includes plausible
alternatives  as such  each observation can actually provide evidence of several different
states  and to differing degrees  we will see that this is useful in representing observations
of states with similar appearance  similarly  ranking functions can give a natural representation of addititive evidence  in the form of observations that must occur several times
before changing an agents beliefs 
we formulate all of our results in a simple transition system framework that makes
our treatment of action effects explicit and easy to compare with more elaborate action
formalisms  however  our fundamental approach to dealing with uncertainty does not
actually require transition systems to be used for action effects  we do not intend for
the methodology described here to compete with alternative formalisms for representing
epistemic action effects  rather  we provide a high level approach to dealing with uncertain
action histories that focuses specifically on the interaction between actions and observations 
the significant feature of this work is that it demonstrates how a single representation of
plausibility can be used to model iterated beliefs about actions and states simultaneously 
the basic approach could be employed in other action formalisms  at a practical level  we
demonstrate the utility of our work by giving a series of examples involving belief change
in which the relative weight given to actions and observations varies  we suggest that our
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

work advances existing work on reasoning about epistemic action effects in that we provide
a flexible  elaboration tolerant approach for capturing several different kinds of belief change
that can occur when there is uncertainty about action occurrences  note that this paper is
an extended version of the work presented by hunter and delgrande        
we proceed as follows  in section    we introduce the formal preliminaries  we then
define a general class of plausibility functions in section    and we show how a sequence
of plausibility functions can be used to represent an uncertain sequence of actions and
observations  we refer to such a sequence as a graded world view  and we demonstrate
how an agents beliefs about event histories can captured by graded world views through
taking aggregates of the constituent plausibility functions  in section    we demonstrate
that graded world views can be seen as epistemic states  and we use our basic framework
to define belief change in domains involving uncertainty about the actions and observations
that have occurred  we compare our approach with related work in section    and we
discuss limitations and advantages in section    in section    we offer some concluding
remarks 

   preliminaries
in this section  we introduce some standard formal machinery for modelling belief change 
and for reasoning about action effects  we also introduce a simple motivating example to
illustrate the sort of problem we would like to address 
    belief revision
belief revision refers to the process in which an agent incorporates new information along
with some pre existing beliefs  the most influential approach to belief revision is the agm
approach  alchourron  gardenfors    makinson         let f denote a finite set of fluent
symbols  which represent binary properties of the world that may change over time  for
example  there may be a fluent symbol raining  f that is true just in case it is raining 
a state is a propositional interpretation of f  indicating which fluents are true and which
are false  in the agm approach to belief revision  the beliefs of an agent are represented
by a belief set  which is a deductively closed set of formulas over f  since f is finite  we
can equivalently define the beliefs of an agent to be represented by a single formula 
informally  a belief revision operator is a function that takes a belief set  and a formula for revision  as input and returns a new formula that represents a new belief set
incorporating   an agm revision operator is a binary function  that satisfies the agm
postulates  the following reformulation of the agm postulates is due to katsuno and
mendelzon         in the postulates   denotes logical equivalence

if        is satisfiable  then        implies

the class of agm revision operators can be captured semantically by introducing a
formal notion of plausibility  for a particular agent  we say that a state of the world s
is more plausible than another state s  if that agent is more likely to abandon belief in
s  when presented with new information  it turns out that every agm revision operator
can be characterized by a class of plausibility orderings over the set of states  this has
been proved for several different representations of plausibility  including total pre orders
over states  katsuno   mendelzon         systems of spheres  grove         and ordinal
conditional functions  spohn        
a belief state is a set of states  informally the set of states that an agent considers
possible  an observation  is also a set of states  which informally represents some peice of
information that an agent receives that provides evidence that the actual state is in   in
this paper  we are primarily interested in belief change as a process on states rather than
formulas  it is clear that the agm approach can equivalently be defined on belief states 
while we have restricted the set of fluents and the set of actions to be finite  this is
really just for convenience when discussing examples  our formal model will be based
on transition systems and ranking functions over sets  it would certainly be possible to
define transition relations and ranking functions over infinite sets  since our definition of
an aggregate is very general  this would introduce no formal complications  however  from
this point on  we will maintain the restriction to finite domains in order to simplify the
discussion 
    transition systems
we are interested in action domains that can be described by supplementing the set f of
fluent symbols with a finite set a of action symbols and a transition system describing the
effects of actions  gelfond   lifschitz         a pair  f  a  is called an action signature 
while we have defined a state to be an interpretation over f  it is often convenient to
identify a state s with the set of fluent symbols true in s  we use this convention in the
following definition  and throughout the rest of the paper 
definition   a transition system is a pair hs  ri where s   f   r  s  a  s 
we restrict attention to deterministic transition systems  i e  we assume that hs  a  s  i  r
and hs  a  s   i  r implies s    s     we also assume that a always contains a distinguished
null action symbol denoted by  
belief update is the belief change that occurs when an agent becomes aware of a change
in the state of the world  note that this is a distinct process from belief revision  which
is typically understood to capture the belief change that occurs when an agent has obtained new information about an unchanged world  one highly influential approach to
belief update is the katsuno mendelzon approach  katsuno   mendelzon         which
is superficially similar to agm revision in that the new information to be incorporated
is encoded as a propositional formula  by contrast  in this paper  we define update with
respect to an action with effects given by an underlying transition system  in other words 
we define belief update operators that take a belief state and an action as input  and return
a new belief state that represents an agents new beliefs after the action has been executed 
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

definition   let t   hs  ri be a transition system  the update function     s  a   s
is given by   a    s   hs    a  si  r for some s     
we remark that this notion of belief change can also be called belief progression or action
progression  note that it is possible in the general case for the result of this update to be
empty  in the case where the transition system does not include any outgoing edge labelled a
from a state in   in order to avoid this problem  it is often convenient to restrict attention
to transition systems where every action has an outcome in every state  in practice  this
can be achieved by assuming a self loop for the action a at any state where no outcome
state is given 
    belief evolution
in previous work  we introduced so called belief evolution operators to reason about alternating sequences of updates and revisions  hunter   delgrande         a belief evolution
operator is defined with respect to a fixed agm revision operator  and a fixed update
operator   for any action a and observation   let    a  denote the set of all s such that
 s   a    note that this set may be empty  the belief evolution operator  is defined
such that  for any belief state  
  ha  i         a    a 
the complete definition of  actually defines the belief change for a sequence of actions and
observations  but the details of this definition are not required at present  the important
point is that the way each observation is incorporated depends on the preceding actions 
the intuition behind belief evolution is that the final state must be a possible effect of
the most recently executed action a  this intuition is satisfied in the original definition by
revising the initial belief set prior to computing the effects of a  as a result  belief evolution
operators have a non markovian character  an observation can not be incorporated just by
considering the current state of the world  instead  an agent incorporates a new observation
by looking back at the original state together with the complete history of actions  however 
this operation can also be understood in a markovian manner if we allow the current belief
state to include some representation of the states that can be ruled out based on the
actions that have previously occurred  in this manner  we can define a markovian form of
belief revision that is equivalent to belief evolution  hunter        
belief evolution provides a reasonable model for problems like moores litmus paper
problem  moore         in this problem  an agent dips a piece of litmus paper in a beaker
to determine if the beaker contains an acid or a base  hence  the agent is performing an
action first and then observing the results  it seems  however  that the observed results
should affect the agents initial belief state  that is  after the litmus paper turns red  the
agent is likely to conclude that the beaker contained an acid even before dipping 
belief evolution operators satisfy the following properties  in these properties  a  a 
a denotes a sequence of action symbols of indeterminate length  and  f denotes the set
of all states over f  the symbols  and  both range over  f   though we think of  as
a belief state and we think of  as an observation  following the standard convention for
such postulates  we implicitly quantify universally over all variables 
   

fihunter   delgrande

   if   f  a         then    a     
   if   f  a        then    a        a
      a        a   
   if    a         then    a        a   
      a      f  a
informally  these properties assert that an agent should respect the history of actions executed when incorporating a new observation  note that we are assuming that  is an agm
revision operator  which would appear to make properties     and     trivial  however 
they are included as properties of belief evolution to emphasize the fact that the actions
preceding the obervation need to be considered in all cases where revision occurs  hunter
  delgrande        
one of the main limitations of belief evolution is that it is not possible to represent
erroneous action histories  it is assumed that the action history is always correct  this is a
reasonable assumption in action domains where there is a single agent executing actions that
can not fail  however  if exogenous or failed actions are permitted  then this assumption is
difficult to support  in general  an agent may have incorrect beliefs about the actions that
have occurred in the past  one of our aims in this paper is to generalize our previous work
to allow erroneous action histories 
    motivating example
we introduce a common sense example in which an agent needs to compare the plausibility
of certain actions with the plausibility of observations  we will return to this example
periodically as we introduce our formal machinery 
consider a simple action domain involving four agents  bob  alice  eve  and trent  bob
places a chocolate chip cookie on his desk and then leaves the room  he believes that no one
is likely to eat his cookie while he is gone  at time    bob knows that alice is at his desk 
at time    bob knows that eve is at his desk  after eve leaves his desk  trent comes and
tells bob that a bite has been taken from the cookie 
given the preceding information  bob can draw three reasonable conclusions  alice
bit the cookie  eve bit the cookie  or trent gave him poor information  if bob has no
additional information about the world  then each conclusion is equally plausible  however 
we suppose that bob does have some additional information  in particular  suppose that
alice is a close friend of bob and they have shared cookies in the past  moreover  suppose
that bob believes that trent is always honest  bobs additional information about alice
and trent provides a sufficient basis for determining which of the three possible conclusions
is the most plausible 
informally  prior to trents report  bob believes that his cookie was unbitten at all
earlier points in time  after trent tells him the cookie is bitten  he must determine the most
plausible world history consistent with this information  in this case  the most plausible
solution is to conclude that alice bit the cookie  note that this conclusion requires bob
to alter his subjective view of the action history  there is a non monotonic character to
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

belief change in this context  because bob may be forced to postulate and retract actions
over time in response to new observations  the consequences of changing the action history
are determined by the underlying transition system  in order to represent this kind of
reasoning  we need to be able to compare the plausibility of action occurrences at different
points in time 
this example illustrates the kind of action scenario that we would like to capture 
because it requires an agent to determine the most plausible history given some a priori
notion of plausibility for actions and observations  for instance  it is intuitively clear that
this problem can not be resolved without comparing the plausibility of trents report being
accurate versus the plausibility of alice biting the cookie  by addressing this issue in a
straightforward manner  we demonstrate how existing actions formalisms can be extended
and employed to handle similar situations 
there is possibly one contentious issue in our discussion of this example  the information provided by trent is not really an observation in the usual sense of the word  instead 
it is a report of information from an external source  however  in the sections that follow 
we will treat reports and observations in the same manner  specifically  we will capture
both by a ranking function over states that indicates which states are supported by the
observation report and to what degree  of course  in reality  observations and reports are
quite different in that the manner in which a report is incorporated depends on trust in
the reporting agent  the relationship between trust and belief change is a topic of current
interest  which is generally handled by introducing some extra formal machinery to encode
the trust held in another agent  lorini  jiang    perrussel        hunter   booth        
it would certainly be possible to follow this approach in the present paper  using distinct
formal tools to capture trust as a phenomenon that is distinct from the perceived accuracy
of sensing  however  mathematically  we would like to end up with a single ranking over
states nevertheless  as such  for the present paper  it is more convenient to represent reported information through a single combined ranking that captures the final plausibility
attached to each state based on all considerations an agent might make 

   ranking functions over actions and states
the approach presented in this paper is based on a simple notion  when an agent is uncertain
about some action or observation  resolving this uncertainty generally involves comparing
the relative likelihood of possible alternatives  our work is distinguished by the fact that we
use sequences of ranking functions to represent uncertainty over both actions and states  we
will see that sequences of ranking functions can capture many natural reasoning problems 
by developing high level representations of these problems  we can see that some notion of
magnitude of likelihood is useful for reasoning about belief change with uncertain action
histories  this allows us to compare our work with existing formalisms for reasoning about
epistemic action effects  particularly those in which the representation of uncertainty is
limited to orderings over states  our fundamental goal is to demonstrate that  in some
cases  sequences of quantitative plausibility orderings have a expressive advantage that
is significant from the perspective of knowledge representation  the aim is to develop
our approach at a high level  in a manner that can easily be translated into other action
formalisms

    plausibility functions
we are interested in action domains where an agents beliefs about an action history may
be incorrect  in this context  the action that is believed to be executed at any given point
in time can be represented by a total pre order over possible actions  the minimal elements
of such a pre order represent the actions that were most likely executed  and moving higher
in the ordering gives increasingly implausible possibilities  representing actions in this
manner allows an agent to determine plausible alternative actions in the face of conflicting
evidence  similarly  an agent needs a mechanism for ordering states in order to represent
fallible observations and fallible beliefs  moreover  we would like to be able to compare
orderings over actions with orderings over states  one natural way to create mutually
comparable orderings is by assigning quantitative plausibility values to every action and
state at every point in time  towards this end  we define plausibility functions 
definition   let x be a non empty set  a plausibility function over x is a function
r   x  n 
if r is a plausibility function and r x   r y   then we say that x is at least as plausible as
y  we will only be interested in plausibility functions over finite sets  where there is always
a non empty set of minimally ranked elements 
plausibility functions are inspired by spohns ordinal conditional functions  spohn 
       but there are some important differences  first  we allow plausibility functions
over an arbitrary set x  rather than restricting attention to propositional interpretations 
this allows us to treat actions in the same manner that we treat observations  another
important difference is that ordinal conditional functions must always assign rank   to a
non empty subset of elements of the domain  plausibility functions are not restricted in this
manner  the minimal rank for a given plausibility function may be greater than    we have
defined plausibility functions in this manner because we will be interested in taking sums
over plausibility functions  and we need to ensure that such sums also define plausibility
functions 
we remark that darwiche and pearl also consider ranking functions that do not necessarily assign rank   to any states  darwiche   pearl         however  darwiche and pearl
define the belief state associated with r to be the set of states that are assigned rank   
under this convention  ranking functions that never assign rank   are associated with the
empty belief state  by contrast  we associate a non empty belief state with every plausibility
function 
we introduce some useful terminology and notation  let r be a plausibility function
over x  the minimum and maximum values obtained by r are denoted by minr and maxr  
respectively  we define bel r  to be the set  s   r s    minr    this notation is intended to
suggest that bel r  is the set of actions or states that are believed  to be clear  when we
say that a state s is believed  we mean that as far as the agent is concerned  the actual world
could be described by s  on the other hand  when we say that an action a is believed  we
mean that the agent views a to be the action that was executed  note that minr is always
defined  because any non empty set of natural numbers has a minimum element  on the
other hand  maxr is only guaranteed to be defined when x is finite  however  we will be
only concerned with plausibility functions over states and actions  these are both finite sets
according to our original definitions 
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

for   x  we define r   to be the minimum value obtained by r for some s    the
degree of strength of a plausibility function r is the least n such that minr  n   r s  for
some s   bel r   hence  the degree of strength of r is the span between the plausibility
of the minimally ranked elements and the non minimally ranked elements  if r has degree
of strength n  this means that every s   bel r  has a plausibility value that is at least n
higher than r bel r    there are two natural interpretations of the degree of strength of a
plausibility function r over a set of states  if we think of r as an initial epistemic state  then
the degree of strength is an indication of how strongly it is believed that the actual state
is in bel r   if we think of r as an observation  then the degree of strength is a measure
of the subjective reliability of r  in the case where x is a set of states  we use the terms
degree of strength and degree of belief interchangeably 
the notion of degree of strength is of crucial importance in our approach  if we use
a total pre order to represent plausibility  then there is really no corresponding notion of
strength to distinguish a situation where the most plausible belief is very strongly held
versus one where it is weakly held  but this kind of distinction is essential when we have
to sort out a sequence of events  we need some notion of strength of belief to decide which
state or action is the hardest to give up  it is possible to represent this kind of information
in an ordering with empty levels  of course  however  our focus will be on aggregating
sequences of belief states and actions  in order to make this as simple as possible  we suggest
that it is better to use the compact representation given by a quantitative ranking function
that lends itself naturally to arithmetical combinations 
note that spohn        defines the degree of strength of a subset of x  rather than the
degree of strength of a ranking function  our definition coincides with spohns definition
if we identify the degree of strength of r with spohns degree of strength of the set bel r  
hence  we use the same conception of degree of strength  but we are only interested in the
strength of belief in the minimally ranked elements 
in order to illustrate the application of plausibility functions over different domains  we
continue our simple example 
example  contd  let f    b itet aken  and let a    b itealice  biteeve   both
actions have the same effect  namely they both make the fluent b itet aken become true 
we represent the problem with   plausibility functions  a    a    and o   
   a  is a plausibility function over actions at time  
   a  is a plausibility function over actions at time  
   o  is a plausibility function over states at time  
informally  each function should obtain a minimum value at the event that bob considers
the most plausible at the given point in time  since bob initially believes that no one will
eat his cookie  both a  and a  should obtain a minimum value at the null action   trents
report that the cookie has been bitten at time   is represented as a plausibility function
over states  by defining o  with a minimum at the set of worlds where the cookie has a bite
out of it  note that we will generally treat reported information in this manner  the degree
of strength of a report is an indication of trust in the agent providing the report  the
   

fihunter   delgrande

additional soft constraints about bobs relationships are used to determine the magnitude
of the values for each event  define a  and a  by the values in the following table 
a 
a 


 
 

b itealice
 
  

b iteeve
  
 

the columns of the table give the plausibilities of each action at each time  in particular 
a  encodes that the plausibility  occurs is    whereas the plausibility of b itealice and
b iteeve are   and     respectively  the degree of strength of a  is    whereas the degree
of strength of a  is    the fact that alice is more likely to bite the cookie is represented by
assigning a low plausibility value to b itealice at time   
we define o  as follows  so give the plausibility values for all states at time   
o 


 

 b itet aken 
 

hence  the observation  b itet aken  is assigned the minimum plausibility value  and
the only alternative observation is assigned a very high plausibility value  the degree of
strength of o  is    this reflects the fact that trents report is understood to be stronger
than the assumption that alice and eve do not bite the cookie 
note that the degree of strength of a  is less than the degree of strength of a  and o   
this gives an indication that bob has comparatively less confidence in his beliefs about the
action at time   
note that  in this example  we have explicitly referred to points in time  we do not 
however  include any formal representation of time in the our framework  any reference
to time should be interpreted as an informal explanatory device  we are concerned with
reasoning about scenarios that involve sequences of actions where each action is instantanenous  and all actions are executed consecutively  nevertheless  since we allow observations
following null actions  we can imagine that actions are being executed in accordance with
a bounded global clock that allows one action per tick 
    graded world views
we define a graded world view to be an alternating sequence of plausibility functions over
 f and plausibility functions over a  hence  at each time i  we use a plausibility function
over  f to represent an agents beliefs about the state of the world and we use a plausibility
function over a to represent an agents beliefs about the action that occurs  informally 
a graded world view represents an agents subjective view of the evolution of the world in
the context of imperfectly known action histories  the rationale behind using a sequence of
ranking functions is to eventually make it possible to compare the likelihood of actions and
observations at different points in the sequence  to arrive at the most plausible sequence of
events  we have the following formal definition 
definition   a graded world view of length n is a   n      tuple
hobs    act    obs            actn   obsn i
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

where each obsi is a plausibility function over  f and each acti is a plausibility function
over a 
at time i  the most plausible actions are the minimally ranked actions of acti and the
most plausible states are the minimally ranked states of obsi   we take obs  to represent the initial belief state  and each subsequent obsi to represent a new observation  if
act   hact            actn i and obs   hobs            obsn i  then we write hact  obsi
as a shorthand for the graded world view hobs    act    obs            actn   obsn i  informally  a graded world view represents an agents subjective view of the history of actions
and observations 
we remark briefly on the intuition behind graded world views  we are interested in
action domains involving actions that are both partially observable and fallible  however 
for the moment we do not consider failed actions  we address this issue briefly in      the
plausibility of an action a represents an agents confidence that a was successfully executed
at a given instant  hence  the lowest plausibility values will be assigned to actions that an
agent has executed  or actions that an agent has observed directly  higher plausibility
values will be assigned to exogenous actions that are assumed to be unlikely  or action
occurrences that are only believed based on external reports  in      we provide some
additional motivation for plausibility values by illustrating a correspondence with subjective
probability functions 
note that graded world views essentially represent the initial belief state as an observation at time    the underlying assumption in a graded world view is that the initial belief
state is no different than any subsequent observation  there is no reason to automatically
prefer the initial beliefs over new information  nor is there any reason to automatically
disregard the initial beliefs given new information  in the definition of a graded world view 
we have used indices in a manner that is not symmetric in order to emphasize the unique
stature of obs    in particular  note that there is no act  in the definition  this simple
notational convention is intended to highlight the fact that obs  has a slightly different
stature at an informal level 
    aggregate plausibility functions
given a graded world view hact  obsi  we would like to be able to determine the most
plausible history of the world  we formally define the notion of a history over a transition
system 
definition   let t   hs  ri be a transition system  a history of length n is a tuple
hs    a            an   sn i where for each i 
   si  s 
   ai  a  and
   hsi   ai     si   i  r 
let histn denote the set of histories of length n 
note that histn  s   a  s n   ideally  we would like to use graded world views
to assign plausibility values to histories  however  a graded world view does not provide
   

fihunter   delgrande

sufficient information to define a unique plausibility function over histories  for example  a
graded world view does not indicate the relative weight of recent information versus initial
information  in order to determine the most plausible history  we need some mechanism for
combining a sequence of plausibility functions 
although a graded world view does not define a unique plausibility function over histories  we can define a general notion of consistency between graded world views and plausibility functions on histories  let r            rn be plausibility functions over x            xn  
respectively  let r be a plausibility function over x       xn   we say that r is consistent
with hr            rn i if  for every i and every xi   x i  xi
ri  xi     ri  x i  

r hx            xi           xn i    r hx            x i           xn i 
so r is consistent with hact  obsi just in case r increases monotonically with respect
to each component of hact  obsi  any plausibility function r that is consistent with
hact  obsi provides a potential candidate ranking over histories 
define an aggregate plausibility function to be a function that maps every graded world
view of length n to a plausibility function over histn   we are interested in aggregate
plausibility functions in which the output is always consistent with the input  hence  we
say that an aggregate plausibility function agg is admissible if  for every hact  obsi  the
function agg hact  obsi  is consistent with hact  obsi 
we provide some examples  note that aggregate plausibility functions return a function
as a value  we can specify the behaviour of an aggregate by specifying a plausibility value
for each pair consisting of a graded world view and a history  let h   hs    a            an   sn i 
one admissible aggregate is obtained by taking the sum of plausibility values 
sum hact  obsi  h   

n
x

acti  ai    

i  

n
x

obsi  si  

i  

a weighted sum can be used to reflect the relative importance of different time points  for
each i  let bi be a positive integer 
sums  hact  obsi  h   

n
x

acti  ai    

i  

n
x

bi  obsi  si   

i  

by setting bi    i   the aggregate function sums can be used to represent a strict preference
for recent observations  this is a standard assumption in many approaches to belief revision 
we could add a similar weight to the action histories as well  which would give another
distinct aggregate  the functions sum and sums are just two simple examples  many more
examples can be defined by specifying aggregate functions that increase monotonically with
each component 
we return to the cookie example to illustrate how the reasoning involved can be captured
with graded world views and aggregate plausibility functions 
example  contd  we have already defined plausibility functions a    a  and o    in order
to give a complete graded world view  we need to define two more plausibility functions over
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

states  in particular  we need to give a plausibility function o  representing bobs initial
beliefs and we need to give a plausibility function o  representing the null observation that
bob makes at time   
first  we reiterate the description of a  and a  in the following table 

a 
a 


 
 

b itealice
 
  

b iteeve
  
 

the fact that alice is more likely to bite the cookie is represented by assigning a lower
plausibility value to b itealice at time   
the plausibility function o  should assign a minimum value to the state where the cookie
is unbitten  the plausibility function o  should assign the same value to every state  the
plausibility function o   given previously  represents trents report that the cookie has been
bitten  as noted previously  we treat reported information as an observation  and we use
the degree of strength of the reported information as an indication of the reliability of the
source  in this case  the degree of strength of o  is an indication of trust in trent  we define
o    o    o  in the next table 

o 
o 
o 


 
 
 

 b itet aken 
 
 
 

note that the degree of strength of o  is higher than the degree of strength of a  or a   
this reflects the fact that trents report is understood to supersede the assumption that
alice and eve do not bite the cookie  graded world views have been defined precisely for
this kind of comparison between action plausibilities and state plausibilities 
if we use the aggregate function sum  then we are interested in finding the minimal sum
of plausibilities over ho    a    o    a    o  i  by inspection  we find that the minimum plausibility
is obtained by the following history 
h   h  b itealice  b itet aken    b itet akeni 
this history represents the sequence of events in which alice bites the cookie at time   
intuitively  this is the correct solution  given the choice between alice and eve  bob believes
that alice is the more plausible culprit 
we remark that graded world views bear a resemblance to the generalized belief change
framework proposed by liberatore and schaerf         however  the liberatore schaerf
approach associates a penalty with state change  which is minimized when determining
plausible models  as such  it is difficult to represent problems where non null actions are
strictly more plausible than null actions  by contrast  graded world views have no implicit
preference for null actions  moreover  our approach differs in that we allow actions with
conditional effects given by a transition system 
   

fihunter   delgrande

    subjective probabilities
one issue that arises from our definition of a graded world view is the fact that it is not clear
how plausibility values should be assigned in practical problems  we address this problem
by illustrating a correspondence between plausibility functions and probability functions 
we simplify the discussion by restricting attention to rational valued probability functions
as follows 
definition   let x be a non empty set  a probability function over x is a function
p r   x  q such that
 for all x  x     p r x    
p

xx p r x      
we do not need any other axioms of probability theory for our present purposes  at a
common sense level  it is clear what it means to say that action a occurred at time t with
probability p  by contrast  the problem with plausibility values is that there is no obvious
sense of scale  it is difficult to assign numerical plausibility values  because the numbers have
no clear meaning  we illustrate how probability functions can be translated uniformly into
plausibility functions  thereby giving a sense of scale and meaning to plausibility values 
let p r be a probability function over a finite set x  let q denote the least common
denominator of all rational numbers pq such that p r x    pq for some x  x  define the
plausibility function r as follows 
   if p r x  is minimal  set r x    q 
   otherwise  if p r x   

p
q 

then set r x    q  p 

hence  every probability function can be translated into a plausibility function 
example  contd  consider the following probability functions for the cookie example 

p ra 
p ra 


  
  

b itealice
   
   

b iteeve
   
   


  
  
  

p ro 
p ro 
p ro 

 b itet aken 
  
  
  

the corresponding plausibility functions are given in the following tables 

a

b itealice
  
  

b iteeve
  
  

o  
o  
o  


 
 
  

 b itet aken 
  
 
 

it is easy to see that these plausibility functions are obtained from the plausibility
functions given earlier by adding a constant to each value  in      we illustrate that adding
a constant in this manner does not affect the class of minimally ranked histories 
connecting plausibility functions with subjective probabilities provides some justification for the use of the aggregate function sum  in particular  if we assume that the subjective
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

probability functions are independent  then the probability of a given sequence of events is
determined by taking a product  in the cookie example  we can compare the probability of
alice biting the cookie versus eve biting the cookie 
   p r h  b itealice  b itet aken    b itet akeni 
                               
   p r h      b iteeve  b itet akeni 
                               
it is easy to check that the history where alice bites the cookie is actually the most probable history  so  in this example  the minimally ranked history according to the aggregate
function sum is also the most probable history according to the sequence of probability
functions  this is a general property of our translation  maximizing probability over independent probability functions corresponds to minimizing the sum over plausibility values 
this follows simply from the fact that the more probable events have been assigned minimal plausibility values  and the fact that summation over natural numbers is an increasing
function  whereas multiplication on fractions less than   is decreasing 
the correspondence descibed in this section relies on the assumption that sequences of
actions are independent  it is worth noting  however  that this very often is not the case
in practice  instead  it is often the case that actions occur in sequences with some clear
dependence between the individual actions  however  this is not our concern at present  the
only reason for considering probability functions is to provide some intuition or motivation
for the way that plausibility values can be assigned 
    the summation convention
in order to ground the discussion  it is useful to choose a fixed aggregate function for assigning plausibility values to histories  as such  unless otherwise indicated  we will assume
that plausibility values are assigned to histories by the aggregate function sum  although
this is not the only approach to combining plausibility functions  it provides a simple admissible aggregate function that is appropriate in many cases  in particular  we saw in the
previous section that sum is appropriate for domains where the plausibility functions have
been obtained from independent subjective probabilities 
we introduce some notation that will simplify the results in the next few sections 
recall that sum hact  obsi  is a plausibility function on histories  when the underlying
graded world view is clear from the context  we will write plaus h  as a shorthand for
sum hact  obsi  h  
it is useful to introduce an operator that maps a graded world view to the most plausible
histories 
definition   let w vn denote the set of graded world views of length n for a fixed action
signature  define    w vn   histn as follows 
 hact  obsi     h   plaus h   plaus g  for all g  histn   
we have the following obvious equivalence
 hact  obsi    bel sum hact  obsi   
   

fihunter   delgrande

it is also useful to use plaus to define a plausibility function over states 
definition   let hact  obsi be a graded world view  for any state s  define
plaus state hact  obsi  s 
to be the least n such that plaus hact  obsi  h    n for some history h with final state
s 
so the plausibility of the state s is the rank of the most plausible history ending with s 
when the underlying graded world view is clear from context  we simply write plaus state s 
for the plausibility of the state s  we extend the operator bel   to graded world views
by defining bel hact  obsi  to be bel plaus state hact  obsi    hence  bel takes a
graded world view as an argument and returns the most plausible set of terminal states 
    a uniform representation
before considering applications and formal results  we briefly discuss the most novel and
significant features of our approach  the notion of plausibility and the relation with theory
change has been explored extensively in the literature  work on nonmonotonic consequence
operators  for example  has been informed by notions of preferred models  kraus  lehmann 
  magidor        and conditional knowledge  lehmann   magidor         there has also
been a great deal of research on different representations of plausibility  ranging from orderings  baltag   smets              britz   varzinczak         to quantitative approaches
to possibility  benferhat  dubois    prade         to variations on probabilistic models
 friedman   halpern         we take a moment to position our work in this context 
as we have stated several times  what sets our work apart is that we apply the same
notion of plausibility uniformly to both states and actions  this contrasts with most existing
work  where a model of plausibility is used for representing initial beliefs  but then actions
are handled with different formal machinery  in many cases  actions are atomic  belief
change due to action is concerned with how a complicated plausibility structure changes in
response to a distinct action occurence 
in our model  an action occurrence is just another plausibility function  this has several
advantages  which we show in the next sections  first  it allows us to easily compare
strength of belief in a state with strength of belief in an action occurence  for example  if
i believe the lamp is on but i also believe that i toggled the switch  what should i believe 
situations of this form are common  and they require a comparison between two different
forms of likelihood  in general  there is no natural logical aparatus that can help resolve this
problem  we need some extra logical information about which belief is stronger  the belief
in the state or the belief in the action  there is a natural intuition that we actually need
to be given some rankings to make this determination  that is exactly what we do here 
the second advantage of using a uniform representation of plausibility for actions is
that it allows us to consider alternative actions  looking at the literature on belief change
and preferential models  it is clear that we actually need orderings over states in order to
perform many kinds of reasoning  the reason we need such orderings is because we need
to be able to specify the best alternatives to the things we believed to be true  we argue
that the same is true for actions  when we find out that an action did not occur  we need to
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

have some mechanism for determining the next best alternative  we will see in the next
section that there are many practical examples where this is important  and these examples
can all be captured in a straightforward way by plausibility functions 
while it is tempting to look at our model and try to position it in the context of
alternative models of plausibility  we argue that this is not the best way to look at this
work  in fact  we could propose an approach very similar to the one in this paper based
on sequences of probability functions with suitable aggregates  the fact that we are using
spohn style ranking functions in particular is not the most important point  what is
important is that we are using a measure of plausibility uniformly for observations and
actions  and the plausibility measure has the feature that differences in plausibility have
a magnitude  this allows us to determine which alternatives to our current beliefs about
states and actions should be abandoned  because we can appeal to our single notion of
magnitude to determine some notion of minimal change 

   using graded world views
in this section  we consider the most basic approach that one can use to try to find a
minimally ranked history 
    pointwise minima
let w   hact  obsi be a graded world view where
act   hact            actn i
and
obs   hobs            obsn i 
the easiest way to determine a minimally ranked history is to simply take the most plausible
actions and the most plausible worlds at each point in time  the following definition makes
this notion more precise 
definition   given a history h   hs    a            an   sn i  we say h is a pointwise minimum
for hact  obsi if  for all i 
   for all a  a  acti  ai    acti  a   and
   for all s   f   obsi  si    obsi  s  
the following proposition states that  if a graded world view has any pointwise minima 
then those will be the most plausible histories 
proposition   let w   hact  obsi be a graded world view and let m be the set of
pointwise minima for w   if m      then  w     m  
proof it is sufficient to note that  for h  m   plaus h   plaus g  for all histories g  
note  however  that histories are restricted in that each world must be the outcome of the
preceding action  as such  it is possible that a graded world view will have no pointwise
minimum  this is why the preceding proposition starts with the assumption that the set
   

fihunter   delgrande

of pointwise minima is non empty  in cases where the there are no pointwise minima  there
will still be minimally plausible histories 
finding pointwise minima is not easy in the general case 
proposition   determining if a graded world view has a pointwise minimum is n p complete 
proof given a history  it is clear that checking if it is a pointwise minimum can be
done in linear time  so the problem lies in n p   assume a fixed set f of fluent symbols 
let w   hact  obsi where obs has length   f    and assume that each obsi obtains a
minimum at a distinct interpretation of f  then a pointwise minimum for w will correspond
to a hamiltonian path for the underlying transition system  the result follows since finding
a hamiltonian path is np complete  
the fact that it is already intractable to find a pointwise minimum suggests that finding
minimal histories over a complicated aggregate function is likely to be computationally
difficult  this is not a major concern for our present purposes however  as we view graded
world views as a high level tool to capture a variety of belief change scenarios  if one is
interested in modelling concrete action domains  then it is important to choose aggregate
functions that are well understood and computationally easy to minimize 
    equivalence
clearly it is possible for two distinct graded world views to have the same set of minimally
ranked world histories  in fact  it is possible for two distinct graded world views to induce
the same preference ordering over histories  in this section  we define a natural equivalence
relation over graded world views with an eye towards categorical representations  we start
by defining a relation on plausibility functions 
definition    let r  and r  be plausibility functions over a set x  we say that r  
  r 
if  for every x  y  x 
r   x   r   y    r   x   r   y  
it is easy to verify the following  
  is an equivalence relation  r  and r  have the same degree
of strength  and r  
r
implies
that bel r      bel r     essentially  the only difference
   
between equivalent plausibility functions is the minimum value  we make this idea more
precise by defining a notion of normalization for plausibility functions 
let r be a plausibility function  for any integer z   minr   the translation of r by
z is the plausibility function x   r x    z  it is easy to prove that r 
  r  if and only if
 
r is a translation of r  we define the normalization of r to be the translation by  minr  
the normalization of r is the unique plausibility function equivalent to r that obtains a
minimum of   
we can extend the notion of equivalence to graded world views 
definition    let w  and w  be graded world views over histories for a fixed action signature with a given underlying transition system  we say that w  
  w  if  for every pair
of histories g and h 
sum w    g   sum w    h    sum w    g   sum w    h  
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

unlike plausibility functions  it is possible to construct equivalent pairs of graded world
views that are not obtained by translations 
the following proposition illustrates that every graded world view is equivalent to a
graded world view consisting of normalized plausibility functions 
proposition   let hact  obsi be a graded world view  if hact     obs   i is obtained by
normalizing each component of act and obs  then
hact  obsi 
  hact     obs   i 
proof
let g  h be histories  for ease of readability  let plaus  and plaus  denote
sum hact  obsi  and sum hact     obs   i   respectively  hence  plaus  and plaus  are
functions over histories  obtained by minimization of the total sum  as such  each of plaus 
and plaus  must have a minimum value  corresponding to the lowest possible sum over
terms  then the following equalities are immediate 
plaus   g   plaus   h    plaus   g   min plaus   h    min
plaus 

plaus 

  plaus   g   plaus   h  

hence  although we allow plausibility functions with minimum values larger than   in a
graded world view  we can always pass to an equivalent graded world view consisting of
normalized plausibility functions  we remark  however  that a graded world view defined
by a sequence of normalized plausibility functions need not obtain a minimum of    in this
case  the minimum will be   if and only if the graded world view has a pointwise minimum 
it is also important to note that proposition   only holds under the aggregate plausibility
function sum 
    representing belief states
plausibility functions can be defined that simply pick out a distinguished set of elements of
the domain  if   x and c is an integer  let   c denote the function from x to the set of
integers that is defined as follows 

  if s  
  c  s   
c otherwise
if c is a positive integer  then   c denotes a plausibility function in which the elements of 
are the most plausible  and everything else is equally implausible  plausibility functions of
the form   c will be called simple  if x is a set of states  then simple plausibility functions
correspond to belief states  if x is a set of actions  then simple plausibility functions pick out
the actions that are believed to have occurred  using the terminology introduced earlier 
we say that  is held with degree of belief c 
if c      then   c does not actually define a plausibility function  however  allowing
negative values leads to a simple symmetry in our notation  in the following proposition  
denotes the complement of  under set difference  so if  is a set of states  then     f   
   

fihunter   delgrande

proposition   for any set  and positive integer c
c 
    c 
proof let s  t be states  by definition  we have

if s    t   
 c
c if s     t  
  c  s     c  t   

 
otherwise 
and

  c 
c
  c  s     c  t   

 

if s     t  
if s    t   
otherwise 

clearly  the right hand sides of each equality are the same  
suppose that
act   hact            actn i
and
obs   hobs            obsn i
where each acti and obsi is simple  with the same maximum plausibility c  this means
that each acti and obsi assigns either the value   or the value c to every element in
their respective domains  in this case  we essentially have belief states with no plausibility
ordering  in this case  it is easy to show that
hs    a            an   sn i   hact  obsi 
if and only if the cardinality of
 ai   ai  acti     si   si  obsi  
is maximal among all histories  in other words  the most plausible histories are those
that agree with hact  obsi at the highest number of components  this is a reasonable
approach to take in the trivial case where we have no prior ranking over states or actions 
we emphasize that this is just a special case when the plausibility functions are simple
and they share the same degree of strength  in the next section  we define belief change
operations in terms of a general concatenation on plausibility functions  if we do not restrict
the plausiblity functions as we have here  then we get a much wider range of possible belief
change operations 
    graded world views as epistemic states
an epistemic state is a representation of an agents belief state that defines a total pre order
 over all states  darwiche   pearl         if s  t  then the underlying agent believes
that it is more likely that the actual state of the world is s than t  the current belief
state is given by the set of  minimal states  recall also that a graded world view defines
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

a plausibility function plaus state over states  so a graded world view clearly defines an
ordering over states  and we can think of a graded world view as defining an epistemic
state  the worlds that receive minimal rank in a graded world view are the worlds that
are supported by the most reliable observations and actions  using this ranking to define
a plausibility ordering is tantamount to assuming that the plausibility of s is completely
determined by the reliability of the source reporting that s occurs 
by viewing graded world views as epistemic states  we can define belief change operations
in a more familiar manner  in particular  we can define belief change through a simple
concatenation operator  on graded world views  given a sequence of plausibility functions
r   hr            rn i and a plausibility function r  we let r  r denote the sequence hr            rn   ri 
let hact  obsi be a graded world view  let ra be a plausibility function over actions and
let rs be a plausibility function over states  define  as follows 
hact  obsi  hra   rs i   hact  ra   obs  rs i 
in this context the initial epistemic state is given by hact  obsi  which represents an
agents a priori beliefs about the history of observed actions and states  new actions and
observations are incorporated by simply concatenating the new plausibility functions on
to the initial graded world view  the new graded world view can be used to define a new
ordering on histories through some aggregate function  for example  if are using sum as the
default aggregate  then the new ordering is immediate  note that the new graded world view
obtained in this manner also includes all historical information required for future belief
change  as a special case of this simple concatenation operation  we get a new approach
to update  for any set x  let   denote the plausibility function that uniformly assigns  
to every element of x  we can identify the update hact  obsi  ra with the following
operation 
hact  obsi  hra    i 
we can also define a natural approach to revision in this manner  let null denote a
plausibility function that assigns plausibility   to the null action   and assigns everything
else a plausibility larger than the maximum value obtained by sum hact  obsi   we
identify the revision hact  obsi  rs with the following operation 
hact  obsi  hnull  rs i 
using plausibility functions to represent observations allows us to represent some natural
problem domains that can not be easily represented if we restrict observations to sets
of possible worlds  in particular  consider an action domain in which observations have
varying degrees of reliability  in such domains  when an agent makes an observation that is
inconsistent with the current belief state  there are two factors that should be considered 
the strength of belief in the current belief state and the reliability of the observation  there
is an obvious conflict that arises if we attempt to address both factors simultaneously  for
example  suppose that the underlying agent strongly believes that s is a possible state of
the world  now suppose that the agent makes two observations 
   one observation suggests that s is possible  but comes from an unreliable source 
   

fihunter   delgrande

   another observation suggests that s is not possible  and it comes from a very reliable
source 
it can be difficult to determine the appropriate belief change in this scenario  particularly
if strength of belief and observational reliability are treated independently  by quantifying
the reliability of every observation  graded world views make it easy to resolve this kind of
issue  we remark that problems of this form have also been addressed through the use of
prioritized merging operators  delgrande  dubois    lang        
note that there is an asymmetry in our definition of revision and update through the
 operator  in the case of update  we assume that the final observation assigns the same
plausibility to every state  the symmetric definition for a single observation would be
defined as follows 
hact  obsi  h   rs i 
however  this definition allows an arbitrary action to occur immediately before the observation  if we want to assume that the graded world view hact  obsi gives a complete picture
of the world at the time of the observation  then we need to assume that any intermediary
action is null  hence  the asymmetry is not due to any significant difference between actions
and observations  the asymmetry is simply due to the fact that graded world views involve
alternating sequences of actions and observations  with actions occurring first by default 
in this section we have illustrated that a graded world view defines an epistemic state 
if we take an epistemic state to be a total pre order on states  then the converse is clearly
false  an ordering on states does not provide enough information to define numerical ranking
functions over states  the move from epistemic states to graded world views is motivated
by the same kind of concern that motivates the move from belief states to epistemic states 
in particular  belief states in agm revision can be understood to represent the minimal
elements in some ordering of states  hence  a belief state can provide a partial description
of an ordering  and an ordering can in turn provide a partial description of a graded world
view  a belief state is sufficient for single shot revision  provided that an ordering is implicit
in the revision operator  however  a belief state is not sufficient if we need to explicitly
reason about the way plausibility orderings are modified  similarly  orderings on states are
sufficient for reasoning about preferences over states  but they are not sufficient if we need
to explicitly reason about action histories  in the next section  we clarify this point through
practical examples 
    representing natural action domains
we illustrate how some interesting phenomena can be represented by graded world views 
the simplest examples involve graded world views of length    in particular  we initially
focus on graded world views of the form
hin it i  hra   rs i 
in this context  in it represents the initial belief state of an agent  ra represents an agents
beliefs about the action that has been executed  and rs represents the observed state of
the world  previously we have used obs  for the initial plausibility function over states 
the change in notation is just to emphasize that in it is some a priori initial ordering
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

over states  to be clear  in it   ra   and rs are all plausibility functions  as such  we can
define the degree of strength of each  to facilitate the exposition  we denote the degrees
of strength by deg in it    deg ra    and deg rs   respectively  varying the magnitudes of
these values allows us to capture several different underlying assumptions 
   fallible initial beliefs  deg in it     deg ra   and deg in it     deg rs   
   erroneous perception  deg rs     deg in it   and deg rs     deg ra   
   fallible action history  deg ra     deg in it   and deg ra     deg rs   
as a simple example  suppose that an agent believes a certain lamp is initially on  then
the power switch is toggled  and then the agent observes that the lamp is actually still
on  clearly this sequence of events can not consistently be believed by a rational agent 
manipulating the degrees of strength of in it   ra and rs gives an agent some mechanism
for resolving such conflicts  in case      the agent is not completely certain that the lamp
was initially on  as such  the easiest way to incorporate the new information is to change
the initial belief state  by contrast  in case      the agent is not completely certain that
the lamp is still on after toggling the switch  in this case  since the agent is confident the
lamp was initially on and the switch was toggled  it is natural to reject the observation
and believe that the lamp is now off  the distinction between these two cases cannot be
captured without some notion of reliability  in case      the agent would resolve the conflict
by believing that the attempt to toggle the power switch had failed 
the special case in which the degree of strength is   also captures some important
phenomena  note that a plausibility function r has degree of strength   just in case there
is some constant c such that r x    c for all x  as such  a degree of   indicates that every
element of the domain receives minimal rank  we consider the informal interpretation of a
degree   for each plausibility function in our schematic example 
   if deg in it        then every initial state is equally plausible  the agent has no
contingent a priori beliefs about the state of the world 
   if deg ro        then ro represents a null observation  the observation obs does not
provide evidence for any particular state 
   if deg ra        then every action is equally likely  so the agent is completely ignorant
about the action that has occurred  and we can think of ra as an exogenous action
beyond the agents control 
these are relatively crude distinctions  but they still capture important classes of problems 
roughly speaking  the problems that we have addressed thus far can be captured by a
plausibility ordering over sequences of the form
  a          an  n
where  is a belief state  each ai is an action symbol  and each i is an observation 
for the purpose of comparison  we remark that belief evolution operators defined in
section     are only useful for problems in which the underlying plausibility ordering is

given as follows  for some permutation p            pn of            n 

a  

  
    p   p       pn

an
by contrast  graded world views are suitable for any total pre order over a                an   n  
but this is not the entire class of problems representable by graded world views  by using a
ranking function for each event  we are able to draw two additional distinctions that can not
be represented by a simple ordering  first  we are able to represent changes in plausibility
that do not affect the ordering of states  this is useful for representing action domains
where an agent must observe a single piece of evidence multiple times before believing it is
correct  second  we are able to represent graded evidence  we use the term graded evidence
to describe situations were an observation actually supports several different conclusions
with different degrees of confidence  we conclude this section with two examples illustrating
action domains that are difficult to represent if we only have an ordering over the plausibility
of events 
example  additive evidence  bob believes that he turned the lamp off in his office  but
he is not completely certain  as he is leaving the building  he talks first to alice and then
to eve  if only alice tells him his lamp is still on  then he will believe that she is mistaken 
similarly  if only eve tells him his lamp is still on  then he will believe that she is mistaken 
however  if both alice and eve tell bob that his lamp is still on  then he will believe that
it is in fact still on 
this example can easily be represented by a graded world view as follows  we assume
that the underlying action signature contains  among others  a fluent symbol lampon and
an action symbol t urnlampoff   the underlying transition system defines the effects of
turning the lamp off in the obvious manner  let on denote the set of states in which
lampon is true  the following plausibility functions define a graded world view that
represents this action domain 
   obs    on    
   act     t urnlampoff     
   obs    on   
   act        
   obs    on   
note that  hobs    act    obs  i  consists of all histories where the lamp is turned off at
time    however   hobs    act    obs    act    obs  i  consists of all histories where the
lamp is not turned off at time    two observations of on are required to make bob believe
that he did not turn the lamp off 

example  graded evidence  bob receives a gift that he estimates to be worth approximately     he is curious about the price  so he tries to glance quickly at the receipt without
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

anyone noticing  he believes that the receipt says the price is     this is far too low to be
believable  so bob concludes that he must have mis read the receipt  since a   looks very
similar to an    he concludes that the price on the receipt must actually have been    
to represent this example  we first define act         because bob believes that no ontic actions have occurred  we assume that there are fluent symbols cost   cost           cost 
interpreted to represent the cost of the gift  we define a plausibility function obs  representing bobs initial beliefs 

   if s    cost  
  if s    cost   or s    cost  
obs   s   

  otherwise
note that bob initially believes that the cost is     but it is comparatively plausible that this
cost is one dollar more or less  finally  we define a plausibility function obs  representing
the observation of the receipt 

   if s    cost  
  if s    cost  
obs   s   

  otherwise
bob believes that the observed digit was most likely a    with the most plausible alternative being the visually similar digit   
given these plausibility functions  the most plausible state of the world is the state in
which the price is     in order to draw this conclusion  bob needs observations that provide
graded evidence about states of the world and he needs to be able to weight this information
against his initial beliefs 
the preceding examples illustrate that there are natural common sense reasoning problems in which an agent needs to consider aggregate plausibilities over a sequence of actions
and observations  graded world views are well suited for reasoning about such problems 
    non deterministic and failed actions
in this section  we consider actions with non deterministic effects  we remark  in particular 
that fallible actions can be understood as actions with non deterministic effects  fallible
actions are just actions where some possible outcomes are considered to be failures  in the
simplest case  for example  a failed action might be one which leaves the state of the world
unchanged  hence  by addressing non deterministic effects  we are also handling actions
that might fail  our basic approach is the following  we introduce some new machinery
for the representation of non deterministic actions  and then we demonstrate that the new
machinery is unnecessary when we use summation to determine the plausibility of histories 
as such  we can reasonably restrict attention to deterministic actions when proving formal
expressibility results for graded world views 
given a non deterministic transition system t   hs  ri and a graded world view w  
it is not clear how we should choose the effects of each action in the most plausible world
histories  this problem can be solved by attaching a plausibility value to the possible effects
of each action  boutilier         for each action a and state s  let ef f  a  s  denote the
   

fihunter   delgrande

set of states s  such that  s  a  s     r  hence ef f  a  s  is the set of states that may
result  given that action a is executed in state s 
definition    an effect ranking function is a function  that maps every action state pair
 a  s  to a plausibility function over ef f  a  s  
informally  an effect ranking function gives the plausibility of each possible effect for each
action  for instance  if we want to model a coin flipping action  then the corresponding effect
ranking function would be constant  both outcomes of the coin flip would be considered
equally plausible 
a non deterministic graded world view is a pair hw  i where w is a graded world view
and  is an effect ranking function  we illustrate with an example 
example consider an action domain involving a single fluent symbol lampon indicating
whether or not a certain lamp is turned on  there are two action symbols p ress and
t hrowp aper respectively representing the acts of pressing on the light switch  or throwing
a ball of paper at the light switch  informally  throwing a ball of paper at the light switch
is not likely to turn on the lamp  but suppose that an agent has reason to believe that a
piece of paper was thrown at the lamp and  moreover  the lamp has been turned on  we
illustrate how non deterministic graded world views can provide a representation of this
problem 
both actions have non deterministic effects in that both may cause lampon to become
true  but both may also fail to do so  we define a graded world view hact  obsi of length
   first  we define act so that t hrowp aper is the most likely action at time   

act 


  

p ress
 

t hrowp aper
 

next we define obs so that initially the light is off  and then the light is on 

obs 
obs 


  
 

lampon
 
  

finally  we define an effect ranking function  that represents the fact that pressing is more
likely to turn the light on 

 p ress   lampon  
 p ress   
 t hrowp aper   lampon  
 t hrowp aper   


 
  
 
 

 lampon 
  
 
 
 

lines   and   in the table indicate that pressing the switch is very likely to change the
state of the lamp  lines   and   indicate that throwing paper at the switch is most likely
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

to have no effect  but a change caused by the paper ball is seen as more plausible than a
failed effect when the button is pressed 
in the preceding example  there are two possible solutions  either a plausible event occurs
with an unlikely outcome  or a less plausible event occurs with an expected outcome  there
is no a priori preference given to occurrence plausibilities or to effect plausibilities  the
framework is flexible enough to represent either possibility 
introducing effect ranking functions makes the distinction between action occurrences
and action effects explicit  which in turn gives a straightforward treatment of failed actions  however  we need to introduce some extra machinery in order to determine the
most plausible action history  the most general approach is to extend the definition of an
aggregate plausibility function  a non deterministic aggregate plausibility function takes a
non deterministic graded world view as an argument  and it returns a plausibility function
over histories  an admissible non deterministic aggregate plausibility function is one that
increases monotonically with respect to the given graded world view  as well as the given
effect ranking function 
we have been using the function sum as our standard aggregate plausibility function 
the natural extension of sum to non deterministic graded world views is the following  for
any history h   s    a            an   sn   define
x
sum hact  obsi    h   
obsi  si     acti  ai      ai   si    si   
i

it is easy to see that this is an admissible non deterministic aggregate function  returning
to the lamp example  there are two minimally ranked histories under this function  one in
which the lamp was turned on by pressing on the switch and one in which the lamp was
turned on by throwing a piece of paper at the switch 
in the remainder of this section  we will assume that sum is the default aggregate
function for non deterministic world views  under this assumption  we demonstrate that
non deterministic graded world views can be translated into graded world views in an
extended action signature 
let t   hs  ri be a non deterministic transition system over the action signature ha  fi 
let hhact  obsi  i be a non deterministic graded world view  we extend the action
signature to a new action signature a  where every edge in t corresponds to a unique
action symbol  in particular  let a     a s a t     s  a  t   r   let t     hs  r  i where r 
is the closure of the set  hs  a s a t    ti   s  t  s   suppose that act   act            actn  
define act     act             actn  where  for each i  acti   a s a t      acti  a     a  s  t  
proposition   for any non deterministic transition system t   a history
h   s    a            an   sn
obtains the same rank in hhact  obsi  i as
h    s    a s   a   s              a sn   an  sn     sn
obtains in hact     obsi 
   

fihunter   delgrande

proof the plausibility of h is obtained by taking the sum
x
obsi  si     acti  ai      ai   si    si   
i

which is clearly the same sum taken to determine the plausibility of h    
hence non deterministic actions and failed actions can be represented in a graded world
view  simply by setting up the plausibility functions carefully 
we remark that there is a conceptually interesting distinction that is lost in this translation  informally  there is a distinction between an action that fails to occur and an action
that occurs  but fails to produce an expected effect  this distinction is clear if we consider
the difference between failing to drop a glass on the ground  and dropping a glass that fails
to break when it hits the ground  in the first case  the agent executes the drop action
but it fails to occur  perhaps the glass sticks to the agents hand  in the second case  the
glass is successfully dropped without breaking  in our framework  both of these events are
represented by a dropping action with the null effect  we suggest that this is an acceptable
treatment  because in both cases the sequence of actions and states is identical  as such  we
cannot distinguish between these scenarios based on our definition of a history  however 
we may be able to distinguish indirectly based on the values of other fluents  for instance 
the location of the glass is only going to change in the case where it is successfully dropped 

   comparison with related formalisms
belief change due to actions and observations has been addressed previously in the literature 
in this section  we consider how our approach is related to existing work in the area 
    representing single shot belief change
while our focus thus far has been on the use of graded world views for the representation
of iterated belief change due to actions and observations  the simplest scenario involves
just a single ontic or epistemic action  it is important  therefore  to verify that the singleshot belief change operators induced by a graded world view are reasonable with respect
to existing work in the area  recall that we defined  and  on graded world views as
shorthand notation for the associated concatenation operations  based on the results in
this section  it will be clear that this shorthand is natural and appropriate 
we first consider the case of a single ontic action 
proposition   let hact  obsi be a graded world view  for any plausibility function r
over a 
bel hact  obsi  hr   i    bel hact  obsi   bel r  
proof since every action is always executable  s  bel hact  obsi  hr   i  if and only
if there is some s   bel hact  obsi  such that s   a   s for some a  bel r   hence
s  bel hact  obsi  hr   i  if and only if s  bel hact  obsi   bel r   
proposition   is important if we are primarily interested in belief states and ontic actions 
basically  in this case  graded world views are unnecessary  the most plausible final belief
state can be determined by simply looking at the belief state associated with the initial
graded world view 
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

we now consider the case of a single observation  at present  we are primarily interested
in comparing the expressive power of graded world views with agm revision operators 
there is one sense in which graded world views are clearly more expressive than agm
operators  in particular  a new observation need not be incorporated into an agents beliefs
if the observation does not come from a reliable source  we will demonstrate that  in the
context of a single observation  this is essentially the only difference between a graded world
view and an agm revision operator  more specifically  we will see that the belief change
defined by concatenating a single observation onto a graded world view can be captured by
an agm operator  provided that the observation has degree of strength higher than some
fixed threshold 
we start by proving that every plausibility function defines a system of spheres  as
defined by grove         we first review the definition of a system of spheres  let ml
denote a set of consistent  complete theories over l  a set of subsets s of ml is a system
of spheres centered on x where x  ml   if it satisfies the conditions 
s   s is totally ordered by 
s   x is the minimum of s under 
s   ml  s
s   for any formula  with     
    there is a least sphere c   such that c        
  
and u      
   implies that c    u for every u  s
we picture a system of spheres as a series of concentric circles  with innermost circle x 
let r be a plausibility function over x with minimum value minr   for any n  let r n 
denote the set of complete  consistent theories that are satisfied by some interpretation i
with r i   n 
proposition   let r be a plausibility function over a finite action signature  the collection
r    r n    n  minr   is a system of spheres centered on r minr   
proof clearly  for each n  r n   r n       hence r is totally ordered by  
if t  r minr    then t is satisfied by some i with r i   minr   but then  for any n  t
is satisfied by some i with r i   n  hence r minr    r n  for all r n  
since the action signature is finite  there are only finitely many states  hence there is
a state that is assigned a maximum plausibility  say maxr   therefore  r maxr   is the set of
complete  consistent theories 
let  be a consistent formula  since there are only finitely many states  there must be
a state s   such that r s   r t  for all t    let n   r s   clearly r n         now
suppose that u  s and u        suppose that u   r m   so u is the set of complete 
consistent theories satisfied by some i with r i   m  since some elements of u are also in
  it follows m  n  therefore r n   u   and r n  is the least sphere intersecting   
using this result  we can show that single shot revision under graded world views can be
captured by agm revision operators  we make this claim precise in the next proposition 
   

fihunter   delgrande

proposition   let hact  obsi be a graded world view  there is an agm revision function  and a natural number n such that  for any plausibility function r over states with
degree of strength larger than n 
bel hact  obsi  h  n  ri    bel hact  obsi   bel r  
proof recall that plaus is a plausibility function over histories that is defined by minimizing sums over hact  obsi  and plaus state is the corresponding plausibility function
over final states 
let n be a natural number such that n   plaus h  for every history h  let r be a
plausibility function with rank n  it follows that s  bel hact  obsih  n  ri  if and only
if the following conditions hold 
   s  bel r 
   plaus state s  is minimal among all states satisfying   
by proposition    plaus state defines a system of spheres centered on bel plaus state  
it follows from groves representation result  grove        that there is an agm revision
function  such that  for any observation   s  bel plaus state    if and only if the
following conditions hold 
   s  
   plaus state s  is minimal among all states satisfying   
setting    bel r  gives the desired result  
proposition   illustrates that  for a single observation  the most plausible worlds can be
determined without considering the history of actions and observations  we can determine
the most plausible worlds following an observation by simply abstracting a belief state from
a graded world view  then performing agm revision  it is easy to show that the converse is
also true  every agm revision operator can be represented by a graded world view  more
precisely  we have the following result 
proposition   let  be an agm revision operator and let  be a belief state  there is a
graded world view hact  obsi with bel hact  obsi     and a natural number n such
that  for every non empty observation  
     bel hact  obsi  h  n  ri 
where r is any plausibility function over states where the minimal ranked elements  have
degree larger than n 
proof by groves representation result   can be captured by a system of spheres s 
define the graded world view hact  obsi such that s is the system of spheres given by
proposition    set n such that n   plaus h  for every history h  the result is immediate 

taken together  propositions   and   illustrate that graded world views are equivalent to
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

agm revision if we restrict attention to a single observation with a sufficiently high degree
of reliability  hence  for single shot belief change  the full expressive power of graded world
views is unnecessary  for both ontic actions and observations  we can define the same
belief change operations if we start with just a belief state  there is also a correspondence
here with nayaks work on iterated revision  nayak         if an observation is sufficiently
plausible  then every state in that observation ends up being strictly more plausible than
every other state 
    representing conditionalization
spohn uses ranking functions to define a different form of single shot belief change called
conditionalization  spohn         the idea is that new evidence is presented as a pair
   m   where  is a set of states and m     the value of m is an indication of the strength
of the observation   informally  the conditionalization of r is a new function where the
minimally ranked  worlds receive rank   and the non  worlds are all shifted up by m 
in this section  we illustrate how conditionalization can be defined in terms of graded world
views 
first  we define conditionalization formally  let r be a plausibility function with minr  
  and let  be a subset of the domain of r  let min   denote the minimum value r s  for
s    spohn defines the the plausibility function r    over  as follows 
r s     r s   min   
we call r s   the  part of r  the conditionalization of r  written r  m    is the following
plausibility function 

r s  
if s  
r  m   s   
m   r s   if s 
  
so the conditionalization of r is the  part of r together with the  part shifted appropriately 
we show that conditionalization can easily be represented by taking minimal sums over
plausibility functions 
definition    let r be a plausibility function over  f   let  be a non empty subset of  f  
and let m be a natural number  define rc    m  as follows 

 
if s  
rc    m   s   
m   min   if s   
we refer to rc    m  as the conditionalizer of r with respect to  and m  the following
proposition illustrates how we can define the conditionalization of a plausibility function by
taking an appropriate sum 
proposition    let r be a plausibility function with minr      for any   m  the normalization of r   rc    m  is the conditionalization r  m   
proof if s    then
r s    rc    m  s    r s        r s  
   

fihunter   delgrande

if s     then
r s    rc    m  s    r s    m   min   
since r s     and m     it follows that the minimum value obtained by r   rc    m  is
min    hence  the normalization of r   rc    m  is the plausibility function r  defined as
follows 
r   s    r s    rc    m  s   min  
this is equal to r  m    which is what we wanted to show  
proposition    illustrates that the conditionalization of r by    m  can be defined
by taking a minimal sum over two plausibility functions  we have restricted attention to
plausibility functions with minimum   because this class coincides more closely with spohns
ranking functions  however  we can define the conditionalizer in the same manner for
plausibility functions with non zero minimums  we can also define the conditionalization
of a graded world view  informally  we simply conditionalize the associated plausibility
function on states  hence  we identify the conditionalization with respect to h  mi with
the following operation 
hact  obsi  h  plaus statec    m i 
it is straightforward to show that this gives the desired result 
    representing belief evolution operators
as noted previously  we have previously defined so called belief evolution operators to capture iterated belief change due to actions and observations  hunter   delgrande         in
this section  we show that graded world views actually extend this approach  by verifying
that every belief evolution operator can be captured by a graded world view 
there are two underlying assumptions in the definition of belief evolution 
   the plausibility of an observation is determined by some ordering  recency by default 
   the action history is assumed to be correct 
both of these assumptions can be represented in a graded world view by setting up the
plausibility functions appropriately 
belief evolution operators can be defined with respect to metric transition systems  a
metric transition system to be a transition system  along with a metric d that gives a distance
between states  the metric d defines a belief revision operator as follows  delgrande        
      w     v    such that for all v     v   k
we have d w  v     d v    v     
assume that we have a fixed initial belief state i   along with a metric transition system
defining a revision operator  and an update operator   let  be the belief evolution
operator obtained from  and   let
a   ha            an i
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

be an action trajectory  and let
   h            n i
be an observation trajectory  we want to construct a graded world view wev that assigns
minimal plausibility value to all histories corresponding to i  ha  i 
we define wev   hact  obsi presently  by combining i with the metric d given by
the metric transition system  we can define a plausibility function base that represents
the initial ordering of states implicit in   in particular  for any s  set
base s    min  d s  k    k  i    
using this plausibility function  we can define the observation trajectory obs  let max
denote the maximum value obtained by base 

base
if i    
obsi  
i    i   max  otherwise
by incrementing the plausibility of false observations exponentially  we can assure that
recent observations will be given greater credence 
informally  each action symbol ai is translated into a plausibility function that obtains
the minimum value on the set  ai    formally  we have the following  for    i  n 
acti   ai    n     max  
proposition    if i  ha  i   h            n i  then
h   wev  

h   hs    a            an   sn i where si  i for each i 
proof assume for the moment that ha  i is consistent  let h   hv    b            bn   vn i  by
definition h   wev   if and only if the sum
n

is minimal  since ha  i is consistent  there exist histories hs    a            an   sn i where each
si  i   for such histories  the sum     becomes
n
x

acti  ai

obsi  si         obs   s

we remark that this sum is less than any sum that can be obtained by a history where
there is some i such that either bi  ai or si   i   therefore h   wev   if and only if the
following three conditions hold 
   bi   ai for each i    
   

fihunter   delgrande

   vi  i for each i    
   obs   v    is minimal among states satisfying   and   
in order to satisfy condition    it must be the case that v  is in the set

in order to simultaneously satisfy condition    it must also be the case that v  is minimally
distant from i according to the metric d  in other words  v   i  v   therefore  h 
 wev   if and only if each bi   ai and the following conditions hold 
t
   v   i  i i   ai    and
   vi   v   ai  
this is the definition of i  ha  i  so this completes the proof 
the case where ha  i is inconsistent is similar  the only difference is that we need
to notice that the degree of strength of each observation increases by a power of    we
use the fact that  for any natural number p   p is larger than every sum of terms  i with
i   p  as such  in order to minimize the sum      we need to work backwards through the
observations  keeping each observation if it is consistent with the observations that followed 
this is just an equivalent specification of   wev    increasing powers exponentially forces
a strict preference for recent observations  
proposition    demonstrates that graded world views can represent any belief evolution
operator defined with respect to a distance function  from the perspective of graded world
views  the assumption that action histories are infallible is essentially just a restriction on
the admissible plausibility functions 
we conclude this section with some brief remarks about the use of orderings to resolve
inconsistency in iterated belief change  the well known darwiche pearl postulates for iterated belief change  darwiche   pearl        are only satisfied when we assume that the
most recent observation takes precedence over previous observations  by contrast  papini
illustrates an alternative approach to iterated revision in which earlier observations take
precedence over later observations  papini         more generally  we defined belief evolution operators with respect to an arbitrary total ordering over the observations  the most
natural extension of belief evolution would extend the ordering to include all observations
and actions  using the techniques in this section  it is easy to see that this extended conception of belief evolution corresponds to the class of graded world views with an arbitrary
initial observation followed by plausibility functions of the form    i   where each i is distinct  hence  even the most general extension of belief evolution can be represented by a
relatively restricted class of graded world views 
    relation with the situation calculus
the situation calculus  sitcalc  is a well establishing framework for reasoning about the
effects of actions  action descriptions in the sitcalc are formulated in many sorted firstorder logic along with a single second order induction axiom  briefly  variables can range
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

over situations  entities  and actions  situations are understood to represent the current
state of the world  including a complete history of all actions that have occurred  there is
a distinguished constant symbol s  that denotes the initial situation and a distinguished
function symbol do that maps an action a and a situation s to the situation that results
from executing a in situation s  predicate symbols that take a situation argument are
called fluents  for a detailed introduction  we refer the reader to the foundational summary
presented by levesque  pirri and reiter        
the epistemic extension of the sitcalc introduces sensing actions  alternative initial
situations  an accessibility relation  and a plausibility ordering over situations  shapiro
et al          the situations that an agent believes possible are the minimal accessible
situations  and the effect of a sensing action changes the set of accessible states  this
results in a form of belief revision that satisfies most of the agm postulates  we have
previously proved that belief revision in the sitcalc can be captured by a belief evolution
operator under a natural translation  hunter   delgrande         it therefore follows from
proposition    that the belief change operators defined in the standard sitcalc approach
can be captured by graded world views 
a similar conclusion can be drawn regarding our representation of uncertain actions 
bacchus et  al         extend the sitcalc to include noisy sensors and non deterministic
actions  roughly  the idea is to define complex actions in terms of a set of primitive
actions  in this manner  a non deterministic action is represented by a probability function
over the set of primitive actions  we have a similar result in proposition    which proves
that we can capture non deterministic actions by introducing ranking functions over action
effects  if we think of each action effect as a primitive action  then we essentially have the
same representation as bacchus et  al  except that we use ranking functions rather than
probabilities  moreover  in section     we demonstrated that a translation from probabilities
to plausibilities is straightforward 
while our approach appears to be sufficiently general to capture belief change and
uncertainty over actions as defined in the given epistemic extensions of the sitcalc  it is
important to note that there are respects in which our approach is actually more expressive 
in particular  we allow revision by arbitrary rankings over formulas  we do not require
a fixed set of sensing actions  our approach also allows for a flexible representation of
the interaction between uncertainty over actions and observations  and it is elaboration
tolerant in the sense that we need only modify aggregates over plausibility functions to
capture different phenomena  on the other hand  the sitcalc provides a more rigorous and
precise treatment of actions effects and ontic change  for example  the sitcalc treatment
of property persistence  kelly   pearce        captures a natural feature of certain world
properties that can only be captured by a graded world view with an ad hoc restriction on
plausibility functions  overall  we see our approach as a high level model of belief change
that can capture the dynamics of belief in the sitcalc  but it does so while losing some of
the advantages of the sitcalc model of action effects 
    relation with dynamic epistemic logic
the notion of belief change due to reported information has been addressed in dynamic
epistemic logic  del   van ditmarsch  van der hoek    kooi         in this context  belief

change is captured through plausibility models  a plausibility model is a kripke structure 
where we associate a well ordering over possible states with each state  this ordering indicates which states are seen as the most plausible at each state in the structure  belief update
can be captured in this setting through state changing actions that allow different agents to
have different awareness of the action that has been executed  baltag   smets         belief
revision can be captured by a mapping on plausibility models that is syntactically defined
through suitable modal operators  baltag   smets        van benthem         although
it is common to use an ordering to represent plausibility in del  there are also variants
in which plausibility is captured with quantitative values  for example  laverny and lang
       define a logic that incorporates actions and uses ranking functions over n     to
model strength of belief for formulas without nested modalities 
there are two main distinctions between our work and related work in the del tradition  the first distinction is superficial  and it is related to our high level perspective on new
information  in del  there is an external perspective on new information  in which structures explicitly model the way that each agent in the system views the new information 
this is why del is so expressive with respect to nested multi agent beliefs  we are able to
be explicit about the perspective of each agent  as presented in this paper  we can think of
graded world views as taking an internal perspective for a single agent  when we provide a
ranking function that represents an observation  we have no external knowledge about the
actual state of the world  the advantage of this approach is that every observation  resp 
action  is always possible  by contrast  with the external perspective of del  there may be
situations where certain information simply cannot be provided as an information update 
for example  if the underlying kripke structure only contains states where  is true  then
there is no information update that can be provided to make an agent believe  is false 
the second distinction between our work and existing work in del is related to our
uniform representation of observations and actions  in del  a distinction is often drawn
between so called hard updates and soft updates  van benthem         a hard update
occurs when the information is definite in some sense  and it is incorporated by modifying
the accessible states  this might occur  for example  when it is common knowledge that a
certain state changing action has occurred  a soft update corresponds to a belief revision 
where the information is incorporated by modifying the plausbility ordering  however  in a
practical setting  it is often the case that one can not distinguish which kind of change should
actually occur  this kind of ambiguity does not occur in the case of graded world views 
where all belief change operations are handled in a uniform manner by taking aggregates over
plausibility functions  morever  in both hard update and soft update  the update is typically
by a single piece of information with a single level of plausibility  hence  observations and
actions are not represented in a graded manner  this is one of the distinguishing features of
the present work  we allow observations  and actions  to provide different levels of evidence
for several different states simultaneously 
despite the differences  it is important to emphasize that we actually do not see graded
world views as an alternative to del  instead  we see the approach presented here as a tool
that could be used as the basis for belief change in a suitably defined del with quantitative
plausibility rankings  this is analogous to the way that formal belief change operators have
been incorporated in modal logics  iterated revision operators such as lexicographic revision
 nayak        and natural revision  boutilier        were originally defined in a general
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

setting of orderings  before they were used as motivating examples for information update
in del  similarly  we suggest that a modal logic could be defined in which the semantics
of iterated propositional updates was based on aggregates over plausibility functions  such
a logic would be able to model all of the practical domains discussed in this paper  and it
would also be able to capture complex multi agent situations involving nested belief 
    representations of plausibility
following spohn         we have taken quantitative ranking functions as our representation
of plausibility  however  the literature on belief change and defeasible reasoning contains
a great deal of work on different representations of plausibility  it this section  we briefly
consider alternative approaches from the literature  and we argue that our approach is more
suitable for the kind of reasoning we intend to capture 
the most basic representation of plausibility in the literature is a total pre order on
states  as we often see in agm inspired work  we normally think of such an ordering in
terms of a series of levels of plausibility  the obvious limitation of this approach is that
there can be no notion of magnitude with respect to differences in plausibility  although
this is can be introduced by allowing empty levels  in any event  it is clear that ranking
functions are more expressive than total pre orders with respect to modelling plausibility 
a more interesting distinction occurs between our notion of plausibility  and the orderings
used in the del tradition  as noted above  plausibility in this context is typically captured
by a well ordering  van benthem         this is necessary because  in this setting  we
do not want all states to be comparable  we want certain states to be innaccessible from
others  one might ask if our ranking functions are limited in any sense with respect to the
well orderings used in plausibility models  our choice of ranking functions is motivated by
the internal external distinction discussed in the previous section  an individual agent need
not consider impossible states in order to modify their beliefs appropriately  they need
only consider highly unlikely states 
note that our approach is superficially similar to related work on defeasible reasoning
featuring some form of preferential ordering on states  it is possible  for example  to reason
about typicality by supplementing a kripke structure with a single ordering over states
 britz   varzinczak         an alternative model in the setting of description logics has also
been proposed  in which a function is introduced to map each concept to a set of elements
that are deemed to be most typical  giordano  olivetti  gliozzi    pozzato         however 
despite the superficial similarities  it is important to be clear that our initial plausibility
function is not intended to be a representation of typicality or normality in an absolute
sense  our model of plausibility corresponds more closely to a pointed plausibility model
that includes a distinguished actual state 
alternative quantitative models of plausibility have also been explored in the literature 
one of the most influential such approaches is based on possibility measures  which are
functions that map states to         benferhat et al          the main difference between a
possibility measure and a plausibility function is really that the possibility measure   actually corresponds to impossibility  and there is no corresponding plausibility value  however 
we have already shown that plausibility functions can be used to capture rational valued
   

fihunter   delgrande

functions over        it would be straightforward to modify our proof to deal with real number
values 
one of the most general measures of plausibility in the literature is a plausibility space 
which is analogous to a probability space except that the range of plausibility values can
be any set  friedman   halpern         plausibility spaces are intended to be a very
general model that subsumes a great deal of existing work on reasoning about plausibility 
indeed  plausibility functions are clearly just a special case of a plausibility space  so our
representation of belief can be seen as a special case of this more general approach 
in this section  we have been restricting the discussion to alternative representations of
plausibility on states  as noted previously  our approach to the representation of plausibility
over states is actually not new and it is therefore easy to position our work in this context 
the novel feature of our approach is that we use the same notion of plausibiility over actions 
in order to develop a novel approach to reasoning about iterated belief change due to actions
and observations

   limitations and advantages
our focus in previous sections has been on establishing the expressive power of graded
world views  as compared with existing frameworks for reasoning about belief change  as
a result  we have focused on problems involving an a priori graded world view  along with
some new information  however  the restriction to new information is artificial  in the
general case  there is no reason to restrict attention to problems in which an agent only
receives information about actions and observations occurring at the most recent point in
time  an agent could certainly receive new information about earlier events and actions 
hence  a more general problem involves an agent with an underlying graded world view 
together with a set of constraints on the most plausible histories  in this section  we consider
the representation of problems that have this more general form 
    constrained world views
suppose that hact  obsi is a graded world view of length n  an action constraint is
a pair  a  i  where a is an action symbol and i  n  define  hact  obsi    a  i 
to be the set of histories with minimal plausibility  subject to the restriction that the ith
action executed is a  we define observation constraints in the analogous manner  and we
let  hact  obsi      i  be the set of minimally ranked histories where the ith state
is in   if  is a set of constraints  then we define  hact  obsi    to be the set of
minimally ranked histories satisfying every constraint in   we will refer to such histories
as constrained histories and we will refer to a graded world view together with a set of
constraints as a constrained world view 
we have presented constrained world views to illustrate that graded world views are
useful for many problems beyond those that are normally considered to be in the realm of
a standard belief change operator  for example  suppose that bob sends an encrypted
email message to alice  inviting her to a party at his house  bob is aware that eve is
the system administrator  and that she could potentially manipulate the message before
delivering it  when alice does not show up  bob concludes that eve did not deliver the
message  bob is concerned that eve read the message and had hurt feelings that she was
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

not invited  however  looking at every possible action eve could take  bob concludes that
eve could not have decrypted the message 
in the preceding example  bob needs to consider all possible actions that eve could have
executed  the conclusion that bob draws is that eves knowledge of the party is invariant
with respect to her actions  we can formally define invariance as follows 
definition    let hact  obsi be a graded world view  we say that a set of states  is an
i invariant of hact  obsi if and only if  for every a  a  bel hact  obsi   a  i     
the intuition behind i invariance is that  regardless of the action at time i  the underlying
agent will always believe that the actual world is in   reasoning about invariant properties
is essential if an agent is trying to ensure some property must hold in an action domain
involving exogenous actions  this is required  for example  in reasoning about cryptographic
protocols 
reasoning about invariance is just one new kind of problem that can be addressed by
constrained world views  we suggest that constraints can also be used to provide natural
representations of hypothetical reasoning and abductive reasoning 
    belief extrapolation
constrained world views are similar to belief extrapolation operators  dupin de saint cyr
  lang         briefly  a belief extrapolation operator l takes a sequence of formulas 
called a scenario as input  and it outputs another scenario  the intuition is that the output
gives the most general sequence of formulas that can possibly be true  given the input and
the assumption that fluents tend to be inertial  we give a brief description of the basic
construction 
a trajectory is a sequence  of interpretations over some fixed signature  let   i  denote
the ith interpretation in the trajectory    given a scenario   let traj    denote the set of
trajectories that satisfy each formula in  on a point by point basis  every ordering  on
the class of trajectories defines an extrapolation operator l as follows 
   l  t         t      min   traj     
hence   l picks out the minimal trajectories satisfying  
for our present purposes  the most important feature of a belief extrapolation operator
is that it is defined with respect to an ordering over histories  given an ordering over
histories together with a sequence of formulas  a belief extrapolation operator returns the
most plausible sequences of states  in the case of constrained world views  we essentially
do the same thing  the given graded world view defines an ordering over states  and the
constraints give a sequence of conditions that need to be satisfied  it is easy to show
that  using the summation aggregate  every graded world view can be captured by a belief
extrapolation operator  in this section  we consider the converse problem  can every belief
extrapolation operator be represented by a suitable graded world view 
the key observation here is that the mapping from graded world views to orderings
on histories is not surjective  there are orderings on histories that can not be described
by a graded world view  for example  a graded world view can not explicitly capture
plausibilities of the form if a  occurs at time i  then a  is likely to occur at time i     
   

fihunter   delgrande

this is easy to see  because a graded world view ranks histories by combining a sequence of
rankings at each instant  of course  it might be possible to devise a sequence of rankings
along with an aggregate function that happened to support a conditional plausibility for a
fixed action signature  but this would be a domain specific property  because the temporal
relation between actions can not be expressed with two independent plausibility functions 
informally  a graded world view can only represent domains where the ordering on histories
is built up in a pointwise manner by the plausibilities at each point in time  in this section 
we use this limitation to establish a difference in expressive power between constrained
world views and belief extrapolation operators 
first  we need to formalize the problem that we would like to address more precisely 
given a belief extrapolation operator  we would like to be able to find a graded world view
that captures the same information 
definition    let l be a belief extrapolation operator  we say that l is representable if
there is a graded world view hact  obsi such that  for every scenario  of length n 
traj   l     hact  obsi    
if l is representable  then the behaviour of l can be simulated with a graded world view 
we remark that we have abused notation in the definition in that traj   l  is a collection
of sequences of states  whereas  hact  obsi    is a collection of histories  we interpret
the equality to mean that the two collections are equal if we ignore the action symbols in
the latter 
the following proposition indicates that belief extrapolation operators have an expressive advantage 
proposition    there is a belief extrapolation operator l that is not representable 
proof let  be an ordering in which the following trajectories are minimal 
   h a  b    a  b    a  b i
   h a  b    a  b    a  b i
   h a  b    a  b    a  b i
let l be the associated belief extrapolation operator  we will show that l is not representable 
let    ha  a  b  bi  note that  is satisfied by all three minimal trajectories  therefore
t raj  l  is precisely the set of minimal trajectories 
now suppose that hact  obsi is a graded world view such that
hact  obsi  
assigns minimal plausibility to       and    hence  there exist actions a    a    a    b    b    b 
such that the following sums all obtain the minimum possible rank 
   obs    a  b     act   a      obs    a  b     act   b      obs    a  b  
   obs    a  b     act   a      obs    a  b     act   b      obs    a  b  
   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

   obs    a  b     act   a      obs    a  b     act   b      obs    a  b  
it must be the case that act   a      act   a     because otherwise either   or   could
be reduced by changing the first action  similarly  it must be the case that act   b     
act   b     because otherwise either   or   would not be minimal  so  we can rewrite the
sums as follows 
   obs    a  b     act   a      obs    a  b     act   b      obs    a  b  
   obs    a  b     act   a      obs    a  b     act   b      obs    a  b  
   obs    a  b     act   a      obs    a  b     act   b      obs    a  b  
from   and    it follows from basic algebra that
act   b      obs    a  b     act   b      obs    a  b   
substituting this in   gives another minimal sum 
obs    a  b     act   a      obs    a  b     act   b      obs    a  b   
this corresponds to the trajectory
h a  b    a  b    a  b i 
hence  any graded world view assigning minimum plausibility to      must also assign
minimum plausibility to this fourth trajectory  informally  if     are preferred trajectories
according to a graded world view  then we are forced to accept another preferred trajectory 
but we already saw that t raj  l  consists only of      therefore l is not representable 

note that the proof of proposition    is constructive and it demonstrates that there is a
simple  concrete  extrapolation operator that is not representable 
informally  proposition    follows from the fact that some orderings on histories can not
be defined by a graded world view  this is particularly important in applications where
an agent has preferences over the order in which events occur  in such applications  it can
be useful to assign plausibilities to certain sequences of actions  we suggest  however  that
the class of orderings definable by graded world views is a natural class of orderings  in
particular  there are many action domains where an agent has no preconceived assumptions
about the order that exogenous actions will occur  graded world views provide a reasonable tool for the representation of such action domains  graded world views also have an
expressive advantage in that they can explicitly represent fallible actions as well as other
forms of uncertainty over action effects 
we have seen that we can not represent every belief extrapolation operator  but it
would be a mistake to conclude that graded world views are strictly less expressive  belief
extrapolation really says nothing explicit about actions  which leads to several differences
from our approach  given an ordering over histories of length n  it is not clear how to use
belief extrapoloation to incorporate a new action followed by a new observation  there is
no fixed method for extending orderings over n tuples to orderings over n     tuples  in
   

fihunter   delgrande

the case of a graded world view  however  it is clear how the new ordering is defined when
more actions are performed  as such  graded world views are more appropriate for the
representation of epistemic action domains where we expect new observations and actions
to occur  of course  in our approach  we do have a fixed length for the initial graded world
view  since we can have null actions  however  the value n is really a maximum length for the
sequence of actions that occurred  as such  graded world views are most sensible in domains
where we can imagine the maximum number of actions that have previously occurred is
bounded  again  we suggest that the class of domains that satisfies this constraint is both
large and natural 
    beliefs about action effects
despite our flexible representation of observations and actions  there is one aspect of our
representation that is quite rigid  specifically  we have a single underlying transition system
that gives the effects of actions  there is no mechanism for changing this transition system
in response to new information  this has been addressed by varzinczak        in a modal
setting  by introducing a formal mechanism that allows the effects of actions to change in
response to new information  combining this idea with the notion of plausibility in a graded
world view would give an even more complete picture of the way that agents reason about
the effects of actions with uncertain effects  we leave a treatment of this idea for future
work 
a related problem is the fact that the underlying transition system in our framework
is essentially known to the agent  in other words  given perfect information about the
current state of the world and the action that has been executed  then the agent knows
the resulting state  an alternative approach due to eiter et al         is to start with
an action description that specifies some actions effects  we can then introduce suitable
information update mechanisms based only on this  partial  description of effects  rather
than by assuming a definite underlying transition system  this is  however  only a superficial
distinction  by using effect ranking functions  we can essentially give a partial description of
action effects that corresponds to an action description  in this manner  it is straightforward
to define so called action description update problems with graded world views 

   conclusion
we have introduced a formalism for reasoning about sequences of actions and observations 
the formalism uses spohn style ranking functions at each instant to determine the most
plausible action or observation  and determines the most plausible histories by an aggregate
function over all instants  we have proved that the formalism subsumes belief revision 
belief evolution  and conditionalization  moreover  it is suitable for the representation of
fallible beliefs  erroneous perception  exogenous actions  and failed actions  we have used
transition systems for the representation of actions in order to facilitate comparison with a
wide range of action formalisms  in future work  we will be interested in axiomatizing the
belief change that is permitted by the class of admissible aggregate functions 
the main advantage of graded world views over related formalisms is that graded world
views provide a uniform mechanism for dealing with imperfect information about actions
and observations  as such  graded world views allow observations that need not be incor   

fibelief change with uncertain action histories

porated because the agent is convinced a certain action occurred previously  on the other
hand  graded world views also allow an agent to retract the belief that an action occurred if
they have a strong belief in some observation  graded world views provide a tool for representing these opposing conclusions  simply by considering the magnitudes of plausibilities 
as well as some underlying aggregate 
in existing work  belief change caused by actions is often represented by starting with
an action formalism and then adding revision operators  one problem with this approach
is that it does not allow beliefs about action occurrences  in a sense  graded world views
take the opposite approach  we start with ranking functions  which were originally defined
for reasoning about belief change in a static environment  and then we plug in actions  an
agents beliefs about the actions that occur are independent of the formal representation
of action effects  as such  although we have presented graded world views in terms of
transition systems  it would certainly be possible to use a different action formalism  the
key point is that  by using ranking functions to represent uncertainty about states and
actions  we can define a framework for reasoning about epistemic action effects in which
primary importance is placed on the evolution of an agents beliefs 
we conclude with a brief remark about the overall approach taken in our framework  a
distinction is commonly drawn between update and revision in the belief change literature 
despite the fact that it can be difficult in practice to determine which is the appropriate
operation given a particular piece of information  in many cases  it simply is not clear if
conflicting information is the result of some unseen action or if it is the result of erroneous
beliefs  one solution to this problem is to define a single  general belief change operation
that subsumes both  kern isberner         by contrasat  we maintain an explicit distinction
between the way beliefs change due to actions and observations  but we use a uniform model
of uncertainty at the agent level that focuses on finding the most plausible sequence of events
to explain all available evidence  this seems like a natural approach in many applications 
where an agents perception of past events is likely to be influenced by their conviction with
respect to their senses and beliefs
