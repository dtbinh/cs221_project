abstract
this paper presents a multilayered architecture that enhances the capabilities of current
qa systems and allows different types of complex questions or queries to be processed 
the answers to these questions need to be gathered from factual information scattered
throughout different documents  specifically  we designed a specialized layer to process the
different types of temporal questions  complex temporal questions are first decomposed
into simple questions  according to the temporal relations expressed in the original question 
in the same way  the answers to the resulting simple questions are recomposed  fulfilling
the temporal restrictions of the original complex question  a novel aspect of this approach
resides in the decomposition which uses a minimal quantity of resources  with the final
aim of obtaining a portable platform that is easily extensible to other languages  in this
paper we also present a methodology for evaluation of the decomposition of the questions
as well as the ability of the implemented temporal layer to perform at a multilingual level 
the temporal layer was first performed for english  then evaluated and compared with 
a  a general purpose qa system  f measure        for qa plus english temporal layer
vs         for the general qa system   and b  a well known qa system  much better
results were obtained for temporal questions with the multilayered system  this system was
therefore extended to spanish and very good results were again obtained in the evaluation
 f measure        for qa plus spanish temporal layer vs         for the general qa
system  

   introduction
nowadays  it is a fact that there is a huge amount of digital information available  mainly
in textual form  and also a large number of users who want the easiest possible access
to this information  this situation continuously fosters research on the development of
information systems that make it possible to analyze  locate  manage  access and process
all this information automatically  commonly  these systems are referred to as search
engines 
a search engine is especially useful to obtain a specific piece of information without
the need to manually go through all the available documentation related to the search
topic  search engines are currently evolving towards a new generation of engines capable of
c

understanding user needs better  the necessity behind every query  and offering specific
services or interfaces  depending on the domain or context  the new generation of search
engines will be able to not only offer a list of ordered web pages  but also discover pieces of
information scattered throughout different information sources or even summaries  barzilay 
elhadad    mckeown         that is  they will integrate information from text search  web
pages  documents   multimedia search  images  video  audio  and database search  tourist 
biomedicine  etc   into comprehensible answers to be delivered to users  in addition  they
will correctly process questions formulated in free natural language as opposed to keyword
queries or fixed templates  as in information extraction scenarios  michelson   knoblock 
       question answering systems  qa  are one of the best examples of this new generation
of search engines  allowing users to formulate questions in free natural language  nl  and
providing them with exactly the information required  also in nl form 
however  qa is not a mature technology and current systems are mainly focused on the
treatment of questions that require very specific items of data as an answer such as dates 
names of entities or quantities  what is the capital of brazil  is an example of the so
called factual questions  in this case  the answer is the name of a city 
on the long road towards the next generation systems  the work presented here takes
a new step forward  it defines a layer that  installed on top of current nl based search
engines or qa systems  enhances their capabilities of processing different types of complex
temporal questions 
the specific case of temporal qa is not a trivial task due to the potential complexity
of temporal questions  current search engines  such as operational qa systems can deal
with simple factual temporal questions  that is  questions requiring a date as an answer
 when did bob marley die   or questions that involve simple temporal expressions in
their formulation  who won the u s  open in         processing these kinds of questions
is usually accomplished by identifying explicit temporal expressions in questions and the
relevant documents that contain these temporal expressions in order to answer the questions 
however  the system described in this paper also processes complex temporal questions 
that is  questions whose complexity is related to the temporal properties of the entities
enquired about and the relative ordering of events mentioned in the question  the following
are examples of these complex temporal questions 
 who was the spokesman of the soviet embassy in baghdad during the invasion of
kuwait 
 is bill clinton currently the president of the united states 
the approach we present in this work tries to imitate the temporal reasoning of a human
when solving these types of questions  for example  a person trying to answer the question 
who was the spokesman of the soviet embassy in baghdad during the invasion of kuwait 
would proceed as follows 
   first  the complex question would be decomposed into two simple ones  who was
the spokesman of the soviet embassy in baghdad  and when did the invasion of
kuwait occur  
   

fienhancing qa systems with complex temporal question processing capabilities

   he she would look for all the possible answers to the first simple question  who was
spokesman of the soviet embassy in baghdad  
   after that  he she would look for the answer to the second question  when did the
invasion of kuwait occur 
   finally  he she would give as a final answer one of the answers for the first question  if
there is any  that have temporal compatibility with the answer to the second question 
in this case  the answer to the first question must be temporally compatible with the
period of dates associated with the invasion of kuwait  during  
therefore  a logical approach for the treatment of complex questions should be based on the
decomposition of these questions into simple ones that can be resolved using conventional
qa systems  finally  answers to simple questions  fulfilling the temporal constraints  would
be used to construct the answer to the original complex question 
this study presents the development and evaluation of a tool that processes complex
nl temporal questions for information retrieval purposes  apart from the fact that the tool
is capable of processing this type of complex questions  it has the following advantages 
 it can be incorporated as a layer on top of one or more already existing qa systems 
 it can contain and integrate into an answer different data obtained from different types
of information sources  web pages  databases  documents  etc   that are retrieved
using different types of search engines  qa  nlidb    etc   
 the layer is a portable platform since the language dependent features of the process
are easily extended to other languages 
 all the information necessary to process the complex question is obtained directly
from it  no extra auxiliary questions or annotations are required 
in this paper  our main aim is to demonstrate how the temporal layer can improve
a general purpose qa system when questions are not simple or factual  but of a higher
degree of complexity  specifically  we implemented the temporal layer in order to deal
with questions with different levels of temporal complexity  furthermore  the proposed
treatment of questions uses a minimum quantity of linguistic resources in order to obtain a
very portable platform  which can be easily extended to different languages 
the paper has been structured in the following way  first of all  section   briefly introduces the current situation of temporal reasoning and qa  section   depicts our proposal
for classifying temporal questions into four groups  depending on the features of the question  section   explains the concept of a multilayered qa system  section   describes the
different modules of the temporal layer in more detail  and in section    decomposition of
the question and the multilayered qa system are evaluated for english  the portability of
the system to other languages is then described  and the procedure repeated and evaluated
for spanish  finally  some conclusions and comments on future work will be made 
   natural language interfaces to databases

   background
as explained in the introduction  one of the aims of this paper is to process complex questions  complex questions in general have been dealt with in previous studies using different
approaches to decompose them  harabagiu  lacatusu and hickl        presented a procedure in which a question produces lots of queries that are semantically related to the original
question  with the main aim of obtaining more information about the answers  this approach requires a significant amount of semantic information  the question decomposition
presented by katz  borchardt and felshin        involves three decomposition techniques 
a  a syntactic decomposition using linguistic knowledge and language based descriptions
of resource content  b  a semantic decomposition using domain motivated explanation patterns and language based annotations of resource content  and c  a semantic decomposition
of both questions and resource content into lower level assertions  this approach makes use
of a considerable amount of linguistic knowledge and in order to move to new domains  new
sets of parameterized language based annotations need to be composed  in addition to these
studies dealing with single focus complex questions  lin and lui        propose processing
complex questions with multiple foci by obtaining one subquestion for each focus of the
original question  this approach determines four possible relations between the subquestions derived from the original question  however  the temporal relation is not considered
in this approach 
apart from complex questions treatment  the motivation for the temporal aspect of this
work is due to the great importance in the question answering field of relating questions
and information to the temporal dimension in order to find a correct answer  take  for
example  the following two similar questions 
 who is the president of the usa 
 who was the president of the usa in      
there is an obvious dependency of answers on time  so in order to obtain the right answer
to these two questions  temporal information needs to be extracted and processed  because
the first question refers to the current president of the usa  the exact point in time when
the question is formulated   whereas the second one refers to the president in       when
the temporal information is not explicit  the questions are considered complex temporal
questions 
the importance of the temporal dimension of data in information search processes is
corroborated by the recent interest shown by the major evaluation forums on qa like text
retrieval conference   trec        and cross language evaluation forum   clef        
see also the works by voorhees        and magnini et al          in including different types
of temporal questions as part of their evaluation benchmarks 
furthermore  clef has explicitly fostered research into complex temporal questions by
organizing a specific pilot task for such questions  herrera  penas    verdejo        and
including in clef  magnini et al         the temporal dimension of questions and answers
as part of its main qa task 
a temporal question can be appropriately processed by      relating the available information to its temporal dimension and     adapting the search to link this temporal
information with the information search process 
   

fienhancing qa systems with complex temporal question processing capabilities

concerning the first task  the analysis of time is a challenging problem  as the needs of
applications based on information extraction techniques expand to include varying degrees
of time stamping  identification and reasoning  of events or expressions within a narrative
or question  interest in temporal representation and reasoning has been evolving throughout the years and has resulted in a growing number of meetings related to this topic  we
present here  in descending chronological order  the most important ones  time        is
an annual symposium on temporal representation and reasoning  demri   jensen        
it involves different areas including time in natural language  tempeval       verhagen
et al         is a workshop held within semeval      for the evaluation of systems performing time event temporal relation identification  arte      is a new workshop focused on
annotating and reasoning about time and events  ahn        dalli   wilks        mani  
wellner        and was part of the relevant conference coling acl         pan  mulkar 
  hobbs      a   dagstuhl      was a seminar about annotating  extracting and reasoning
time and events  katz  pustejovsky    schilder         tern        was an international
competition in which different systems that identify and normalize temporal expressions
were evaluated and compared  tango      was specialized in developing an appropriate infrastructure for annotation  pustejovsky   mani         lrec        dedicated a
workshop to annotation standards for temporal information in natural language  mani
  wilson        setzer   gaizauskas        saquete  martnez barco    munoz        
acl        included the temporal and spatial information processing workshop  setzer  
gaizauskas        filatova   hovy        katz   arosio        moia        schilder   habel        wilson  mani  sundheim    ferro        and finally  coling         in which
some papers were related to temporal expression identification or temporal databases  it
is important to emphasize that all these meetings led to the development of a standard for
a specification language for events and temporal expressions and their ordering  timeml 
       nowadays  there is also a growing number of automatic systems extracting temporal
expression information    such as  atel         chronos  negri         tempex        
gutime  mani   wilson      a   dante  mazur   dale         timextag  ahn       
and terseo  saquete  munoz    martnez barco        
regarding the second task  significant progress has been made in temporal analysis applied to ie and qa tasks as presented in the terqas workshop  pustejovsky        radev
  sundheim         the purpose of the terqas workshop was to address the problem of
how to enhance natural language question answering systems to answer temporally based
questions about the events and entities in news articles  besides  a temporal question corpus
was developed  as far as we know  one of the first systems that treated temporal information for qa purposes was described by breck et al         and it used temporal expression
identification applying the temporal tagger developed by mani and wilson      b   another important study related to temporal constraints in question answering is presented by
prager  chu carroll and czuba         they presented a method to improve the accuracy
of a qa system by asking auxiliary questions related to the original question whose answers are used to temporally verify and restrict the original answer  this method is called
qa by dossier with constraints and is very suitable for trec style factoid questions  but
it has the inconvenience of requiring the generation of a set of auxiliary questions  besides

recently  researchers have also focused on other important features in temporal reasoning
for final applications  such as  a  event detection  evita  saur  knippen  verhagen   
pustejovsky        is an application for recognizing events in natural language texts  and
this recognition is applied to qa  b  event extension  pan  mulkar and hobbs      b  describe a method to automatically learn durations from event descriptions  and c  temporal
relations between temporal expressions and events  as described by lapata and lascarides
       
however  those strategies that implied a complex temporal processing of the question 
using only information extracted from the original question and a small amount of linguistic
resources for the temporal reasoning were beyond the scope of these investigations 
our proposal is focused on temporal reasoning for complex temporal questions and so it
is necessary to add a new layer to existing systems  thereby allowing these complex questions
to be processed  saquete  martnez barco  munoz    vicedo         the decomposition
performed by the temporal layer is based only on the temporal relation between the events
of the original question  and no other linguistic information is required in the decomposition 
in addition  a system that identifies and normalizes temporal expressions was used as a part
of the processing layer  negri  saquete  martnez barco    munoz         taking advantage
of the multilingual feature of this system in order to use it for cross lingual tasks 
however  not all the temporal questions need to be treated in the same way since they
may have different characteristics  and for this reason  a classification of the different types
of temporal questions is also proposed 

   temporal questions taxonomy
before explaining how to answer temporal questions  they must be classified into different
categories since the way to solve them will differ depending on the type of question involved 
the temporality of a question depends on two levels of complexity  a  the number of events
in the question  questions formed by a single event and whose answers can be found in
a document  simple questions   and questions formed by more than one event that are
temporally related and whose answers could be found in multiple documents  complex
questions   and b  the temporal information appearing in the question  like implicit or
explicit temporal expressions  that needs to be recognized and normalized  the combination
of these two features results in four different types of temporal questions 
simple temporal questions 
type    single event temporal questions without a temporal expression  te   these are
questions that require a temporal expression as an answer and do not contain any temporal
expression in their formulation  these questions are formed by a single event and no
temporal reasoning is required  because they are resolved by a qa system directly without
a pre or postprocessing of the question  for example  when did jordan close the port of
aqaba to kuwait   however  since this taxonomy is a temporal question taxonomy  this
type of basic temporal questions need to be considered 
type    single event temporal questions with a temporal expression  these are questions
that require a temporal reasoning of the temporal expression contained in the formulation
of the question  there is a single event in the question  but there are one or more temporal
expressions that need to be identified  normalized and annotated  all this temporal infor   

fienhancing qa systems with complex temporal question processing capabilities

mation is necessary to search for the correct answer  due to the fact that it is establishing
temporal constraints for the candidate answers  for example  who won the      new
hampshire republican primary   temporal expression      
complex temporal questions 
type    multiple event temporal questions with a temporal expression  questions that
contain more than one event  related by a temporal signal  this signal establishes the order
between the events in the question  moreover  there are one or more temporal expressions in
the question  these temporal expressions need to be identified  normalized and annotated 
and they establish temporal constraints in the answers to the question  for example  what
did george bush do after the u n  security council ordered a global embargo on trade with
iraq in august     in this example  the temporal signal is after and the temporal
constraint is between          and            this question consists of these two events 
 event    george bush did something
 event    the u n  security council ordered a global embargo on trade with iraq
 temporal constraint  august      
type    multiple event temporal questions without a temporal expression  like type   
these questions consist of more than one event  related by a temporal signal  but in this
case  the questions do not contain temporal expressions  the temporal signal establishes
the order between the events in the question  for example  who was the president of
us when the aarp was founded   in this example  the temporal signal is when and the
question would be decomposed into 
 event    someone was the president of us
 event    the aarp foundation
how to process each type of question will be explained in detail in the following sections 

   architecture of a multilayered qa system
in order to process special types of questions which are beyond the scope of currently qa
systems  this work proposes a multilayered architecture that increases the functionality of
these qa systems  allowing them to solve any type of complex question  in this work  the
temporal layer has been implemented  moreover  this architecture enables different layers
to be added to cope with questions that need other kinds of complex processing and are
not temporally oriented  such as script questions  how do i assemble a bicycle   or
template based questions  what is the main biographical data of nelson mandela   
complex questions have in common the need for additional processing of the question
in order to solve it adequately  the architecture presented in this paper enables different
types of complex questions to be dealt with by superposing additional processing layers 
one for each type  on the top of an existing general purpose qa system  as shown in figure
   these layers will 
 decompose the question into simple events to generate simple questions  sub questions 
that are ordered according to the original question

figure    multi layered architecture of a qa system
this architecture has a large number of advantages  of which the following should be
mentioned 
 it allows researchers to use any existing general purpose qa system 
 since complex questions are processed by a superior layer  it is not necessary to modify
the current qa system when you want to deal with more complex questions  the layer
enhances the capabilities of an existing qa system without changing it in any way 
 each additional processing layer works independently from the others and only processes the questions accepted by that layer 
 it is possible to have more than one type of qa system working in parallel  each of
them specialized in searching for a specific type of information  text multimedia databases  
next  a layer oriented to processing temporal questions according to the taxonomy shown
in section   is presented

figure    architecture of the temporal layer
these components all work together in order to obtain a final answer as follows 
 question decomposition unit is a preprocessing unit which performs three main tasks 
first of all  temporal expressions in the question are identified and normalized  secondly  following the taxonomy shown in section    there are different types of questions
and each type must be treated in a different way  for this reason  the type needs to
be identified  after that  complex questions  type   and    are split into simple
ones using the temporal signal as a reference  the first sub question is defined as the
question focus  q focus  and it specifies the type of information the user needs to
find  the second sub question is called the question restriction  q restriction  and
the answer to this sub question establishes the temporal restrictions on the list of
answers to the q focus  the q focus and the q restriction are the input of the qa
system  for example  the question where did bill clinton study before going to oxford university   is divided into two sub questions that are related by the temporal
signal before  q focus  where did bill clinton study  and q restriction when
did bill clinton go to oxford university

following answers

 answer recomposition unit  this unit constructs the answer to the original question from the answers to the q focus and the q restriction using all the temporal
constraints  such as temporal signals  which are fully explained later  or temporal
expressions  available in the original question  the temporal signal establishes the
appropriate order between the answers to the q focus and the q restriction in the
question  finally  this unit returns the appropriate answer by analyzing the temporal compatibility between the list of possible q focus answers and the q restriction
answer

figure    example of performance of the temporal layer
it is important to emphasize that the temporal layer is a language dependent platform
 it uses lexical and syntactic patterns  and english was the language chosen initially to
develop the layer  however  it can be easily extended to other languages  as will be seen in
section      the units that integrate the temporal layer are described in more detail in the
following sections 
   

fienhancing qa systems with complex temporal question processing capabilities

    question decomposition unit
the main task of this unit  which is divided into three main modules  is the temporal
reasoning of the temporal information of the question and the decomposition of the question
 only required in type   and   questions   the temporal expression identification and
normalization module detects and resolves the temporal expressions in the question  the
type identification module classifies the question according to the taxonomy proposed in
section    finally  the question splitter module splits the complex question into simple
ones 
thus  the output of the question decomposition unit consists of 
 two sub questions  q focus and q restriction   which will be processed by a qa
system in order to obtain an answer for each of them 
 temporal tags  containing concrete dates returned by the terseo system  saquete
et al          these tags are part of the input of the answer recomposition unit and
they are used by this unit as temporal constraints in order to filter the individual
answers  and
 the temporal signal  which is part of the input of the answer recomposition unit
as well  because this information is needed in order to compose the final answer and
determine the temporal compatibility between the answers to the q focus and the
answer to the q restriction 
the modules of the decomposition unit are fully explained in the following subsections 
      temporal expression identification and normalization
this module uses the terseo system  saquete et al         to identify  annotate and
normalize temporal expressions in the question 
with this system  implicit and explicit temporal expressions can be annotated  expressions like            are explicit  while those like two days before are implicit and
need the location of another complete temporal expression  te  to be understood  for the
specific purposes of the temporal layer  terseo simply returns the text of the temporal
expression in a string and the normalization or resolution value of the temporal expression
using the iso standard format for concrete dates or periods 
in this work  terseo does not use a complete text as input  but only a question  the
temporal tags  te tag with a value attribute  obtained from the questions are the output
of this module and they are used in the answer recomposition unit in order to filter
the individual answers obtained by the qa system  the te tag is necessary in order to
determine the temporal compatibility between the answers to the q focus and the answer
to the q restriction  for example  in a question like  which u s  ship was attacked by
israeli forces during the six day war in the sixties   the temporal constraint that must be
fulfilled is  the date of q focus answers should be between            and            
     in iso format   this means that only the answers whose dates are within the range
of dates in the question are temporally compatible 
it is very important to emphasize that  initially  the terseo was developed for spanish 
but a platform to automatically extend the system to other languages was developed as
   

fisaquete  vicedo  martnez barco  munoz    llorens

well  therefore  the system was evaluated for three different languages  spanish  english
and italian  for spanish the results were     precision and     recall  the system was
evaluated for english using the tern        corpus and the results obtained for the fmeasure were     for identification and about     for normalization  for the italian
evaluation  the i cab corpus was used  this corpus consists of     news documents taken
from the local newspaper ladige     ita terseo obtained an f measure of around    
for identification  the results are quite good because the extension to english and italian
was completely automatic and therefore  also very fast 
the multilingual capabilities of terseo are very interesting in various nlp fields  in
particular its application to crosslingual qa systems  and therefore in the temporal layer
as well 
      type identification
the type identification module classifies the question into one of the four types in the
taxonomy proposed above  this identification is necessary because each type of question
produces a different behavior  scenario  in the system  type   and type   questions are
classified as simple  and the answer can be obtained without splitting the original question 
on the other hand  type   and type   questions need to be split into a set of simple
sub questions  these types of sub questions are always type    type   or a non temporal
question  which are considered simple questions 
the question type is established according to the rules in figure    there are four
possibilities   a  if there is no temporal expression and no temporal signal  the question
is classified as type      b  if there is no temporal expression but a temporal signal  the
question is classified as type      c  if there is a temporal expression but no temporal
signal  the question is classified as type      d  if there is a temporal expression and a
temporal signal  the question is classified as type   
      question splitter
this task is only necessary when  according to the type identification module  the question
is type   or type    these questions are considered complex questions and need to be
divided into simple ones  type    type   or non temporal questions   the decomposition
of a complex question is based on the identification of temporal signals  which link simple
events to form complex questions  see table    
as explained before  using the temporal signal as a referent  the two events related by
it will be transformed into two simple questions  question focus  q focus  and questionrestriction  q restriction  
the q focus is a question that specifies the information that the user is searching
for  this question is very simple to obtain  because no syntactic changes are required to
construct it  only the question mark must be added  when the q focus is processed by a
qa system  the system will return a list of possible answers 
the q restriction is constructed using the part of the complex question that follows
the temporal signal  this question is always transformed to a when question using a set

between the answers and composes the final answer to the original complex question  this
process will be fully explained in the following subsection 
    answer recomposition unit
the main task of the answer recomposition unit is to obtain the final answer to the
complex question using all the available inputs of the decomposition unit and the answers
obtained from the qa system  the recomposition unit is divided into two modules  the
individual answer filtering module filters the possible answers to the q focus  avoiding
the non temporally compatible ones  and the answer comparison and composition module 
which composes the answer to the original question by using the ordering key established
by the temporal signal 
once the complex questions have been split by the decomposition unit into the q focus
and the q restriction and the answers to these questions have been obtained by a qa
system  the recomposition unit determines from the list of all the potential answers to the
q focus which one is compatible with all the temporal constraints obtained in the process 
temporal expressions  temporal signal and answer to the q restriction  the answers to the
q focus that fulfill the temporal constraints will be considered the answer to the initial
complex question 
      individual answer filtering
the list of possible answers to the q focus and the answer to the q restriction given by
the qa system are the input of the individual answer filtering module  for a q focus
or q restriction with a temporal expression  it selects only those answers that satisfy the
temporal constraints obtained by the te identification and normalization unit  the date
of the answer should be temporally compatible with the temporal tag  that is  the date of
the answer must lie within the date values of the tag  if not  it will be rejected  only the
answers that fulfill the constraints go to the answer comparison and composition module 
      answer comparison and composition
finally  once the answers have been filtered using the signals and the ordering key  the
results for the q focus are compared with the answer to the q restriction in order to
determine if they are temporally compatible  temporal signals denote the relationship of
order between the date of the answer to the q focus and the date of the answer to the
q restriction 
only the answers that fulfill the compatibility established by the temporal signal can be
possible answers to the original question  the answer selected is considered by this module
to be the answer to the complex question  hence  the system is able to solve complex
temporal questions 

   evaluation experiments
the evaluation experiments performed in this paper were done initially for english  and
after porting the system to spanish  the same evaluation procedure was carried out for this
new language 
   

fienhancing qa systems with complex temporal question processing capabilities

this evaluation has a dual aim  on the one hand  to determine if the decomposition
unit is able to process each type of question properly in order to obtain appropriate simple
factual questions that can be answered by any kind of general purpose qa system  and on
the other hand  to show to what extent the general purpose qa system could be improved
when these techniques are applied 
    test environment
first of all  a corpus of english questions that contains as many simple and complex temporal questions as possible was necessary  the first idea was to use already existing resources 
such as trec        and clef        question corpora  due to the large number of
questions they contain  unfortunately  after studying these corpora  they were discarded
because they do not contain complex temporal questions  thus  using the initial terqas
question corpus proposal  radev   sundheim        pustejovsky        as a model  a new
question corpus was manually developed collecting questions from a group of volunteers
unacquainted with this work  the instructions given to the volunteers were     answers to
the questions proposed must be found on the internet     the questions must be constructed
according to the temporal question taxonomy described in section    and    the questions
must expect a fact as an answer  factual questions   in the case of complex questions  two
factual questions must be related to a temporal signal    this last instruction was necessary
in order to make the evaluation procedure more straightforward since open ended questions
usually require long answers  which makes them more difficult to judge  in order to have
a balanced corpus  some questions were discarded and finally the corpus developed contains a balanced number      of each type of temporal question  types       and     which
resulted in     temporal questions for english    for the spanish evaluation  the english
question corpus was manually translated into this language  therefore  the distribution of
the questions by type is the same as in english 
once the question corpus for english and spanish were developed  the following step
was to construct the testbeds for both languages in order to allow for rigorous  transparent
and replicable evaluation tests  the testbed annotation was performed using an xml
schema and was developed by three independent annotators  in the case of doubts or
disagreement  the annotation was reviewed by a referee  who made the final decision  the
interannotator agreement was calculated for every attribute  resulting      for all cases
except the temporal signal       due to the complexity of some temporal signals 
in the testbed annotation  every question is annotated with a q tag  and this tag has
an id attribute that identifies every question  the question string is annotated using the
question tag  furthermore  for every question  there are five items that must be annotated 
   identification and normalization of the temporal expressions in the question  the
annotation for this item is done using a te tag  and its content stores the string text
of the te  the tag also has an attribute value  which stores the resolution of the
expression using the iso format 
   it is important to emphasize that type   questions contain two events and a temporal expression  which
is used as an extra time constraint in the answering procedure  limiting the number of potential answers 
speeding the answering step  and refining the final answer

   the type of question according to the classification proposed in this paper  this type
is annotated using the tag type and it must be a value between   and    since the
questions were manually built using the temporal question taxonomy as a reference 
   the temporal signal  the tag used to annotate this item is called signal and it stores
the exact string text of the temporal signal of the question 
   the two possible sub questions in the case of complex questions  type   and     the
first sub question is annotated using the tag q focus and the second using the tag
q rest  and 
   the answer to the complex question  the answer is annotated using an answer tag and
contains the correct answer to the complex question  one example of the annotation
format for a question is 
 q id       
 question who won the best actress oscar award when james dean died in the   s    question 
 te value       the   s   te 
 type     type 
 signal when   signal 
 q focus who won the best actress oscar award    q focus 
 q rest when did james dean die in the     s    q rest

   q 

in the case of the decomposition unit  the following five aspects are evaluated 
 te identification and normalization  are the temporal expressions in the question
correctly detected and normalized 
 type identification  is the type of question correctly identified according to the classification presented previously in this paper 
 signal detection  are any temporal signals in the question correctly detected 
 question splitter  are the complex questions correctly split into simple factual questions  which can be answered by a general purpose qa system 
 decomposition unit as a whole  has the system correctly undertaken all the
sub tasks previously defined  since these sub tasks as a whole compose the decomposition unit 
however  not all the evaluation aspects explained above need to be considered for all the
questions  table   determines if an aspect must be evaluated or ignored for each particular
type of question  the decomposition unit as a whole is only taking into consideration the
evaluated sub tasks for every question 
having determined what aspects are evaluated in the decomposition and in what cases
they must be evaluated  depending on the type of question  the next step is to establish
how these aspects are evaluated  for this purpose  the criteria matrix  containing the rules
followed in the evaluation in order to determine when the elements are treated  act  and
which of them are correct  corr   is shown in table

in the case of qa evaluation  we are using the current clef evaluation criteria 
as starting point  determining correct and inexact answers  the use of these evaluation
criteria is possible since our corpus only contains factual questions  therefore  determining
the correctness of an answer is very straightforward  the other clef judgments are not
specified in this evaluation because the measure of incorrectness may be calculated directly
by subtracting the number of correct answers from the total number of questions  in
addition  the unknown judgement is also omitted since two human assessors must evaluate
all the answers  and finally  we do not consider unsupported judgement neither  since our
corpus consisted of data obtained from the internet  where all correct answers can be found

      evaluating the decomposition unit for english
in this section  the decomposition unit  for the processing of simple and complex temporal
questions in english is evaluated  based on the testbed defined previously  in this evaluation 
in addition to the decomposition unit efficiency  some aspects of temporal expressions and
their influence on complex questions were analyzed 
the evaluation results are very good with an f measure of        all the results
are shown in table    in the evaluation      of a total of     questions were correctly
preprocessed  since the decomposition unit not only divides the complex questions but also
determines the type of the question and performs the temporal reasoning if necessary  the
whole set of questions is considered in the global measure of the decomposition unit  it is
obvious that in the case of type   questions the decomposition unit simply determines the
type of question  but we were interested in evaluating the performance of the unit in this
respect

fienhancing qa systems with complex temporal question processing capabilities

next  a detailed analysis of the results for each evaluation aspect is shown  see appendix
a for detailed error examples  
 identification and normalization of temporal expressions  in this corpus  there were
    temporal expressions and our system detected     of which    were correctly
resolved  as we said previously  this module uses the terseo system to identify
and normalize the temporal expressions in the question  there were three types of
errors      expressions that were treated by terseo as temporal expressions but
were not in fact temporal      expressions that were identified wrongly because  a 
the expression is outside the scope of the terseo system  or b  the identification
extent is not exact  and     expressions that  a  were normalized wrongly because the
normalization rule in terseo was not appropriate for these expressions  or b  were
not normalized because the normalization rule does not exist 
 type identification  there were     temporal questions in the corpus  all of them were
processed by this module  and     were correctly identified according to the taxonomy
proposed in section    the errors in this module were due to the fact that some te
were not detected by terseo  as shown in appendix a  however  this type of error
does not usually affect the question splitting and in most cases the complex question
is split correctly 
 signal detection  in the corpus  there were     questions that were considered complex  type   and type     our system was able to treat and recognize correctly the
temporal signal of    of these questions  the main error detected in this module arose
when a temporal expression was part of a signal  denoting a complex signal  such as 
event  a year after event   this type of complex signal is outside the scope
of the system  the system also fails when a preposition  classified as a signal in the
system  is part of a te  like during the    century and therefore during is wrongly
considered a temporal signal 
 question splitter  from this set of     complex questions  the system was able
to process and split    of them properly  the errors in this unit are due to  a 
wrong signal identification  or b  syntactic problems  obtaining a tensed verb or the
subject of the q focus to construct the q restriction properly  for instance  in the
question which language was invented when berliner patented the gramophone  
the postagger did not identify patented as a past tense verb and the q restriction
was wrongly generated as  when did berliner patented the gramophone happen  
one possible problem that can appear in complex questions  and is not yet treated by
our system  are questions that contain anaphoric co references  therefore  when splitting
the complex question into two separate simple questions  the question that contains the
anaphoric co reference can not be treated directly by a qa system and needs to be processed
by a module that performs anaphora resolution first  for example  in which studies did
ms  whitman graduate before she got her mba    the q restriction obtained is  when
did she get her mba   in this case  she is referring to ms  whitman  in our case 
this type of question is outside our scope  however  just by adding a module that adapts
anaphora resolution techniques for dialogs and texts  palomar et al         palomar

martnez barco        to questions  the situation will be solved  moreover  applying this
module to the question does not affect the decomposition process in any case 
      evaluating the influence of the temporal processing in qa systems
for english
the qa system used for this evaluation is a general purpose one that uses internet data
as the corpus  moreda  llorens  saquete    palomar      a   this is a very simple opendomain qa system  whose main feature is that the answer extraction unit is able to look
for possible answers in two ways  performing a mapping with the type of name entity that
the question requires  ne based   or with the type of semantic role that the question needs
as an answer  sr based    
due to the modularity of the qa system  in this evaluation  only the ne based answer extraction is used  as a baseline  using a subset of factual questions  extracted from
trec     and trec     that are ne oriented  the authors evaluated the system and
found        precision      recall         f and        mrr  moreda  llorens  saquete

the evaluation performed in this work is divided into two experiments 
   base qa system evaluation  first the qa system is evaluated without using the
temporal layer 
   multilayered qa system evaluation  then the qa system is evaluated when it performs with the temporal layer 
the main aim of this evaluation is to compare the results of the two experiments and
determine if the temporal layer enhances a general purpose qa system like the one used
in this case  besides  for both experiments  the     temporal question corpus created for
this purpose containing simple  type   and type    and complex  type   and type   
questions is used 
the results obtained by the general purpose qa system without the temporal layer are

as shown in both tables  the qa system enhanced with the temporal layer offers better
results in all measures         improvement in f and        error reduction in f   the
most outstanding improvements occur in complex temporal questions  due to the extra
reasoning that the temporal layer applies to find a candidate answer  moreover  an extra
experiment  with manually corrected temporal expression identification and normalization 
is performed  obviously  only questions type   and   are affected and improved  results

a graphical comparison of the results for each type of question is shown in figure    it is
very clear that the multilayered qa system enhances the performance of the qa system in
all the types of questions except type    simple factual temporal questions   since this type
of question is processed in the same way by both systems  for the other types  precision 
recall  f measure and mrr are improved  especially in the case of type   and type  
questions  in which the base qa system is almost incapable of answering these questions
properly  the system gave very few inexact answers since the questions need short answers
consisting only of an ne or te 
some interesting examples that have been analyzed are shown in figure   
in the first example  the question is a type   question  which contains an implicit
temporal expression    years ago  the question is processed by both systems  but with
the important difference that the multilayered qa system is able to process the temporal
expression and normalize the expression to a concrete date  in this case       once this
preprocessing of the temporal expression is done  the question is processed by the base qa
system as where were the olympics held in        allowing the system to find the correct
answer  without this preprocessing of the temporal layer  the base qa system returns the

most popular answer  which corresponds to the last olympic games in beijing  and therefore
fails to answer the question correctly 
in the second example  the question is a type   complex question and is again processed
by both systems  since the base qa system is not able to reason the second part of the
question and simply uses the keywords in the question  only the multilayered qa system
returns a correct answer  taking as a restriction the date when the event in the second part
of the questions occurred 
to conclude  this study demonstrates that including this type of layer can help general purpose qa systems to resolve questions that are more complex than simple factual
questions  without changing the implementation of the general qa system 
      comparison with other qa systems
in order to compare our results with those of another qa system  we carried out the above
test with the widely known start qa system  katz               which is available on

the start qa system was only able to answer types   and type   questions  although  the precision achieved by this system with these types of questions is high  the recall
is lower  specially for type   questions          focusing on complex temporal questions
 types      and     our qa system  which uses temporal information  can be seen to obtain
better results than the start qa  which does not use a temporal layer  in conclusion 
these results show that the application of a temporal layer improves qa results for complex
temporal questions  concretely  considering the overall results  the qa system using the
temporal layer exceeds the start system by a         as regards the f measure

    portability to other languages  the spanish approach
as said before  the system was initially developed for english but was extended to spanish
as well  since the task performed by the layer that processes complex questions is language

briefly  in the evaluation for spanish      out of a total of     questions were properly
processed and decomposed in all aspects  te identification  type identification  temporal
signal detection and splitting  if necessary   which means an f measure of       for the
whole decomposition process  the best results were obtained by the signal detection module  f measure almost        but the results for question splitting and type identification
 f measure around         and te identification and normalization were also quite good
 f measure around      
the main errors were very similar to the english ones  however  some new problems
appeared in spanish  see appendix b for details   principally produced by 
 grammatical errors in the transformation of the second question due to the ambiguity
of some words that produces an incorrect pos tagging  for example  in the expression
el cometa hale  the hale comet   the postagger classifies cometa  comet  as
a verb rather than a noun  which would be the appropriate tag in this case 
 temporal expressions like el ano    or el     year      which in spanish refer
to      in this case  are detected but not resolved  the same problem appears other
expressions containing non explicit numeric temporal expressions  i e  el siglo xix
 xix century   el segundo milenio  second millennium  or the less common
word spelled dates mil novecientos noventa y ocho  one thousand nine hundred
ninety eight  are not successfully processed by the temporal layer 
 finally  in questions where the temporal signal is complex  such as  un ano despues
de que    a year after      both signal detection and question splitting are wrong
because this type of complex signal is outside the scope of the system 
      evaluating the influence of the temporal processing in qa systems
for spanish
for this evaluation  the qa system described  moreda et al       a  was adapted to the
spanish language  as in english  we used the ne based answer extraction module 
we divided the spanish evaluation into two experiments  as in the english evaluation 
   base qa system evaluation  first the adapted qa system is evaluated without using
the temporal layer 
   multilayered qa system evaluation  then the adapted qa system is evaluated when
it performs with the temporal layer 
the main aim of this evaluation is to analyze whether the temporal layer can be successfully extended to other languages and deal with other language qa system  like the
spanish adapted qa system in this case  the     temporal question corpus created for the
english test were manually translated into spanish and used in both experiments 
the results obtained by the general purpose spanish qa system without the temporal
layer are shown in table    
the results obtained by the system that has been enhanced with the temporal layer are
shown in table

these results for spanish show  as expected and already proven in the english case 
that  a  the qa system enhanced with the temporal layer gives better results in all measures         improvement in f and        error reduction in f   and b  the temporal layer
is easily extensible to other languages  the final global results are worst than the english
approach with this qa system  but this is due to the fact that the baseline results for the
spanish qa system are also worst compared with the english qa system  f english    
compared to f spanish       in addition  as in the english experiments  an extra experiment with manually corrected spanish temporal expression identification and normalization
is performed and results are shown in table

despite this fact  the multilayered qa system enhances the performance of the spanish
qa system in all the types of questions  even in the case of complex questions  for which the
base spanish qa system is unable to find any correct answer  there are very few inexact
   

fisaquete  vicedo  martnez barco  munoz    llorens

answers for spanish as well  thus proving that the system usually obtains exact answers for
both languages 
to conclude this second evaluation analysis  extension of the evaluation to spanish
corroborates the conclusions obtained in the english evaluation and also demonstrates that
the temporal layer improves the system in the same way regardless of the language 

   conclusions and further work
this study presents a multilayered temporal qa architecture that performs on a multilingual level  in this case english and spanish  this system processes complex temporal
questions by splitting them into simple questions that can be answered by different types
of general purpose qa systems  in addition  the system performs a temporal reasoning of
the questions with temporal information 
the proposal consists in adding a new layer  on top of a current qa system  which has
two main features 
 complex question decomposition  questions are decomposed into simple events which
generate simple questions  sub questions  by using the temporal signal that relates
the events  the first sub question  q focus  specifies the type of information the user
needs to find  the answer to the second sub question  q restriction  establishes the
temporal restrictions on the list of answers to the q focus  the q focus and the
q restriction are the input of a qa system  any type of qa system could be used
here  
 question recomposition  answers to the q focus and q restriction  obtained from
the qa system  are filtered and compared in order to determine their temporal compatibility and construct the final complex answer 
since the layer that processes complex questions uses lexical and syntactic rules  a
grammar   this task is language dependent  initially  the decomposition unit was prepared
for english  but in a very general way  extension of the system to spanish was therefore very
simple  only some small changes were required   and the same applies to other languages 
in addition  the temporal reasoning of the system is performed by terseo  which is a
multilingual system  now working in spanish  english  catalan and italian  that is easily
extensible to any european language 
for evaluation purposes  there were two aims  a  to determine if the decomposition unit
processes each type of question properly in order to obtain the appropriate simple factual
questions  and b  show how these techniques enhance a general purpose qa system  in order
to accomplish these aims  a test bed for english and spanish was constructed  annotating
the question corpus with the correct results for both decomposition and qa tasks  and
determining the criteria establishing when a question has been properly decomposed and
answered 
the decomposition unit evaluation results for english and spanish were very good for
complex questions  f measure       for english and       for spanish   when evaluating
the performance of the whole multilayered architecture  these results were compared with
those obtained by the base qa system without the temporal layer  great improvement
   

fienhancing qa systems with complex temporal question processing capabilities

was found  especially in the case of complex questions  type   and     in which the base
system was not able to answer them at all        average f measure for english and      
for spanish   the multilayered qa system obtained an overall f measure of approximately
    for english and     for spanish for all types of questions  besides  the temporal layer
qa system was also compared with an online general purpose qa system called start 
demonstrating the difficulty encountered by these general purpose qa systems in answering
questions with complex temporal information or temporal relations 
further work will be done along three main lines of research     resolving the problems
detected in the temporal layer after the evaluation process     adding a module to resolve
anaphoric co reference in questions     integrating the event and link information from
timeml schema  timeml        in our system in order to extract a deeper understanding
of complex questions     taking into consideration techniques to determine event durations
in case of open ended questions  such as  what happened to world oil prices after the iraqi
annexation of kuwait   for this task  previous work in the field will be considered  pan
et al       b   and    applying the layer procedure to other types of complex questions 
as well as studying the new features that need to be added to the system to enable it to
perform with other languages like chinese
