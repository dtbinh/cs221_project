abstract
as fragments of first order logic  description logics  dls  do not provide nonmonotonic
features such as defeasible inheritance and default rules  since many applications would
benefit from the availability of such features  several families of nonmonotonic dls have
been developed that are mostly based on default logic and autoepistemic logic  in this
paper  we consider circumscription as an interesting alternative approach to nonmonotonic
dls that  in particular  supports defeasible inheritance in a natural way  we study dls
extended with circumscription under different language restrictions and under different
constraints on the sets of minimized  fixed  and varying predicates  and pinpoint the exact
computational complexity of reasoning for dls ranging from alc to alcio and alcqo 
when the minimized and fixed predicates include only concept names but no role names 
then reasoning is complete for nexpnp   it becomes complete for npnexp when the number
of minimized and fixed predicates is bounded by a constant  if roles can be minimized or
fixed  then complexity ranges from nexpnp to undecidability 

   introduction
early knowledge representation  kr  formalisms such as semantic networks and frames
included a wealth of features in order to provide as much expressive power as possible
 quillian        minsky         in particular  such formalisms usually admitted a structured representation of classes and objects similar to modern description logics  dls   but
also mechanisms for defeasible inheritance  default rules  and other features that are nowadays studied in the area of nonmonotonic logics  nmls   when kr theory developed
further  the all embracing approaches were largely given up in favour of more specialized
ones due to unfavourable computational properties and problems with the semantics  this
process has caused dls and nmls to develop into two independent subfields  consequently 
modern description logics such as shiq lack the expressive power to represent defeasible
inheritance and other nonmonotonic features  horrocks  sattler    tobies        
despite  or due to  this development  there has been a continuous interest in the
 re integration of nonmonotonic features into description logics  in recent years  the advent of several new applications of dls have increased this interest even further  we briefly
discuss two of them  first  dls have become a popular tool for the formalization of biomedc

ical ontologies such as galen  rector   horrocks        and snomed  cote  rothwell 
palotay  beckett    brochu         as argued for example by rector        and stevens
et al          it is important for such ontologies to represent exceptions of the form in
humans  the heart is usually located on the left hand side of the body  in humans with
situs inversus  the heart is located on the right hand side of the body  modelling such
situations requires defeasible inheritance  i e   properties transfer to all instances of a class
by default  but can be explicitly overridden in special cases  mccarthy        horty       
brewka        baader   hollunder      b   the second application is the use of dls as security policy languages  uszok  bradshaw  johnson  jeffers  tate  dalton    aitken

formalizing access control policies  one must deal with the situation where a given request
is neither explicitly allowed nor explicitly denied  then  a default decision has to be taken
such as in open and closed policies  where authorizations are respectively granted or denied
by default  bonatti   samarati         moreover  policies are often formulated incrementally  i e   start with general authorizations for large classes of subjects  objects  and actions 
and then progressively refine them by introducing exceptions for specific subclasses  this
approach is clearly an incarnation of defeasible inheritance 
while the above applications illustrate that integrating nonmonotonic features into dls
is worthwhile  the actual engineering of a computationally well behaved nonmonotonic dl
that provides sufficient expressive power turns out to be a non trivial task  in particular 
combinations of dls and nonmonotonic logics typically involve subtle interactions between
the two component logics and this easily leads to undecidability  it appears that there is no
one optimal way to circumnavigate these difficulties  and thus many different combinations
of dls and nonmonotonic logics have been proposed in the literature  each with individual
strengths and limitations  we provide a survey in section     however  there is a striking
gap  almost all existing approaches are based on default logic and autoepistemic logic  while
circumscription has received very little attention in connection with dls  and the computational properties of dls with circumscription have been almost completely unknown  this
is all the more surprising since circumscription is known to be one of the weakest forms of
nonmonotonic reasoningsee the work by janhunen        for one of the most recent surveys  and the paper by bonatti and eiter        for an expressiveness analysis in terms of
queries  therefore  it is a natural idea to use circumscription for defining a computationally
well behaved  yet expressive dl with nonmonotonic features 
in this paper  we study circumscription  mccarthy        as an alternative approach
to defining nonmonotonic dls  in particular  we define a family of dls with circumscription that enable a natural modelling of defeasible inheritance  our general approach is to
generalize standard dl knowledge bases to circumscribed knowledge bases  ckbs  which 
additionally to a tbox for representing terminological knowledge and an abox for representing knowledge about individuals  are equipped with a circumscription pattern  this
pattern lists predicates  i e   concept and role names  to be minimized in the sense that  in
all admitted models of the ckb  the extension of the listed predicates has to be minimal
w r t  set inclusion  following mccarthy         the minimized predicates can be used as
abnormality predicates that identify instances which are not typical for their class  circumscription patterns can require other predicates to be fixed during minimization  or allow
them to vary freely  mccarthy         a main feature of the dls of our family is that they

come with a built in mechanism for defeasible inheritance  by default  the properties of a
class  humans in the first example above  transfer to each subclass  humans with situs
inversus   but exceptions can be specified based on a priority mechanism  it is well known
that defeasible inheritance with priority cannot be modularly encoded with pure default or
autoepistemic logic  horty         and workarounds such as the explicit listing of exceptions
lead to serious maintainability problems  circumscription lends itself naturally to priorities 
based on circumscription patterns that can express preferences between minimized predicates in terms of a partial ordering  as argued by baader and hollunder      b   such an
approach is well suited to ensure a smooth interplay between defeasible inheritance and dl
subsumption  and thus we prefer it over traditional prioritized circumscription 
to achieve decidability  nonmonotonic dls usually have to adopt suitable restrictions
on the expressive power of the dl component  on non monotonic features  or their interaction  in the case of default logic and autoepistemic logic  a typical restriction concerns
the different treatment of individuals that are explicitly denoted by a constant  and those
that are not  this goes back to reasoning in first order default logic  reiter        and
autoepistemic logic  moore         which also involve tricky technical issues related to the
denotation of individuals  to make reasoning decidable in dls based on default logic  default rules are applied only to the individuals denoted by constants that occur explicitly
in the knowledge base  baader   hollunder      a   but not to unnamed individuals  as
a consequence  named and unnamed individuals are not treated uniformly  in approaches
based on autoepistemic logic  donini  lenzerini  nardi  nutt    schaerf        donini 
nardi    rosati               an alternative solution is to restrict the domain to a fixed  denumerable set of constants  this approach overcomes the different treatment of named and
unnamed individuals since all individuals are named  the flipside is that ad hoc encodings
are required when the domain is finite or the unique name assumption is not enforced  i e  
when different constants are allowed to denote the same individual  in this respect  dls
with circumscription pose no difficulty at all  and named individuals are treated in exactly
the same way as unnamed ones without any assumptions on the domain  at the same
time  we are able to base our nonmonotonic dls on rather expressive dl components such
as alcio and alcqo without losing decidability  however  we cannot do without any
restrictions either  we only allow to fix and minimize concept names during circumscription
and require that all role names vary 
the main contribution of this paper is a detailed analysis of the computational properties
of reasoning with ckbs  we show that  in the expressive dls alcio and alcqo  instance
checking  satisfiability and subsumption are decidable for concept circumscribed kbs in
which only concept names  and no role names  are minimized and fixed  more precisely  we
prove that these reasoning problems are nexpnp  complete  where the lower bound applies
already to concept circumscribed kbs in alc with empty preference relation and without
fixed concept names and     empty tbox or     empty abox and acyclic tbox  in addition 
we show that if a constant bound is imposed on the number of minimized and fixed concept
names  then the complexity drops to npnexp  
the situation is completely different when role names are minimized or fixed  first  the
complexity of reasoning with ckbs formulated in alc with a single fixed role name  empty
tbox  empty preference relation  and no minimized role names turns out to be outside the
analytic hierarchy  and thus very highly undecidable  this result is shown by a reduction

of satisfiability in monadic second order logic  mso  with binary predicates over arbitrary
 i e   not necessarily tree shaped  structures  the reduction does not apply to ckbs in
which role names can be minimized  but not fixed  surprisingly  we find that in this case
reasoning with empty tboxes becomes decidable  and again nexpnp  complete  for dls
between alc and alcqo  and only for alci and its extensions it is undecidable  for all
these logics  however  adding acyclic tboxes leads to undecidability  the reader can find a
table summarising the complexity results in section   
it is interesting to note that our results are somewhat unusual from the perspective of
nmls  first  the arity of predicates has an impact on decidability  fixing concept names
 unary predicates  does not impair decidability  whereas fixing a single role name  binary
predicate  leads to a strong undecidability result  second  the number of predicates that
are minimized or fixed  bounded vs  unbounded  affects the computational complexity of
reasoning  although  as we note in passing  a similar effect can be observed in propositional
logic with circumscription  this has  to the best of our knowledge  never been explicitly
noted 
the paper is organized as follows  in the next section we introduce syntax  semantics 
and reasoning problems for circumscribed kbs  and provide some examples  section  
provides some basic results such as a polynomial simulation of fixed concepts by means of
minimized concepts  a polynomial reduction of reasoning with general tboxes to reasoning with acyclic tboxes  and a polynomial reduction of the simultaneous satisfiability of
multiple ckbs to standard satisfiability  then  section   proves the decidability and complexity results for concept circumscribed knowledge bases  fixed and minimized roles are
considered in sections   and    respectively  section   discusses related work  and section  
concludes the paper by summarizing the main results and pointing out some interesting

   description logics and circumscription
in dls  concepts are inductively defined with the help of a set of constructors  starting with
a set nc of concept names  a set nr of role names  and  possibly  a set ni of individual
   

fithe complexity of circumscription in dls

names  all countably infinite   we use the term predicates to refer to elements of nc  nr  
the concepts of the expressive dl alcqio are formed using the constructors shown in
figure   
there  the inverse role constructor is a role constructor  whereas the remaining six
constructors are concept constructors  in figure   and throughout this paper  we use  s
to denote the cardinality of a set s  a and b to denote individual names  r and s to denote
roles  i e   role names and inverses thereof   a  b to denote concept names  and c  d to
denote  possibly complex  concepts  as usual  we use   as abbreviation for an arbitrary
 but fixed  propositional tautology   for     and  for the usual boolean abbreviations 
r c  existential restriction  for      r c   and r c  universal restriction  for      r c  
in this paper  we will not be concerned with alcqio itself  but with several of its
fragments   the basic such fragment allows only for negation  conjunction  disjunction 
and universal and existential restrictions  and is called alc  the availability of additional
constructors is indicated by concatenation of a corresponding letter  q stands for number restrictions  i stands for inverse roles  and o for nominals  this explains the name
alcqio  and also allows us to refer to fragments such as alcio  alcqo  and alcqi 
the semantics of alcqio concepts is defined in terms of an interpretation i  
i
    i    the domain i is a non empty set of individuals and the interpretation function i maps each concept name a  nc to a subset ai of i   each role name r  nr to a
binary relation ri on i   and each individual name a  ni to an individual ai  i   the
extension of i to inverse roles and arbitrary concepts is inductively defined as shown in the
third column of figure    an interpretation i is called a model of a concept c if c i     
if i is a model of c  we also say that c is satisfied by i 
a  general  tbox is a finite set of concept implications  cis  c v d where c and d are
 
concepts  as usual  we use c   d as an abbreviation for c v d and d v c  an abox is
a finite set of concept assertions c a  and role assertions r a  b   where a  b are individual
names  r is a role name  and c is a concept  an interpretation i satisfies  i  a ci c v d
if c i  di    ii  an assertion c a  if ai  c i   and  iii  an assertion r a  b  if  ai   bi    ri  
then  i is a model of a tbox t if it satisfies all implications in t   and a model of an abox
a if it satisfies all assertions in a 
an important class of tboxes are acyclic tboxes  call a tbox t acyclic if it is a set
 
of concept definitions a   c  where a is a concept name and the following two conditions
hold 
 no concept name occurs more than once on the left hand side of a definition in t  
 
 the relation t   defined by setting a t b iff a   c  t and b occurs in c  is
well founded 
   the reason that we do not consider alcqio in this paper is that it does not have the finite model
property  i e   there are satisfiable concepts that are not satisfiable in finite models  our proofs of the
complexity upper bounds assume the finite model property and  therefore  do not work for alcqio  investigating circumscription for description logics without the finite model property remains an interesting
open problem

    circumscription  varying predicates  and partial priority ordering
circumscription is a logical approach suitable for modelling what normally or typically
holds  and thus admits the modeling of defeasible inheritance  mccarthy        lifschitz 
       the idea is to define  in a standard first order language  both domain knowledge and
so called abnormality predicates that identify instances of a class that violate the normal or
typical properties of that class  to capture the intuition that abnormality is exceptional 
inference is not based on the set of all models of the resulting theory as in classical logic 
but rather restricted to those models where the extension of the abnormality predicates is
minimal with respect to set inclusion  intuitively  this means that reasoning is based only
on models that are as normal as possible  since such models are classical models of the
given knowledge base  all classical first order inferences are valid in circumscription  but
additional inferences may become possible  
since description logics are fragments of first order logic  circumscription can be readily
applied  using alc syntax  we can assert that mammals normally inhabitate land  and
that whales do not live on land 
mammal v habitat land t abmammal
whale v mammal u habitat land
the upper inclusion states that any mammal not inhabitating land is an abnormal mammal 
thus satisfying the abnormality predicate abmammal   when applying circumscription to the
above tbox  we should thus only consider models where the extension of abmammal is minimal 
however  there is more than one way of defining such preferred models because each nonminimized predicate can be treated in two different ways during minimization  we may
either fix its extension or let it vary freely 
intuitively  fixed predicates retain their classical semantics while varying predicates may
be affected by minimization  as a concrete example  consider once more the above tbox
and assume that all non minimized predicates are fixed  then we can derive the following
subsumptions 
whale v abmammal
  
 
abmammal   mammal u habitat land 
here  whale v abmammal and abmammal w mammal u habitat land are classical consequences
of the tbox  the minimization of abmammal adds only the inclusion abmammal v mammal u
habitat land 
to further analyze fixed predicates  suppose that we explicitly introduce a concrete
mammal that is not a whale by adding an abox assertion
mammal u whale flipper 
we might expect that we can derive habitat land flipper   but actually that is not the
case  to see this  observe that there is a classical model of the knowledge base that falsifies
habitat land flipper   the extension of the fixed predicates habitat and land are not
affected by minimization  so habitat land flipper  must still be false after minimization 
the same argument can be applied to the negation of habitat land flipper   which is
thus also not derivable  what we have just seen is that if a sentence uses only fixed
   

fithe complexity of circumscription in dls

predicates  then it is a consequence of a circumscribed knowledge base if  and only if  it is
a classical consequence of the knowledge base 
now assume that we let the role habitat and the concept name land vary freely  and fix
only mammal and whale  in view of the concept inclusion for mammal in our original tbox 
this setup may be interpreted as expressing that it is very unlikely for a mammal not to
live on land  we are willing to modify the extension of habitat and land in order to avoid
abnormality  we obtain an additional consequence  namely 
 
whale   abmammal  
  
to see that this is indeed a consequence note that  during minimization  we can  i  make
land non empty and  ii  for any mammal m that is not a whale  ensure that m is not
an abmammal by linking it via habitat to the generated instance of land   intuitively  the
equality    can be seen as reflecting the unlikeliness of being abnormal  a mammal is only
abnormal if there is a reason  and the only reason that we have captured in our knowledge
base is being a whale 
let us now return to the assertion mammal u whale flipper   by applying classical
reasoning to    and     we derive whale w mammal u habitat land  i e   whales are
the only mammals that do not live on land   thus we can now derive the expected conclusion habitat land flipper   in summary  by turning habitat and land into varying
predicates  we have obtained a more natural modelling in which the habitat attribute of
mammals can be forced to its default value 
driving our example further  we might now consider whales abnormal to such a degree
that we do not believe they exist unless there is evidence that they do  then we should 
additionally  let whale vary freely  the result is that    and    can still be derived  and
additionally we obtain the consequence
 
 
whale   abmammal    
we can then use an abox to add evidence that whales exist  e g  through the assertion
whale mobydick   as expected  the result of this change is that
 
 
whale   abmammal    mobydick  
evidence for the existence of another  anonymous whale could be generated by adding the
abox assertion male mobydick  and the tbox statement
whale v mother  whale u male 
with mother and male varying freely  this knowledge base classically entails that there exist
two whales  satisfying male and male  respectively  the former is denoted by mobydick 
while the latter is not denoted by any abox individual  which corresponds to a first order
constant   after minimization  whale contains exactly those two individuals 
in general  the appropriate combination of fixed and varying predicates depends on the
application  therefore  we adhere to standard circumscription and give users the freedom
to choose which predicates are minimized  fixed  and varying 
   indeed  this is the only reason to let land vary  to ensure that it can be made non empty during
minimization

as another example  consider the sentences  in humans  the heart is usually located
on the left hand side of the body  in humans with situs inversus  the heart is located on the
right hand side of the body  they can be axiomatized as follows 
human v has heart has position  left  t abhuman
situs inversus v has heart has position  right 
has heart has position  left  u has heart has position  right  v   
the predicate abhuman represents abnormal humans and should be minimized  if humans
with situs inversus are to be restricted to those individuals that are explicitly declared to
have this property  then by analogy with the previous example the roles specifying heart
position and the class of exceptional individuals situs inversus should be allowed to vary
while human can be fixed and retain its classical semantics  as a result and in the absence of
any further axioms  abhuman and situs inversus are empty in all minimized models  the
additional axiom has friend situs inversus john  turns abhuman and situs inversus
into a singleton set containing an anonymous individual  though in some models  it may be
john himself   as an example for a nonclassical consequence  consider 
human u situs inversus v has heart has position  left   
that is  all humans have the default heart position with the only exception of those that are
explicitly declared to have situs inversus 
it has been extensively argued  mccarthy        horty        brewka        baader  
hollunder      b  that there is an interplay between subsumption and abnormality predicates that should be addressed in nonmonotonic dls  consider  for example  the following
tbox 
user
staff
staff
blacklistedstaff

v
v
v
v

hasaccessto  confidentialfile  t abuser
user
hasaccessto  confidentialfile  t abstaff
staff u hasaccessto  confidentialfile 

to get models that are as normal as possible  as a first attempt we could minimize the
two abnormality predicates abuser and abstaff in parallel  assume that hasaccessto is
varying  and user  staff  and blacklistedstaff are fixed  then  the result of parallel
minimization is that staff members may or may not have access to confidential files  with
equal preference  in the first case  they are abnormal users  and in the second case  they
are abnormal staff  however  one may argue that the first option should be preferred  since
staff v user  but not the other way round   the normality information for staff is more
specific than the normality information for users and should have higher priority  such effects are well known also from the propositional first order case and indeed  circumscription
has soon after its introduction been extended with priorities to address issues of specificity
 mccarthy        
in our formalism  users can specify priorities between minimized predicates  typically 
these priorities will reflect the subsumption hierarchy  as computed w r t  the class of all
models   since the subsumption hierarchy is in general a partial order  the priorities between
minimized predicates may form a partial order  too  this approach is analogous to partially
   

fithe complexity of circumscription in dls

ordering priorities on default rules  as proposed by brewka         it is more general
than standard prioritized circumscription  which assumes a total ordering  mccarthy       
lifschitz         and a special case of nested circumscription  lifschitz        
    circumscribed knowledge bases
to define dls with circumscription  we start by introducing circumscription patterns  they
describe how individual predicates are treated during minimization 
definition    circumscription pattern   cp   a circumscription pattern is a tuple cp
of the form    m  f  v    where  is a strict partial order over m   and m   f   and v
are mutually disjoint subsets of nc  nr   the minimized  fixed  and varying predicates 
respectively  by   we denote the reflexive closure of   define a preference relation  cp
on interpretations by setting i  cp j iff the following conditions hold 
   i   j and  for all a  ni   ai   aj  
   for all p  f   pi   pj  
   for all p  m   if pi   pj then there exists q  m   q  p  such that q i  q j  
   there exists p  m such that pi  pj and for all q  m such that q  p  q i   q j  
when m  f  nc  i e   the minimized and fixed predicates are all concepts  we call
   m  f  v   a concept circumscription pattern 
 
we use the term concept circumscription if only concept circumscription patterns are admitted  based on circumscription patterns  we can define circumscribed dl knowledge
bases and their models 
definition    circumscribed kb  a circumscribed knowledge base  ckb  is an expression circcp  t   a   where t is a tbox  a an abox  and cp      m  f  v   a circumscription pattern such that m  f  v partition the predicates used in t and a  an interpretation
i is a model of circcp  t   a  if it is a model of t and a and there exists no model i   of t
and a such that i    cp i 
a ckb circcp  t   a  is called a concept circumscribed kb if cp is a concept circumscription pattern 
 
note that partially ordered circumscription becomes standard parallel circumscription if
the empty relation is used for  
the main reasoning tasks for  non circumscribed  kbs are satisfiability of concepts
w r t  kbs  subsumption w r t  kbs  and instance checking w r t  kbs  these reasoning
tasks are fundamental for circumscribed kbs as well  we now provide precise definitions
of these tasks  throughout this and the following section  dl denotes the set of dls

satisfies c i      let l  dl  the satisfiability problem w r t  ckbs in l is defined
as follows  given a concept c in l and a ckb circcp  t   a  in l  decide whether c
is satisfiable w r t  circcp  t   a  
 a concept c is subsumed by a concept d w r t  a ckb circcp  t   a   in symbols

the subsumption problem w r t  ckbs in l is defined as follows  given concepts c

 an individual name a is an instance of a concept c w r t  a ckb circcp  t   a   in

concept c in l  an individual name a  and a ckb circcp  t   a  in l  decide whether
circcp  t   a     c a  
 
these reasoning problems can be polynomially reduced to one another  first  c is satisfiable
w r t  circcp  t   a  iff circcp  t   a      c v   and circcp  t   a     c v d iff c u d
is not satisfiable w r t  circcp  t   a   and second  c is satisfiable w r t  circcp  t   a  iff
circcp  t   a      c a   where a is an individual name not appearing in t and a  conversely 
we have circcp  t   a     c a  iff auc is not satisfiable w r t  circcp   t   a a a     where
a is a concept name not occurring in t and a  and cp  is obtained from cp by adding a
to m  and leaving  as it is   in this paper  we use satisfiability w r t  ckbs as the basic
reasoning problem 

   basic reductions
we present three basic reductions between reasoning problems for circumscribed knowledge
bases that are interesting in their own right and  additionally  will be useful for establishing
the main results of this paper later on  more precisely  we replay a well known reduction of
fixed predicates to minimized predicates in the context of dls  reduce reasoning w r t  ckbs
with general tboxes to reasoning w r t  ckbs with acyclic tboxes  and show that  under
certain conditions  simultaneous satisfiability w r t  a collection of ckbs is reducible to
satisfiability w r t  a single ckb 
    fixed and minimized concepts
in circumscription  it is folklore that fixed predicates can be simulated in terms of minimized
predicates  see e g  de kleer         in the case of dls  the same simulation is possible
for concept names  to see this  let c  be a concept and circcp  t   a  a circumscribed

fithe complexity of circumscription in dls

it is not difficult to see that c  is satisfiable w r t  circcp  t   a  iff it is satisfiable w r t 
circcp   t     a   thus  we get the following result 
lemma   let l  dl  then satisfiability w r t   concept  circumscribed kbs in l can be
polynomially reduced to satisfiability w r t   concept  circumscribed kbs in l that have no
fixed concept names 
in contrast to concept names  fixed role names cannot be reduced to minimized role names
since boolean operators on roles are not available in standard dls such as alcqio  a
proof is given in section    where we show that  in some cases  reasoning with minimized
role names is decidable  whereas the corresponding reasoning task for ckbs with fixed role
names is undecidable 
the reduction above clearly relies on tboxes  however  in this paper we will sometimes
work with circumscribed kbs in which the tbox is empty  the following lemma  proved in
the appendix  shows that for ckbs in alc without fixed role names and with empty tbox 
one can simulate fixed concept names using minimized concept names without introducing
a tbox  the proof  which may be viewed as a much more careful version of the proof of
lemma    can be adapted to yield an analogous result for the other logics in dl 
lemma   in alc  satisfiability w r t   concept  circumscribed kbs with empty tbox and
without fixed roles can be polynomially reduced to satisfiability w r t   concept  circumscribed
kbs with empty tbox and without fixed predicates 
    acyclic and general tboxes
for many dls  satisfiability w r t   non circumscribed  kbs with general tboxes is harder
than satisfiability w r t   non circumscribed  kbs with acyclic tboxes  in the case of alc 
alci  alcq  and alcqo  the latter problem is pspace complete  baader  mcguiness 
nardi    patel schneider        baader  milicic  lutz  sattler    wolter      b  y  ding
  wu        while the former is exptime complete  baader et al          the only
dls considered in this paper for which satisfiability is exptime hard already with acyclic
tboxes are alcio and its extensions  areces  blackburn    marx         we show that 
for circumscribed kbs  there is no difference in computational complexity between acyclic
and general tboxes 
let c  be a concept and circcp  t   a  a ckb with cp      m  f  v    we may assume
 
without loss of generality that t        c  for some concept c   to see this  observe that
 
axioms c v d are equivalent to     c t d   define
 
 
 
 
 an acyclic tbox t      a   c  b   u a  a    a  b     b   where a  b  a    b     u
are new concept and role names not occurring in t   a  m   f   v   and c   
 a circumscription pattern cp       m     f  v      where m     m   a    b     and v    
v   a  b  u  
we will ad b   conjunctively to c  and thus be interested in models of circcp   t     a  where
 b    i      in such models  we have ai   i  and thus c i   i   since  otherwise  we
can turn each instance d of b   into an instance of b   by making d an instance of b and

linking it via the role u to an instance of a  thus obtaining a more preferred model w r t 
 cp    this is the basis of the proof of the following lemma  given in the appendix 
lemma   c  is satisfiable w r t  circcp  t   a  iff c  ub   is satisfiable w r t  circcp   t     a  
thus  we have obtained the following result 
proposition   let l  dl  satisfiability w r t   concept  circumscribed kbs in l can be
polynomially reduced to satisfiability w r t   concept  circumscribed kbs in l with acyclic
tboxes and without changing the abox 
this shows that satisfiability w r t  ckbs with acyclic tboxes is of the same complexity as
satisfiability w r t  ckbs with general tboxes  in many cases considered in this paper  the
same is even true for ckbs with empty tboxes  c f  section    however  we also identify
cases where ckbs with non empty tboxes have higher complexity  see theorems    and     
and thus a general reduction as the one underlying proposition   cannot exist for the case
of empty tboxes 
    simultaneous satisfiability
in applications  it is often necessary to merge tboxes  aboxes  and whole knowledge bases
by taking their union  we show that  under certain conditions  reasoning w r t  the union
of several circumscribed kbs can be reduced to reasoning w r t  the component ckbs  a
concept c is simultaneously satisfiable w r t  ckbs circcp   t    a             circcpk  tk   ak   if
there exists an interpretation i that is a model of all the ckbs and satisfies c i     
the following lemma says that simultaneous satisfiability can be polynomially reduced to
satisfiability w r t  a single ckb if there are no two ckbs that share a role name 
the proof idea for the case k     is as follows  given circcp   t    a    and circcp   t    a    
we first take the union of these two ckbs  replacing in circcp   t    a    each concept name
a that is also used in circcp   t    a    with a fresh concept name a    we then introduce an
additional concept name p  for problem  and make sure that p is satisfied by each abox
individual whenever there is a point in the model where the interpretation of a and a 
disagrees  we then look for a model where p is not satisfied in the abox  intuitively  the
additional concept name p satisfies the purpose of decoupling a and a    which is important
e g  in the case where a a  is minimized both in circcp   t    a    and circcp   t    a     details
are given in the appendix 
lemma   for all l  dl  simultaneous satisfiability w r t   concept  circumscribed kbs
circcp   t    a           circcpk  tk   ak    such that circcpi  ti   ai   and circcpj  tj   aj   share no
role names for    i   j  k  can be reduced in polynomial time to satisfiability w r t  single
 concept  circumscribed kbs 

   the complexity of reasoning in concept circumscribed kbs
the main contributions of this paper consist in  i  showing that  in many cases  reasoning
with circumscribed knowledge bases is decidable  and  ii  performing a detailed analysis
   

fithe complexity of circumscription in dls

of the computational complexity of these decidable cases  in this section  we show that
satisfiability w r t  concept circumscribed kbs is nexpnp  complete for the dl alc and
its extensions alcio and alcqo  we also show that it is npnexp  complete if the number
of fixed and minimized concept names is bounded by a constant  we first present proofs of
the upper bounds and then establish matching lower bounds 
    upper bounds
we start with the general case in which there is no bound on the number of fixed and
minimized predicates 
      the general case
we prepare the upper bound proof by showing that if a concept is satisfiable w r t  a
concept circumscribed kb  then it is satisfiable in a model of bounded size  we use  c  to
denote the length of the concept c  i e  
p the number of  occurrences of  symbols needed to
write c  the size  t   of a tbox t is cvdt  c     d   and the size  a  of an abox a is
the sum of the sizes of all assertions in a  where the size of each role assertion is   and the
size of concept assertions c a  is  c  
lemma   let c  be a concept  circcp  t   a  a concept circumscribed kb  and n     c     
 t      a   if c  is satisfiable w r t  circcp  t   a   then the following holds 
 i  if t   a and c  are formulated in alcio  then c  is satisfied in a model i of
circcp  t   a  with  i    n  
 ii  if t   a and c  are formulated in alcqo and m is the maximal parameter occurring in a number restriction in t   a  or c    then c  is satisfied in a model i of
circcp  t   a  with  i    n   m       n 
proof  let cp  t   a  and c  be as in lemma    we may assume that a    as every
assertion c a  can be expressed as an implication  a  v c  and every assertion r a  b  can
be expressed as  a  v r  b   denote by cl c  t   the smallest set of concepts that contains
all subconcepts of c  all subconcepts of concepts appearing in t   and is closed under single
negations  i e   if d  cl c  t   and d does not start with   then d  cl c  t    
let i be a common model of c  and circcp  t   a   and let d   c i   define an equivalence relation  on i by setting d  d  iff
 c  cl c    t     d  c i      c  cl c    t     d   c i   
we use  d  to denote the equivalence class of d  i w r t  the  relation  pick from each
equivalence class  d  exactly one member and denote the resulting subset of i by    
we first prove point  i   thus  assume that t and c  are formulated in alcio  we
define a new interpretation j as follows

the following claim is easily proved using induction on the structure of c 
claim  for all c  cl c    t   and all d  i   we have d  c i iff d   c j for the element

thus  j is a model of t satisfying c    to show that j is a model of circcp  t   a   it thus

claim  for all concepts c  cl c    t   and all d  i   we have d  c i iff d   c j for the
element d    d  from j  
 

 

it follows that i   is a model of t   observe that ai fi ai iff aj fi aj for each concept

i    cp i follows from j    cp j   we have derived a contradiction and conclude that j is
a model of circcp  t   a   thus we are done since the size of j is bounded by   n

it is interesting to note that the proof of lemma   does not go through if role names are
minimized or fixed  this problem cannot be overcome  as proved by the undecidability
results presented in sections   and   
using the bounded model property just established  we can now prove decidability
of reasoning with concept circumscribed kbs formulated in alcio and alcqo  more
precisely  lemma   suggests a non deterministic decision procedure for satisfiability w r t 
concept circumscription patterns  simply guess an interpretation of bounded size and then
check whether it is a model  it turns out that this procedure shows containment of satisfiability in the complexity class nexpnp   which contains those problems that can be solved
by a non deterministic exponentially time bounded turing machine that has access to an
np oracle  it is known that nexp  nexpnp  expspace 
theorem    in alcio and alcqo  it is in nexpnp to decide whether a concept is
satisfiable w r t  a concept circumscribed kb circcp  t   a  
proof  it is not hard to see that there exists an np algorithm that takes as input a
ckb circcp  t   a  and a finite interpretation i  and checks whether i is not a model of
circcp  t   a   the algorithm first verifies in polynomial time whether i is a model of t and
a  answering yes if this is not the case  otherwise  the algorithm guesses an interpretation
j that has the same domain as i and interprets all individual names in the same way  and
then checks whether  i  j is a model of t and a  and  ii  j  cp i  it answers yes if
both checks succeed  and no otherwise  clearly  checking whether j  cp i can be done
in time polynomial w r t  the size of j and i 
this np algorithm may now be used as an oracle in a nexp algorithm for deciding
satisfiability of a concept c  w r t  a ckb circcp  t   a   by lemma    it suffices to guess
an interpretation of size   k with k    c       t      a    and then use the np algorithm
to check whether i is a model of circcp  t   a   this proves that concept satisfiability is in
nexpnp  
o
   the bound   k clearly dominates the two bounds given in parts  i  and  ii  of lemma   

   

fibonatti  lutz    wolter

by the reductions given in section    theorem    yields co nexpnp upper bounds for
subsumption and the instance problem  we will show in section     that these upper
bounds are tight 
      bounded number of minimized and fixed predicates
since nexpnp is a rather large complexity class  it is a natural question whether we can
impose restrictions on concept circumscription such that reasoning becomes simpler  in the
following  we identify such a case by considering concept circumscribed kbs in which the
number of minimized and fixed concept names is bounded by some constant  in this case  the
complexity of satisfiability w r t  concept circumscribed kbs drops to npnexp   for readers
uninitiated to oracle complexity classes  we recall that nexp  npnexp  nexpnp   and
that npnexp is believed to be much less powerful than nexpnp   see for example the work
by eiter et al         
to prove the npnexp upper bound  we first introduce counting formulas as a common
generalization of tboxes and aboxes 
definition     counting formula  a counting formula  is a boolean combination of
concept implications  abox assertions c a   and cardinality assertions  c   n  where c
is a concept and n a non negative integer  we use      and  to denote the boolean
operators of counting formulas  an interpretation i satisfies a cardinality assertion  c   n 
if  c i   n  the satisfaction relation i     between models i and counting formulas  is
defined in the obvious way 
 
in the following  we assume that the integers occurring in cardinality assertions are coded
in binary  the npnexp algorithm to be devised will use an algorithm for satisfiability of
 non circumscribed  counting formulas as an oracle  therefore  we should first determine
the computational complexity of the latter  it follows from results by tobies        that 
in alc  satisfiability of counting formulas is nexp hard  a matching upper bound for
the dls alcio and alcqo is obtained from the facts that  i  there is a polynomial
translation of counting formulas formulated in these languages into c   the two variable
fragment of first order logic extended with counting quantifiers  gradel  otto    rosen 
      pacholski  szwast    tendera         and  ii  satisfiability in c  is in nexp even if
the numbers in counting quantifiers are coded in binary  pratt hartmann        
theorem     tobies  pratt  in alc  alcio and alcqo  satisfiability of counting
formulas is nexp complete even if numbers in number restrictions are coded in binary 
we now establish the improved upper bound 
theorem    let c be a constant  in alcio and alcqo  it is in npnexp to decide satisfiability w r t  concept circumscribed kbs circcp  t   a   where cp      m  f  v   is such
that  m  c and  f  c

proof  assume that we want to decide satisfiability of the concept c  w r t  the ckb
circcp  t   a   where cp      m  f  v   with  m  c and  f  c  by lemma    we
may assume that f     we may have to increase the constant c appropriately   we
may assume without loss of generality that the cardinality of m is exactly c  thus  let
m    a            ac    by lemma    c  is satisfiable w r t  circcp  t   a  iff there exists a

as c is constant  the number  c of such concepts is constant as well  clearly  the sets csi  
s  m   form a partition of the domain i of any model i  introduce  for each concept
name b and role name r in t  a  a fresh concept name b   and a fresh role name r   
respectively  for a concept c  denote by c   the result of replacing in c each concept name
b and role name r with b   and r    respectively  the primed versions a  and t   of a and
t are defined analogously  denote by n the set of individual names in t  a   c    
the nexp oracle we are going to use in our algorithm checks whether a counting formula

   the algorithm states that c  is satisfiable in a model of circcp  t   a  if  and only if 
  is satisfiable and   is not satisfiable 
using the fact that c is fixed  is is not hard to verify that this is a npnexp  algorithm  it
remains to show correctness and completeness 
suppose that there exists a model of circcp  t   a  satisfying c    then there is such a
model i of size bounded by   k   let the algorithm guess

exists a model j satisfying     by the definitions of   and     we may assume that
 i   j  
 ai   aj for all a  m  
 ai   aj for all individual names a 
moreover  as no unprimed role names occur in   and the only unprimed concept names in
  are those in m   we may assume that the interpretation of all unprimed concept and role
names in i and j coincide  thus  j is a model of circcp  t   a  satisfying c    but now
define a model j   with domain j by setting
 

 aj   aj   for all individual names a 
 

 rj    r   j   for all role names r 
 

 aj    a   j   for all concept names a 
then  by the conjunct under item   of the definition of     j   is a model for a  t   by
items   and   of the definition of     j    cp j   and we have derived a contradiction 
conversely  suppose the algorithm says that there exists a model of circcp  t   a  satisfying c    then take a model i for     by the conjunct under item   of     i is a model
for t  a satisfying c    it follows from the unsatisfiability of   that i is a model for

fithe complexity of circumscription in dls

as a corollary  we obtain co npnexp upper bounds for subsumption and the instance problem  a similar drop of complexity occurs in propositional logic  where satisfiability w r t 
circumscribed theories is complete for npnp and it is not difficult to see that bounding the
minimized and fixed predicates allows us to find a pnp algorithm 
    lower bounds
we prove lower complexity bounds for reasoning with concept circumscribed kbs that
match the upper bounds given in section     
      the general case
as in section      we start with the general case in which the number of fixed and minimized
predicates is not bounded  our aim is to establish two nexpnp  lower bounds that both
match the upper bound established in theorem     the first bound is for satisfiability w r t 
concept circumscribed kbs that are formulated in alc and have an empty tbox  but a nonempty abox  the second bound is also for satisfiability w r t  concept circumscribed kbs
formulated in alc  but assumes an acyclic tbox and empty abox  both reductions work
already in the case of an empty preference relation  and without any fixed predicates  note
that considering satisfiability of a concept c w r t  a concept circumscribed kb circcp  t   a 
with both t and a empty is not very interesting  it can be seen that c is satisfiable w r t 
circcp  t   a  iff c is satisfiable  without reference to any kb   where c is the concept
obtained from c by replacing all minimized concept names with  
the proof of our first result is by reduction of a succinct version of the problem cocert col  which is nexpnp  complete  eiter  gottlob    mannila         to satisfiability
w r t  concept circumscribed kbs with empty tbox  let us first introduce the regular  nonsuccinct  version of co cert col 
instance of size n  an undirected graph g on the vertices                n     such that every
edge is labelled with a disjunction of two literals over the boolean variables  vi j   i  j   n  
yes instance of size n  an instance g of size n such that  for some truth value assignment
t to the boolean variables  the graph t g  obtained from g by including only those edges
whose label evaluates to true under t is not   colorable 
as shown by stewart         co cert col is complete for npnp   to obtain a problem
complete for nexpnp   eiter et al  use the complexity upgrade technique  by encoding the
input in a succinct form using boolean circuits  the complexity is raised by one exponential
to nexpnp  eiter et al          more precisely  the succinct version co cert cols of
co cert col is obtained by representing the input graph g with nodes              n    
as  n     boolean circuits with  n inputs  and one output  each  the boolean circuits are
   
   
 i 
named ce   cs   cs   and cj   with i               and j   n  for all circuits  the  n inputs
are the bits of the binary representation of two nodes of the graph  the purpose of the
circuits is as follows 
 circuit ce outputs   if there is an edge between the two input nodes  and   otherwise 
   

 if there is an edge between the input nodes  circuit cs outputs   if the first literal
   
in the disjunction labelling this edge is positive  and   otherwise  circuit cs does the
   

fibonatti  lutz    wolter

same for the second literal  if there is no edge between the input nodes  the output is
arbitrary

 if there is an edge between the input nodes  the circuits cj compute the labelling

circuit cj outputs the j th bit of ki   if there is no edge between the input nodes  the

we reduce co cert cols to satisfiability w r t  concept circumscribed kbs that are formulated in alc and whose tbox and preference relation are empty  it then remains to
apply lemma   to eliminate fixed concept names  we note that the construction in the
proof of the lemma leaves the preference relation untouched   let
   

   

 i 

g    n  ce   cs   cs    cj  i         j n  
be the  succinct representation of the  input graph with  n nodes  we construct an abox
ag    c  u root a      a circumscription pattern cpg   and a concept cg such that g is a
yes instance of co cert cols iff cg is satisfiable w r t  circcpg    ag   
the concept c  used in ag is a conjunction whose presentation is split into two parts 
intuitively  the purpose of the first group of conjuncts is to fix a truth assignment t for
the variables  vi j   i  j   n   and to construct  an isomorphic image of  the graph t g 
obtained from g by including only those edges whose label evaluates to true under t  then 
the purpose of the second group is to make sure that t g  is not   colorable 
when formulating c    we use several binary counters for counting modulo  n  the
number of nodes in the input graph   the main counters x and y use concept names
x            xn  and y            yn  as their bits  respectively  additionally  we introduce concept
 i 
 i 
names k            kn    i                that serve as four additional counters k               k      
the first group of conjuncts of c  can be found in figure    where the following abbreviations
are used 
 ri  c denotes the n fold nesting r      r c 
 r  k  i    x  is an abbreviation for

u

j n

 i 
 i  
 xj  r kj   u  xj  r kj   and

similarly for r  k  i    y   
 the abbreviations wc   c a boolean circuit  are explained later on 
the intuition behind figure   is as follows  lines     to     build up a binary tree of depth
 n whose edges are labeled with the role name r  the   n leaves of the tree are instances
of the concept name leaf  and they are labeled with all possible values of the counters x
and y   since we will minimize leaf via the circumscription pattern cpg   this concept name
denotes precisely the leaves of the tree  due to the use of the counters x and y   the leaves
are all distinct 
the leaves of the tree just established satisfy a number of purposes  to start with 
each leaf with counter values x   i and y   j corresponds to the variable vi j of co certcols and determines a truth value for this variable via truth falsity of the concept

additionally to representing a variable  a leaf with x   i and y   j corresponds to the
potential edge between the nodes i and j  to explain this more properly  we must first
discuss the abbreviations wc used in lines     and     of figure   
each concept wc   c a boolean circuit with  n inputs  is the result of converting c into a
concept that uses only the constructors   u  t such that the following condition is satisfied 
if a d  i is an instance of wc   the output of c upon input b            b n  is b  and the truth
value of the concept names x            xn    y            yn  at d is described by b            b n   
then the truth value of some concept name out at d is described by b  by introducing one
auxiliary concept name for every inner gate of c  the translation can be done such that the
size of wc is linear in the size of c  the following concept names are used as output 
 wce uses the concept name e as output

figure    the second group of conjuncts of c   
lines     and     ensure that these concepts are propagated to all leaves  our next aim is to
ensure that each leaf that represents a potential edge  i  j  is connected via the role var  to
the leaf that represents the variable in the first disjunct of the label of  i  j   and analogously
for the role var  and the variable in the second disjunct of the edge label  if we replaced
the concept name leaffix with leaf in lines     and      then these lines would apparently
encode these properties  however  we have to be careful as the mentioned replacement
would interact with the minimization of leaf  to fix this problem  we resort to a trick  we
use the concept name leaffix instead of leaf  in this way  we may or may not reach an
instance of leaf  if we do not  we force the concept name p to be true at the root of the
tree in lines      and       we will use cg to rule out models in which p is true  finally 
we fix leaffix via cpg to eliminate interaction with the minimization of leaf 
the remaining lines      to      ensure that a leaf is an instance of elim iff the potential
edge that it represents is not present in the graph t g  induced by the truth assignment t
described by the leaves 
the second group of conjuncts of c  can be found in figure    here   y      stands
for the concept  y  u    u yn     as already mentioned  the purpose of these conjuncts
is to ensure that the graph t g  described by the leaves does not have a   coloring  the
strategy for ensuring this is as follows  we use the  n leaves with y     to store the colors
of the nodes  i e   the leaf with x   i and y     stores the color of node i  by lines     
and       there is a unique coloring  then  lines      to      ensure that each leaf  viewed
as an edge  is connected via the role col  to the leaf that stores the color of the first node
of the edge  and analogously for the role col  and the second node of the edge  leaffix and
p have the same role as before  lines      to      guarantee that the concept name clash
identifies problems in the coloring  a leaf is in clash if it represents an edge that exists
in g  is not dropped in t g   and where both endpoints have the same color  the idea
is that clash will be minimized while r  g  and b vary  when some additional concept
names are fixed  this corresponds to a universal quantification over all possible colorings

set cg   root u p u r n  clash  and recall that ag    c  u root a      the following
lemma is proved in the appendix 
lemma    g is a yes instance of co  certcols iff cg is satisfiable with respect to
circcpg    ag    where cpg      m  f  v   with      m    root  leaf  clash  
f    leaffix  tr  x            xn    y            yn      
and v the set of all remaining predicates in ag  
since the size of ag is polynomial in n  we get the following result by applying lemma   
theorem    in alc  satisfiability w r t  concept circumscribed kbs is nexpnp  hard even
if the tbox and the preference relation are empty and there are no fixed predicates 
it is now rather straightforward to establish the announced second nexpnp lower bound by
a reduction of satisfiability w r t  concept circumscribed kbs in the special case formulated
in theorem     details are given in the appendix 
corollary    in alc  satisfiability w r t  concept circumscribed kbs is nexpnp  hard
even if the tbox is acyclic  the abox and preference relations are empty  and there are no
fixed predicates 
corresponding lower bounds for subsumption and the instance problems follow from the
reduction given in section   
      bounded number of minimized and fixed predicates
we now establish a matching lower bound for theorem    by showing that  in alc  satisfiability w r t  concept circumscribed kbs is npnexp  hard even if only a constant number
of predicates is allowed to be minimized and fixed  in contrast to the previous section 
we ignore the case of empty tboxes and directly establish the lower bound for the case
of non empty tboxes and empty aboxes  this allows us to demonstrate the usefulness of
lemma   for separating different parts of a lower bound proof  in the main reduction from
the previous section  the two parts of the reduction shown in figure   and   are not truly
independent  which forced us to implement the technical trick that involves the concept
names leaffix and p   when using lemma    in contrast  we achieve a true separation of
concerns  in general  though  we conjecture that the lower bound proved in this section can
also be established for the case of empty tboxes by adapting the mentioned technical trick 
we leave this as a problem to the interested reader 
recall that a  non deterministic  k tape turing machine is described by a tuple
 q    q      qacc   qrej   
with q a finite set of states   a finite alphabet  q   q a starting state 
  q  k  q  k   l  r k
a transition relation  and qacc   qrej  q the accepting and rejecting states  for our purposes 
an oracle turing machine is a   tape turing machine m that  additionally  is equipped
with
   

fibonatti  lutz    wolter

 a   tape turing machine m   the oracle  whose alphabet is identical to that of m 
 a query state q    and
 two answer states qyes and qno  
the second tape of m is called the oracle tape  when m enters q    the oracle determines the
next state of m  if the content of the oracle tape is contained in the language accepted by
the oracle  the next state is qyes   otherwise  it is qno   during this transition  the head is not
moved and no symbols are written  the state q  cannot occur as the left most component
of a tuple in ms transition relation 
let m    q    q      qacc   qrej   m    q    qyes   qno   be an oracle turing machine such that
the following holds 
 m solves an npnexp  complete problem 
 the time consumption of m is bounded by a polynomial p  where oracle calls contribute with a single clock tick  
    q     is bounded by  q n    with q a
 the time consumption of m     q      q         qacc

we assume without loss of generality that m and m  never attempt to move left from the
left most position of the tape  neither right from the right most position   our npnexp hardness proof uses a reduction of the word problem of m  thus  let w   be an input
for m of length n  and let m   p n  and m    q p n    we construct three tboxes
tw   tw    and tw     circumscription patterns cp  cp    and cp     and a concept cw such that
m accepts w iff cw is simultaneously satisfiable w r t  circcp  tw      circcp   tw       and
circcp    tw        then  lemma   yields a reduction to  non simultaneous  satisfiability w r t 
concept circumscribed ckbs  intuitively  the purpose of the first tbox tw is to impose a
basic structure on the domain  while tw  describes computations of m  and tw   describes
computations of m    we use general tboxes rather than acyclic ones since  by lemma   
this can be done without loss of generality 
the tbox tw is shown in figure    as in the previous reduction  we use concept
names x            xm    and y            ym    to implement two binary counters for counting
 
modulo  m   we also use the same abbreviations as in the previous reduction  additionally 
r  x    states that the value of the counter x            xm    is incremented when going to
r successors  i e

the purpose of lines      to      is to ensure that  for each possible value  i  j  of the
counters x and y   there is at least one instance of nexp that satisfies  x   i  and  y   j  
 
 
we minimize nexp  and thus enforce that nexp has exactly  m   m elements  these
 
 
elements are interconnected via the roles r  for right  and u  for up  to form a  m  m grid  later on  we use this grid to encode computations of the oracle machine m    observe

that  since we are working with simultaneous satisfiability  the minimization of nexp does
not interact with anything that we are going to put into the tboxes tw  and tw    
we also minimize the concept name result  and thus lines      and      guarantee that
there are exactly m instances of result  identified by the concept names r            rm    if
m makes a call to the oracle in the i th step  then the result of this call will be stored

names 
 for all a    i  j   m  and k          we introduce a concept name sai j k   intuitively

of ms computation  we start our numbering of tape cells and steps with   
 for all q  q and i   m  qiq is a concept name expressing that m is in state q in the

k th head of m is on cell j in the i th step of the computation

figure    the tbox tw   
use b to denote the  shared  blank symbol of m and m    lines      to      describe the
behaviour of a turing machine in the usual way  transitions follow the transition table  the
computation starts in the initial configuration  etc  line      ensures that the instance of
np can reach the  unique  instance of result u ri via the role resi   for all i   m  lines     
and      deal with transitions of m in the query state by looking up the result of the oracle
call in the corresponding instance of result  finally  lines      and      ensure that the head
position and tape symbols do not change when querying the oracle  the circumscription
pattern for tw  is simply cp            v    with v the set of all predicates used in tw   
the purpose of tw   is to describe computations of the oracle turing machine m    note
that we have to describe more than a single computation of m   but at most polynomially many  since m may visit the state q  more than once  all these computations are
represented in the nexp grid  where different computations are untangled by the use of
different concept names for each computation  we use the counter x            xm    to count
   

fithe complexity of circumscription in dls

configurations and the counter y            ym    to count the tape cells of each configuration 
moreover  we use the following concept names 
 for all a   and i   m  a concept name sai   if sai is satisfied by some instance of
nexp where x            xm    has value j and y            ym    has value k  then the i th
computation of m  has  in its j th step  symbol a on the k th cell 
 for all q  q and i   m  a concept name qiq   the purpose of this concept name is
two fold  first  it represents the current state of m  in the i th computation  and
second  it indicates the head position in the i th computation 
 for all a    q  q  m   l  r  and all i   m  a concept name aiq a m as a marker 
the meaning of the marker aiq a m is that  to reach the current configuration  m  has
switched to q  written a  and moved its head in direction m   additionally  the marker
indicates the head position in the previous configuration 
 an additional concept name nh  for nohead  that helps us to enforce that m  has
only a single head position 
the details of tw   are shown in figure    where we require one copy of each line for every
i   m  the purpose of lines      and      is to regenerate the grid structure of nexp using
the roles r  und u    this is necessary since the roles r and u are used in tw   and  to use
lemma    the tboxes cannot share any role names  lines      and      ensure that every
instance of nexp reaches  only  the unique instance of np via the role tonp  and  only  the
unique instance of result u ri via the role res i   for all i   m  lines      to      describe the
computation of m  in a straightforward way  more precisely  lines      to      set up the
initial configuration by reading the contents of ms oracle tape from the instance of np 
lines      to      implement transitions  and lines      to      enforce a unique label of
the tape  a unique state  and a unique head position  finally  line      ensures that  if the
i th computation of m  is rejecting  then rej is true in the instance of result u ri  
note that m  is a non deterministic machine and may have more than one computation 
for storing rej in result u ri   we need to know that all these computations are rejecting 
to deal with this issue  rej is minimized with all other predicates varying  if there exists
an accepting computation of m  on the i th input  then we can represent this computation
in nexp and make rej false in the instance of result u ri   hence  rej holds at result u ri
iff there exists no accepting computation  note that we cannot fix the concept names
x            xm      y            ym    while minimizing rej since we would get an unbounded number
of fixed concept names  this means that the elements of nexp can change their position
during minimization  and with them the roles r  and u    this is not harmful since tw and
lines      and      ensure that that the structure  nexpi    r   i    u   i   is always isomorphic
to a grid  and the rest of tw   ensures that the elements of nexp always encode computations
of m    we thus use the circumscription pattern cp          rej     v      where v   contains
all predicates used in tw   except rej 
the proof of the following lemma is left to the reader  in its formulation  the union
over all qiqacc imposes that at least one state in the computation is accepting

 but non empty aboxes   corresponding lower bounds for subsumption and the instance
problems follow from the reduction given in section   
   

fithe complexity of circumscription in dls

   circumscription with fixed roles
in the preceeding sections  we have analyzed the computational complexity of reasoning
w r t  concept circumscribed kbs and  in particular  established decidability  in the current
section  we extend concept circumscribed kbs to what we call role fixing ckbs  which differ
from the former by allowing role names to be fixed  but not minimized   interestingly  the
result of this seemingly harmless modification is that reasoning becomes highly undecidable 
we start with defining the ckbs studied in this section 
definition    a ckb circcp  t   a  with cp      m  f  v   is called role fixing if m contains no role names 
 
to pinpoint the exact complexity of reasoning in role fixing ckbs  we present a reduction of
the logical consequence problem in monadic second order logic with binary relation symbols
 over unrestricted structures  not over trees  to the instance problem w r t  role fixing ckbs
formulated in alc  it follows that the latter problem is harder than any problem definable
in second order arithmetic and thus outside the analytical hierarchy  analogous results for
satisfiability and subsumption follow by the reductions given in section    our reduction
applies already to the case where tbox and preference relation are empty 
for a finite set r of binary relation symbols  denote by mso r  the set of formulas
constructed from a countably infinite set p    p          of variables for sets  a countable infinite
set x    x          of individual variables  and the binary relation symbols in r  using boolean
connectives  first order quantification  and monadic second order quantification  it is not
hard to see that reasoning with role fixing ckbs corresponds to reasoning in a tiny fragment of mso r   more specifically  consider the standard translation of alc concepts c to
fo formulas  and thus mso r  formulas  c    x  with one free individual variable x as e g 
given by borgida        and take a ckb circcp  t   a  with cp      m  f  v       v    
m    a   and f    r   translate  t   a  to the mso r  sentence
 
 
 
 
x c    x   d   x   
c    xa   
r xa   xb   
cvdt

c a a

r a b a

where the xa are individual variables 
then an alc concept c is satisfiable w r t  circcp  t   a  if  and only if  the mso r formula
  xc    x   p  p  a    p a    
is satisfiable  where p  a  stands for x  p  x   a   x  x  a   x p  x   and  p a   
denotes  with a  replaced by p   this translation is easily extended to the case where an
arbitrary number of concept names is minimized and an arbitrary number of concept and
role names is fixed and varies 
when we prove that logical consequence in mso r  is reducible to the instance problem w r t  role fixing ckbs  we thus establish the surprising result that reasoning in such
skbs does not only correspond to the above tiny fragment of mso r   but is as hard as all
of mso r   our reduction is indirect  instead of directly reducing logical consequence in
mso r   we reduce the semantic consequence problem of modal logic and exploit thomasons result that logical consequence in mso r  can be reduced to the latter problem  see
   

fibonatti  lutz    wolter

the works by thomason      b      a  and the survey articles by wolter et al         and
goldblatt        for details 
we first define the semantic consequence problem of modal logic  in the framework of
description logic  and present thomasons result  starting with some notation 
let r be a finite set of role names  an r frame is a structure f    f   rf    where f
is a non empty domain and rf  f  f for all r  r  an interpretation i    i   i   is
based on an r frame f iff f   i and ri   rf for all r  r  we say that a concept c is
valid in f and write f    c if c i   i for every interpretation i based on f  the semantic
consequence of modal logic is now defined as follows  let c and d be alc concepts with
roles from r  then d is a semantic consequence of c  in symbols c  d  if for every
r frame f  from f    c it follows that f    d  note that since validity in an r frame f
involves quantification over all possible interpretations of the symbols not contained in r 
the relation c  d is invariant over all uniform renamings of atomic concepts in d  this
will be used later on  
for simplicity  we consider only mso r   monadic second order logic with one binary
relation symbol r  it is straighforward to extend our result to arbitrary finite sets r of
relation symbols  given a set of role names r  an alc concept is called an alc r  concept
if it uses no other role names other than those in r  the following theorem follows from
the results by thomason      b      a  
theorem    there exist an effective translation          of mso r  sentences to
alc  r   concepts and an alc  r   concept c  such that for all mso r  sentences  and  
the following conditions are equivalent 
  is a logical consequence of  in mso r  
 c  u        
we can thus establish the reduction of mso r  to the instance problem w r t  role fixing
ckbs by reducing instead the semantic consequence problem  in fact  such a reduction can
be implemented in a very transparent way if we extend alc with the universal role  whereas
the reduction to alc itself requires a number of rather technical intermediate steps  for
this reason  we defer the alc case to the appendix and give the proof with the universal
role 
let u be a new role name  called the universal role  in every interpretation i  u has the
fixed interpretation as ui   i  i   since the interpretation of u is fixed anyway  we do
not allow to use it in circumscription patterns 
now suppose that c and d are alc  r   concepts  to establish the reduction  we construct a role fixing ckb circcp     c   a    and concept c  such that c  d if  and only if  a
is an instance of c  w r t  circcp     c   a     as noted above  we may assume that c  d do
not share any concept names  otherwise  simply replace the concept names in d with fresh
ones   let a be a concept name that does not occur in c and d  let cp      m   r   v   
where      m consists of a and the set of concept names in c  and v consists of the
concept names in d  set a     u c t u

we have b i   i   for all b  m   we now distinguish two cases 
 b j   i   for all b  m   in this case  all b  m have the same interpretation in i

 b j    i   for at least one b  m   then j  cp i  assume that c j    i   then
ai   u c j and j is a model of a  thus  we have derived a contradiction to the
assumption that i is a model of circcp    a  
to prove that point   implies point    assume that point   does not hold  consider a
frame f such that f    c  but f     d  let i be an interpretation based on f such that
ai   d i   we may also assume that b i   i for all b  m  since no such b occurs in
d   then ai    u c  u d i and i is a model of a  it remains to show that there does
not exist an i    cp i such that i   is a model of a  this is straightforward  from f    c  we
 
 
obtain that there does not exist any i   such that ai   u c i   moreover  there clearly
 
 
 
does not exist an i   such that b i   b i for some b  m and ai   u

we have thus proved that the logical consequence problem of mso r  is effectively reducible
to the instance problem w r t  role fixing ckbs formulated in alc extended with the universal role  in our reduction  the tbox and preference relation are empty  in the appendix 
we show how the reduction above can be modified so as to prove the same result for alc
without the universal role 
theorem    the logical consequence problem of mso r  is effectively reducible to the
instance problem w r t  role fixing ckbs formulated in alc  this even holds when the
tbox and preference relation are empty 

   circumscription with minimized roles
unlike fixed concept names  fixed role names cannot be simulated using minimized role
names  this is due to the fact that boolean operators on roles are not available in standard
dls  thus  theorem    does not imply undecidability of reasoning in ckbs in which role
names are allowed to be minimized  but not fixed  in this section  we investigate ckbs of
this type  the formal definition is as follows 
definition    a ckb circcp  t   a  with cp      m  f  v   is called role minimizing if f
contains no role names

we show that role minimizing ckbs behave rather differently from concept circumscribed
kbs and from role fixing ckbs  first  it turns out that reasoning with role minimizing
ckbs with empty tbox is nexpnp  complete for alcqo  but undecidable for alci 
thus  in contrast to the circumscribed kbs considered so far  we now observe a difference
in complexity between alcqo and alci  and even between alc and alci  a second
difference to the results obtained so far is that the nexpnp  lower bound  which applies
to ckbs formulated in alc with an empty tbox  even holds for role minimizing ckbs in
which a single role is minimized and no other predicate is fixed or minimized  this result
is of interest because it shows that complexity does not drop to npnexp if the number of
minimized predicates is constant  finally  we show that  with non empty tboxes  reasoning
with role minimizing ckbs becomes undecidable already for alc 
    role minimizing ckbs with empty tbox in alcqo
we first prove the nexpnp  completeness result discussed above for dls without inverse
roles  we start with the upper bound  to prove it  we first establish a bounded model
property using a selective filtration style argument  see e g  blackburn et al          the
difference to the bounded model property proof given above for concept circumscribed kbs
is that  here  we do not build a quotient model of a given model by identifying nodes using an
equivalence relation  but construct a submodel of a given model by selecting relevant nodes 
in contrast to forming quotient models  this technique works only with empty tboxes since
a tbox can force us to select infinitely many nodes  similarly  the selection technique does
not work for dls with the inverse role because  as we shall see below  inverse roles can be
used to simulate tboxes 
recall that the role depth rd c  of a concept c is defined as the nesting depth of the
constructors    k r d  and    k r d  in c 
theorem    in alcqo  satisfiability w r t  role minimizing ckbs with empty tbox is
in nexpnp  
proof  let circcp    a  be a role minimizing ckb with cp      m  f  v    and let c  be a
concept that is satisfiable w r t  circcp    a   let m  be the maximal parameter occurring
in number restrictions of a or c    set
n    max  rd c       rd c    c a   a   and m      m          a     c     n    
we show that there exists a model j of circcp    a  satisfying c  such that  j  m 
let i be a model of circcp    a  such that there exists a d   c i   for each d  i   fix a
minimal set d d   i such that 
 for every concept    k r c  which occurs in a or c  with d     k r c i there exist
at least k distinct e  d d  such that  d  e   ri and e  c i and
 for every concept    k r c  which occurs in a or c  with d      k r c i there exist
at least k     distinct e  d d  such that  d  e   ri and e  c i  
clearly   d d    m          c       a   for each d  i   next  define a set d   i by
setting
d      d      ai   a  ni occurs in a or c

define an interpretation i   with domain i as follows

 for a  m  v   ai   ai  n  
 

 for a  f   ai   ai  
 

a straightforward inductive argument shows that i   is a model of a such that d   c i  
 
note that we did not change the interpretation of the a  f   moreover  we have pi  pi
for every p  m   together with the fact that i   is a model of a and i     cp i  we even get
 
pi   pi for every p  m   it follows that i   is a model for circcp    a  because j  cp i  
would imply j  cp i 
 
note that ri  n  n   for every role r  now define an interpretation j with domain
j   n by putting
 

 aj   ai  n   for every concept name a 
 

 rj   ri   for every role name r 
 aj   ai   for every individual name a from a or c   
we still have that j is a model for a satisfying c    moreover  any interpretation j    cp j
satisfying a can be easily extended to an interpretation i     cp i   satisfying a  hence  no
such interpretation exists and j is a model for circcp    a   from  n  m we derive
 j  m 
the proof of the nexpnp  upper bound is now exactly the same as the proof of theorem
    it suffices to replace the bound   k for the size of interpretations by the bound m 
o
we now give a lower bound matching the upper bound of theorem    
theorem    in alc  satisfiability w r t  role minimizing ckbs with empty tbox is nexpnp hard  this holds even if there is only one minimized role name and no fixed prediates
proof  by theorem     in alc it is nexpnp  hard to decide whether a concept c  is
satisfiable w r t  circcp    a   where cp      m    v   and m contains concept names only 
clearly  it is still nexpnp  hard to decide whether there exists a common model of c  and
circcp    a  of size at least  m   thus  it is sufficient to provide a polynomial reduction
of this problem to the satisfiability problem w r t  ckbs in alc with a single minimized
role and all remaining predicates varying  suppose c  and circcp    a  are given  let
m    a            ak   and take

let cp        r       v   b            bk   r     and define a  and c   as the result of replacing 
in a and c    every occurrence of ai by r   ci   for i  k  finally  set a   a    r   ci  a   
i  k   we show the following 
   c  is satisfiable w r t  circcp    a  in a model of size at least  m if  and only if  c   is
satisfiable w r t  circcp     a   
let i be a model of circcp    a  and c  of size at least  m   define an interpretation i  
with domain i by extending i as follows  take mutually distinct d            dk  i and
interpret b            bk   r    r    and a in such a way that

 r i     d    d              d    dk    
it is readily checked that i   is a model of c   and circcp     a   
conversely  let i be a model of circcp     a   and c     define an interpretation i   by
 
extending i with aii    r   ci  i   for i  k  it is readily checked that i   is a model of c

    role minimizing ckbs with nonempty tbox
in the bounded model property proof above  it is important that the selection of nodes
stops after n iterations with the set n   where n is the maximum of the role depths of the
concepts in the abox and the concept c we want to satisfy  such a bound for the selection
of nodes does not exist if the tbox is non empty  and we now show that reasoning w r t 
role minimizing ckbs is indeed undecidable in this case  the proof is by a reduction of the
  tiling problem  berger

definition    a tiling problem is a quadruple triple p    t  h  v    where t is a finite

it is straightforward to verify that i is a model of tp   additionally  we clearly have ai 
  di  
it thus remains to show that there is no model j of tp with j  cp i  assume there is
such a j   since all concept and role names except d and b are minimized  it follows that
   xi   xj and y i   y j because j is a model of

t for all t  t because of point   and j is a model of      
   n i   n j because  no matter what b j is  by point   we have

thus and because j is a model of       n i   n j  
thus  i and j differ at most in the interpretation of the concept names d and b  which
are varying  this is a contradiction to j  cp i 
conversely  assume that circcp  tp         d a   and let i be a model of circcp  tp     with

 let d   b j and d   b j  
 let dj   i  
clearly  j  cp i  to obtain a contradiction against i being a model of circcp  tp     
it thus remains to show that j is a model of tp   it suffices to consider      to

because dj   i   to show       let e  i   we show that e  c j for c the concept

the proof uses the spy point technique  areces  blackburn    marx         namely  we
show that aboxes can simulate tbox reasoning by employing inverse roles and a simulation
of nominals by circumscription  using this idea the proof is rather similar to the proof of

let p be an instance of the tiling problem and consider the ckb circcp  tp     defined
in the proof of lemma     we simulate its tbox axioms c v c   by abox assertions
  c  c     u r    c  c      a  and enforcing the role r  to connect all relevant points to a 
this is achieved by forcing all relevant points in the domain to satisfy r    a   since we
do not have nominals in the language we use a concept name a instead of  a  and ensure
that it behaves like a nominal  we now present the details 
for the sake of readability  we write concept assertions c a  in the form a   c and we
set    r  c   c u r c  let a  b     and n   be fresh concept names and r  be a fresh role

 ai   d   r i whenever d    ai and d is  x  y  reachable in i from ai in a finite number of
steps  assume that this is not the case  then there exist d  d   i such that

 d is removed from n  i  
 let ai  b  j and d     b  j

clearly j  cp i  to obtain a contradiction it is thus sufficient to show that j is a model
of ap   clearly  all assertion in ap containing neither d  b     nor n   are satisfied in j   for
the remaining assertions except       it follows from dj   i that they are satisfied in j  
finally  for       observe that n  i   ai     e    ai   e   r i   because a   di and assertions

   related work
we have already pointed out in the introduction that circumscription is just one of several
possible approaches to nonmonotonic dls and that  in order to achieve decidability  each
of these approaches has to adopt a suitable restriction on the expressive power of the dl
component  on the non monotonic features  or on the interaction of the dl and its nonmonotonic features  in this section  we survey the existing approaches  discuss the adopted
restrictions  and relate them to dls with circumscription whenever possible  however  we
point out that a full fledged formal comparison of the different approaches is a serious research endeavor of its own and outside the scope of this paper  the main approaches to
nonmonotonic dls  excluding those relying on the integration of dls and logic programming  are summarized in table    where n a  stands for not analyzed and the specificity
column states whether a formalism is equipped with a priority mechanism based on the the
specificity  i e   subsumption  of concepts 
we start with two early approaches based on circumscription  in the work by brewka
        a frame system is given a nonmonotonic semantics based on circumscription  the
focus is on showing the appropriateness of the proposed semantics  and the decidability and
complexity of reasoning is not analyzed  cadoli et al          apply circumscription to a dl

table    some approaches to nonmonotonic dls

in the same way as we do here  the authors consider only non prioritized circumscription
and apply it to a fragment of the description logic ale  decidability of reasoning is shown
by a reduction to propositional reasoning under the extended closed world assumption
 ecwa   which is in p    to the best of our knowledge  this was the first effective reasoning
method for a nonmonotonic description logic 
in another early approach by padgham and zhang         a nonmonotonic dl is obtained by an adaptation of the inheritance networks approach  horty        where the
underlying dl is essentially al extended with concrete data values  the main contribution is the definition of the formalism and a discussion of applications  decidability and
complexity are not analyzed 
a recent approach that is similar in spirit to circumscription has been taken by giordano
et al          the authors extend alc with a modal operator t representing typicality 
and maximize t s extension to achieve nonmonotonic inferences  decidability is proved via
a tableau algorithm that also establishes a co nexpnp upper bound for subsumption  a
lower bound is not given 
we now turn to approaches based on default logic  reiter         the nonmonotonic
dls by baader and hollunder      a      b   straccia         and lambrix et al        
share a common restriction  default rules can be applied to an individual only if it has
a name  that is  if it is denoted by an individual constant that occurs explicitly in the
knowledge base  this restriction is motivated by the observation that  when defaults are also
applied to implicit  anonymous  individuals  then reasoning becomes undecidable  baader  
   

fibonatti  lutz    wolter

hollunder      a   since the models of dl knowledge bases usually include a large number
of anonymous individuals due to existential quantification  this restriction introduces a
strong asymmetry in the treatment of individuals 
another line of nonmonotonic dls  donini et al                     is based on first order
autoepistemic logics whose interpretation domains are restricted to a fixed and denumerable
set of constants  the use of a unique domain resolves several issues related to quantification
in modal logics  such as whether the barcan formula should hold  and whether different
worlds of the same kripke structure should be allowed to have different domains   it also
avoids the asymmetry of the approaches based on default logic because  by definition  all
individuals have a name  the other side of the coin is that domains with finite or varying
cardinality and knowledge bases that do not satisfy the unique name assumption can only
be dealt with using rather technical encodings  such as an explicit axiomatization of the
finite domain represented by a concept name d  
in the first paper mentioned above  donini et al          decidability results apply only to
monotonic knowledge bases  as the autoepistemic operator can be used in a nonmonotonic
fashion only in queries  this restriction has been lifted in the subsequent publications 
they make use of the logic of minimal knowledge and negation as failure  mknf   which
is equipped with two  auto epistemic operators k and a  donini et al               
in the former paper  donini et al          the underlying monotonic fragment can be any
description logic with a decidable instance checking problem  the price payed for this
generality is that decidability results apply only to so called simple knowledge bases  where
quantifying in  that is  quantification across modal operators  as in r k c  is not allowed 
nonetheless  such kbs are expressive enough to model default rules  a different restriction is
explored by donini et al          the underlying dl is restricted to alc while limited forms
of quantifying in are allowed  in so called subjectively quantified alckn f knowledge bases 
decidability results are obtained for the subclass of simple subjectively quantified knowledge
bases  whose nonmonotonic part is restricted to inclusions of the form kc v d such that
  v c is can not be inferred from the knowledge base  this restriction is incompatible
with the traditional embedding of  priority free  circumscription into autoepistemic logic 
which is based on prerequisite free default rules that would be equivalent to inclusions of
the form k  v c 
a recent line of research on integrating dls and logic programming rules introduces
further nonmonotonic extensions of dls based on negation as failure  some approaches
 eiter et al         use a loosely coupled integration of logic programs and dls  where the
interpretations of the dl component are not restricted while the logic program variables
range only over the named dl individuals  thus  these approaches are somewhat similar
to the classical extensions of dls based on defaults in that nonmonotonic inferences are
limited to named individuals  a more recent approach  motik   rosati        is based on
mknf and shares with the mknf dls discussed above pros and cons of adopting a fixed
denumerable domain  if the complexity of reasoning in the underlying dl is c   np  then
the data complexity of entailment is bounded by c c   finally  we mention a   valued variant
of this approach  knorr  alferes    hitzler        based on the well founded semantics 
   the autoepistemic operator can be used only in restricted contexts that suffice to encode so called
procedural rules  which are monotonic

a common limitation of the nonmonotonic extensions of dls based on mknf is that
they provide no support for specificity and priorities  in particular  defeasible inheritance
is not mentioned in the expressiveness analysis for autoepistemic approaches  donini et al  
            and it does not appear to be a goal of any mknf based approach  as pointed
out in the introduction  it is well known that  in the propositional case  nonmonotonic logics
cannot modularly encode specificity based priorities such as those needed by inheritance
mechanisms  horty        

   conclusions and perspectives
we have shown that circumscription provides an elegant approach to defining nonmonotonic
dls  that the resulting formalisms have an appealing expressive power and are decidable
if appropriate restrictions are adopted  the main such restriction  which leads to rather
robust decidability results  is that only concept names are minimized and fixed whereas all
role names vary  with empty tboxes  decidability is retained if roles are allowed to be
minimized  but not when they are fixed  the decidability and complexity results obtained
in this paper are listed in more detail in table    by the results of section    all bounds
with tbox     apply to both general and acyclic tboxes 
we view this paper as a promising step towards establishing circumscribed dls as a
major family of nonmonotonic dls to be used in practical applications  to reach this goal 
some additional research topics have to be addressed  of which we mention two  first  the
algorithms presented in this paper are based on massive non deterministic guessing and
thus do not admit an efficient implementation  ideally  one would like to have algorithms
which are well behaved extensions of the tableau algorithms that underly state of the art
dl reasoners  baader   sattler         a crucial issue is whether the sophisticated optimization techniques implemented in such reasoners  tableaux caching  dependency directed
backtracking etc   cf  baader et al         chap     can be adapted to circumscribed dls 
some first steps have been made by grimm and hitzler         second  it seems necessary
to develop a design methodology for modelling defeasible inheritance  the examples given
in this paper indicate that the main challenge is to find rules of thumb to determine which
predicates should be fixed  varied  and minimized  it may be appealing to hide abnormality
predicates behind explicit syntax for defeasible inclusions  and trade some generality for
simplicity and usability 
also from a theoretical perspective  our initial investigation leave open at least some
interesting questions  for example  our current techniques are limited to circumscribed dls
   

fibonatti  lutz    wolter

that have the finite model property  it would be desirable to overcome this limitation and
obtain decidability results for even more expressive dls such as shiq or owl  it is also
possible to follow the opposite approach and consider circumscribed versions of inexpressive
dls such as those of the el or dl lite family  baader  brandt    lutz      a  calvanese 
giacomo  lembo  lenzerini    rosati         which are currently very popular in a large
number of applications  first steps have been made by bonatti  faella  and sauro        
who investigated circumscribed versions of el and dl lite 
finally  it is worth mentioning that our complexity results for circumscription can be
used to prove complexity bounds for other  seemingly unrelated  reasoning problems in
description logic  for example  certain reasoning services for conservative extensions and
modularity in description logic and the satisfiability problem w r t  concept circumscribed
knowledge bases are mutually reducible to each other in polynomial time  konev  lutz 
walther    wolter         as there are not many problems that are known to be nexpnp complete  circumscription thus provides a new class of problems that can potentially be
employed to give nexpnp lower bound proofs

appendix a  missing proofs in section  
lemma    in alc  satisfiability w r t   concept  circumscribed kbs with empty tbox and
without fixed roles can be polynomially reduced to satisfiability w r t   concept  circumscribed kbs with empty tbox and without fixed predicates 
proof  in the proof of lemma    we have used tbox axioms to state that some fresh
concept names are interpreted as the complement of fixed concept names  in general  this
cannot be done using abox assertions only  instead  we construct abox assertions which
force this to be the case only for objects which are relevant for the truth of the given abox 
some care is required to do this using abox assertions of polynomial size  the first part of
the proof deals with this problem  the second part is then a straighforward modification
of the proof of lemma   
the first part of the proof consists of introducing some notation and proving a central
technical claim  for w   r     rn  nr   an interpretation i  and d  e  i   we write
i
 d  e   wi iff there are d            dn  i with d   d    e   dn   and  di   di      ri  
for all
i   n 
let n be a set of individual names and paths a mapping from n to the powerset of nr  
an interpretation i is well behaved for the mapping paths if for every d  i   there is an
a  n and a w  paths a  such that  ai   d   wi   with each alc concept c  we associate
a set p c  of pairs  w  d  with w  nr and d a subconcept of c as follows 
 if c  nc   then p c        c   
 if c   d  then p c        c    p d  
   

fithe complexity of circumscription in dls

 if c   d  u d  or c   d  t d    then p c        c    p d     p d    
 if c   r d or c   r d  then p c        c      rw  e     w  e   p d   
for a set of abox assertions s and an individual name a  we use p s  a  to denote the set
s
c a s p c   we write paths s  a  for  w   d    w  d   p s  a    we now formulate
the announced claim 
claim    suppose circcp    a      c   a     where cp does not contain fixed role names and a
and c   a  are formulated in alc  let s   a   c   a     and let n be the set of individual
names in s  let i   be the restriction of i to those d  i such that  for some a  n
and some w  paths s  a   we have  ai   d   wi   then i   is a model of circcp    a  and
c   a    which is well behaved for the mapping paths a    paths s  a   a  n  
we now prove the claim  let i be a model of circcp    a  with ai    c   i   note that
 
for all a  n   we have   paths s  a  and thus ai  i   clearly  i   is well behaved for
paths  one can prove by induction on c that
 

   for all a  n    w  c   p s  a   and d  i with  ai   d   wi   we have d  c i iff
 
d  ci  
we show only the case c   r d  and leave the other cases to the reader  let d  c i   then
there is an e  di with  d  e   ri   since  w  c   p s  a   we have  wr  d   p s  a  
 
since  ai   d   wi   we have  ai   e    wr i   thus  e  i and the induction hypothesis
 
 
 
yields e  di   by definition of i   and the semantics  d  c i   now let d  c i   then there
 
 
is an e  di with  d  e   ri   by definition of i      d  e   ri   since  w  c   p s  a   we
have  wr  d   p s  a   since  ai   d   wi   we have  ai   e    wr i   thus  the induction
hypothesis yields e  di  
thus     is established  using    and the facts that ai    c   i and that i is a model
 
 
of a  it is not hard to verify that ai    c   i and that i   is a model of a  we show that
i   is also a model of circcp    a   assume to the contrary that there is a model j   of a
with j    cp i     define an interpretation j as follows 
 j   i  
 aj   ai for all a  f  
 

 aj   aj for all a  v  m  
 

 rj   rj for all r  nc  
 bj   bi for all b  ni  
using the assumption that cp does not contain fixed role names  it is not hard to verify
that j  cp i  to obtain a contradiction to the fact that i is a model of circcp    a   it
thus remains to show that j is a model of a  to this end  we prove by induction on c that
 

   for all a  n    w  c   p s  a   and d  j with  aj   d   wj   we have d  c j iff
 
d  cj  
since the induction step is as in the proof of     we only do the induction start  thus  let
c   a  nc   if a  v  m   we are done by definition of j   now let a  f   since i   is

a restriction of i and aj   ai   the definition of j yields aj  j   aj   as required 
this finishes the proof of the claim 
to prove lemma    we consider instance checking instead of satisfiability  since we
have provided polynomial reductions from satisfiability to  non  instance checking and vice
versa in section    we nevertheless obtain the desired result  let circcp    a  be a ckb
with cp      m  f  v   and f    a            ak    take a concept assertion c   a     let
s   a   c   a     and n be the set of individual names in s  define
 m     m   a            ak   a             a k    where the a i are fresh concept names 
 a    a   w  a i  ai   a    w  paths s  a   a  n   i  k  
 cp       m       v   
then circcp    a     c   a    iff circcp     a       c   a    follows immediately from claim  
and the fact that paths s  a    paths s     a   for s     a   c   a    
o
lemma   c  is satisfiable w r t  circcp  t   a  iff c  u b   is satisfiable w r t  circcp   t     a  
proof  suppose i is a model of c  and circcp  t   a   expand i to an interpretation i   by
setting
 
 
 
 
 
ai   b  i   i   b i   a i     ui    
clearly  i   is a model of c  u b   and  t     a   we show that i   is a model of circcp   t     a  
assume to the contrary that there is a model j of  t     a  with j  cp  i     then a j    
aj   i   b j     and b   j   i   since u is varying and j  cp  i     it is thus easy to
show that j  cp i  this contradicts the fact that i is a model of circcp  t   a  
conversely  suppose i is a model of c  u b   and circcp   t     a   we show that i is also
a model of c  and circcp  t   a   first observe that ai   i   for suppose that this is not
the case  define a new interpretation j in the same way as i except that uj   i  i  
b j   i   and b  j     then j  cp  i  since b  i      and j is a model of  t     a   thus
we have derived a contradiction  it follows that c i   i and hence i is a model of  t   a 
and c    it remains to show that there is no j  cp i such that j is a model of  t   a  
assume such a j exists  then c j   i   define a model j   by expanding j as follows

b j   a j    

 

uj    

note that a  b  a    b     and u are interpreted by i in the same way  then j    cp  i 
moreover  j   is a model of  t     a   we have derived a contradiction

proof  it suffices to reduce simultaneous satisfiability without shared role names to the complement of instance checking w r t  single ckbs  as a generalization is straightforward  we

if  assume that a  is not an instance of  p u r   c    w r t  circcp  t   a   then there
is a model i of circscp  t   a  with ai    p u r   c   i   we call i connected if the directed
graph gi    i   rr ri   r  i   is connected  a connected component i   of i is the
 
 
restriction of i to domain i such that i is a  maximal  connected component in gi  
we may assume without loss of generality that the chosen model i is connected  if it is
not  then the use of the role r  ensures that there is a connected component i   of i that

model of circcp  t   a  and ai    p u r   c   i   thus we may simply replace i by i    
we have to show that c  is simultaneously satisfiable with respect to circcp   t    a   
and circcp   t    a     clearly  i is a model of c    by construction of circcp  t   a   it is
a model of t    and a    to show that i is also a model of circcp   t    a     assume to the

it is readily checked that j   is a model of t and a  and that j    cp i  thus  we have
derived a contradiction to the fact that i is a model of circcp  t   a   and it follows that i
is a model of circcp  t    a    
it remains to show that i is a model of circcp  t    a     since i is connected  a model
of t    and satisfies ai  
  p i   we have that aii    a i  i for all i   n  therefore  i is also a
model of t  and a    analogously to the case of circcp   t    a     we can now show that i is

only if  assume that c  is simultaneously satisfiable w r t  the ckbs circcp   t    a   
and circcp   t    a     then there exists a model i of c  that is a model of circcp   t    a

that i   is also model of circcp  t   a   to do this  we first show the following 
 a  i   is a model of circcp   t    a     this is the case since any model j of t  and a 
with j  cp  i   satisfies j  cp  i  thus  the existence of such a model contradicts

contradiction to the fact that i is a model of circcp   t    a

proof  if  suppose that cg is satisfiable w r t  circcpg    ag   and let i be a model of
i      we have to show that g is a yes instance of co cert col  
circcpg    ag   with cg
s
to start  we show that
i 
 i  ai   cg
i with d    ai  
assume to the contrary that this is not the case  then there is a d  cg
 
i   we have d  rooti   let j be the interpretation obtained from i by setting
since d  cg
rootj    ai     by definition of ag   we have ai   rooti   and thus j cpg i  moreover 
it is easily seen that j is a model of ag   we have thus established a contradiction to the
fact that i is a model of circcpg    ag    which proves  i  
by lines          fig      there are elements di w  i  the nodes of the tree  for i   n
and w        i such that

 d n w  leaf i   for all w         n  
for i  j    n   we use  i j to denote the element d n w such that w         n denotes the
binary encoding of i followed by that of j  we now show that
 ii  leaf i     i j   i  j    n   
assume to the contrary that this is not the case  i e   that there is a d  leaf i such that
d     i j for all i  j    n   let id   jd     be integers such that the truth values of x            xn 
at d encode id and the truth values of y            yn  encode jd   starting from i  we construct
an interpretation j by setting

further modify j into j   by setting

by going through lines     to       it is straightforward to check that j   is a model of ag  
moreover  we clearly have j    cpg i  and thus obtain a contradiction to the fact that i is
a model of circcpg    ag    we have thus shown  ii  
the following is an easy consequence of  i   the fact that p is a conjunct of cg   and
lines                 and

now suppose to the contrary of what we aim to prove that g is not a yes instance  then 
for all truth assignments t  the subgraph t g  is   colorable  in particular  this holds for
the assignment t defined by setting  for all i  j    n  

t vij        iff  i j  tri  

let c                n       r  g  b  be a   coloring of t g  and construct an interpretation
j by starting from i and applying the following modifications 

cj
clashj

    i     i    n   c i    c  for all c   r  g  b 
   

clearly  j  cpg i  the minimized predicate clash is empty in j   but non empty in i since
i is non empty  to obtain a contradiction  it thus suffices to show that j is a model
cg
of ag  
since i and j agree on all predicates but r  g  b  and clash  all inclusions that do not
mention these concepts are satisfied in j   these are lines     to       lines      and     
 n j
are satisfied by construction of j and since  due to line     and  ii    aj
    d    r  
n
implies d    i j for some i  j       it thus remains to consider lines      to       we first
show that
 iv  for all i  j    n    i  j  is an edge of t g  iff  i j 
  elimj  
let i  j    n and let the potential edge  i  j  be labeled with vk   k   vk   k   since the
 i 
 i 
circuits cs and cj deliver an output for any input  we can assume that also potential 
but non existing edges have a label   by  ii  and  iii  together with lines     and     
var j   var i     k   k    and var j   var i     k   k     thus  the definition of t together
with lines      to      yields that  i  j  is an edge of t g  iff  i j 
  elimi   to prove  iv   it
remains to note that i and j interpret the concept name elim in the same way 
 n j
now  we prove that      to      are satisfied in j   let  aj
    d    r     by line  
j
n
and  ii   d    i j for some i  j       let  i j 
  elim   by  iv  and since c is a   coloring
of t g   we get c i     c j   thus  by construction of j    i   
  c j or  j   
  c j for all
c   r  g  b   by  ii  and  iii  together with lines      and       col j   col i     i    
and col j   col i     j      therefore   i j 
   col  c u col  c j for all c   r  g  b  
j
since this holds for any  i j 
  elim   the preconditions of the implications in lines      to
     are never satisfied  thus  the implications are satisfied 

only if  suppose that g is a yes instance and let t be a truth assignment such that
t g  is not   colorable  let c                n       r  g  b  be a color assignment that
minimizes  w r t  set inclusion  the set   i  j     i  j  an edge in g with c i    c j    define
an interpretation i as follows  here and in the following  we do not distinguish between a
number and its binary encoding as a string

i and
to show that cg is satisfiable w r t  circcpg    ag    it suffices to show that ai   cg
i is a model of circcpg    ag    the former is easy  recall that cg   rootup ur n  clash 
by definition of i  ai    root u p  i   since c is not a   coloring  ai    r n  clash i   it
thus remains to show that i is a model of circcpg    ag    since it is easy to verify that i is
a model of ag   this boils down to showing that there is no model j of ag with j  cpg i 
assume to the contrary that there is such a j   by lines        and since j is a model
of ag   we have  leaf j    n   since  leaf i     n and j  cpg i  we get leaf j   leaf i  
for similar but simpler reasons  rootj   rooti   thus  j  cpg i implies clashj   clashi

then  ii  guarantees that if  i  j  is an edge in g with c   i    c   j   then d n ij  clashj  
since clashj   clashi   we get that
   if c   i    c   j   then c i    c j  
   there are i  j with c   i     c   j   but c i    c j  
this contradicts our initial minimality assumption on the coloring c 
it thus remains to prove  iii   we start with  a   assume that
 d  var i   leaf i  leaf i     var j   leaf j  leaf j   and

by line       i    i and j        by  i  and lines      and      and since i and j
agree on the interpretation of x            xn    y            yn    there is an e  leaffixj such
that  d n ij   e   col j   the value encoded by x            xn  at e in j is i  and the value
encoded by y            yn  at e in j is    since leaffixi   leaffixj   we have leaffixj  
leaf j   however  there is only a single element of leaf j where x            xn  encodes i and
y            yn  encodes   and this is d n i    d    the converse direction is analogous

corollary    in alc  satisfiability w r t  concept circumscribed kbs is nexpnp  hard
even if the tbox is acyclic  the abox and preference relations are empty  and there are no
fixed predicates 
proof  the abox ag from the reduction given in section       is of the form  c   a    
and the circumscription pattern cpg has an empty preference relation  it thus suffices to
show that there is a polynomial reduction of satisfiability w r t  concept circumscribed kbs
of this form to satisfiability w r t  concept circumscribed kbs with an acyclic tbox  empty
abox and preference relation  and no fixed predicates 
let circcp    a  be a concept circumscribed kb with a    c   a     and cp

a is a concept name that does not occur in a and c and u is a role name that does not
occur in a and c  also define cp       m  v   u   f   a    then c is satisfiable w r t 
circcp    a  iff a u c is satisfiable w r t  circcp   t     
if  if a u c is satisfiable w r t  circcp   t      then there is a model i of circcp   t

j   into an interpretation i   by setting ai   ai and ui   i  i   it is readily checked
that i   is a model of t and i    cp  i  thus we have obtained a contradiction to the fact

we show that the semantic consequence problem can be reduced to instance checking
w r t  role fixing ckbs in alc  we have already proved that for alc extended with the
universal role  in fact  the only remaining problem is to approximate concepts u c using alc concepts that state that the extension of c contains all points within a certain 
sufficiently large neighbourhood 
to construct such an approximation  we first introduce a local version of the notion of
frame validity of concepts  a pointed r frame is a pair  f  d  such that d  f and f is
an r frame  a concept c is valid in a pointed r frame  f  d   in symbols  f  d     c  iff

 transa is valid in f if  and only if  sf is transitive 
 conta is valid in f if  and only if  rf  sf  
say that d   f is  r  s  reachable from d in f if  d  d      rf  sf   and call d  f a
root of f if every d   f is  r  s  reachable from d in f  if f is an  r  s  frame with root
d  then the following conditions are equivalent 
    r  s   transa u conta   is valid in  f  d  
 sf is transitive and rf  sf  
these observations are used in the proof of lemma    below  as before  we sometimes write
concept assertions c a  in the form a   c  recall that the role depth rd c  of a concept c
is defined as the nesting depth of the constructors r d and r d  r  r  in c
