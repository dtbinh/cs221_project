abstract
paper presents multilayered architecture enhances capabilities current
qa systems allows different types complex questions queries processed 
answers questions need gathered factual information scattered
throughout different documents  specifically  designed specialized layer process
different types temporal questions  complex temporal questions first decomposed
simple questions  according temporal relations expressed original question 
way  answers resulting simple questions recomposed  fulfilling
temporal restrictions original complex question  novel aspect approach
resides decomposition uses minimal quantity resources  final
aim obtaining portable platform easily extensible languages 
paper present methodology evaluation decomposition questions
well ability implemented temporal layer perform multilingual level 
temporal layer first performed english  evaluated compared with 
a  general purpose qa system  f measure        qa plus english temporal layer
vs         general qa system   b  well known qa system  much better
results obtained temporal questions multilayered system  system
therefore extended spanish good results obtained evaluation
 f measure        qa plus spanish temporal layer vs         general qa

   introduction
nowadays  fact huge amount digital information available  mainly
textual form  large number users want easiest possible access
information  situation continuously fosters research development
information systems make possible analyze  locate  manage  access process
information automatically  commonly  systems referred search
engines 
search engine especially useful obtain specific piece information without
need manually go available documentation related search
topic  search engines currently evolving towards new generation engines capable

understanding user needs better  the necessity behind every query  offering specific
services interfaces  depending domain context  new generation search

       question answering systems  qa  one best examples new generation
search engines  allowing users formulate questions free natural language  nl 
providing exactly information required  nl form 
however  qa mature technology current systems mainly focused

long road towards next generation systems  work presented takes
new step forward  defines layer that  installed top current nl based search

temporal questions 
specific case temporal qa trivial task due potential complexity
temporal questions  current search engines  operational qa systems deal
simple factual temporal questions  is  questions requiring date answer
 when bob marley die   questions involve simple temporal expressions
formulation  who u s  open         processing kinds questions
usually accomplished identifying explicit temporal expressions questions
relevant documents contain temporal expressions order answer questions 
however  system described paper processes complex temporal questions 
is  questions whose complexity related temporal properties entities
enquired relative ordering events mentioned question  following
examples complex temporal questions 
spokesman soviet embassy baghdad invasion
kuwait 
bill clinton currently president united states 
approach present work tries imitate temporal reasoning human
solving types questions  example  person trying answer question 
spokesman soviet embassy baghdad invasion kuwait 
would proceed follows 
   first  complex question would decomposed two simple ones 
spokesman soviet embassy baghdad  invasion
kuwait occur  
   

fienhancing qa systems complex temporal question processing capabilities

   he she would look possible answers first simple question 
spokesman soviet embassy baghdad  
   that  he she would look answer second question 
invasion kuwait occur 
   finally  he she would give final answer one answers first question  if
any  temporal compatibility answer second question 
case  answer first question must temporally compatible
period dates associated invasion kuwait  during  
therefore  logical approach treatment complex questions based
decomposition questions simple ones resolved using conventional
qa systems  finally  answers simple questions  fulfilling temporal constraints  would

   background
explained introduction  one aims paper process complex questions  complex questions general dealt previous studies using different
approaches decompose them  harabagiu  lacatusu hickl        presented procedure question produces lots queries semantically related original
question  main aim obtaining information answers  approach requires significant amount semantic information  question decomposition
presented katz  borchardt felshin        involves three decomposition techniques 
a  syntactic decomposition using linguistic knowledge language based descriptions
resource content  b  semantic decomposition using domain motivated explanation patterns language based annotations resource content  c  semantic decomposition
questions resource content lower level assertions  approach makes use
considerable amount linguistic knowledge order move new domains  new
sets parameterized language based annotations need composed  addition
studies dealing single focus complex questions  lin lui        propose processing
complex questions multiple foci obtaining one subquestion focus
original question  approach determines four possible relations subquestions derived original question  however  temporal relation considered
