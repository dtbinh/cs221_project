order understand taken one disjunct per lesson approach rather
all at once approach  let s make observations concerning accurately blame
assignment error determined typical training example 
recall error propagation proof tree involves projecting desired node input
values known node output value  consider pand node known desired output
     two unknown inputs  know inputs must least     
means inputs pand node fall within relatively small range           
however  desired output two input por node      sure
inputs fall range          known output pand por node
low  say      opposite effect  is  unknown inputs
por node would lie relatively small range            unknown inputs
pand node would fall somewhere much larger range            observations
suggest blame assignment error propagated pand node
reasonable accuracy examples relatively good  say     above  however 
high evaluation measures  error value cannot reliably propagated por

since subcategory evaluation measure computed por parent category

connecting node consists parent  or general  category whose membership
calculation involves pand connectives  structure proof trees permits
membership functions contribute evaluation measure parent category

approach eliminates reliability problems associated propagating blame assignment
