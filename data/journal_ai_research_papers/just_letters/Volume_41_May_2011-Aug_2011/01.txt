abstract
usually a voting rule requires agents to give their preferences as linear orders  however 
in some cases it is impractical for an agent to give a linear order over all the alternatives  it
has been suggested to let agents submit partial orders instead  then  given a voting rule 
a profile of partial orders  and an alternative  candidate  c  two important questions arise 
first  is it still possible for c to win  and second  is c guaranteed to win  these are the
possible winner and necessary winner problems  respectively  each of these two problems
is further divided into two sub problems  determining whether c is a unique winner  that
is  c is the only winner   or determining whether c is a co winner  that is  c is in the set of
winners  
we consider the setting where the number of alternatives is unbounded and the votes
are unweighted  we completely characterize the complexity of possible necessary winner
problems for the following common voting rules  a class of positional scoring rules  including
borda   copeland  maximin  bucklin  ranked pairs  voting trees  and plurality with runoff 

   introduction
in multiagent systems  often  the agents must make a joint decision in spite of the fact
that they have different preferences over the alternatives  for example  the agents may
have to decide on a joint plan or an allocation of tasks resources  a general solution to
this problem is to have the agents vote over the alternatives  that is  each agent i gives a
ranking  linear order  i of all the alternatives  then a voting rule takes all of the submitted
rankings as input  and based on this produces a chosen alternative  the winner   or a set
of chosen alternatives  the design of good voting rules has been studied for centuries by
the social choice community  more recently  computer scientists have become interested in
social choicemotivated in part by applications in multiagent systems  but also by other
applications  hence  a community interested in computational social choice has emerged 
in traditional social choice  agents are usually required to give a linear order over all
the alternatives  however  especially in multiagent systems applications  this is not always
practical  for one  sometimes  the set of alternatives is too large  for example  there are
generally too many possible joint plans or allocations of tasks resources for an agent to
give a linear order over them  in such settings  agents must use a different voting language
to represent their preferences  for example  they can use cp nets  boutilier  brafman 
domshlak  hoos    poole        lang        xia  lang    ying      a      b  lang  
xia         however  when an agent uses a cp net  or a similar language  to represent
its preferences  this generally only gives us a partial order over the alternatives  another

issue is that it is not always possible for an agent to compare two alternatives  pini  rossi 
venable    walsh         such incomparabilities also result in a partial order 
in this paper  we study the setting where for each agent  we have a partial order corresponding to that agents preferences  we study the following two questions      is it
the case that  for some extension of the partial orders to linear orders  alternative c wins 
    is it the case that  for any extension of the partial orders to linear orders  alternative c
wins  these problems are known as the possible winner and necessary winner problems  respectively  introduced by konczak and lang         depending on the interpretation of c
wins  the possible necessary winner problems are further divided into two sub problems 
one is called the possible neccessary unique winner problem  here unique is often omitted
when causing no confusion   in which c wins means that c is the only winner of the election  the other is called the possible necessary co winner problem  in which c wins means
that c is one of the winners  it should be noted that the answer depends on the voting
rule used  previous research has also investigated the setting where there is uncertainty
about the voting rule  here  a necessary  possible  winner is an alternative that wins for any
 some  realization of the rule  lang  pini  rossi  venable    walsh         in this paper 
we will not study this setting  that is  the rule is always fixed 
while these problems are motivated by the above observations on the impracticality
of submitting linear orders  they also relate to preference elicitation and manipulation  in
preference elicitation  the idea is that  instead of having each agent report its preferences
all at once  we ask them simple queries about their preferences  e g  do you prefer a
to b    until we have enough information to determine the winner  preference elicitation has found many applications in multiagent systems  especially in combinatorial auctions  for overviews  see parkes        sandholm   boutilier        and in voting settings
as well  conitzer   sandholm            b  conitzer         the problem of deciding
whether we can terminate preference elicitation and declare a winner is exactly the necessary winner problem  manipulation is said to occur when an agent casts a vote that
does not correspond to its true preferences  in order to obtain a result that it prefers  by
the gibbardsatterthwaite theorem  gibbard        satterthwaite         for any reasonable voting rule  there are situations where an agent can successfully manipulate the rule 
to prevent manipulation  one approach that has been taken in the computational social
choice community is to study whether manipulation is  or can be made  computationally
hard  bartholdi  tovey    trick      a  bartholdi   orlin        hemaspaandra   hemaspaandra        elkind   lipmaa        conitzer  sandholm    lang        faliszewski 
hemaspaandra    schnoor        zuckerman  procaccia    rosenschein        xia  zuckerman  procaccia  conitzer    rosenschein        faliszewski  hemaspaandra    schnoor 
       the fundamental questions that have been studied here are given the other votes 
can a coalition of agents cast their votes so that alternative c wins   so called constructive manipulation  and given the other votes  can this coalition of agents cast their votes
so that alternative c does not win   so called destructive manipulation   these problems
correspond to the possible winner problem and  the complement of  the necessary winner
problem  respectively  to be precise  they only correspond to restricted versions of the possible winner problem and  the complement of  the necessary winner problem in which some
of the partial orders are linear orders  the nonmanipulators votes  and the other partial
orders are empty  the manipulators votes   however  if there is uncertainty about parts
  

fidetermining possible and necessary winners given partial orders

of the nonmanipulators votes  or if parts of the manipulators votes are already fixed  for
example due to preference elicitation   then they can correspond to the general versions of
the possible winner problem and  the complement of  the necessary winner problem 
another related problem is the evaluation problem  conitzer et al          we are
given a probability distribution over each voters vote  and we are asked for the probability
that a given alternative wins  it has been shown that for any anonymous voting rule  when
the number of alternatives is no more than a constant  there is a polynomial time algorithm
that solves the evaluation problem  when the number of alternatives is not bounded
above by a constant  the problem becomes  p hard for plurality  borda  and copeland
rules  hazon  aumann  kraus    wooldridge         the complexity of influencing the
distribution over the voters votes on multiple binary issues to make a given alternative
 a valuation of all these issues  win has also been studied  erdelyi  fernau  goldsmith 
mattei  raible    rothe         the possible necessary winner problems are related to the
evaluation problem in the following way  if every voter assigns positive probability to
every one of the linear orders that extend her partial order  then  for any alternative c  c
is a possible winner if and only if the probability that c wins the election is positive  c is
a necessary winner if and only if the probability that c wins the election is    we must
note that this reduction from the possible necessary winner problem to the evaluation
problem is in general not polynomial  because for any partial order  it is possible that
there are exponentially many linear orders that extend it  for example  if the partial
order is empty  then any linear order is an extension of it  however  in this paper  we
prove results that show that the possible necessary winner problem is hard even when the
number of undetermined pairs in each partial order is a constant  so that there are in fact
only polynomially many linear orders that extend it  hence  our hardness results also imply
 only np  hardness results for the evaluation problem 
because of the variety of different interpretations of the possible and necessary winner
problems  it is not surprising that there have already been significant studies of these problems  two main settings have been studied  see walsh       for a good survey   in the first
setting  the number of alternatives is bounded  and the votes are weighted  here  for the
borda  veto  copeland  maximin  stv  and plurality with runoff rules  the possible winner
problem is np complete  for the stv and plurality with runoff rules  the necessary winner
problem is conp complete  conitzer et al         pini et al         walsh         however 
in many elections  votes are unweighted  that is  each agents vote counts the same   if
the votes are unweighted  and the number of alternatives is bounded  then the possible and
necessary winner problems can always be solved in polynomial time  assuming the voting
rule can be executed in polynomial time  conitzer et al         walsh         hence  the
other setting that has been studied is that where the votes are unweighted and the number
of alternatives is not bounded  this is the setting that we will study in this paper  in this setting  the possible and necessary winner problems are known to be hard for stv  bartholdi
  orlin        pini et al         walsh         computing whether an alternative is a
possible or necessary condorcet winner can be done in polynomial time  konczak   lang 
       however  at the time of the conference version of this work  xia   conitzer        
for most of the other common rules  there were no prior results  except for the fact that the
  

fixia   conitzer

problems are easy for many of these rules when each partial order is either a linear order
or empty  that is  the standard manipulation problem   
    our contributions
in this paper  we characterize the complexity of the possible and necessary winner problems
for some of the most important other rulesspecifically  a class of positional scoring rules 
copeland  maximin  bucklin  ranked pairs  voting trees  and plurality with runoff  we
show that the possible winner problems are np complete for all these rules except the
possible unique winner problem with respect to plurality with runoff  we also show that the
necessary winner problems are conp complete for the copeland  ranked pairs  and voting
trees  and the necessary co winner problem is conp complete for plurality with runoff  for
the remaining cases  we present polynomial time algorithms  our results are summarized

table    summary of complexity of possible necessary winner problems with respect to
common voting rules  unless otherwise mentioned  the results do not depend on
whether we consider the unique winner or the co winner version of the problem 

   an earlier paper  konczak   lang        studied these problems for positional scoring rules  and claimed
that the problems are polynomial time solvable for positional scoring rules  however  there was a subtle
mistake in their proofs  we will show that the possible winner problem is in fact np complete for some
positional scoring rules  we will also give a correct proof that the necessary winner problem is indeed
polynomial time solvable for all positional scoring rules

fidetermining possible and necessary winners given partial orders

this paper is a significant extension of the conference version of this work  xia  
conitzer         this extended version includes all the proofs  and the results on voting trees 
plurality with runoff  and k approval are new  the conference version also did not mention
plurality and veto  these results are easy and follow from known results  as explained in the
footnotes under the table 
    subsequent work since the conference version
since the conference version of this work  the complexity of the possible winner problem
with respect to any positional scoring rule has been fully characterized  betzler   dorn 
      baumeister   rothe         by the theorems of betzler and dorn         the possible
winner problem is np complete with respect to borda and k approval  still  these hardness
results do not directly imply the hardness results obtained for positional scoring rules in
this paperwe prove that the hardness results for borda and k approval hold even when
the number of undetermined pairs in each vote is no more than   
also  a special case of the possible and necessary winner problems where new alternatives
join the election after the voters preferences over the initial alternatives have been fully
revealed has been proposed and studied in the work of chevaleyre  lang  maudet  and
monnot         it has been shown that the possible winner with new alternatives problem
is np complete for maximin  copeland  xia  lang    monnot         and k approval when
k    and there are at least   new alternatives  chevaleyre  lang  maudet  monnot    xia 
       the problem is in p for bucklin  when k      xia  lang    monnot         borda 
and k approval  when k    or there are no more than two new alternatives   chevaleyre 
lang  maudet  monnot    xia        
meanwhile  a number of new results on the complexity of the unweighted coalitional
manipulation problem have also been obtained  specifically  the unweighted coalitional
manipulation problem has been shown to be np hard for copeland for any       
 except for         these results even hold with two manipulators   faliszewski et al        
        maximin  two manipulators  and ranked pairs  one manipulator   xia et al         
and a specific positional scoring rule  two manipulators   xia  conitzer    procaccia        
as we mentioned before  the unweighted coalitional manipulation problem is a special case
of the possible winner problem studied in this paper  where some partial orders are linear
orders and the others are empty   as a result  np hardness results for the unweighted
coalitional manipulation problem also imply np hardness of the possible winner problem
for these rules  we note that the np hardness results proved in this paper  except the
possible unique winner problem for plurality with runoff  hold even when for each partial
order  the number of pairs of alternatives for which the order is unknown is a constant 
therefore  the subsequent research on the unweighted coalitional manipulation does not
completely imply the np hardness results that we prove in this paper for the possible
winner problem for copeland  maximin  ranked pairs  and positional scoring rules 
elkind et al         showed that the possible winner problem also reduces to the swap
bribery problem  in which an interested party can pay voters to swap adjacent alternatives
   faliszewksi et al         also study the case of weighted coalitional manipulation with three alternatives
for copeland  and show that how hard this problem is depends both on  and whether we consider the
unique winner or the co winner variant of the problem  we do not study weighted votes in this paper

in their rankings  but the price to swap two alternatives depends on both the identity of
the alternatives and the identity of the voter  that is   with respect to a fixed voting rule 
the computational complexity of the swap bribery problem is at least as high as that of the
possible winner problem  in terms of polynomial time reductions 
the complexity of the possible winner problem has also been studied from a fixedparameter tractability perspective  for parameters such as the number of alternatives  the
number of voters  and the number of unknown pairs in each vote  betzler  hemmann   
niedermeier         finally  the counting version of the possible winner problem has also
been studied  bachrach  betzler    faliszewski        

   preliminaries
let c    c            cm   be the set of alternatives  or candidates   a linear order on c is
a transitive  antisymmetric  and total relation on c  the set of all linear orders on c is
denoted by l c   an n voter profile p on c consists of n linear orders on c  that is 
p    v            vn    where for every i  n  vi  l c   the set of all profiles on c is denoted
by p  c   in the remainder of the paper  m denotes the number of alternatives and n denotes
the number of voters 
a voting rule r is a function from the set of all profiles on c to the set of  nonempty 
subsets of c  that is  r   p  c    c     the following are some common voting rules 
    positional  scoring rules  a positional scoring rule is defined by a scoring vector
 sm     sm               sm  m   of m non negative integers  where  sm           sm  m  
for any vote v  l c  and any c  c  let s v  c     smp
 j   where j is the rank of
c in v   for any profile p    v            vn    let s p  c    ni   s vi   c   the rule will
select c  c so that s p  c  is maximized  some examples of positional scoring rules
are borda  for which the scoring vector is  m     m                 plurality  for which
the scoring vector is                    veto  for which the scoring vector is                    and
k approval     k  m      for which the scoring vector is                               in this
   z

paper  we assume that the scoring vector can be computed in polynomial time 
   copeland  for any two alternatives ci and cj   we can simulate a pairwise election
between them  by seeing how many votes rank ci ahead of cj   and how many rank cj
ahead of ci   ci wins if and only if the majority of votes rank ci ahead of cj   then 
an alternative receives one point for each win in a pairwise election   typically  an
alternative also receives half a point for each pairwise tie  but this will not matter for
our results   a winner is an alternative who has the highest score 
   maximin  a k a  simpson   let np  ci   cj   denote the number of votes that rank ci
ahead of cj in the profile p   a winner is an alternative c that maximizes min np  c  c    
c  c  c    c  
   bucklin  an alternative cs bucklin score is the smallest number k such that more
than half of the votes rank c among the top k alternatives  a winner is an alternative
who has the smallest bucklin score   sometimes  ties are broken by the number of
  

fidetermining possible and necessary winners given partial orders

votes that rank an alternative among the top k position  but for simplicity we will
not consider this tiebreaking rule here  
   ranked pairs  this rule first creates an entire ranking of all the alternatives  np  ci   cj  
is defined as for the maximin rule  in each step  we will consider a pair of alternatives
ci   cj that we have not previously considered  specifically  we choose the remaining
pair with the highest np  ci   cj    we then fix the order ci   cj   unless this contradicts
previous orders that we fixed  that is  it violates transitivity   we continue until we
have considered all pairs of alternatives  hence we have a full ranking   the alternative
at the top of the ranking wins 
   voting trees  a voting tree is a binary tree with m leaves  where each leaf is associated
with an alternative  in each round  there is a pairwise election between an alternative
ci and its sibling cj   if the majority of voters prefer ci to cj   then cj is eliminated 
and ci is associated with the parent of these two nodes  similarly  if the majority of
voters prefer cj to ci   then ci is eliminated  and cj is associated with the parent of
these two nodes  the alternative that is associated with the root of the tree  wins all
its rounds  wins  balanced voting trees are also known as cup  knockout tournaments
or single elimination tournaments 
   plurality with runoff  the rule has two steps  in the first step  all alternatives except
the two that are ranked in the top position for most times are eliminated  and the
votes transfer to the second round  in which the plurality rule  a k a  majority rule in
case of two alternatives  is used to select the winner 
   single transferable vote  stv   the election has m rounds  in each round  the alternative that gets the minimal plurality score drops out  and is removed from all of
the votes  so that votes for this alternative transfer to another alternative in the next
round   the last remaining alternative is the winner 
given a profile p   the pairwise score difference dp  c  c   of alternatives c and c is defined
as follows 
dp  c  c     np  c  c    np  c   c 
the subscript p is omitted when there is no risk of confusion  for a linear order v over
c  we let dv denote the pairwise score difference function of the profile that consists of a
single vote v   that is  dv   d v     it follows from the definition that d c  c     d c   c  
we note that although maximin  ranked pairs  and voting trees are based on pairwise scores 
they can also be computed by pairwise score differences in the same way  because for any
profile p of n votes  and any pair of alternatives  c  c    we have dp  c  c      np  c  c    n 
we adopt the parallel universes tiebreaking  conitzer  rognlie    xia        to define
the winning alternatives for the rules that have multiple rounds  i e   ranked pairs  voting
trees  plurality with runoff  and stv   that is  an alternative c is a winner if and only if
there exists a way to break ties in all of the steps such that c is the winner  for example 
an alternative c is a winner for a voting tree  if there exists a way to break ties in the
pairwise elections in the voting process  such that c wins  a partial order on c is a reflexive 
transitive  and antisymmetric relation on c  we say a linear order v extends a partial order
o if o  v  
  

fixia   conitzer

definition   a linear order v on c extends a partial order o on c if for every pair of
alternatives c  c  c  c o c  c v c  
throughout the paper we use the following notation  let v denote a linear order over c 
let o denote a partial order over c  let p denote a profile of linear orders  let pposet denote
a profile of partial orders 

   possible necessary winners
we are now ready to define possible  necessary  winners  which were first introduced by
konczak and lang        
definition   given a profile of partial orders pposet    o            on   on c  we say that an
alternative c  c is      a possible winner if there exists p    v            vn   such that each vi
extends oi   and r p      c       a necessary winner if for every p    v            vn   such that
each vi extends oi   r p      c       a possible co winner if there exists p    v            vn   such
that each vi extends oi   and c  r p        a necessary co winner if for any p    v            vn  
such that each vi extends oi   c  r p   
example   let there be three alternatives  c    c    c     three partial orders are illustrated
in figure    let pposet    o    o    o     c  is a possible  co  winner of pposet with respect to
plurality  because we can complete o  by adding c   c    complete o  by adding c   c   
and complete o  by adding c   c  and c   c    then  c  is the only winner  however  c  is
not a necessary  co  winner  because we can complete o  by adding c   c    complete o  by
adding c   c    and complete o  by adding c   c  and c   c    then  c  is the only winner

however  if we let pposet
   o    o    o     then c  is the  only  necessary winner  because
c  will be ranked first in at least two votes 

now  we define the computational problems studied in this paper 
definition   define the problem possible winner  pw  with respect to voting rule r to be 
given a profile pposet of partial orders and an alternative c  we are asked whether or not c
is a possible winner for pposet with respect to r 
necessary winner  nw   possible co winner  pcw   and necessary co winner  ncw 
are defined similarly 
a natural first question is how these problems are related to each other  it turns out
that  holding the voting rule fixed  there exists a polynomial time turing reduction from
nw to pcw  that is  if pcw is in p  then nw is also in p 
proposition   for any voting rule r  if computing pcw with respect to r is in p  then
computing nw with respect to r is also in p  
  

fidetermining possible and necessary winners given partial orders

proof  because r never outputs   an alternative c is a necessary unique winner with respect
to r if and only if for every alternative d  d    c   d is not a possible co winner  therefore  if
we have a polynomial time algorithm that solves the pcw problem with respect to r  then
to solve the nw problem  we simply run the algorithm for every alternative d  d    c   if
any d    c is a possible co winner  then we output that c is not a necessary unique winner 
otherwise  we output that c is a necessary unique winner 
 
there is no similar relationship between the pw and ncw problems  it is true that if
some alternative d  d    c  is a possible unique winner  then c is not a necessary co winner 
however  it is possible that even if no alternative d  d    c  is a possible unique winner  c
is still not a necessary co winner  for example  let pposet    c   c   c    c   c   c    
because pposet is already composed of linear orders  it has only one extension  itself   it
follows that there is no possible unique winner for pposet with respect to plurality  but clearly
c  is not a necessary co winner  more generally  we have the following proposition  which
says that for any pair of different problems x  y   pw  pcw  nw  ncw   the answer to
y cannot be computed from only the answers to x for all alternatives  unless x  nw and
y  pcw   this holds even when the rule is plurality  
proposition   suppose m     let x  y   p w  p cw  n w  n cw   be such that     x  y
and     x  pcw or y  nw  there exist two profiles pposet and pposet of partial orders  with
 pposet      pposet     such that     for every alternative c  the answers to x with respect to
plurality are the same for both pposet and pposet   and     there exists an alternative d for
which the answers to y with respect to plurality for pposet and pposet are different 
proof  the proof is by construction  for any partial order o on c  we let t op o  denote
the set of alternatives c for which there exists at least one extension of o where c is in the
top position  for any set c   c  we define oc  to be an arbitrary partial order such that
t op oc      c    for simplicity  we write oc for o c     for example  when m      we can let
oc    o c      c   c   c    that is  oc  is a linear order  as another example  o c   c    is
the partial order that is obtained from  c   c   c    by removing c   c   
let d   c    we next specify the profiles pposet and pposet for the following  exhaustive 
list of cases  x  y   
  pw  nw  and  pw  ncw       let pposet be composed of   copies of oc    c  is a
necessary unique co winner      let pposet    oc    oc    oc    o c   c      o c   c       c  is

   hardness results
in this section  we prove that pw  pcw  is np complete with respect to a class of positional
scoring rules  copeland  maximin  bucklin  ranked pairs  and voting trees  nw  ncw  is
conp complete with respect to copeland  ranked pairs  and voting trees  and pw is npcomplete and ncw is conp complete with respect to plurality with runoff  for positional
scoring rules  we will not show that pw is hard for all positional scoring rulesin fact  for
plurality and veto  pw is easy  rather  we will give a sufficient condition on a positional
scoring rule under which pw is hard  most notably  borda satisfies this condition  kapproval does not satisfy this condition  and we will provide a distinct proof for pw  pcw 
with respect to k approval  k       similarly for voting trees  we provide a necessary
condition under which the hardness results hold  and most notably  balanced voting trees
satisfy this condition  all of these results  except the one for pw with respect to plurality
with runoff  hold even when the partial orders are almost linear orders  that is  the
number of undetermined pairs in each partial order is bounded above by a constant 
   after the conference version of this paper  xia   conitzer         betzler and dorn proved a dichotomy
theorem for possible winner problems with respect to positional scoring rules  betzler   dorn        
according to their theorem  pw with respect to k approval  k     is np complete  in this paper  we
prove that the problem is np complete  even when the number of undetermined pairs in each vote is no
more than   

  

fidetermining possible and necessary winners given partial orders

all the hardness results are proved by reductions from the exact   cover  x c 
problem  except for the result for k approval  which is proved by a reduction from   sat 
x c and   sat are known to be np complete  garey   johnson         the two problems
are defined as follows 
definition    x c  we are given a set v    v            vq   and a collection s    s            st   
where for each i  t  si    vl i      vl i      vl i       v  with    l i      l i      l i      q  we
are asked whether we can cover all of the elements in v with non overlapping sets in s 
definition      sat  we are given a formula in conjunctive normal form  f   c  
       ct over binary variables x            xq   where for any j  t  cj is called a clause  for any
j  t  cj   lj   lj   lj    where for any              lj is called a literal  and there exists
i  q such that either lj   xi or lj   xi   we are asked whether there exists a valuation
of the variables under which f is true 
in each proof  the election instance that we construct from an arbitrary x c  or   sat 
instance consists of two parts  the first part is a set of partial orders that encode the x c
 or   sat  instance   for example  in some of our pw reductions from x c  the first part
is structured as follows  in order for c to win  there is an alternative c that needs to be
placed in a high position in the extensions of the partial orders at least some number
of times  however  for each of the partial orders  there is a set of three alternatives such
that if we put c in a high position in an extension of that partial order  then these three
alternatives must be ranked in even higher positions  that is  c pushes up these three
alternatives in the extension   these sets of three alternatives that must sometimes be
pushed up correspond to the sets of three elements in the x c instance  the pw instance
is set up in such a way that if the same x c element alternative is pushed up by c in two
different votes in the first part  then c cannot win  thus  the sets of alternatives that we
push up must be disjoint  and the instance is set up in such a way that we need to put c in
a high position often enough that the pushed up   sets actually must constitute an exact
cover  the second part is a set of linear orders  that is  in the second part  everything is
determined  whose purpose is  informally stated  to adjust the scores of the alternatives so
that we get the properties just described 
first we introduce some notation to represent the set of all pairwise comparisons in a
linear order 
definition   for any set  a            al    let o a            al       ai   aj     i   j  
that is  o a            al   is the set of all ordered pairs consistent with the linear order a  
       al   for example  o a  b  c      a  b    b  c    a  c    the following notation will be
frequently used in the proofs 
definition   for any set a and any partition a            ak of a  let o a            ak   denote
an arbitrary linear order on a that is consistent with a   a          ak  
   typically  we define the partial orders by first defining some linear orders and then removing some of
the pairwise ordering constraints 

  

fixia   conitzer

the proofs that make use of this notation only use the fact that o a            ak   is consistent
with a          ak   so that the order within each ai  i  k  does not matter  for example 
let a    a  b  c  d   a     a   a     b  c   a     d   there are two linear orders that are
consistent with a   a   a    they are a  b  c  d and a  c  b  d  o a    a    a   
can denote either of them  e g   o a    a    a      a  b  c  d  sometimes we use the
notation others to denote the set of all objects that are not mentioned in the context 
for example  o a    a    a      o others  a    a      o a    others  a      o a    a    others  
usually  a positional scoring rule is defined for a fixed number of alternatives  that is 
m is fixed   if we hold m fixed  then there exist polynomial time algorithms for both pw
and nw  walsh        conitzer et al          however  there are positional scoring rules
that are defined for any number of alternativesfor example  borda  plurality  and veto 
for such positional scoring rules  the number of alternatives is not bounded  and indeed  we
will prove that pw is not always easy with respect to such rules  to study the complexity
of social choice problems that involve a growing number of alternatives  it is necessary to
associate a scoring vector with every natural number of alternatives  in the remainder of the
paper  a positional scoring rule r consists of a sequence of scoring vectors   s     s           such
that for each i  n   si is the scoring vector for i alternatives  the next theorem provides a
sufficient condition on a positional scoring rule for pw to be np complete  in this paper 
all the pw pcw problems are in np  and all the nw ncw problems are in conp  this
follows from the fact that  given an extension of the partial orders to linear orders  we can
compute the winner s  in polynomial time for the rules studied in this paper  with this
in mind  we only prove the hardness direction in the np completeness conp completeness
proofs  there do exist rules for which computing the winner s  is np hard  for example 
dodgsons rule  bartholdi  tovey    trick      b  hemaspaandra  hemaspaandra    rothe 
      and youngs rule  rothe  spakowski    vogel         but we will not study any rules
for which computing the winners is hard here 
theorem   let r be a positional scoring rule with scoring vectors   s     s            suppose
there exists a polynomial function f  x  such that for any x  n  there exist l and k with
x  l  f  x  and k  l     and satisfy the following conditions 
     sl  k    sl  k         sl  k        sl  k         sl  k        sl  k          
     sl  k        sl  k          
then  pw and pcw are both np complete with respect to r  even when the number of
undetermined pairs in each vote is no more than   
proof  given an x c instance v    v            vq    s    s            st    let q      l  f  q     
 where q is the number of elements in the x c instance  satisfy the two conditions in
the assumption  and let k  l    satisfy  sl  k    sl  k         sl  k        sl  k       
 sl  k        sl  k           and  sl  k        sl  k           let k     sl  k    sl  k      and
k     sl  k        sl  k       we construct the pw instance as follows 
alternatives  c    c  w  d   v  a  where d and a    a            alq    are auxiliary
alternatives 
first part  p    of the profile  for each j  t  choose an arbitrary set bj  c  si  w  d  
  

fidetermining possible and necessary winners given partial orders

with  bj     k     we define a partial order oj as follows 
oj   o bj   w  si   d  others      w    sj   d   
that is  oj is a partial order that agrees with bj  w  sj  d  others  except that the
pairwise relations between  w  sj   and  w  d  are not determined  and these are the only  
undetermined relations   let p     o            ot   
second part  p    of the profile  we first give the properties that we need p  to satisfy 
we will show how to construct p  in polynomial time later in the proof  all votes in p 
are linear orders  let p     o bj   w  sj   d  others    j  t   that is  p    p      t  is an
extension of p   in fact  p  is the set of linear orders that we started with to obtain p   
before removing some of the pairwise relations   p  is a set of linear orders such that the
following holds for q   p   p   
    for every i  q   sl  q  c    sl  q  vi      k     sl  q  w    sl  q  c

   k    k     k   

    for every i  q  the scores of vi and w  c are higher than those of the other alternatives
in any extension of p   p   
    p  s size is polynomial in t   q 
suppose there exists an extension p  of p  such that c is the winner for p   p    for each
i  q  vi is not ranked higher than w more than once in p    because otherwise the total
score of vi will be higher than or equal to the total score of c  we recall that the score
difference between w and c in p   p  is  q    k    k     k    therefore  if there exists j  t
such that in the extension of oj   w is ranked above c  and is ranked below some alternative
in sj   then there must exist an alternative in v that is ranked above w at least two times
in p    which contradicts the assumption that c is the winner  it follows that in order for
the total score of w to be lower than the total score of c  w is ranked lower than d at least
q

  times  let i denote the set of subscripts of votes in p  for which w is ranked lower than
d  then  si    si   i  i  is a solution to the x c instance 
conversely  given a solution to the x c instance  let i be the set of indices of si that
are included in the x c  then  a solution to the possible winner instance can be obtained
by ranking d ahead of w exactly in the votes with subscripts in i  therefore  c is a possible
winner if and only if there exists a solution to the x c problem  which means that pw and
pcw are np complete with respect to positional scoring rules that satisfy the conditions
stated in the theorem 
for possible co winner  we replace     by the following condition 
    for every i  q  s q  c   s q  vi     k    s q  w   s q  c     q    k    k    
next  we show how to construct the profile p  so that it satisfies the three conditions 
p  consists of the following three parts 
the first part  p    let mv denote the cyclic permutation among v   c  w   that
is  mv   c  w  v   v          vq  c  for any j  n  and any e 
v   c  w   we let mv   e    e  and mvj  e    mv  mvj   e    the first part of p  is
p    mv  p     mv   p            mvq    p     it follows that for any e  e  v   c  w  
 sl  p   p    e     sl  p   p    e

the second part  p    choose an arbitrary set b  c  d  w  c  such that  b    k

putting p  and p  together  the condition     in the description of p  is satisfied 
the third part  p    p  is defined in a way such that in p    the total scores of each
pair of alternatives in v   c  w  are the same  and the total score of any alternative
in v   c  w  is significantly higher than the total score of any alternative in a   d  
let mo be a cyclic permutation among a   d   that is  we let mo   d  a  
a          alq   d  let v    o v  c  w  others   we define the third part p  as
follows 
p      p   p   p           mvi  moj  v       i  q      j  l  q    
we note that  p   p   p        is polynomial in t   q  therefore  the size of p  is
polynomial in t   q 
 
theorem   provides a sufficient condition on positional scoring rules for pw and pcw
to be np complete  it can be applied to prove np completeness of pw and pcw for borda 
as the following corollary shows 
corollary   pw and pcw are np complete with respect to borda  even when the number
of undetermined pairs in each vote is no more than

claim follows 
 
theorem   does not apply to k approval  as we noted in table    the possible and

that for any fixed k  n with k     pw and pcw with respect to k approval are npcomplete 
theorem   for any fixed natural number k     pw and pcw are np complete with

proof  we first prove the np hardness for pw with respect to   approval  then  we show
how to extend the proof to any k  n  where k    
we prove the np hardness by a reduction from   sat  given an instance of   sat 
where there are q variables x            xq and a formula f   c          ct   we construct an
instance of pw with respect to   approval as follows  without loss of generality  we assume
that q   t     generally  for any fixed k  n  we can assume that q   t  k   and that in
each clause of f   no variable appears more than once

where c    c            ct    x    x            xq   x            xq    and for each i  q 
 xi    x i           xti   x i           xti    xi    x i           xti   x i           xti   
 di    d i           dti    di    d i           dti   
in words  c represents the set of clauses in f   xi and xi represent the values that the
boolean variable xi can take  xi  respectively  xi   represents a set of duplicates of
xi  respectively  xi    di  respectively  di   represents a set of auxiliary alternatives
that are associated with xi  respectively  xi   
first part p  of the profile  for each i  q  we let vi   o c  xi   xi   others  
then  we obtain oi by removing  xi   xi   from vi   that is  in any extension of oi  
c must be in the top position  and one of xi and xi must be in the second position
 and the other  in the third   we will see later in the proof that the two extensions
of oi correspond to the two valuations of the variable xi   i e   xi being ranked in the
second position  while xi is ranked in the third position  corresponds to xi   f alse 
for each i  q  we define the following linear orders 
vi    o xi   d i   x i   x i   others 
   j  t  vij   o xij    dji   xji   xji   others 
then  we obtain oi  from vi  by removing  xi   d i     x i   x i    for each    j  t 
we obtain oij from vij by removing  xij    dji     xji   xji    we define vij  and oij 
similarly by adding  to each alternative explicitly written in the definition of vij and
oij   respectively  that is  the alternatives that are not in others   for example 
vi     o xi   d i   x i   x i   others  
for each j  t  let fj   x  x   x          xq  xq be the mapping such
that for any x  x  fj  x  is obtained from x by adding j to the superscript of
x  for example  fj  x      xji and fj  x      xj    for each j  t  let wj  
o c  fj  lj     fj  lj     fj  lj     others   then  we obtain qj from wj by removing
 fj  lj     fj  lj     fj  lj       fj  lj     fj  lj     fj  lj    
that is  in any extension of qj   c must be in the top position  and one of  fj  lj     fj  lj    
fj  lj     must be in the second position  we will see that the extensions of qj correspond to how cj  the jth clause  is satisfied under a valuation of x            xq  
we let p     o            oq     oij   oij    i  q  j  t    qj   j  t

it can be checked that in p    p    every alternative c  c    c  is ranked in the two top

of oij   respectively  oij   in p   
proof  for any i  q  we prove the claim by induction on j  we only prove the case where
g xi     true  the case where g xi     f alse can be proved similarly 
suppose g xi     true  by definition  xi is ranked in the second position in the extension of oi in p    we recall that s   p    xi     q   t      s   p    c      because c is the
unique winner  xi is not ranked in the top two positions in any extension of p     oi   
specifically  xi is not ranked in the top two positions in the extension of oi     we recall
that xi  d i in oi     therefore  d i is not ranked in the top two positions in the
extension of oi    otherwise  xi would also be ranked in the top two positions  which immediately prevents c from being the unique winner   we also note that xi   d i   x i   x i
are the only four alternatives that can be ranked in the top two positions in an extension of
oi     it follows that in the extension of oi     x i   x i are ranked in the top two positions 
this means that the claim holds for j     
suppose the claim holds for all j with j  j    following similar reasoning as in the
case where j      we can prove that the claim holds for j   j       more precisely  by


the induction hypothesis  xji is ranked in the top two positions in the extension of oij    


therefore  xji is not ranked in the top two positions in the extension of oij      otherwise

the score of xji is at least as large as the score of c  which means that c is not a unique




winner   we recall that xji  dji    in oij       therefore  dji    is not ranked in the


top two positions in the extension of oij      otherwise xji must also be ranked in the
top two positions  which immediately prevents c from being the unique winner   we also




note that xji   dji      xji      xji    are the only four alternatives that can be ranked in


the top two positions in an extension of oij       it follows that in the extension of oij      


xji    and xji    are ranked in the top two positions  this means that the claim holds for
j   j      
therefore  the claim holds for every j  t 
 
we are now ready to show that under g  all the clauses are satisfied  let j be a number
no more than t  if xji is ranked in the second position in the extension of qj   then we must
have that g xi     true  if not  then  from claim    xji is ranked in the top two positions in
the extension of oij   which means that xji is ranked in the top two positions in p   p  at least
twice  once in oij   and once in qj   it follows that s   p    xji    q t     q t   s   p    c  
which contradicts the assumption that c is the unique winner  similarly  if in the extension of
  

fixia   conitzer

qj   xji is ranked in the second position  then we must have that g xi     f alse  this means
that under g  every clause cj is satisfied by the valuation of the variable that corresponds
to the alternative that is ranked in the second position in the extension of qj   hence  f is
satisfied 
for pcw  we simply replace s   p    xi     s   p    xi     s   p    xji     s   p    xji    
s   p    xji     s   p    xji     q   t    in the definition for p  by s   p    xi     s   p    xi    
s   p    xji     s   p    xji     s   p    xji     s   p    xji     q   t    
the reduction for k     is similar to the case where k      for any   sat instance  let
p  and p  be the profile of partial orders defined for the case k      for k      we add
 p   p      k     new alternatives to the instance  and in each partial order in p   p    we
let the top k    positions be occupied by the new alternatives  and we put the remaining
new alternatives in the bottom positions  such that none of the new alternatives is ranked
in the top k positions more than once  let p  and p  denote the profiles of partial orders
obtained in this way  it follows that c is a possible  co  winner for p   p  with respect to
k approval if and only if c is a possible  co  winner for p   p  with respect to   approval 
 
theorem   pw and pcw are np complete and nw and ncw are conp complete with
respect to copeland  even when the number of undetermined pairs in each vote is at most
  
proof  we first prove the pw and ncw parts  in one reduction from x c  without loss
of generality  we can always assume that in the x c instance  t is odd and t   q  because
if not  then we make the following changes to the x c instance 

and   t  q  sets
 if t   q  then we add   t  q  dummy elements v            v  tq

 if q   t  then we add q  t copies of s   
 if q   t and t is even  then we add three dummy elements v    v    v    and three copies
of s     v    v    v    
in the new x c instance  t   q  t is odd  the size of the instance is polynomial in the size
of the old one  and the new x c instance has a feasible solution if and only if the old one
has 
given an x c instance v    v            vq    s    s            st    where q   t and t is odd  we
construct a pw instance as follows

let p  denote the profile that extends p  such that in each vote d and si are ranked
higher than w and c  that is  p     o  v   si    d  si   w  c  b  a    i  t   we make the
following observations on each pairwise election 
 w always defeats c  d  b  a  and for each i  q  dp  p   vi   w      
 c always defeats v  b  always loses to a  and dp  p   d  c

 b always defeats d  v  a  and due to its cyclic order in the profile  bj always defeats
bj             bj      t     where for any i  n  bi   bi  t   and always loses to the other
 
alternatives in b 
therefore  in p   p    the total number of pairwise elections won by each alternative is 
 w wins  b     a         t 
 c wins  v     b    q    t    t

all lose to b 
 any b  b wins at most      b         a     v             t    q     pairwise elections 
we recall that in the x c instance t   q  which means in p   p    the winners are
 w  c   in order for c to be the unique winner  the only possibility is for c to win the
q
pairwise election against d by putting c  d in at least votes in p    however  when we
 
put c ahead of d in a vote corresponding to si   for all v  si the pairwise score difference
between w and v increases by    moreover  if w  v for some v  v at least twice in an
  

fixia   conitzer

extension p  of p    then dp  p   v  w      which means that w defeats v in their pairwise
election  in this case  w would win  m     pairwise elections  which means that c cannot
be the unique winner  therefore  c is a possible unique winner if and only if there exists
q
an extension p  of p  such that c  d in exactly votes in p    and the corresponding si
 
do not overlap  that is  they constitute an exact cover of v  this means that pw has a
solution if and only if the x c problem has a solution  so pw is np complete 
because in the above reduction  w would always be a co winner if c is not the unique
winner  ncw is conp complete  for pcw and nw  we just need to slightly modify the
reduction for pw and ncw  let  a    t    and keep the rest unchanged  then  w will
initially win  t     pairwise elections  and c is a possible co winner  w is not the necessary
unique winner  if and only if there exists a feasible solution to the x c instance 
 
theorem   pw and pcw are np complete with respect to bucklin  even when the number
of undetermined pairs in each vote is at most    
proof 
first  we give a reduction from x c to pw  given any x c instance v  
 v            vq    s    s            st    we construct a pw instance as follows 
alternatives  w  d  v   c  w   where w    w            wq      d    d            dq     
first part p  of the profile  for each i  t  we start with o w            wq     si   c   v  
si    d   and then obtain a partial order by removing the relations in

second part p  of the profile 
 t copies of v  c  others

we note that the number of undetermined pairs in each vote is no more than     notice

q
 p   p       t  
     and w  is ranked within top q     positions in t       votes
 
 
in any extension of p   p    therefore  in order for c to win  c  wq  must hold in at
q
least votes in the extension of p    however  whenever we put c ahead of wq  in a vote 
 
we are forcing the alternatives in the si corresponding to that vote be ranked within top q
positions  if some v  v is ranked within top q positions at least twice in an extension of
q
p    then overall it will be ranked within top q positions in at least t       votes  which
 
means c will not be the unique winner 
if there exists a feasible solution to the x c problem  then we can put c ahead of wq 
in the votes corresponding to this solution  so that we obtain an extension p  of p  such
q
that c is ranked within top q     positions in votes  while for any v  v  v is ranked within
 
top q  and  in fact  the first q      positions just once  as a result  c is the unique winner
of the profile p   p    because no other alternative is ranked within top q     positions in

q
at least t   votes  conversely  if c is the unique winner in some profile p   p    then
 
p  corresponds to a feasible solution to the x c problem  therefore  pw with respect to
bucklin is np complete 
q
for pcw  we just need to modify the reduction slightly  by changing the last     votes
 
from  d  w   others  to  d          dq  w   others   in this case  the bucklin score
of w  is q      which means c can at best hope to be a co winner  as a result  pcw is also
np complete 
 
to prove our hardness results for maximin  ranked pairs  and voting trees  we present
two helpful lemmas  we first show that given any pair of alternatives c  c   there exist two
linear orders that increase d c  c   by two while keeping all other pairwise score differences
unchanged  this lemma has been used previously  mcgarvey        conitzer   sandholm 
    a   we will use this technique in the second  score adjusting  part of the reductions
for maximin  ranked pairs  and voting trees 
lemma   given any profile p and any pair of different alternatives c  c   let the remaining
alternatives be  c            cm     let p  be the profile consisting of p plus the following two
votes 
    c  c  c          cm     and
    cm          c   c  c   
then  dp   c  c     dp  c  c        and for any alternatives d  d such that  d  d    
   c  c   
dp   d  d     dp  d  d   
this lemma tells us that the pairwise score differences can be changed almost arbitrarily 
the only constraint is that the parity of the pairwise score differences remains the same 
the following lemma is a direct corollary 
lemma    the main theorem in mcgarvey        given a profile p and any skewsymmetric function f   c  c  z  that is  f  c    c      f  c    c    for all c    c     such
that for all pairs of alternatives c  c  c  f  c  c    dp  c  c   are all even  or all odd   then
there exists a profile p  such that
    p    

 p


   f  c  c    dp  c  c         
  c c

   dp p    f  
that is  for any skew symmetric function f such that for all pairs of alternatives  c  c  
 with c    c    f  c  c    dp  c  c   has the same parity  we can change the pairwise score
 p


differences from dp to f by adding no more than
   f  c  c  dp  c  c       votes to p  
  c c
here  the factor    comes from the fact that for any pair of alternatives c and c   the absolute
value of the difference between f and dp is counted twice  i e    f  c  c    dp  c  c     
 f  c   c   dp  c   c    in fact  it is possible to obtain even tighter bounds on the needed size
of p   erdos   moser         but for the purpose of our np hardness proofs this does not
matter 
  

fixia   conitzer

now we are ready to prove the hardness results for maximin and ranked pairs  as we
mentioned in the beginning of this section  in all hardness proofs in this section  the profile
consists of p  and p    where p  is a set of partial orders used to encode the x c instance 
and p  is a set of linear orders used to adjust the scores of the alternatives  for maximin 
ranked pairs  and voting trees  p  is used to adjust the pairwise score differences  we do not
explicitly give p  in the reductions for these rules  instead  we present the properties of p   
then appeal to lemma   to assert that p  does exist  and can be constructed in polynomial
time 
theorem   pw and pcw are np complete with respect to maximin  even when the number of undetermined pairs in each vote is at most   
proof  we first prove that pw is np complete  given an x c instance v    v            vq   
s    s            st    we construct a pw instance as follows 
alternatives  v   c  w  w   
first part p  of the profile  for each i  t  we start with o w  si   c   v  si    w    and
subsequently obtain a partial order oi by removing the relations in  w    si   c   
second part p  of the profile  according to lemma    p  is defined to be a set of
votes such that the pairwise score differences of  o w  si   c   v   si    w     i  t   p 
satisfy 
 q
   for each i  q  d w  vi     t    d w   w    d v    w     t   
 
d w   c    t    

    d w  c    t 

    for all other pairwise scores not defined in      d l  r     
we note that the number of undetermined pairs in each vote is no more than   
lemma   implies that the size of p  is polynomial in q   t 
we note that the minimum pairwise score difference of w is d w  w     t     the
minimum pairwise score difference of w is also t      d w   v    
suppose there exists a profile p  extending p  such that c wins in p   p    if c is raised
q
higher than w in at least one and at most    votes in p    then  d c  w   t  and there
 
exists i  q such that d vi   w   t  the smallest pairwise score difference of vi    which
means that c is not the unique winner because vi is performing at least as well  if c is ranked
q
higher than w in at least     votes in p    then we still have d c  w     t      and there
 
exists i  q such that vi is ranked higher than w in at least two votes in p    which means
that d vi   w   t      the smallest pairwise score difference of vi    it follows that in this
case  c is not the unique winner because vi is performing at least as well  therefore  the
q
only way for c to win is to decrease d w  c  by raising c higher than w in exactly votes in
 
p    however  each time that we decrease d w  c  by   due to adding c  w to oi  p    for
each v  si   d w  v  is also decreased by two  because d w   c    t     decreasing d w  c 
to less than t    would not raise the minimum pairwise score difference of c  but if for
some i  q  d w  vi   is decreased by   or more  then the minimum pairwise score of vj is
  

fidetermining possible and necessary winners given partial orders

at least t      which means that in this case c cannot be the unique winner  therefore 
the sets si in the votes in p  where c  w cannot overlap  because there must be at least
q   of these votes  the corresponding subsets si constitute a feasible solution to the x c
instance 
conversely  suppose the x c instance has a solution  without loss of generality  let the
solution be  s            sq      we define an extension p  of p  by adding c  w in oi for all
i  q    and then adding w  si for all i   q    it follows that c is the unique winner for
the profile p   p  with respect to the maximin rule  therefore pw is np complete 
for pcw  we just need to slightly modify the above reduction  we replace the condition
d w  vi     t     by d w  vi     t when constructing p    therefore pcw is np complete   
theorem   pw and pcw are np complete and nw and ncw are conp complete with
respect to ranked pairs  even when the number of undetermined pairs in each vote is at most
  
proof  we first prove the np hardness of pw and ncw in one reduction  given an x c
instance v    v            vq    s    s            st    we construct a pw instance as follows 
alternatives  v   c  a  b  w  
first part p  of the profile  for each i  t  we start with o a  c  si   b  others   and
subsequently obtain a partial order oi by removing the relations in   a  c  si  b    
second part p  of the profile  according to lemma    p  is defined to be a set
of votes such that the pairwise score differences of  o a  c  si   b  others    i  t   p 
satisfy 
   for all i  q  d c  b    d w  a    d w  vi      t

   d a  c    t  

we note that the number of undetermined pairs in each vote is no more than   
lemma   implies that the size of p  is polynomial in q   t 
we note that d c  b   d w  a   and d w  vi    for every i  q  are much larger than the
remaining pairwise score differences in any extension of p   p    therefore  c  b  w  a 
and w  vi  for every i  q  are fixed first in any extension of p   p    it follows that in
the output  a linear order over c  for any extension of p   p    we must have that c  b 
w  a  and w  vi  for every i  q   we note that the only way for c to be the unique
 q
winner is to lock b  a before a  c  that is  d b  a  must be at least t         however 
 
whenever we let b  a in an extension of oi   we are forcing si  c  let p  be an extension
of p  such that c is the unique winner for the profile p   p   or  equivalently  such that
w is not a co winner for the profile p   p     we note that if there exists i  q such that
 q
 q
      t 
     d c  w  
vi  c in at least two votes in p    then d vi   c   t  
 
 
which means that w is a co winner  by locking vi  c before c  w   therefore  in p    we
  

fixia   conitzer

q
must have that b  a in exactly votes  and for all i  q  vi  c in exactly one vote  this
 
naturally corresponds to a solution to the x c instance 
conversely  suppose that the x c instance has a solution  without loss of generality  let
the solution be  s            sq      we define an extension p  of p  by adding b  a in oi for all
i  q    and then for all i   q    letting the extension of oi be  a  c  si  b  others  
it follows that c is the unique winner for this profile  and hence  w is not a co winner  
therefore  pw is np complete and ncw is conp complete with respect to ranked pairs 
for pcw and nw  we just need to slightly modify the above reduction by letting
 q
d b  a    t and for all i  q  letting d vi   c    t  
   
 
 
next  we consider voting trees  because a voting tree is defined for a fixed number
of alternatives  to study the complexity of the possible necessary winner problems with
respect to voting trees  we need to consider an infinite sequence of trees  one for each
natural number  representing the number of alternatives    therefore  we let a voting tree
rule t be composed of an infinite sequence of voting trees  t    t            where for any m  n 
tm is a voting tree for m alternatives  that is  tm is a binary tree that has m leaf nodes 
and each leaf is associated with an alternative  
for any t  n  a voting tree tm is t well spread if there exist t pairs of leaves  c    a            
 ct   at    such that for each i  t  ci and ai are siblings  we say that any leaf in such a pair
is a rich leaf  a voting tree is balanced if the depths of any pair of leaves differ at most by
one  and the number of leaves whose  unique  sibling is not a leaf is at most one 
example   two voting trees are illustrated in figure    the voting tree in  a  is   wellspread  and c  and c  are rich leaves  the voting tree in  b  is balanced and   well spread 
and all leaves except c  are rich leaves

f  x  such that for any x  n  there exists l  n with x  l  f  x  such that tl is x wellspread  then pw and pcw are np complete  and nw and ncw are conp complete with
respect to t   even when the number of undetermined pairs in each vote is at most    
   this is similar to the case of positional scoring rules  which are technically defined only for a specific
number of alternatives

the only way for c to win is to beat d in the first round  and not to meet any of  v            vq  
in later rounds  which can only happen if every vi is beaten by the corresponding ai in
the first round  this is because by item      for each i    i   d vi   ai      q      which
means that if for some i  q  vi wins in the first round  it will only be beaten by w or vj
for some j  q in subsequent rounds in this case the winner must be w  it follows that in
any extension of p  that makes c win  c must be ranked higher than d at least q   times 
however  if we rank c higher than d in an extension of oi   then in the same extension we
must have that si  ai   in order for every ai to defeat vi   for every i  q  vi can be ranked
higher than ai at most once in the extension of p    therefore  if there exists a profile p 
extending p  such that c is the unique winner  or co winner  in p   p    then the votes in
p  where c  d make up a feasible solution to the x c problem instance  conversely  for
any feasible solution to the x c problem instance  we can find a p  extending p  such that
c is the unique winner of the profile p   p  with respect to tij   therefore  pw and pcw
are np complete 
because if c is not the unique winner  then w is always the unique winner  therefore 
nw and ncw are conp complete 
 
from theorem    we immediately obtain the following hardness results for voting tree
rules composed of balanced trees  by setting f  x     x  because there will exist some integer
y such that  x   y   x  so in the balanced tree for  y alternatives there will be at least
x pairs of siblings  
corollary   pw and pcw are np complete and nw and ncw are conp complete with
respect to the voting tree rule that is composed of balanced binary trees  even when the
number of undetermined pairs in each vote is at most    
finally  we have the following theorems on the complexity of pw and ncw with respect
to plurality with runoff

q       times  and for each j  t  sj is ranked in the top position q times  it
does not matter how the remaining alternatives are ranked in p    
 p     we first obtain  according to lemma    a profile p   such that the pairwise

satisfy the following conditions 
   d d  c    d e  c      
   for all j  t  d c  sj       
by lemma    the size of p   is polynomial in p   t  next  we obtain p   from p  
by moving an alternative in e to the top position in each vote of p     in such a
way that each vote in p   ranks a different alternative in the top position  p   is
well defined  because  e    p     
for any profile p   and any alternative c   we let p lup  c   denote the plurality score of c in p  
that is  p lup  c   is the number of times where c is ranked in the top position in p   the subscript p is omitted when there is no risk of confusion  we make the following observations
on the profile  q copies of o d  sv   c  others      t copies of o d  e  c  others    p    p

we also note that in any extension of p   p    p lu c    q     
if the x c instance has a solution sj            sjq     then we construct a solution to the

 for each i  q  let vi    sjl  d   sv    sjl     c  others   where jl is such that

 for each j  t  with j    jl for all l  q     let vj    vj     sj  d  e  c  others  
we note that vj  and vj  extend q j and q j   respectively

also  we have that for each l  q    d c  sjl        it follows that the pairs that enter the
runoff  in some parallel universe  are  c  sj              c  sjq      and c wins all of these pairwise
elections  therefore  c is the unique winner for p   p   
next  we show how to convert a solution to the pw instance to a solution to the x c
instance  let p    p    p   be an extension of p  such that c is the unique winner for
p   p    where p      vi   i  q  extends p     and p      vj    j  t    vj    j  t 
extends p     we make the following sequence of claims 
claim   neither d nor e can enter the runoff  which means that the only pairs that could
potentially still enter the runoff are  c  sj    for some j  t 
proof  if d or e entered the runoff in some parallel universe  then it would defeat c
in the runoff  unless c is not even in the runoff  in which case c also does not win in this
parallel universe   contradicting that c is the unique winner 
 
claim   for each j  t  p lup   sj      
proof  if this does not hold  then we let j  be an index that maximizes p lup   sj    
it follows that p lup    sj        because p lup    sj        however  by putting sj  in the
top position in a partial order in p     we are forcing d c  sj    to be reduced by    which
means that sj  defeats c in their pairwise election  moreover  because  by claim    one of
the sj must enter the runoff  and because sj  has the maximum plurality score among the
alternatives in sv   sj  must be in the runoff in one of the parallel universes  however  c
cannot win in this parallel universe  which contradicts the assumption that c is the unique
winner 
 
claim   p lup   d       p lup   e    q   
proof  it follows from claim   that for each j  t  p lup  p   sj    q      therefore 
by claim   we must have that p lup  p   d   q     and p lup  p   e   q      the claim
follows 
 
claim   for any j  t  if p lup    sj       then p lup   sj      
proof  if p lup    sj      and sj enters the runoff in some parallel universe  then c
cannot win in that parallel universe  for the sake of contradiction  suppose p lup   sj      
by claim   and claim    sj enters the runoff in some parallel universe  which contradicts
the assumption that c is the unique winner 
 
claim   let x     sj   p lup    sj        p lup    sj         and x     sj   p lup    sj    
   p lup    sj         we have x   x    sv and  x      q   
  

fidetermining possible and necessary winners given partial orders

proof  let x     x     x     x     and x    t  x   x    by claim    for each
sj  sv    x   x     p lup    sj     p lup    sj        we recall that for each o  p     the
top ranked alternative in any extension of o must be either d or an element in sv   for each
q  p     the top ranked alternative in any extension of q must be d  e  or an element in
sv   we then use these observations to obtain two inequalities 
first  in order for c to be the unique winner  d cannot be in the top position in any vote
in p     therefore  all of the q top positions in p   must be taken by alternatives in sv  
now  any alternative in x  can take at most three of these top positions  any alternative
in x  takes none of these top positions by definition  and any alternative in sv    x   x   
takes one of these top positions  it follows that  x    x   q 
now  we apply a similar analysis to p     in order for c to be the unique winner  e
cannot be in the top position in more than  q   votes in p     leaving at least  t   q  
top positions to be filled  now  any alternative in x  takes none of these top positions  any
alternative in x  can take at most two of these top positions  claim     and any alternative
in sv    x   x    takes one of these top positions  it follows that  x    x    t   q   
by substituting q in the second inequality by the q in the first inequality  we obtain
 x     x       x    t  we recall that x    x    x    t  therefore  x       x    x    t  now
the first inequality becomes x   q   and the second inequality becomes x   t  q    it
follows from x    x    t that x    q   and x    t  q   
 
based on all these claims  we can now construct a solution to the x c instance  let
x     sj            sjq      from claim    claim     p       q  and the fact that every top position
in p   must be occupied by one of the alternatives in x    it follows that sj            sjq   is
a solution to the x c instance  therefore  pw with respect to plurality with runoff is
np complete 
 
theorem   ncw is conp complete with respect to plurality with runoff  even when the
number of undetermined pairs in each vote is at most   
proof  we prove conp hardness by a reduction from x c  given an x c instance v  
 v            vq    s    s            st    we construct a ncw instance as follows

first part p  of the profile  for each j  t  we start with o d  sj   c  others   and

follows 
 p     a set of t q        q   votes  such that c is ranked in the top position t    
times  d is ranked in the top position q      times  and for each i  q  vi is
ranked in the top position t times 
 p     we first obtain  according to lemma    a profile p   such that the pairwise
score differences of  o d  sj   c  others    j  t   p    p   satisfy the following
conditions 
   d c  d     t     
  

fixia   conitzer

   for all i  q  d vi   c      
by lemma    the size of p   is polynomial in t   q  next  we obtain p   from
p   by raising an alternative in e to the top position in each vote  in such a way
that each vote in p   ranks a different alternative in the top position 
we recall that for any profile p and any alternative c   p lup  c   denotes the number of
times that c is ranked in the top position in p   we make the following observations on
 o d  sj   c  others    j  t   p   
 d c  d     t      and for all i  q  d vi   c      
 p lu c    t      p lu d    t      q    for each i  q  p lu vi     t  for each e  e 
p lu e     
it follows from the observations that in any extension of p   p    c must enter the runoff 
also  in any extension  c defeats d in the pairwise election  let p   p   where p  is an
extension of p    be a profile in which c is not a co winner  we must have that d does not
enter the runoff  which means that p lup  p   d   t     it follows that c  d in at least q  
votes in p    however  by ranking c  d in a partial order oi   we are forcing c  si   now 
the pairs of alternatives that enter the runoff  in parallel universes  are  c  v              c  vq   
since c loses in all these pairwise elections in the runoff  because  by assumption  c is not
a co winner   we must have that for each vj   c  vj in at most one vote in p    hence  a
solution to the complement of the ncw instance naturally corresponds to a solution to the
x c instance  conversely  a solution to the x c instance corresponds to a solution to the
complement of the ncw instance  therefore  ncw with respect to plurality with runoff is
conp complete 
 

   polynomial time algorithms for possible and necessary winner
problems
in this section we present polynomial time algorithms for     nw and ncw with respect
to all positional scoring rules  maximin  and bucklin      pcw and nw with respect to
plurality with runoff  we recall that pw is np complete  theorem    and ncw is conpcomplete  theorem     both with respect to plurality with runoff 
we note that positional scoring rules  maximin  and bucklin are all based on some type
of scores  so if we can find an extension of the partial orders to linear orders so that the
score of c  denoted by s c   is no more than the score of another alternative w  then c is
not the  unique  winner in this profile  and hence c is not a necessary winner  therefore 
in the following algorithms for these rules  we check all alternatives w    c  and try to make
s c   s w  as low as possible on a vote by vote basis  or equivalently  make s w   s c 
as high as possible   for each vote o  partial order   there can be two cases  in the first
case  c  o w  in this case  we only need to consider c and w separately  raising w as high
as possible and lowering c as low as possible   this part of the algorithm has already been
considered in konczak   lang         the following example  example    illustrates this
idea

example   a partial order o is illustrated in figure    a   let c   c  and w   c    since

in the second case  c o w  this case is more complicated  and in what follows we
show how to minimize s c   s w  for positional scoring rules  maximin  and bucklin  for
plurality with runoff  we convert pcw into a maximum flow problem to solve it  this also
gives an algorithm for nw  simply by checking whether any other alternative is a possible
co winner  see proposition    
in this section  the input consists of c    c  c            cm     c  the alternative for which
we wish to decide whether or not it is a necessary  co  winner   a profile pposet of n partial
orders over c  and the voting rule r 
we first define some notation that will be used in the algorithms 
definition   given a partial order o and an alternative c  let upo  c     c  c   c o c 
and downo  c     c  c   c o c    given another alternative w such that c o w  let os
c  w block be defined as follows  blocko  c  w     c  c   c o c o w  
that is  upo  c  is the set of alternatives that are weakly preferred to c in o  including c
itself   and downo  c  is the set of alternatives that c is weakly preferred to in o  including
c itself   if c o w  then blocko  c  w  is the set of all the alternatives  including c and w 
that are ranked between c and w  it is easy to check that for any partial order o  and any
pair of alternatives c  w  with c o w   blocko  c  w    downo  c   upo  w  
example   let o be the partial order illustrated in figure    a   we have that upo  c     
 c    c     upo  c       c    c    c    c    c     downo  c       c    c    c     downo  c       c     and
blocko  c    c       c    c    c    
the notion of a block is useful for the following reason  in the algorithm  we want to
think about an extension of the partial orders in which w does as well as possible  and c
does as poorly as possible  when c o w in some partial order o  we cannot rank c below
w  but at least it makes sense to have as few alternatives between them as possible  the
alternatives in the block are exactly the ones that need to be between them  we will rank
the other alternatives outside of the block  then  the question is where to position the
block  and we will slide the block through the ranking 
now we are ready to present the algorithms  we note that given a partial order o 
computing the upo and downo sets takes polynomial time  let  sm denote the scoring
vector of the positional scoring rule 
algorithm    computing nw with respect to a positional scoring rule 
  

fixia   conitzer

   for each partial order o  pposet and each alternative c  compute upo  c  and
downo  c  
   repeat steps  ac for each w    c 
 a  let s w    s c      
 b  for each partial order o in pposet  
 if c  o w  then  following example    the lowest possible position for c is
the m       downo  c  th position  and the highest possible position for w is
the  upo  w  th position  so we add the scores  sm   upo  w    and  sm  m     
 downo  c    to s w  and s c   respectively 
 if c o w  then the highest that we can slide os c  w block  as measured by cs
position  which is at the top of the block  is position  upo  w    downo  c        if
an alternative a is ranked above w in the partial order  then we will place it above
c  unless the partial order ranks c above a   and the lowest  as measured by ws
position  which is at the bottom of the block  is position m downo  c  upo  w  
 if an alternative a is ranked below c in the partial order  then we will place it
below w  unless the partial order ranks a above w   any position between these
extremes is also possible  we find the position that minimizes the score of c
minus the score of w  then add the scores that c and w get for these positions to
s c  and s w   respectively 
 c  if the result is that s w   s c   then output that c is not a necessary winner
 terminating the algorithm  
   output that c is a necessary winner  if we reach this point  
the algorithm for computing ncw is obtained simply by checking whether s w    s c 
in step   
proposition   algorithm   checks whether or not c is a necessary winner for pposet with
respect to a given positional scoring rule in polynomial time 
proof  it is equivalent to check whether there exists an extension p of pposet and an
alternative w    c  such that s p  w   s p  c that is  whether c is not a necessary  unique 
winner  to this end  for each o  pposet   we maximize s vo   w s vo   c  over all extensions
vo of o 
we recall that for each i  m   sm  i  is the score of the alternative that is ranked at
the ith position  for any extension vo of o  s vo   w    sm   upo  w     because w cannot
be ranked higher than the  upo  w  th position  and s vo   c    sm  m       downo  c   
 because c cannot be ranked lower than the  m       downo  c   th position   these
two bounds can be achieved if c  o w  for every d  c   upo  w   we add w  d to
o  and for every d  c   downo  c   we add d  c to o  we obtain a partial order o
this way  and we let vo be an  arbitrary  linear order that extends o   it follows that
s vo   w   s vo   c     sm   upo  w      sm  m       downo  c    
however  if c o w  there may not exist vo in which s vo   w     sm   upo  w    and
s vo   c     sm  m       downo  c    hold simultaneously  we note that in any vo that
  

fidetermining possible and necessary winners given partial orders

maximizes s vo   w   s vo   c   the only alternatives between c and w must be those in
blocko  c  w   therefore  for each d  c such that d o w and c  o d  we must have that
d vo c  and for each d  c such that c o d and d  o w  we must have that w vo d  it
follows that s vo   w   s vo   c   maxl   sm  l    blocko  c  w         sm  l    where l ranges
between  upo  w    downo  c       and m   downo  c    upo  w    let vo be an extension
of o restricted to c   blocko  c  w  in which upo  w    downo  c  is ranked at the top and
downo  c    upo  w  is ranked at the bottom  for each d  c    upo  w   downo  c  
and each d  blocko  c  w   we must have d  o d and d  o d  therefore  for each
 upo  w    downo  c        l  m   downo  c    upo  w    we can put blocko  c  w  between
the  l    th position and the lth position in vo   to obtain a linear order that extends o 
this proves the correctness of step  b  which computes maxvo  s vo   w   s vo   c    it
follows that the algorithm correctly checks whether or not c is a necessary winner 
 
we now move on to the maximin rule  we note that c is not a necessary winner for pposet
with respect to maximin if and only if there exists a profile of linear orders p extending
pposet   and two alternatives w and w   such that for all alternatives d  np  w  d   np  c  w   
we recall that np  w  d  is the number of votes in p where w  d  therefore  our algorithm
considers all pairs  w  w    and then checks whether there exists an extension of the input
partial orders for which the inequality holds for all alternatives d  to perform such a check 
in each partial order  we would like to rank w ahead of c  and also to rank w as high as
possible  however  these two objectives may conflict  it may be the case that if we rank
c ahead of w   then we can rank w higher than in the case where we rank w ahead of c 
in this case  we first place w ahead of c  and then rank w as high as possible under this
additional constraint  this works for the following reason  let o  pposet be a partial
order where c  o w and w  o c  let v be an arbitrary extension of o in which w v c
and let v  be an arbitrary extension of o in which c v  w   for any d  c  we have
that n v    w  d   n v    c  w       n v     w  d   n v     c  w    which means that enforcing
w  c is always at least as good as enforcing c  w

the algorithm for computing ncw with respect to maximin is similar  the only modification
is that in step    we check if for all alternatives d    w  s w  d    s c  w   
proposition   algorithm   checks whether or not c is a necessary winner for pposet with
respect to maximin in polynomial time 
proof  the function s x  y  computed in the algorithm is the number of times x is preferred
to y in an extension of pposet   for any partial order o  we let vo be the extension computed
in step  b  let g v  d    nv  w  d   nv  c  w    we next prove that for each d    w and
each extension vo of o  g vo   d   g vo   d   if c  o w and c vo w   then g vo   d  
   g vo   d   because nvo  c  w       and nvo  c  w         if c  o w and w vo c  then
nvo  c  w     nvo  c  w    we note that vo is obtained by raising w as high as possible in o
while w  c  which means that nvo  w  d   nvo  w  d   it follows that g vo   d   g vo   d  
similarly  if c o w   then we also have that for all d    w  nvo  w  d   nvo  w  d  
therefore pfor any extension p of pposet and any d    w  s w  d   s c  w     np  w  d  
np  c  w    opposet g vo   d   and when p is the profile computed in step  b  the inequality becomes an equality  it follows that the algorithm is correct 
 
now we move on to the bucklin rule  we note that c is not a necessary winner of
pposet with respect to bucklin  if and only if there exists an extension p of pposet and an
alternative w  such that either ws bucklin score is    or there exists    k  m  such that
w is among the top k for more than n  votes  meaning that ws bucklin score is no more
than k   and c is among the top k    for at most n  votes  meaning that cs bucklin score
is no less than k   therefore  like algorithm    the algorithm for bucklin considers each
alternative w  computes the possible positions for the blocks blocko  c  w   and then checks
for all k from   to m whether the above condition can be made to hold 
in the algorithm  if c  oj w  then high j  is the highest position that w reaches in an
extension of oj   and low j  is the lowest position that c reaches in an extension of oj   if
c oj w  then high j  is the highest position of c given that c and w are ranked as close to
each other as possible  low j  is the lowest position of c given that c and w are ranked as
close to each other as possible  and length j  is the size of blockoj  c  w   for any i  m
and any d   c  w   let s i  d  denote the minimum number of times that d is ranked in
the top i positions  where the minimum is taken over all optimal extensions of pposet  we
will elaborate on the meaning of optimality later   u  k  is the number of partial orders
for which we will have to compute where to put the block blockoj  c  w  to make c not a
necessary unique winner  that is  u  k  is the number of partial orders for which there
exists an extension in which c is in the top k    positions and w is in the top k positions 
as well as another extension in which c is not in the top k    positions and w is not in the
top k positions

 c   for each k  m  each j  n 
 if length j       then add   to s k  w  if high j   k  and add   to s k  c  if
low j   k 
 if length j       then add   to s k  w  if either low j    length j      k  or
the following two conditions both hold  low j   k and high j    length j     
k  also  add   to s k  c  if low j   k  add   to u  k  if low j   k     and
high j    length j      k 
 d   if there exists    l  u     such that s    w    l   n   s    c    l  or there exists
   k  m and l  u  k  such that s k  w    l   n   s k  c    l  then output that c
is not a necessary co winner  terminating the algorithm  
proposition   algorithm   checks whether or not c is a necessary winner for pposet with
respect to bucklin in polynomial time 
proof  similarly as in the case of positional scoring rules  for bucklin  if c  o w  then we
can simply rank c as low as possible while rank w as high as possible  independently  on
the other hand  if c o w  then we can without loss of generality place as few alternatives
between c and w as possible  but the question is where to place the c  w block  the
algorithm will consider a particular k  and try to make it so that w is among the top k for
more than half the votes  and c is among the top k    for at most half the votes  for a
particular vote with c o w  depending on where the block is placed  either     c is among
the top k    and w is among the top k  or      c is among the top k    and w is not among
the top k  or      c is not among the top k    and w is not among the top k  however 
  

fixia   conitzer

not all three of these possibilities may exist for a particular vote  the algorithm will never
choose     unless that is the only option  so that the only difficult case is when a decision
must be made between     and     
we recall that for any i  m and any d   c  w   s i  d  is the minimum number of
times that d is ranked within top i positions  where the minimum is taken over all extensions
of pposet that are consistent with the observations in the previous paragraph  specifically 
option     is never chosen unless there is no other choice   u  k  is the number of partial
orders for which there exists an extension in which c is ranked within top k    positions
and w is ranked within top k positions  as well as an extension in which c is not ranked
within top k    positions and w is not ranked within top k positions  that is  we have a
choice between     and      
for each k  m  and each j  n  we consider how to extend oj  
 if c  oj w  then the positions of c and w are already determined by our previous
observations  w is ranked as high as possible and c is ranked as low as possible  
 if c oj w and high j   k  then c cannot be ranked within top k    positions and
w cannot be ranked within top k positions  therefore  we add   to s k     c  and
s k  w  
 if c oj w  high j    k and high j    length j       k  then c can be ranked within
top k    positions  but w cannot be ranked within top k positions  there are two
sub cases      if low j   k  then we rank c in the low j th position  and henceforth
add   to both s k     c  and s k  w       if low j    k  then c is inevitably ranked
within top k    positions  and w cannot be ranked within top k positions  which
means that we add   to s k     c  and   to s k  w  
 the final case is where c oj w  high j    k and high j    length j      k  again 
there are two subcases      if low j    k  then it means that c must be ranked within
top k    positions  therefore we rank w in the top k positions  and add   to both
s k    c  and s k  w       if low j   k  then it means that we have three options for
an extension of oj   corresponding to the cases               discussed in the beginning
of the proof 
    cs position is within top k    and ws position is within top k 
    cs position is within top k   and ws position is not within top k  which implies
that length i       
    cs position is not within top k    and ws position is not within top k 
as we already discussed  option     is suboptimal  therefore  we add   to both
s k     c  and s k  w   and add   to u  k  
the only remaining decision is for how many of the votes corresponding to the number
u  k  to choose option      as opposed to option       this corresponds to step  d of the
algorithm  where it checks whether there exists a way of choosing the number of extensions
 but no more than u  k   that choose     in such a way that c is not the winner 
therefore  the algorithm is correct 
 
  

fidetermining possible and necessary winners given partial orders

finally  we consider the possible co winner problem with respect to plurality with runoff 
we will show that this problem can be solved in polynomial time  from this  it also follows
that the necessary  unique  winner problem can be solved in polynomial time  proposition     in contrast  we have already shown that for plurality with runoff  the possible
unique winner problem is np complete  theorem    and the necessary co winner problem
is conp complete  theorem    
our algorithm for determining whether c is a possible co winner is based on the following
key observation  c is a possible co winner for pposet with respect to plurality with runoff
if and only if there exists an extension of pposet   denoted by p    an alternative d    c  and
two natural numbers l    l    such that     c is preferred to d in at least half of votes  linear
orders  in p    and     p lup   c    l    p lup   d    l    and for each alternative c  c    c and
c    d   p lup   c    min l    l     that is  c and d can enter the runoff  there could be other
pairs of alternatives who enter the runoff in some parallel universe  and c can then defeat
d in the runoff 
for each i  m     we let i denote the number of partial orders o  pposet such
that ci o c  we recall that t op o  denote the set of alternatives c for which there exists
at least one extension of o where c is in the top position  based on the observations in
the previous paragraph  we will consider all possibilities for l    l    and d  we will use i to
denote possibilities for the index of d   and solve a maximum flow problem instance for each
possibility   specifically  for every l    l   n and every i  m     with i  n     we
define a maximum flow problem fl   l   i as follows  illustrated in figure    in which i

edges  we have the following five types of edges 
 edges from s to  o            on    for every i  n  there is an edge  s  oi   with
capacity   
   our original proof used a minimum cost flow problem  but one of the anonymous reviewers pointed out
how to modify this approach into the simpler maximum flow approach presented here  as well as two
papers  gusfield   martel        russell   walsh        where maximum flow problems were used to
solve other election problems  for which we thank the reviewer

 edges from  o            on   to  ci   c  c            cm     we have
 for every j  n and every d  c such that d    ci   if d  t op oj    then there
is an edge  oj   d  with capacity   
 for every j  n  if ci  t op o  and ci oj c  then there is an edge  oj   ci  
with capacity   
 for any j  n  there is an edge  oj   ci   with capacity   if ci  t op o  and
ci  oj c 
 edge from ci to ci   there is an edge  ci   ci   with capacity n    i  
 edges from c    c  ci   to t   for every c  c    c  ci    we have an edge  c   t  
with capacity lmin   min l    l    
 edges from  c  ci   t   to t  we have
 an edge  c  t  with capacity l   
 an edge  ci   t  with capacity l   
 an edge  t   t  with capacity n  l   l   
next  we prove that c is a possible co winner for pposet with respect to plurality with runoff
if and only if there exist l    l   n and i  m    such that fl   l   i has a solution in which
the value of the flow is n 
because all parameters in fl   l   i are integers  if there exists a solution to fl   l   i   then
there must also exists an integer solution  first  we show how to convert an integer solution
to fl   l   i to a solution to the pcw problem with respect to plurality with runoff  let f
be an integer solution to fl   l   i   that is  f   vertices  vertices  z  we construct an
extension p     v            vn   of pposet as follows 
 for each j  n  if f  oj   ci       then we let vj be an extension of oj in which ci is
ranked in the top position 
 for each j  n and each d  c    ci    if f  oj   d      then we let oj be an extension
of oj in which d is ranked in the top position  and c is ranked as high as possible 
because the value of f is n  the plurality score of c is l  and the plurality score of ci is
l    while the plurality score of ci  i    i   is at most lmin   therefore  c and ci enter the
runoff together in one parallel universe  now  the capacity constraint on the edge  ci   ci  
ensures that c will win the runoff  the reason is that if we rank ci first in a vote in which
we could have ranked c ahead of ci   then it will contribute   to the flow on this edge 
moreover  the capacity of the edge  ci   ci   is n    i   which means that ci  c in at
most i    n    i    n   votes of p    hence  c is a co winner for p   
conversely  if there exists an extension p  of p such that c is a co winner of p    then
there exists a ci such that in some parallel universe   c  ci   enter the runoff  and c wins
this runoff  let l    l  be the plurality scores of c  ci   respectively  then  this extension can
be converted to a solution to fl   l   i  we omit the details because they are similar to the
details for the other direction  
therefore  the following algorithm solves pcw with respect to plurality with runoff

   output that c is not a possible co winner 
proposition   algorithm   checks whether or not c is a possible co winner for pposet with
respect to plurality with runoff in polynomial time 
we recall from the proof of proposition   that c is a necessary unique winner if and only
if no other alternative is a possible co winner  therefore  we naturally obtain an algorithm
for nw  simply by using algorithm   to check if any alternative other than c is a possible
co winner 
proposition   algorithm   can be used to check whether or not c is a necessary unique
winner for pposet with respect to plurality with runoff in polynomial time 

   conclusion and future work
we considered the following problem  given a set of alternatives  a voting rule  and a
set of partial orders  which alternatives are possible necessary winners  that is  which
alternatives would win for some all extension of the partial orders  we considered the case
where the votes are not weighted and the number of alternatives is not bounded  table   in
the introduction summarizes our results  these results hold whether or not the alternative
must be the unique winner  or merely a co winner  unless specifically mentioned 
in this paper  there was no restriction on the partial orders  however  if the reason
that we have partial orders is that preferences are submitted as cp nets  this introduces
additional structure on the partial orders  that is  not all partial orders correspond to a
cp net  hence  while our positive results would still apply  it is not immediately obvious
that our negative results would still apply 
another approach is to approximate the sets of possible necessary winners  more precisely  we are asked to output a superset  respectively  subset  of possible  respectively 
necessary  winners such that the size of the output set should be within a fixed ratio of
the number of the possible  respectively  necessary  winners  pini et al         proved the
inapproximability of the set of possible necessary winners for the single transferable vote
rule  stv  rule  we conjecture that similar inapproximability results hold for most of
the common voting rules studied in this paper  for which the possible necessary winner
problems are  co  np complete
