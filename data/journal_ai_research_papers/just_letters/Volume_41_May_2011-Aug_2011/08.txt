abstract
there has been significant recent interest in game theoretic approaches to security  with much
of the recent research focused on utilizing the leader follower stackelberg game model  among
the major applications are the armor program deployed at lax airport and the iris program in
use by the us federal air marshals  fams   the foundational assumption for using stackelberg
games is that security forces  leaders   acting first  commit to a randomized strategy  while their
adversaries  followers  choose their best response after surveillance of this randomized strategy 
yet  in many situations  a leader may face uncertainty about the followers surveillance capability 
previous work fails to address how a leader should compute her strategy given such uncertainty 
we provide five contributions in the context of a general class of security games  first  we
show that the nash equilibria in security games are interchangeable  thus alleviating the equilibrium
selection problem  second  under a natural restriction on security games  any stackelberg strategy
is also a nash equilibrium strategy  and furthermore  the solution is unique in a class of security
games of which armor is a key exemplar  third  when faced with a follower that can attack
multiple targets  many of these properties no longer hold  fourth  we show experimentally that in
most  but not all  games where the restriction does not hold  the stackelberg strategy is still a nash
equilibrium strategy  but this is no longer true when the attacker can attack multiple targets  finally 
as a possible direction for future research  we propose an extensive form game model that makes
the defenders uncertainty about the attackers ability to observe explicit

  parr         in this framework  the defender  i e   the security forces  acts first by committing
to a patrolling or inspection strategy  and the attacker chooses where to attack after observing the
defenders choice  the typical solution concept applied to these games is strong stackelberg equilibrium  sse   which assumes that the defender will choose an optimal mixed  randomized  strategy
based on the assumption that the attacker will observe this strategy and choose an optimal response 
this leader follower paradigm appears to fit many real world security situations 
indeed  stackelberg games are at the heart of two major deployed decision support applications  the first is the armor security system  deployed at the los angeles international airport
 lax   pita et al         jain et al          in this domain police are able to set up checkpoints
on roads leading to particular terminals  and assign canine units  bomb sniffing dogs  to patrol
terminals  police resources in this domain are homogeneous  and do not have significant scheduling constraints  the second is iris  a similar application deployed by the federal air marshals
service  fams   tsai  rathi  kiekintveld  ordonez    tambe        jain et al          armed
marshals are assigned to commercial flights to deter and defeat terrorist attacks  this domain has
more complex constraints  in particular  marshals are assigned to tours of flights that return to the
same destination  and the tours on which any given marshal is available to fly are limited by the
marshals current location and timing constraints  the types of scheduling and resource constraints
we consider in the work in this paper are motivated by those necessary to represent this domain 
additionally  there are other security applications that are currently under evaluation and even more
in the pipeline  for example  the transportation security administration  tsa  is testing and evaluating the guards system for potential national deployment  at over     airports   guards
also uses stackelberg games for tsa security resource allocation for conducting security activities
aimed at protection of the airport infrastructure  pita  bellamane et al          another example is
an application under development for the united states coast guard for suggesting patrolling strategies to protect ports to ensure the safety and security of all passenger  cargo  and vessel operations 
other potential examples include protecting electric power grids  oil pipelines  and subway systems
infrastructure  brown  carlyle  salmeron    wood         as well as border security and computer
network security 
however  there are legitimate concerns about whether the stackelberg model is appropriate in all
cases  in some situations attackers may choose to act without acquiring costly information about the
security strategy  especially if security measures are difficult to observe  e g   undercover officers 
and insiders are unavailable  in such cases  a simultaneous move game model may be a better
reflection of the real situation  the defender faces an unclear choice about which strategy to adopt 
the recommendation of the stackelberg model  or of the simultaneous move model  or something
else entirely  in general settings  the equilibrium strategy can in fact differ between these models 
consider the normal form game in table    if the row player has the ability to commit  the sse
strategy is to play a with    and b with     so that the best response for the column player is to play
d  which gives the row player an expected utility of       on the other hand  if the players move
simultaneously the only nash equilibrium  ne  of this game is for the row player to play a and
the column player c  this can be seen by noticing that b is strictly dominated for the row player 
   in these games it is assumed that if the follower is indifferent  he breaks the tie in the leaders favor  otherwise  the
optimal solution is not well defined

table    example game where the stackelberg equilibrium is not a nash equilibrium 
previous work has failed to resolve the defenders dilemma of which strategy to select when the
attackers observation capability is unclear 
in this paper  we conduct theoretical and experimental analysis of the leaders dilemma  focusing
on security games  kiekintveld et al          this is a formally defined class of not necessarily zerosum  games motivated by the applications discussed earlier  we make four primary contributions 
first  we show that nash equilibria are interchangeable in security games  avoiding equilibrium
selection problems  second  if the game satisfies the ssas  subsets of schedules are schedules 
property  the defenders set of sse strategies is a subset of her ne strategies  in this case  the defender is always playing a best response by using an sse regardless of whether the attacker observes
the defenders strategy or not  third  we provide counter examples to this  partial  equivalence in
two cases      when the ssas property does not hold for defender schedules  and     when the
attacker can attack multiple targets simultaneously  in these cases  the defenders sse strategy may
not be part of any ne profile  finally  our experimental tests show that the fraction of games where
the sse strategy played is not part of any ne profile is vanishingly small  however  when the attacker can attack multiple targets  then the sse strategy fails to be an ne strategy in a relatively
large number of games 
section   contains the formal definition of the security games considered in this paper  section  
contains the theoretical results about nash and stackelberg equilibria in security games  which we
consider to be the main contributions of this paper  in section    we show that our results do not
hold in an extension of security games that allows the attacker to attack multiple targets at once 
section   contains the experimental results  to initiate future research on cases where the properties
from section   do not hold  we present in section   an extensive form game model that makes the
defenders uncertainty about the attackers ability to observe explicit  we discuss additional related
work in section    and conclude in section   

   definitions and notation
a security game  kiekintveld et al         is a two player game between a defender and an attacker 
the attacker may choose to attack any target from the set t    t    t            tn    the defender tries
to prevent attacks by covering targets using resources from the set r    r    r            rk    as shown
in figure    udc  ti   is the defenders utility if ti is attacked while ti is covered by some defender
resource  if ti is not covered  the defender gets udu  ti    the attackers utility is denoted similarly by
   the not necessarily zero sumness of games used for counter terrorism or security resource allocation analysis is
further emphasized by bier         keeney         rosoff and john         they focus on preference elicitation of
defenders and attackers and explicitly outline that the objectives of different terrorist groups or individuals are often
different from each other  and that defenders and attackers objectives are not exact opposites of each other  for
instance  bier        notes that the attackers utility can also depend on factors that may not have a significant effect
on the defenders utility  such as the cost of mounting the attack as well as the propaganda value of the target to the
attacker

figure    payoff structure of security games 
motivated by fams and similar domains  we introduce resource and scheduling constraints for
the defender  resources may be assigned to schedules covering multiple targets  s  t   for each
resource ri   there is a subset si of the schedules s that resource ri can potentially cover  that is 
ri can cover any s  si   in the fams domain  flights are targets and air marshals are resources 
schedules capture the idea that air marshals fly tours  and must return to a particular starting point 
heterogeneous resources can express additional timing and location constraints that limit the tours
on which any particular marshal can be assigned to fly  an important subset of the fams domain
can be modeled using fixed schedules of size    i e   a pair of departing and returning flights   the
lax domain is also a subclass of security games as defined here  with schedules of size   and
homogeneous resources 
a security game described above can be represented as a normal form game  as follows  the
attackers pure strategy space a is the set of targets  the attackers mixed strategy a   hai i is a
vector where ai represents the probability of attacking
qk ti   the defenders pure strategy is a feasible
assignment of resources to schedules  i e   hsi i  i   si   since covering a target with one resource
is essentially the same as covering it with any positive number of resources  the defenders pure
strategy can also be represented by a coverage vector d   hdi i        n where di represents
whether ti is covered or not  for example  h t    t      t   i can be a possible assignment  and the
corresponding coverage vector is h          i  however  not all the coverage vectors are feasible due
to resource and schedule constraints  we denote the set of feasible coverage vectors by d        n  
the defenders mixed strategy c specifies the probabilities of playing each d  d  where each
individual probability is denoted
p by cd   let c   hci i be the vector of coverage probabilities corresponding to c  where ci   dd di cd is the marginal probability of covering ti   for example 
suppose the defender has two coverage vectors  d    h       i and d    h       i  for the mixed
strategy c   h      i  the corresponding vector of coverage probabilities is c   h         i  denote
the mapping from c to c by   so that c    c

in our stackelberg model  the defender chooses a mixed strategy first  and the attacker chooses

   the follower breaks ties optimally for the leader 
ud  c  g c    ud  c    c    for all c  where   c  is the set of follower best responses to
c 
we denote the set of mixed strategies for the defender that are played in some nash equilibrium
by n e   and the corresponding set for strong stackelberg equilibrium by sse   the defenders
sse utility is always at least as high as the defenders utility in any ne profile  this holds for any
game  not just security games  this follows from the following  in the sse model  the leader can
at the very least choose to commit to her ne strategy  if she does so  then the follower will choose
from among his best responses one that maximizes the utility of the leader  due to the tie breaking
assumption   whereas in the ne the follower will also choose from his best responses to this defender strategy  but not necessarily the ones that maximize the leaders utility   in fact a stronger
claim holds  the leaders sse utility is at least as high as in any correlated equilibrium  these observations are due to von stengel and zamir        who give a much more detailed discussion of these
points  including  implicitly  to what extent this still holds without any tie breaking assumption  
in the basic model  it is assumed that both players utility functions are common knowledge 
because this is at best an approximation of the truth  it is useful to reflect on the importance of this
assumption  in the sse model  the defender needs to know the attackers utility function in order to
compute her sse strategy  but the attacker does not need to know the defenders utility function  all
   

fikorzhyk   y in   k iekintveld   c onitzer     tambe

he needs to best respond is to know the mixed strategy to which the defender committed   on the
other hand  in the ne model  the attacker does not observe the defenders mixed strategy and needs
to know the defenders utility function  arguably  this is much harder to justify in practice  and this
may be related to why it is the sse model that is used in the applications discussed earlier  our goal
in this paper is not to argue for the ne model  but rather to discuss the relationship between sse and
ne strategies for the defender  we do show that the nash equilibria are interchangeable in security
games  suggesting that ne strategies have better properties in these security games than they do in
general  we also show that in a large class of games  the defenders sse strategy is guaranteed to
be an ne strategy as well  so that this is no longer an issue for the defender  while the attackers ne
strategy will indeed depend on the defenders utility function  as we will see this does not affect the
defenders ne strategy 
of course  in practice  the defender generally does not know the attackers utility function exactly  one way to address this is to make this uncertainty explicit and model the game as a bayesian
game  harsanyi         but the known algorithms for solving for sse strategies in bayesian games
 e g   paruchuri et al         are practical only for small security games  because they depend on
writing out the complete action space for each player  which is of exponential size in security games 
in addition  even when the complete action space is written out  the problem is np hard  conitzer  
sandholm        and no good approximation guarantee is possible unless p np  letchford et al  
       a recent paper by kiekintveld  marecki  and tambe        discusses approximation methods for such models  another issue is that the attacker is assumed to respond optimally  which
may not be true in practice  several models of stackelberg games with an imperfect follower have
been proposed by pita  jain  ordonez  tambe et al          these solution concepts also make the
solution more robust to errors in estimation of the attackers utility function  we do not consider
bayesian games or imperfect attackers in this paper 

   equilibria in security games
the challenge for us is to understand the fundamental relationships between the sse and ne strategies in security games  a special case is zero sum security games  where the defenders utility is
the exact opposite of the attackers utility  for finite two person zero sum games  it is known that
the different game theoretic solution concepts of ne  minimax  maximin and sse all give the same
answer  in addition  nash equilibrium strategies of zero sum games have a very useful property in
that they are interchangeable  an equilibrium strategy for one player can be paired with the other
players strategy from any equilibrium profile  and the result is an equilibrium  where the payoffs
for both players remain the same 
unfortunately  security games are not necessarily zero sum  and are not zero sum in deployed
applications   many properties of zero sum games do not hold in security games  for instance 
a minimax strategy in a security game may not be a maximin strategy  consider the example in
table    in which there are   targets and one defender resource  the defender has three actions  each
of defenders actions can only cover one target at a time  leaving the other targets uncovered  while
   technically  this is not exactly true because the attacker needs to break ties in the defenders favor  however  when
the attacker is indifferent among multiple actions  the defender can generally modify her strategy slightly to make the
attacker strictly prefer the action that is optimal for the defender  the point of the tiebreaking assumption is merely to
make the optimal solution well defined  see also the work of von stengel and zamir        and their discussion of
generic games in particular 

   

fis tackelberg vs   nash in s ecurity g ames

all three targets are equally appealing to the attacker  the defender has varying utilities of capturing
the attacker at different targets  for the defender  the unique minimax strategy  h             i  is
different from the unique maximin strategy  h                i

table    security game which is not strategically zero sum 
strategically zero sum games  moulin   vial        are a natural and strict superset of zerosum games for which most of the desirable properties of zero sum games still hold  this is exactly
the class of games for which no completely mixed nash equilibrium can be improved upon  moulin
and vial proved a game  a  b  is strategically zero sum if and only if there exist u     and v    
such that ua   vb   u   v   where u is a matrix with identical columns and v is a matrix with
identical rows  moulin   vial         unfortunately  security games are not even strategically zerosum  the game in table   is a counterexample  because otherwise there must exist u  v     such
that

from these equations  a   y   a   z   b   x   b   z   c   x   c   y   v  which implies

a   x   b   y   c   z  u must be    which contradicts the assumption u     
another concept that is worth mentioning is that of unilaterally competitive games  kats  
thisse         if a game is unilaterally competitive  or weakly unilaterally competitive   this implies
that if a player unilaterally changes his action in a way that increases his own utility  then this must
result in a  weak  decrease in utility for every other players utility  this does not hold for security
games  for example  if the attacker switches from a heavily defended but very sensitive target to an
undefended target that is of little value to the defender  this change may make both players strictly
better off  an example is shown in table    if the attacker switches from attacking t  to attacking
t    each players utility increases 
nevertheless  we show in the rest of this section that security games still have some important
properties  we start by establishing equivalence between the set of defenders minimax strategies
and the set of defenders ne strategies  second  we show nash equilibria in security games are
interchangeable  resolving the defenders equilibrium strategy selection problem in simultaneousmove games  third  we show that under a natural restriction on schedules  any sse strategy for the
defender is also a minimax strategy and hence an ne strategy  this resolves the defenders dilemma
about whether to play according to sse or ne when there is uncertainty about the attackers ability

table    a security game which is not unilaterally competitive  or weakly unilaterally competitive  

to observe the strategy  the defender can safely play the sse strategy  because it is guaranteed to
be an ne strategy as well  and moreover the nash equilibria are interchangeable so there is no risk
of choosing the wrong equilibrium strategy  finally  for a restricted class of games  including
the games from the lax domain   we find that there is a unique sse ne defender strategy and a
unique attacker ne strategy 
    equivalence of ne and minimax
we first prove that any defenders ne strategy is also a minimax strategy  then for every defenders
minimax strategy c we construct a strategy a for the attacker such that hc  ai is an ne profile 
definition    for a defenders mixed strategy c  define the attackers best response utility by
e c    maxni   ua  c  ti    denote the minimum of the attackers best response utilities over
all defenders strategies by e    minc e c   the set of defenders minimax strategies is defined
as 
m    c e c    e    
we define the function f as follows  if a is an attackers strategy in which target ti is attacked
with probability ai   then f  a    a is an attackers strategy such that
ud  ti  
ua  ti  
pn
where      is a normalizing constant such that i   ai      the intuition behind the function f
is that the defender prefers playing a strategy c to playing another strategy c  in a security game
g when the attacker plays a strategy a if and only if the defender also prefers playing c to playing
c  when the attacker plays f  a  in the corresponding zero sum security game g  which is defined
in lemma     below  also  the supports of attacker strategies a and f  a  are the same  as we will
show in lemma      function f provides a one to one mapping of the attackers ne strategies in g
to the attackers ne strategies in g  with the inverse function f    a    a given by the following
equation 
  ua  ti  
ai   ai
   
 ud  ti  
ai   ai

lemma      consider a security game g  construct the corresponding zero sum security game g
in which the defenders utilities are re defined as follows 
udc  t    uac  t 
udu  t    uau  t 
then hc  ai is an ne profile in g if and only if hc  f  a i is an ne profile in g 
   

fis tackelberg vs   nash in s ecurity g ames

proof  note that the supports of strategies a and a   f  a  are the same  and also that the attackers
utility function is the same in games g and g  thus a is a best response to c in g if and only if a is
a best response to c in g 
denote the utility that the defender gets if profile hc  ai is played in game g by udg  c  a   to
show that c is a best response to a in game g if and only if c is a best response to a in g  it is
sufficient to show equivalence of the following two inequalities 
udg  c  a   udg  c    a    
 udg  c  a   udg  c    a    
we will prove the equivalence by starting from the first inequality and transforming it into the second

attackers utility function in g is the same as in g  thus c must also be a minimax strategy in g  and

lemma      in a security game g  any defenders strategy c such that e c    e  is an ne
strategy  i e   m  n e  
proof  c is a minimax strategy in both g and the corresponding zero sum game g  any minimax
strategy is also an ne strategy in a zero sum game  fudenberg   tirole         then there must
exist an ne profile hc  ai in g  by lemma      hc  f    a i is an ne profile in g  thus c is an
ne strategy in g 
theorem      in a security game  the set of defenders minimax strategies is equal to the set of
defenders ne strategies  i e   m   n e  
proof  lemma     shows that every defenders ne strategy is a minimax strategy  and lemma    
shows that every defenders minimax strategy is an ne strategy  thus the sets of defenders ne and
minimax strategies must be equal 
it is important to emphasize again that while the defenders equilibrium strategies are the same
in g and g  this is not true for the attackers equilibrium strategies  attacker probabilities that leave
the defender indifferent across her support in g do not necessarily leave her indifferent in g  this is
the reason for the function f  a  above 
    interchangeability of nash equilibria
we now show that nash equilibria in security games are interchangeable  this result indicates that 
for the case where the attacker cannot observe the defenders mixed strategy  there is effectively no
equilibrium selection problem  as long as each player plays a strategy from some equilibrium  the
result is guaranteed to be an equilibrium  of course  this still does not resolve the issue of what to
do when it is not clear whether the attacker can observe the mixed strategy  we return to this issue
in subsection     
theorem      suppose hc  ai and hc    a  i are two ne profiles in a security game g  then hc  a  i
and hc    ai are also ne profiles in g 
proof  consider the corresponding zero sum game g  from lemma      both hc  f  a i and hc    f  a   i
must be ne profiles in g  by the interchange property of ne in zero sum games  fudenberg   tirole         hc  f  a   i and hc    f  a i must also be ne profiles in g  applying lemma     again
in the other direction  we get that hc  a  i and hc    ai must be ne profiles in g 
by theorem      the defenders equilibrium selection problem in a simultaneous move security
game is resolved  the reason is that given the attackers ne strategy a  the defender must get the
same utility by responding with any ne strategy  next  we give some insights on expected utilities
in ne profiles  we first show the attackers expected utility is the same in all ne profiles  followed
by an example demonstrating that the defender may have varying expected utilities corresponding
to different attackers strategies

on the other hand  because a is a best response to c  it should be at least as good as the strategy of
attacking t  arg maxt ua  c  t  with probability    that is 
ua  c  a   ua  c  t     e c    e   
therefore we know ua  c  a    e   
unlike the attacker who gets the same utility in all ne profiles  the defender may get varying
expected utilities depending on the attackers strategy selection  consider the game shown in table    the defender can choose to cover one of the two targets at a time  the only defender ne
strategy is to cover t  with      probability  making the attacker indifferent between attacking t 
and t    one attacker ne strategy is to always attack t    which gives the defender an expected utility
of    another attackers ne strategy is h        i  given which the defender is indifferent between
defending t  and t    in this case  the defenders utility decreases to     because she captures the
attacker with a lower probability

table    a security game where the defenders expected utility varies in different ne profiles 

    sse strategies are also minimax ne strategies
we have already shown that the set of defenders ne strategies coincides with her minimax strategies  if every defenders sse strategy is also a minimax strategy  then sse strategies must also be
ne strategies  the defender can then safely commit to an sse strategy  there is no selection problem for the defender  unfortunately  if a security game has arbitrary scheduling constraints  then an
sse strategy may not be part of any ne profile  for example  consider the game in table   with  
targets  t            t       schedules s     t    t     s     t    t     and a single defender resource  the
defender always prefers that t  is attacked  and t  and t  are never appealing to the attacker

table    a schedule constrained security game where the defenders sse strategy is not an ne
strategy 

there is a unique sse strategy for the defender  which places as much coverage probability on
s  as possible without making t  more appealing to the attacker than t    the rest of the coverage
probability is placed on s    the result is that s  and s  are both covered with probability      in

contrast  in a simultaneous move game  t  and t  are dominated for the attacker  thus  there is no
reason for the defender to place resources on targets that are never attacked  so the defenders unique
ne strategy covers s  with probability    that is  the defenders sse strategy is different from the
ne strategy  the difference between the defenders payoffs in these cases can also be arbitrarily
large because t  is always attacked in an sse and t  is always attacked in a ne 
the above example restricts the defender to protect t  and t  together  which makes it impossible
for the defender to put more coverage on t  without making t  less appealing  if the defender could
assign resources to any subset of a schedule  this difficulty is resolved  more formally  we assume
that for any resource ri   any subset of a schedule in si is also a possible schedule in si  
   i  k   s   s  si  s   si  

   

if a security game satisfies equation      we say it has the ssas property  this is natural in many
security domains  since it is often possible to cover fewer targets than the maximum number that a
resource could possible cover in a schedule  we find that this property is sufficient to ensure that
the defenders sse strategy must also be an ne strategy 
lemma      suppose c is a defender strategy in a security game which satisfies the ssas property
and c    c  is the corresponding vector of marginal probabilities  then for any c  such that
   c i  ci for all ti  t   there must exist a defender strategy c  such that  c      c   
proof  the proof is by induction on the number of ti where c i    ci   as denoted by  c  c     as
the base case  if there is no i such that c i    ci   the existence trivially holds because  c    c   
suppose the existence holds for all c  c  such that  c  c      k  where    k  n     we consider
any c  c  where  c  c      k      then for some j  c j    cj   since c j    and c j   cj   we have
cj      there must be a nonempty set of coverage vectors dj that cover tj and receive positive
probability in c  because the security game satisfies the ssas property  for every d  dj   there
is a valid d which covers all targets in d except for tj   from the defender strategy c  by shifting
cd  cj c j  
probability from every d  dj to the corresponding d   we get a defender strategy c
cj
where ci   ci for i    j  and ci   c i for i   j  hence  c   c      k  implying there exists a c  such
that  c      c  by the induction assumption  by induction  the existence holds for any c  c

it follows that the defender is better off using c    which contradicts the assumption c is an sse
strategy of the defender 
theorem     and     together imply the following corollary 
corollary      in security games with the ssas property  any defenders sse strategy is also an
ne strategy 
we can now answer the original question posed in this paper  when there is uncertainty over
the type of game played  should the defender choose an sse strategy or a mixed strategy nash
equilibrium or some combination of the two   for domains that satisfy the ssas property  we have
proven that the defender can safely play an sse strategy  because it is guaranteed to be a nash
equilibrium strategy as well  and moreover the nash equilibria are interchangeable so there is no
risk of choosing the wrong equilibrium strategy 
among our motivating domains  the lax domain satisfies the ssas property since all schedules
are of size    other patrolling domains  such as patrolling a port  also satisfy the ssas property  in
such domains  the defender could thus commit to an sse strategy  which is also now known to be
an ne strategy  the defender retains the ability to commit  but is still playing a best response to
an attacker in a simultaneous move setting  assuming the attacker plays an equilibrium strategy 
it does not matter which one  due to the interchange property shown above   however  the fams
domain does not naturally satisfy the ssas property because marshals must fly complete tours   the
question of selecting sse vs  ne strategies in this case is addressed experimentally in section   
   of course  one may not agree that  in cases where its common knowledge that the players move simultaneously 
playing an ne strategy is the right thing to do in practice  this is a question at the heart of game theory that
is far beyond the scope of this paper to resolve  in this paper  our goal is not to argue for using ne strategies
in simultaneous move settings in general  rather  it is to assess the robustness of sse strategies to changes in the
information structure of specific classes of security games  for this purpose  ne seems like the natural representative
solution concept for simultaneous move security games  especially in light of the interchangeability properties that
we show 
   in principle  the fams could fly as civilians on some legs of a tour  however  they would need to be able to commit
to acting as civilians  i e   not intervening in an attempt to hijack the aircraft  and the attacker would need to believe
that a fam would not intervene  which is difficult to achieve in practice

    uniqueness in restricted games
the previous sections show that sse strategies are ne strategies in many cases  however  there
may still be multiple equilibria to select from  though this difficulty is alleviated by the interchange
property   here we prove an even stronger uniqueness result for an important restricted class of
security domains  which includes the lax domain  in particular  we consider security games where
the defender has homogeneous resources that can cover any single target  the ssas property is
trivially satisfied 
since all schedules are of size    any vector of coverage probabilities c   hci i
p
such that ni   ci  k is a feasible strategy for the defender  so we can represent the defender
strategy by marginal coverage probabilities  with a minor restriction on the attackers payoff matrix 
the defender always has a unique minimax strategy which is also the unique sse and ne strategy 
furthermore  the attacker also has a unique ne response to this strategy 
theorem       in a security game with homogeneous resources that can cover any single target 
if for every target ti  t   uac  ti      e    then the defender has a unique minimax  ne  and sse
strategy 
proof  we first show the defender has a unique minimax strategy  let t     t uau  t   e

note that e  cannot be less than any uac  ti    otherwise  regardless of the defenders strategy 
the attacker could always get at least uac  ti     e  by attacking ti   which contradicts the fact that
e  is the attackers best response utility to a defenders minimax strategy  since e   uac  ti   and

e c      e c     e    which contradicts the fact that e  is the minimum of all e c

furthermore  by theorem      we have that c is the unique defenders ne strategy  by theorem     and the existence of sse  basar   olsder         we have that c is the unique defenders
sse strategy 
in the following example  we show that theorem      does not work without the condition
uac  ti      e  for every ti   consider a security game with   targets in which the defender has two
homogeneous resources  each resource can cover any single target  and the players utility functions
are as defined in table    the defender can guarantee the minimum attackers best response utility

of e      by covering t  with probability     or more and covering t  with probability    since
e    uac  t     theorem      does not apply  the defender prefers an attack on t    so the defender
must cover t  with probability exactly     in an sse strategy  thus the defenders sse strategies
can have coverage vectors                                     or any convex combination of those two
vectors  according to theorem      each of those sse strategies is also a minimax ne strategy  so
the defenders sse  minimax  and ne strategies are all not unique in this example 
theorem       in a security game with homogeneous resources that can cover any one target  if
for every target ti  t   uac  ti      e  and uau  ti      e    then the attacker has a unique ne strategy 
proof  c and t  are the same as in the proof of theorem       given the defenders unique ne

hence  c is not a best response to a  which contradicts the assumption that hc   ai is an ne profile

    overview of the results
in some games with multiple attacker resources  the defenders sse strategy is also an ne strategy 
just like in the single attacker resource case  for example  suppose all targets are interchangeable
for both the defender and the attacker  then  the defenders sse strategy is to defend all targets
with equal probabilities  so that the defenders utility from an attack on the least defended targets
is maximized  if the attacker best responds by attacking all targets with equal probabilities  the
resulting strategy profile will be an ne  thus the defenders sse strategy is also an ne strategy
in this case  example   below discusses this case in more detail  we observe that the defenders
sse strategy in this example is the same no matter if the attacker has   or   resources  we use
this observation to construct a sufficient condition under which the defenders sse strategy is also
an ne strategy in security games with multiple attacker resources  proposition       this modest
positive result  however  is not exhaustive in the sense that it does not explain all cases in which the
defenders sse strategy is also an ne strategy  example   describes a game in which the defenders
sse strategy is also an ne strategy  but the condition of proposition     is not met 
in other games with multiple attacker resources  the defenders sse strategy is not part of any
ne profile  the following gives some intuition about how this can happen  suppose that there
is a target ti that the defender strongly hopes will not be attacked  even udc  ti   is very negative  
but given that ti is in fact attacked  defending it does not help the defender much  ud  ti    
udc  ti    udu  ti   is very small   in the sse model  the defender is likely to want to devote defensive
resources to ti   because the attacker will observe this and will not want to attack ti   however  in the
ne model  the defenders strategy cannot influence what the attacker does  so the marginal utility
for assigning defensive resources to ti is small  and  when the attacker has multiple resources  there
may well be another target that the attacker will also attack that is more valuable to defend  so the
defender will send her defensive resources there instead  we provide detailed descriptions of games
in which the defenders sse strategy is not part of any ne profile in examples       and   
since the condition in proposition     implies that the defenders sse and ne strategies do not
change if the number of attacker resources varies  we provide an exhaustive set of example games
in which such equality between the sse and ne strategies is broken in a number of different ways
 examples          and     this set of examples rules out a number of ways in which proposition    
might have been generalized to a larger set of games 
    detailed proofs and examples
under certain assumptions  sse defender strategies will still be ne defender strategies in the model
with multiple attacker resources  we will give a simple sufficient condition for this to hold  first 
we need the following lemma 
lemma      given a security game g l with l attacker resources  let g   be the same game except
with only one attacker resource  let hc  ai be a nash equilibrium of g     suppose that for any target
ti   lai     then  hc  lai is a nash equilibrium of g l  
   

fikorzhyk   y in   k iekintveld   c onitzer     tambe

proof  if lai    for any ti   then la is in fact a feasible attacker strategy in g l   all that is left to
prove is that hd  lai is in fact an equilibrium  the attacker is best responding because the utility of
attacking any given target is unchanged for him relative to the equilibrium of g     the defender is
best responding because the utility of defending any schedule has been multiplied by l relative to
g     and so it is still optimal for the defender to defend the schedules in the support of c 
this lemma immediately gives us the following proposition 
proposition      given a game g l with l attacker resources for which ssas holds  let g   be the
same game except with only one attacker resource  suppose d is an sse strategy in both g l and
g     let a be a strategy for the attacker such that hd  ai is a nash equilibrium of g    we know that
such an a exists by corollary       if lai    for any target ti   then hd  lai is an ne profile in g l  
which means d is both an sse and an ne strategy in g l  
a simple example where proposition     applies can be constructed as follows 
example    suppose there are   targets  which are completely interchangeable for both players 
suppose the defender has   resource  if the attacker has   resource  the defenders sse strategy is
d                   and the attackers ne best response to d is a                    if the attacker
has   resources  the defenders sse strategy is still d  since for all ti    ai     proposition    
applies  and profile hd   ai is an ne profile 
we denote the defenders sse strategy in a game with l attacker resources by cs l and denote
the defenders ne strategy in the same game by cn  l   in example    we have cn      cs    
cs     cn      hence  under some conditions  the defenders strategy is always the sameregardless
of whether we use sse or ne and regardless of whether the attacker has   or   resources  we will
show several examples of games where this is not true  even though ssas holds  for each of the
following cases  we will show an example game for which ssas holds and the relation between
the defenders equilibrium strategies is as specified in the case description  in the first case  the
sse strategy is equal to the ne strategy for l      but the condition of proposition     is not met
because the sse strategy for l     is different from the sse strategy for l      and also because
multiplying the attackers ne strategy in the game with l     attacker resource by   does not result
in a feasible attackers strategy  in the game that has l     attacker resources but is otherwise the
same   in the last three cases  the sse strategy is not equal to the ne strategy for l     
 cs     cn       cn      cs    sse vs  ne makes no difference  but l makes a difference  
 cn       cs     cs     cn     ne with l     is different from the other cases  
 cs      cn      cn      cs    sse with l     is different from the other cases  
 cs      cn      cs      cs     cn      cn       cn      cs    all cases are different  except sse
and ne are the same with l     as implied by corollary      
it is easy to see that these cases are exhaustive  because of the following  corollary     necessitates that cs     cn     because we want ssas to hold and each cs l or cn  l strategy to be unique  
so there are effectively only three potentially different strategies  cn      cs     and cs     cn      they
can either all be the same  as in example   after proposition       all different  the last case   or we
can have exactly two that are the same  the first three cases

we now give the examples  in all our examples  we only have schedules of size    and the
defender has a single resource

it is defended with probability   as well  whether we are in the sse or ne model   if the attacker

table    the example game for cn       cs     cs     cn      this example corresponds to the
intuition given earlier  target t  is a sensitive target for the defender  the defender suffers
a large loss if t  is attacked  however  if t  is attacked  then allocating defensive resources
to it does not benefit the defender much  because of the low marginal utility ud  t        
as a result  target t  is not defended in the ne profile h                        i  but it is
defended in the sse profile h                    i 
now suppose the attacker has   resources  in sse  the defender wants primarily to avoid an
attack on t   so that t  and t  are attacked with probability   each   under this constraint  the
defender wants to maximize the total probability on t  and t   they are interchangeable and both
are attacked  so probability is equally valuable on either one   the defender strategy                
is the unique optimal solution to this optimization problem 
however  it is straightforward to verify that the following is an ne profile if the attacker has  
resources  h                        i  we now prove that this is the unique ne  first  we show that t 
   

fikorzhyk   y in   k iekintveld   c onitzer     tambe

is defended with probability   in any ne  this is because one of the targets t    t  must be attacked
with probability at least     thus  the defender always has an incentive to move probability from
t  to this target  it follows that t  is not defended in any ne  now  if t  is not defended  then t  is
attacked with probability    what remains is effectively a single attacker resource security game on
t  and t  with a clear unique equilibrium h                  i  thereby proving uniqueness 
example    cs      cn      cn      cs      consider the game shown in table    the defender has
  resource  if the attacker has   resource  then the defenders unique minimax ne sse strategy is
the minimax strategy           
now suppose the attacker has   resources  t  must be attacked with probability    because
ud  t              ud  t      ud  t     in ne  this implies that the defender must put her full
probability   on t    hence  the attacker will attack t  with his other resource  so  the unique ne
profile is h                    i 
in contrast  in sse  the defenders primary goal is to avoid an attack on t    which requires
putting probability at least    on t   so that the attacker prefers t  over t     this will result in t 
and t  being attacked  the defender prefers to defend t  with her remaining probability because
ud  t              ud  t     hence  the unique sse profile is h                      i

table    the example game for cs      cn      cn      cs     t  will certainly be attacked by the
attacker  and will hence be more valuable to defend than any other target in ne because
ud  t              ud  t      ud  t     however  in sse with two attacker resources 
it is more valuable for the defender to use her resource to prevent an attack on t  by the
second attacker resource 

example    cs      cn      cs      cs     cn      cn       cn      cs      consider the game in

that the unique defender minimax ne sse strategy is cs     cn                      
if the attacker has   resources  then in sse  the defenders primary goal is to prevent t  from
being attacked  this requires putting at least as much defender probability on t  as on t    and will
result in t  and t  being attacked  given that t  and t  are attacked  placing defender probability
on t  is more than twice as valuable as placing it on t   ud  t         ud  t          hence  even
though for every unit of probability placed on t    we also need to place a unit on t   to keep t  from
being attacked   it is still uniquely optimal for the defender to allocate all her probability mass in
this way  so  the unique defender sse strategy is             
however  it is straightforward to verify that the following is an ne profile if the attacker has
  resources  h                              i  we now prove that this is the unique ne  first  we
show that t  is not defended in any ne  this is because at least one of t  and t  must be attacked
with probability at least     and hence the defender would be better off defending that target instead

concept   with two attacker resources  in the unique ne  it turns out not to be worthwhile
to defend t  at all even though it is always attacked  because ud  t    is low  in contrast 
in the unique sse  t  is defended with relatively high probability to prevent an attack on

next  we show that t  is attacked with probability   in any ne  if t  has positive defender probability 
then  because t  is not defended  t  is definitely more attractive to attack than t    and hence will be
attacked with probability    on the other hand  if the defender only defends t    then t  and t  are

   experimental results
while our theoretical results resolve the leaders dilemma for many interesting and important classes
of security games  as we have seen  there are still some cases where sse strategies are distinct from
ne strategies for the defender  one case is when the schedules do not satisfy the ssas property 
and another is when the attacker has multiple resources  in this section  we conduct experiments to
further investigate these two cases  offering evidence about the frequency with which sse strategies
differ from all ne strategies across randomly generated games  for a variety of parameter settings 
our methodology is as follows  for a particular game instance  we first compute an sse strategy c using the dobss mixed integer linear program  pita et al          we then use the linear
feasibility program below to determine whether or not this sse strategy is part of some ne profile
by attempting to find an appropriate attacker response strategy

here q is the set of attacker pure strategies  which is just the set of targets when there is only one attacker resource  the probability that the attacker plays q is denoted by aq   which must be between
  and    constraint       constraint      forces these probabilities to sum to    constraint     
   

fikorzhyk   y in   k iekintveld   c onitzer     tambe

prevents the attacker from placing positive probabilities on pure strategies that give the attacker a
utility less than the best response utility e c   in constraints      and       z is a variable which
represents the maximum expected utility the defender can get among all pure strategies given the
attackers strategy a  and cd denotes the probability of playing d in c  these two constraints require the defenders strategy c to be a best response to the attackers mixed strategy  therefore  any
feasible solution a to this linear feasibility program  taken together with the stackelberg strategy
c  constitutes a nash equilibrium  conversely  if hc  ai is a nash equilibrium  a must satisfy all
of the lp constraints 
in our experiment  we varied 
 the number of attacker resources 
 the number of  homogeneous  defender resources 
 the size of the schedules that resources can cover 
 the number of schedules 
for each parameter setting  we generated      games with    targets  for each target t  a
pair of defender payoffs  udc  t   udu  t   and a pair of attacker payoffs  uau  t   uac  t   were drawn
uniformly at random from the set   x  y   z    x            y            x   y   in each
game in the experiment  all of the schedules have the same size  except there is also always the
empty scheduleassigning a resource to the empty schedule corresponds to the resource not being
used  the schedules are randomly chosen from the set of all subsets of the targets that have the size
specified by the corresponding parameter 
the results of our experiments are shown in figure    the plots show the percentage of games
in which the sse strategy is not an ne strategy  for different numbers of defender and attacker
resources  different schedule sizes  and different numbers of schedules  for the case where there
is a single attacker resource and schedules have size    the ssas property holds  and the experimental results confirm our theoretical result that the sse strategy is always an ne strategy  if we
increase either the number of attacker resources or the schedule size  then we no longer have such a
theoretical result  and indeed we start to see cases where the sse strategy is not an ne strategy 
let us first consider the effect of increasing the number of attacker resources  we can see that the
number of games in which the defenders sse strategy is not an ne strategy increases significantly
as the number of attacker resources increases  especially as it goes from   to    note the different
scales on the y axes   in fact  when there are   or   attacker resources  the phenomenon that in many
cases the sse strategy is not an ne strategy is consistent across a wide range of values for the other
parameters  
now  let us consider the effect of increasing the schedule size  when we increase the schedule
size  with a single attacker resource   the ssas property no longer holds because we do not include
the subschedules as schedules  and so we do find some games where the sse strategy is not an
ne strategybut there are generally few cases        of this  also  as we generate more random
schedules  the number of games where the sse strategy is not an ne strategy drops to zero  this
is particularly encouraging for domains like fams  where the schedule sizes are relatively small   
   of course  if we increase the number of attacker resources while keeping the number of targets fixed  eventually 
every defender sse strategy will be an ne strategy again  simply because when the number of attacker resources is
equal to the number of targets  the attacker has only one pure strategy available 

   

fis tackelberg vs   nash in s ecurity g ames

figure    the number of games in which the sse strategy is not an ne strategy  for different
parameter settings  each row corresponds to a different number of attacker resources 
and each column to a different schedule size  the number of defender resources is on the
x axis  and each number of schedules is plotted separately  for each parameter setting 
     random games with    targets were generated  the ssas property holds in the
games with schedule size    shown in column     ssas does not hold in the games with
schedule sizes   and    columns   and    

in most cases   and the number of possible schedules is large relative to the number of targets  the
effect of increasing the number of defender resources is more ambiguous  when there are multiple
attacker resources  increasing the schedule size sometimes increases and sometimes decreases the
number of games where the sse strategy is not an ne strategy 
the main message to take away from the experimental results appears to be that for the case of
a single attacker resource  sse strategies are usually also ne strategies even when ssas does not
hold  which appears to further justify the practice of playing an sse strategy  on the other hand 
when there are multiple attacker resources  there are generally many cases where the sse strategy is
not an ne strategy  this strongly poses the question of what should be done in the case of multiple
attacker resources  in settings where it is not clear whether the attacker can observe the defenders
mixed strategy

   uncertainty about the attackers ability to observe  a model for future
research
so far  for security games in which the attacker has only a single resource  we have shown that if
the ssas property is satisfied  then a stackelberg strategy is necessarily a nash equilibrium strategy  section       this  combined with the fact that  as we have shown  the equilibria of these
games satisfy the interchangeability property  section       provides strong justification for playing
a stackelberg strategy when the ssas property is satisfied  also  our experiments  section    suggest that even when the ssas property is not satisfied  a stackelberg strategy is usually a nash
equilibrium strategy  however  this is not the case if we consider security games where the attacker
has multiple resources 
this leaves the question of how the defender should play in games where the stackelberg strategy is not necessarily a nash equilibrium strategy  which is the case in many games with multiple
attacker resources  and also a few games with a single attacker resource where ssas is not satisfied   especially when it is not clear whether the attacker can observe the defenders mixed strategy 
this is a difficult question that cuts to the heart of the normative foundations of game theory  and
addressing it is beyond the scope of this paper  nevertheless  given the real world implications of
this line of research  we believe that it is important for future research to tackle this problem  rather
than leave the question of how to do so completely open ended  in this section we propose a model
that may be useful as a starting point for future research  we also provide a result that this model at
least leads to sensible solutions in ssas games  which  while it is not among the main results in this
paper  does provide a useful sanity check before adopting this model in future research 
in the model that we propose in this section  the defender is uncertain about whether the attacker
can observe the mixed strategy to which the defender commits  specifically  the game is played as
follows  first  the defender commits to a mixed strategy  after that  with probability pobs   the attacker observes the defenders strategy  with probability    pobs   he does not observe the defenders
mixed strategy  figure   represents this model as a larger extensive form game   in this game  first
nature decides whether the attacker will be able to observe the defenders choice of distribution 
then  the defender chooses a distribution over defender resource allocations  hence  the defender
has a continuum of possible moves  in particular  it is important to emphasize here that committing to a distribution over allocations is not the same as randomizing over which pure allocation to
commit to  because in the latter case an observing attacker will know the realized allocation   the
defender does not observe the outcome of natures movehence  it would make no difference if
nature moved after the defender  but having nature move first is more convenient for drawing and
discussing the game tree  finally  the attacker moves  chooses one or more targets to attack   on the
left side of the tree  he does so knowing the distribution to which the defender has committed  and
on the right side of the tree  he does so without knowing the distribution 
given this extensive form representation of the situation  a natural approach is to solve for an
equilibrium of this larger game  it is not possible to apply standard algorithms for solving extensiveform games directly to this game  because the tree has infinite size due to the defender choice of
distributions  nevertheless  one straightforward way of addressing this is to discretize the space of
   at this point  there is a risk of confusion between defender mixed strategies as we have used the phrase so far  and
defender strategies in the extensive form game  in the rest of this section  to avoid confusion  we will usually refer to
the former as distributions over allocationsbecause  technically  a distribution over allocations is a pure strategy
in the extensive form game  so that a defender mixed strategy in the extensive form game would be a distribution
over such distributions

figure    extensive form of the larger game in which the defender is uncertain about the attackers
ability to observe 

distributions  an important question  of course  is whether it is the right thing to do to play an
equilibrium of this game  we now state some simple propositions that serve as sanity checks on this
model  first  we show that if pobs      we just obtain the stackelberg model 
proposition      if pobs      then any subgame perfect equilibrium of the extensive form game
corresponds to an sse of the underlying security game 
proof  we are guaranteed to end up on the left hand side of the tree  where the attacker observes
the distribution to which the defender has committed  in subgame perfect equilibrium  he must
best respond to this distribution  the defender  in turn  must choose her distribution optimally with
respect to this  hence  the result corresponds to an sse 
next  we show that if pobs      we obtain a standard simultaneous move model 
proposition      if pobs      then any nash equilibrium of the extensive form game corresponds to
a nash equilibrium of the underlying security game 
proof  we are guaranteed to end up on the right hand side of the tree  where the attacker observes
nothing about the distribution to which the defender has committed  in a nash equilibrium of the
extensive form game  the defenders strategy leads to some probability distribution over allocations 
in the attackers information set on the right hand side of the tree  the attacker can only place positive
probability on actions that are best responses to this distribution over allocations  conversely  the
defender can only put positive probability on allocations that are best responses to the attackers
distribution over actions  hence  the result is a nash equilibrium of the underlying security game 

at intermediate values of pobs   in sufficiently general settings  an equilibrium of the extensiveform game may correspond to neither an sse or an ne of the basic security game  however 
we would hope that in security games where the stackelberg strategy is also a nash equilibrium
strategysuch as the ssas security games discussed earlier in this paperthis strategy also corresponds to an equilibrium of the extensive form game  the next proposition shows that this is indeed
the case 
   

fikorzhyk   y in   k iekintveld   c onitzer     tambe

proposition      if in the underlying security game  there is a stackelberg strategy for the defender
which is also the defenders strategy in some nash equilibrium  then this strategy is also the defenders strategy in a subgame perfect equilibrium of the extensive form game  
proof  suppose that d is a distribution over allocations that is both a stackelberg strategy and a
nash equilibrium strategy of the underlying security game  let as be the best response that the
attacker plays in the corresponding sse  and let an be a distribution over attacker actions such that
hd   an i is a nash equilibrium of the security game 
we now show how to construct a subgame perfect equilibrium of the extensive form game  let
the defender commit to the distribution d in her information set  the attackers strategy in the
extensive form is defined as follows  on the left hand side of the tree  if the attacker observes that
the defender has committed to d   he responds with as   if the attacker observes that the defender
has committed to any other distribution over allocations  he responds with some best response to
that distribution  in the information set on the right hand side of the tree  the attacker plays an   it
is straightforward to check that the attacker is best responding to the defenders strategy in every
one of his information sets  all that remains to show is that the defender is best responding to the
attackers strategy in the extensive form game  if the defender commits to any other distribution d   
this cannot help her on the left side of the tree relative to d   because d is a stackelberg strategy  it
also cannot help her on the right side of the tree  because d is a best response to an   it follows that
the defender is best responding  and hence we have identified a subgame perfect equilibrium of the
game 
this proposition can immediately be applied to ssas games 
corollary      in security games that satisfy the ssas property  and have a single attacker resource   if d is a stackelberg strategy of the underlying security game  then it is also the defenders
strategy in a subgame perfect equilibrium of the extensive form game 
proof  this follows immediately from proposition     and corollary     
of course  proposition     also applies to games in which ssas does not hold but the stackelberg
strategy is still a nash equilibrium strategywhich was the case in many of the games in our
experiments in section    in general  of course  if the ssas property does not hold  the stackelberg
strategy may not be a nash equilibrium strategy in the underlying security game  if so  the defenders
strategies in equilibria of the extensive form game may correspond to neither stackelberg nor nash
strategies in the underlying security game  if that is the case  then some other method can be used
to solve the extensive form game directlyfor example  discretizing the space of distributions for
the attacker and then applying a standard algorithm for solving for an equilibrium of the resulting
game  the latter method will not scale very well  and we leave the design of better algorithms for
future research 

   additional related work
in the first few sections of this paper  we discussed recent uses of game theory in security domains 
the formal model of security games  and how this model differs from existing classes of games such
   this will also hold for stronger solution concepts than subgame perfect equilibrium

as strategically zero sum and unilaterally competitive games  we discuss additional related work in
this section 
there has been significant interest in understanding the interaction of observability and commitment in general stackelberg games  bagwells early work        questions the value of commitment
to pure strategies given noisy observations by followers  but the ensuing and on going debate illustrated that the leader retains her advantage in case of commitment to mixed strategies  van damme
  hurkens        huck   muller         guth  kirchsteiger  and ritzberger        extend these
observations to n player games  maggi        shows that in games with private information  the
leader advantage appears even with pure strategies  there has also been work on the value of commitment for the leader when observations are costly  morgan   vardy        
several examples of applications of stackelberg games to model terrorist attacks on electric
power grids  subways  airports  and other critical infrastructure were described by brown et al 
       and sandler and arce m          drake        and pluchinsky        studied different
aspects of terrorist planning operations and target selection  these studies indicate that terrorist
attacks are planned with a certain level of sophistication  in addition  a terrorist manual shows that
a significant amount of information used to plan such attacks is collected from public sources  u s 
department of justice         zhuang and bier        studied reasons for secrecy and deception
on the defenders side  a broader interest in stackelberg games is indicated by applications in other
areas  such as network routing and scheduling  korilis  lazar    orda        roughgarden        
in contrast with all this existing research  our work focuses on real world security games  illustrating subset  equivalence  interchangeability  and uniqueness properties that are non existent in
general stackelberg games studied previously  of course  results of this general nature date back to
the beginning of game theory  von neumanns minimax theorem        implies that in two player
zero sum games  equilibria are interchangeable and an optimal sse strategy is also a minimax  
ne strategy  however  as we have discussed earlier  the security games we studied are generally
not zero sum games  nor are they captured by more general classes of games such as strategically
zero sum  moulin   vial        or unilaterally competitive  kats   thisse        games 
tennenholtz        studies safety level strategies  with two players  a safety level  or maximin 
strategy for player   is a mixed strategy that maximizes the expected utility for player    under the
assumption that player   acts to minimize player  s expected utility  rather than maximize his own
utility   tennenholtz shows that under some conditions  the utility guaranteed by a safety level
strategy is equal or close to the utility obtained by player   in nash equilibrium  this may sound
reminiscent of our result that nash strategies coincide with minimax strategies  but in fact the results
are quite different  in particular  for non zero sum games  maximin and minimax strategies are not
identical  the following example gives a simple game for which our result holds  but the safety level
strategy does not result in a utility that is close to the equilibrium solution 
example    consider the game shown in table     each player has   resource  in this game 
the safety level  maximin  strategy for the defender is to place her resource on target    thereby
guaranteeing herself a utility of at least    however  the attacker has a dominant strategy to
attack target    so that if the defender actually plays the safety level strategy  she can expect utility
    on the other hand  in the minimax stackelberg nash solution  she will defend target   and
receive utility   
kalai        studies the idea that as the number of players of a game grows  the equilibria
become robust to certain changes in the extensive form  such as which players move before which

other ones  and what they learn about each others actions  at a high level this is reminiscent of our
results  in the sense that we also show that for a class of security games  a particular choice between
two structures of the game  one player committing to a mixed strategy first  or both players moving
at the same time  does not affect what the defender should play  though the attackers strategy is
affected   however  there does not seem to be any significant technical similarityour result relies
on the structure of this class of security games and not on the number of players becoming large
 after all  we only consider games with two players  
pita  jain  ordonez  tambe et al         provide experimental results on observability in stackelberg games  they test a variety of defender strategies against human players  attackers  who choose
their optimal attack when provided with limited observations of the defender strategies  results
show the superiority of a defenders strategy computed assuming human anchoring bias in attributing a probability distribution over the defenders actions  this research complements our
paper  which provides new mathematical foundations  testing the insights of our research with
the experimental paradigm of pita  jain  ordonez  tambe et al         with expert players  is an
interesting topic for future research 

   summary
this paper is focused on a general class of defender attacker stackelberg games that are directly
inspired by real world security applications  the paper confronts fundamental questions of how a
defender should compute her mixed strategy  in this context  this paper provides four key contributions  first  exploiting the structure of these security games  the paper shows that the nash equilibria in security games are interchangeable  thus alleviating the defenders equilibrium selection
problem for simultaneous move games  second  resolving the defenders dilemma  it shows that
under the ssas restriction on security games  any stackelberg strategy is also a nash equilibrium
strategy  and furthermore  this strategy is unique in a class of security games of which armor is
a key exemplar  third  when faced with a follower that can attack multiple targets  many of these
properties no longer hold  providing a key direction for future research  fourth  our experimental
results emphasize positive properties of security games that do not fit the ssas property  in practical
terms  these contributions imply that defenders in applications such as armor  pita et al        
and iris  tsai et al         can simply commit to sse strategies  thus helping to resolve a major
dilemma in real world security applications
