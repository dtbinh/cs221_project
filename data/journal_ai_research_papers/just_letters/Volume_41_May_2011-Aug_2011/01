abstract
usually voting rule requires agents give preferences linear orders  however 
cases impractical agent give linear order alternatives 
suggested let agents submit partial orders instead  then  given voting rule 
profile partial orders  alternative  candidate  c  two important questions arise 
first  still possible c win  second  c guaranteed win 
possible winner necessary winner problems  respectively  two problems
divided two sub problems  determining whether c unique winner  that
is  c winner   determining whether c co winner  that is  c set
winners  
consider setting number alternatives unbounded votes
unweighted  completely characterize complexity possible necessary winner
problems following common voting rules  class positional scoring rules  including
borda   copeland  maximin  bucklin  ranked pairs  voting trees  plurality runoff 

   introduction
multiagent systems  often  agents must make joint decision spite fact
different preferences alternatives  example  agents may
decide joint plan allocation tasks resources  general solution
problem agents vote alternatives  is  agent gives
ranking  linear order  alternatives  voting rule takes submitted
rankings input  based produces chosen alternative  the winner   set
chosen alternatives  design good voting rules studied centuries
social choice community  recently  computer scientists become interested
social choicemotivated part applications multiagent systems 
applications  hence  community interested computational social choice emerged 
traditional social choice  agents usually required give linear order
alternatives  however  especially multiagent systems applications  always
practical  one  sometimes  set alternatives large  example 
generally many possible joint plans allocations tasks resources agent
give linear order them  settings  agents must use different voting language
represent preferences  example  use cp nets  boutilier  brafman

xia         however  agent uses cp net  or similar language  represent
preferences  generally gives us partial order alternatives  another

   conclusion future work
considered following problem  given set alternatives  voting rule 
set partial orders  alternatives possible necessary winners  is 
alternatives would win some all extension partial orders  considered case
votes weighted number alternatives bounded  table  
introduction summarizes results  results hold whether alternative
must unique winner  merely co winner  unless specifically mentioned 
paper  restriction partial orders  however  reason
partial orders preferences submitted cp nets  introduces
additional structure partial orders  is  partial orders correspond
cp net  hence  positive results would still apply  immediately obvious
negative results would still apply 
another approach approximate sets possible necessary winners  precisely  asked output superset  respectively  subset  possible  respectively 
necessary  winners size output set within fixed ratio
number possible  respectively  necessary  winners  pini et al         proved
inapproximability set possible necessary winners single transferable vote
rule  stv  rule  conjecture similar inapproximability results hold
common voting rules studied paper  for possible necessary winner
