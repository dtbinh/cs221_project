abstract
information extraction task automatically picking information interest
unconstrained text  information interest usually extracted two steps 
first  sentence level processing locates relevant pieces information scattered throughout
text  second  discourse processing merges coreferential information generate
output  first step  pieces information locally identified without recognizing
relationships among them  key word search simple pattern search achieve
purpose  second step requires deeper knowledge order understand relationships
among separately identified pieces information  previous information extraction systems
focused first step  partly required link piece
information pieces  link extracted pieces information map
onto structured output format  complex discourse processing essential 
paper reports japanese information extraction system merges information using
pattern matcher discourse processor  evaluation results show high level system
performance approaches human performance 

   introduction

textract  information extraction system described here  uses pattern matcher
similar sri s fastus pattern matcher  hobbs et al          matcher implemented
finite state automaton  unlike pattern matchers  textract s matcher deals
word matching problems caused word segmentation ambiguities often found
japanese compound words 
goal pattern matcher identify concepts represented words
phrases text  pattern matcher first performs simple key word based concept
search  locating individual words associated concepts  second step template
pattern search locates phrasal patterns involving critical pieces information identified preprocessor  template pattern search identifies relationships
matched objects defined pattern well recognizing concept behind relationship  one typical concept relationship  economic activity  companies
participate other 
usually dicult determine relationships among pieces information
identified separate sentences  relationships often stated implicitly 
even text explicitly mentions descriptions often located far enough
apart make detection dicult  although importance discourse processing information extraction emphasized message understanding conferences  lehnert
  sundheim        hirschman         system presented satisfactorily addressed
issue 
discourse processor textract able correlate individual pieces information
throughout text  textract merges concepts pattern matcher identified
separately  and usually different sentences  concepts involve companies  textract unify multiple references company even company
name missing  abbreviated  pronominalized  furthermore  processor segments

extraction tasks must identify individual entities certain
relationships among them  often  however  particular piece extracted information
describes part relationship  partial information must merged
pieces information referring entities  merging produce correct results 
therefore  correct identification entity references crucial 

   problem definition

discourse segmentation concept merging discussed using example text 

    word segmentation
japanese word segmentation preprocessor gives rise subsequent under matching
problem  key word text found word segmentor s lexicon 
segmentor tends divide separate words  current lexicon  example

venture    f    kaisyo  dissolve   segmented two individual nouns  thus
key word search   f    teikei kaisyo  succeed segmented sentence 
hand  pattern matching process allows  default  partial matching
key word word text       teikei     z    gyoum teikei

among companies  as described section     information interest therefore found

    discourse segmentation concept merging

joint ventures domain  tie up relationship object contains pointers objects
economic activities  as shown figure     company involved multiple tie ups  merging information tie up relationship according topic companies
sometimes yields incorrect results  consider following example 
 x corp  tied corp  x start selling products
japan next month  last year x started similar joint venture
z inc  

obviously  sale second sentence related tie up relationship x
y  however  since topic company  subject sentence  x three
sentences  sale could related x z tie up relationship  incorrect
merging avoided separating text two blocks  first two sentences
describe x tie up  last sentence describes x z tie up  thus 
discourse segmentation necessary identify portions text containing related pieces
information  crl brandeis diderot system segments joint ventures text
two types text structures  cowie et al          known well discourse
segmentation performed  however 
text segmented  concepts identified pieces information merged

fipattern matching discourse processing

sixty seconds microelectronics article twenty four seconds average 
human analysts took fifteen minutes complete english microelectronics

information extraction 
tipster muc   systems processed japanese english domains 
systems generally performed better japanese domains corresponding english domains  one likely reason structure japanese articles fairly standard 
particularly japanese joint ventures domain  readily analyzed
two discourse structure types described paper  another possible reason characteristic writing style  expressions need identified tend appear first
sentences form suitable pattern matching 
textract japanese microelectronics system copied preprocessor  concept
search pattern matcher  company name unification discourse processor
used textract japanese joint ventures system  microelectronics system
developed three weeks one person replaced joint ventures concepts key
words representative microelectronics concepts key words  lower performance
textract microelectronics system compared joint ventures system largely
due short development time  probably due less homogeneous discourse
structure writing style microelectronics articles 
   conclusions future research

paper described importance discourse processing three aspects information extraction  identifying key information throughout text  i e  topic companies
company name references tipster muc   domains  segmenting text select relevant portions interest  merging concepts identified sentence level processing 
basic performance system depends preprocessor  however  since many
pieces identified information put directly slots otherwise used fill slots
later processing  textract s pattern matcher solves matching problem caused
segmentation ambiguities often found japanese compound words  pattern
matching system based finite state automaton simple runs fast  factors
essential rapid system development performance improvement 
improve system performance pattern matching architecture  increase
number patterns unavoidable  since matching large number patterns
lengthy process  ecient pattern matcher required shorten running time 
tomita s new generalized lr parser  known one fastest parsers practical
purposes  skips unnecessary words parsing  bates   lavie         parser
evaluation investigate appropriate information extraction japanese
text  eriguchi   kitani         pattern matching alone  however  able improve
system performance human levels complicated information extraction task
tipster muc    even task well defined suitable pattern matching

research discussed paper based application oriented  domain specific 
language specific approach relying patterns heuristic rules collected
particular corpus  obvious patterns heuristic rules described paper
cover wide range applications  domains  languages  empirical approach
described worth investigating even entirely new task  however  since
achieve high level system performance relatively short development time 
linguistic theory based systems tend become complex dicult maintain  especially
incorporate full text parsing  simplicity empirically based  pattern oriented
system textract keeps development time short evaluation cycle quick 
corpus analysis key element corpus based paradigm  estimated
corpus analysis took half development time textract  statistically based
corpus analysis tools necessary obtain better performance shorter development
time  tools could help developers extract important patterns heuristic
rules corpus  monitor system performance evaluationimprovement cycle
