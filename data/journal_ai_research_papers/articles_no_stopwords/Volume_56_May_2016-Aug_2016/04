sameas partof matches spatial objects different geospatial datasets
especially crowd sourced datasets since geometries crowd sourced data usually accurate precise buffer geometries margin error level

introduction
motivation work qualitative spatial logics comes needs integrating
disparate geospatial datasets especially crowd sourced geospatial datasets crowd sourced
data involves non specialists data collection sharing maintenance compared
authoritative geospatial data collected surveyors geodata professionals crowd sourced data less accurate less well structured often provides richer
user information reflects real world changes quickly much lower cost
jackson rahemtulla morley interests national mapping agencies
government organisations users geospatial data able integrate
use different geospatial data synergistically
geospatial data matching refers establishing correspondences matches
spatial objects represented different geospatial datasets essential step
data comparison data integration enrichment change detection data update
matching authoritative geospatial data crowd sourced geospatial data non trivial
task geometry representations location place different datasets usually exactly objects sometimes represented different levels
granularity example consider geometries objects nottingham city centre given
ordnance survey great britain osgb openstreetmap osm
figure position shape prezzo ristorante represented differently
osgb data dotted osm data solid victoria shopping centre represented

order integrate datasets need determine objects
represent entity sometimes objects one dataset parts objects
dataset example victoria shopping centre statements
representing two types relations referred sameas matches partof
matches respectively one way produce matches use locations geometries
objects although course use lexical labels associated objects
names restaurants etc previous work du alechina jackson hart
present method generates matches location lexical information
spatial objects generated matches may contain errors seen retractable
assumptions require validation checking one way use logical reasoning
check consistency matches respect statements input datasets
description logic reasoning correctness matches checked respect
classification information example wrong state spatial objects
b bank b clinic concepts bank clinic
disjoint containing common elements however sufficient validating
matches spatial objects example two spatial objects close
one dataset cannot matched two spatial objects far away apart
dataset matter whether type therefore spatial
reasoning required validate matches regard location information addition

appendix b alternative proof path consistency lemma
appendix would provide sketch alternative proof idea
path consistency lemma since may appeal readers proof
presented section alternative proof uses lemma
lemma distance constraint p q h ds h
exist

p q p q ds h
identity definable intervals
proof lemma p q h left definable right definable definition
exists sequence distance constraints pi pi hi p p pn q n
h hn h h greatest
lower bound value openness definition p q ds
lemma definition identity definable interval similarly definition exists h h least upper bound
value openness p q ds identity definable interval intersection rules h
proof sketch alternative proof path consistency lemma suppose
path consistent exist p q g p q g ds g
g g g lemma exist p q p q ds
g identity definable intervals similarly
g identity definable intervals g g
holds iff one following holds
without loss generality let us suppose lemma
iff let identity definable interval
since p q p q ds lemma
p q p q left definable right definable since p q
q p lemma p p left definable right definable rest
proof almost proof path consistency lemma starting
lemma glb h presented section discuss different
ways obtain given greatest lower bound role similar h check
whether derived every valid case

appendix c consequences path consistency lemma
appendix state explicitly implications path consistency lemma
lemma let finite consistent set formulas distance constraint p q h

proof follows immediately proof path consistency lemma
