introduction
one important projects natural language processing years
construction english wordnet wordnet princeton university direction george miller wordnet consists lexical database english
words grouped sets cognitive synonyms called synsets eectiveness wordnet wide range language technology applications inspired many researchers create

basic concepts next small wordnet developed automatic semi automatic
techniques process mono lingual resources language specific properties
employed wordnets created manner later mapped onto wordnet
ili expansion multilingual wordnet constructed translating words inside synsets wordnet existing wordnets target
language multi lingual resources therefore structure original wordnet
preserved words translated
among dierent methods proposed wordnet construction applicable low resource languages methods follow merge labourintensive time consuming moreover need vast knowledge language require many resources main obstacle low resource languages
makes inapplicable practice hand methods
follow expansion usually adopt wordnet structure correct
translation associated words wordnet synsets target language
process multilingual resources comparable corpora kaji watanabe

rodrguez patanakul charnyote bond isahara kanzaki uchimoto
lam al tarouti kalita used causes bottleneck low resource
languages
taking deeper look expansion methods synset wordnet
kept words associated translated target language bi lingual
dictionary usually employed english words inside wordnet synsets translated
since dictionaries translate word sense word sense rather word word
translations ambiguous disambiguated looking carefully
translating english words inside wordnet synset set candidate words target
language obtained equivalent senses english words
thus omitted methods following expansion rank
candidate words omit low rated ones candidate sets task scoring
candidate words wordnet synsets considered optimization sub optimal values found expectation maximization montazery
faili proposed method extension work low resource languages
automatically constructing large scale high quality
wordnets low resource languages studied two major approaches merge
expansion first one suitable requires vast knowledge
target language many language resources preferred utilize wordnets languages adopting structure translating content
finding correct senses target language words ai complete mallery
analogy np completeness complexity theory
whose diculty equivalent solving central ai navigli
iterative optimization method cross lingual wsd proposed
local optimum reasonable time main idea iteratively
improve estimation probability selecting wordnet synsets words
target language additionally proposed method needs resources suitable


fiautomatic wordnet development low resource languages

poor resource languages investigate performance proposed method persian selected poor resource language resulting wordnet examined
conducting several experiments

section automatic methods constructing wordnets reviewed
expansion main stage expansion methods finding
set words lexicalizes concept captured given synset existing wordnet
another language candidate words usually extracted dictionary scoring
system utilized correct words
work kaji watanabe gloss information wordnet
used automatic construction japanese wordnet given english synset
calculates score japanese translation candidates according gloss
appended synset score defined sum correlations translation candidates associated words appear gloss pair words
deemed associated amount mutual information predefined threshold since availability bi lingual corpora limited iterative
proposed calculating pair wise correlations
another study creating wordnet automatically expanding wordnet describes
romanian wordnet work barbu barbu mititelu order identify
romanian words corresponding wordnet synset several heuristics proposed according first heuristic words related synset share common meaning
therefore intersection translations words associated wordnet synsets
considered second heuristic states synset hypernym share
meaning therefore intersection word translations given wordnet synset
hypernym selected romanian synset according third heuristic
translations domain label selected given wordnet synset
fourth heuristic romanian word selected english translations words
definition maximum similarity words gloss given synset
conducted patanakul charnyote semi automatic expanding presented construct thai wordnet candidates links
thai words wordnet synsets derived wordnet translations rank links criteria used categorized three groups
monosemic polysemic structural criteria monosemic criteria focus english words
one meaning assume english words one synset
wordnet polysemic criteria focus english words multiple meanings
believe english words multiple synsets wordnet structural criteria
focus structural relations among synsets respect wordnet
another idea creating wordnet use word aligned parallel corpus n languages annotate word lexical sense tag consists n tuple aligned

conclusion

fiautomatic wordnet development low resource languages

target language used languages generate wordnets
resources needed proposed include bi lingual dictionary monolingual corpus proposed method belongs expansion creates
multi lingual wordnet word target language equivalent synset
wordnet known
proposed method applied persian language quality resulting wordnet examined several experiments precision according
farsnet according manual judgement reason dierence
wordnet synsets fine grained comparison farsnet synsets
synsets farsnet mapped onto one synset wordnet
however farsnet provides one two wordnet synsets frasnet synsets
means correct links resulting wordnet considered
incorrect thus reported precision becomes low resulting wordnet
contains words persian language bijankhan
corpus several wordnets languages additionally core

precision wordnet corpus size therefore important use
large enough dictionaries
