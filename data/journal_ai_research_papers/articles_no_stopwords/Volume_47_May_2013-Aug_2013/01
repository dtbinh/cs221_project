dispatching heuristic
since static np hard solving optimality may prohibitively expensive
therefore investigate heuristic inspired apparent tardiness cost
atc heuristic composite dispatching rule typically applied single machine
scheduling sum weighted tardiness objective pinedo

preliminary experiments demonstrated chosen dispatching rule average
higher wave coverage compared first two heuristics coverage
third heuristic advantage easy understand implement
hybrid heuristic complete approaches
hybrid heuristic complete heuristic solution provides lower bound
maximization objective equation may improve performance complete
approaches therefore simple hybrid first runs dispatching heuristic uses
objective value starting lower bound complete approaches assume
