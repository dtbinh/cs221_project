abstract
investigate two systems fully proportional representation suggested chamberlin courant monroe systems assign representative voter
sum misrepresentations minimized winner determination
systems known np hard hence work aims investigating whether
variants proposed rules specific electorates
solved efficiently variation rules instead minimizing sum misrepresentations considered minimizing maximal misrepresentation introducing effectively
two rules general case minimax versions classical rules appeared
still np hard
investigated parameterized complexity winner determination two classical two rules respect several parameters mixture
positive negative e g proved fixed parameter tractability parameter number candidates fixed parameter intractability number winners
single peaked electorates overwhelmingly positive provide polynomial time considered rule remains
np hard single peaked electorates classical monroe rule

introduction
important conceptual difference purpose single winner multiwinner elections single winner social choice rules used make final decisions e g
elect president choose certain course action multi winner election rules
used elect assembly whose members authorized take final decisions
behalf society main property multi winner rules satisfy
elected assembly represents society adequately particular means
final decision taken opinions existing society heard taken

scheme proportional representation attempts secure assembly whose
membership far possible proportionate different shades political opinion held throughout country microcosm
true reflexion macrocosm black p
although single winner social choice rule easily extended select
assemblye g choosing candidates best scores applying rule repeatedly
required quantity representatives electedthis wrong
brams fishburn see lu boutilier experimental evidence
reason majoritarian logic dominates design single winner social
choice rules cannot provide balanced assembly membership
standard solution electing assembly division
election single member districts approximately equal population district
elects one member assembly single winner rule normally plurality
although one might question whether districting instead total adult
population number registered voters current practice well established
entrenched law many countries including united states brams however
main districting fact fails
give representation minorities minority may comprise population
represented assembly positive side districting method provides
high level accountability voters know representative address
particular issues even recall fail represent decent
standard
voting systemse g cumulative voting single non transferable vote multiwinner variants single transferable vote party list systemshave designed
solve representation minorities brams fishburn however
none scored high accountability may even seem certain
trade cannot representation minorities accountability
however case important idea suggested charles dodgson
known lewis carroll considered different form black
idea developed chamberlin courant later monroe
relative advantages methods political science point view
extensively discussed brams dodgson asserted representation system
coalitions election would formed voters
necessary time information allow coalitions elect representative
adopted sizable minority form coalition represented
realization idea required concept concept misrepresentation assumed voters form individual preferences candidates
political ideology judgement abilities candidates participate
deliberations decision making consistent individuals would wish act
present chamberlin courant p way revolution
indeed single winner literature voting rules widely accepted
voters political preferences complex first choices alone however
multi winner voting literature fixation first preferences led researchers think
proportional representation exclusively terms first preferences list systems


fion computation fully proportional representation

proportional representation parties assigned number seats parliament
proportional number votes first preferences received systems
single non transferable vote block voting cumulative voting take second preferences account levin nalebuff single transferable vote
system proportional representationin fact family voting methods according
tideman richardson allows voters express order preference
candidates levin nalebuff voters rank candidates order preference
first preference votes first looked votes transferred
necessary candidates comfortably elected done
badly eliminated election
voter represented candidate first preference reasonable
say represented optimally misrepresentation case zero
general voter represented candidate ith preference may assume
misrepresented degree si course reasonable assume
sm case rule measuring total misrepresentation
fully defined vector sm number candidates
analogy positional scoring rules single winner elections may say
misrepresentation function positional general choosing proper
misrepresentation function far trivial work levin nalebuff
p difficulty vividly illustrated electorate uniformly distributed
segment choose three representatives equally
spaced selected minimize average distance
traveled nearest legislator broadest possible framework
misrepresentation function may even voter dependent
staying classical positional misrepresentation functions time suppose every voter assigned representative way measuring total
misrepresentation whole society may adopt harsanyi

chamberlin courant monroe consider best set

fibetzler slinko uhlmann

function methods however different difference important chamberlin courant impose restriction function assigns candidates
voters may potentially lead different number voters represented
candidate remedy chamberlin courant suggested use weighted voting
assembly elected candidate weight equal number voters
represent monroe rejected insisted principle one member
assembly one vote reason insisted difference numbers
voters assigned two representatives one
reasons monroe rejected chamberlin courant quite
substantial proportional allocation weights known excessive voting powers
electorates larger constituencies much debate right
way allocating weights representatives alternative chamberlin courants
method would give representatives weights proportional square root
number voters represent justified fact due square root
law penrose priori voting power defined penrose banzhaf index
member voting body inversely proportional square root size

voter w r w c r v recursively solve corresponding subinstance

found recursion stops k reporting voters
represented reporting yes
correctness corresponding obvious since voter v must represented candidate c r v c r regarding running time one branches
r possibilities every considered voter decreases value k one
every subinstance hence investigates r k possibilities
extend branching strategy work cc mw branching
recursion displayed invoked arguments v r note

correctness seen follows first checks
whether misrepresentation bound solution size exceeded line second
checks whether current candidate set already winner set
whether voters represented assignment within misrepresentation bound
line otherwise arbitrarily chosen voter v line tries
possible ways representation without exceeding misrepresentation bound line
possibility decreases r value needed representation v
corresponding candidate line possibility implies candidate added
current solution clearly assign voters optimally represented
candidate hence delete corresponding voters line finally
recursively invoke branch procedure corresponding subinstance line since
possibilities represent v considered least one possibility must lead solution
one exists
regarding running time recursive call line

hence c increased one line every call case c

resident ranks cost facility according distance facility
place residence
multiset candidates model
may compromise solution two systems chamberlin courant
monroe may still divide voters equal almost equal groups may assign
representative one group voters say n voters k
representatives elected may split voters groups sizes n k n k
allow candidate represent one group mathematically would
selecting set representatives cardinality k multiset
cardinality classic monroe example considers subscription newspapers
common room fact better fit multiset model indeed demand say
financial times strong several copies newspaper subscribed
still need use weighted voting assembly case weights
