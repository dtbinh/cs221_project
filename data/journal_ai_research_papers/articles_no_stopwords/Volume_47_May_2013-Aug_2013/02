able draw conclusions inconsistent set formulae indeed
paraconsistent logic allows subset inferences could obtained classical logic

giving broad overview class first note interestingly rather big class
instantiations dungs theory returning inconsistent showed caminada amgoud

taken account since already captures significant number systems

basics argumentation
already mentioned supposes one given set classical propositional logic
formulae use well known e g besnard hunter amgoud cayrol
gorogiannis hunter logic instantiating dungs theory l denotes
set well formed formulae stands classical entailment logical equivalence
use notation mc set maximal consistent subsets
logical argument defined pair support conclusion
definition argument argument pair minimal set
inclusion consistent set formulae
argument use function supp denote support
conc denote conclusion
example let b
c arguments constructed example
supp conc
given set formulae denote arg set arguments constructed
formally arg argument supp let arg l denote set
arguments constructedsfrom language propositional logic given set
arguments e denote base e ae supp suppose function arg defined l
function base defined arg l slightly abusing notation sometimes write
arg respectively base restriction functions set formulae respectively
arguments
definition argumentation system argumentation system pair r
arg l set arguments r binary relation pair b r say
attacks b sometimes use notation arb instead b r

order simplify notation explicitly mention argumentation system
clear context argumentation system refer since arguments built
formulae suppose attack relation defined specifying condition every
two arguments b attacks b condition definition
attack relation satisfied example condition conclusion logically
equivalent negation conclusion b suppose attack relations defined
set arg l arg l every set arg l use restriction attack
relation set aa order simplify notation simply write r attack
relation defined set arg l arg l well restriction attack relation
every set arg l
order determine mutually acceptable sets arguments different semantics
introduced argumentation first introduce basic notions conflict freeness defence
definition conflict free defence let f r e
e conflict free exist arguments b e r b
e defends every b b r exists c e
c r b
let us define commonly used semantics
definition acceptability semantics let f r b say set b
admissible conflict free defends elements
b complete extension b defends arguments contains
arguments defends
b preferred extension maximal respect set inclusion admissible set
b stable extension b conflict free b exists b b
b r
b semi stable extension b complete extension union set
b set arguments attacked b maximal set inclusion
b grounded extension b minimal set inclusion complete extension
b ideal extension b maximal set inclusion admissible set contained
every preferred extension
argumentation system f r denote extx f slight abuse

defining setting
specified knowledge base construct argumentation system f
arg r chosen semantics calculate extensions since components
system except semantics attack relation fixed whether instantiation
corresponds maxi consistent operator depends exclusively two components next
definition provides formal definition mean saying instantiation dungs
framework corresponds maxi consistent operator idea function arg
bijection mc extensions corresponding argumentation system
definition mc ext let x argumentation semantics say attack relation r
satisfies mc extx every finite set propositional formulae
arg bijection mc extx arg r
means every set mc holds arg ext arg r
every e ext arg r exists mc e arg example say
attack relation r satisfies mc extc every finite arg
bijection mc extc arg r sometimes clear context
semantics refer semantics important use simplified notation
mc ext say attack relation r falsifies mc extx r satisfy
mc extx following example shows attack relation satisfy mc exts
example consider attack relation known defeating rebut denoted rdr defined
follows two arguments b say attacks b write ardr b
conc conc b attack relation falsifies mc exts see sufficient
set formulae arg bijection mc arg rdr end
consider denote f arg rdr see mc
denote e arg e arg exts f
e e rdr satisfy mc exts consider argument
note e observe every argument b arg brdr
conc b words every argument b arg b attacks
conc b recall definition know every argument b
supp b conc b thus every argument b arg brdr supp b
since argument b arg supp b
thus argument attacked argument e means e stable extension
f consequently arg bijection mc exts f hence rdr falsifies
mc exts
complete incomplete systems
two ways study link instantiated argumentation system f containing
arguments attacks corresponding knowledge base containing formulae first scenario follows
choose attack relation r semantics x

situation
example let r defined every b arg l b r exists
supp b conc let us use preferred semantics let f r

vice versa extension e b note conclusion accepted argument
however take union formulae used supports arguments f
obtain two maximal consistent subsets knowledge base

second scenario one cannot expect arg bijection mc ext r
incomplete argumentation system stand obtained conclude system
arg base meaningless would certainly hasty let us consider
question detail namely know missing arguments added intelligent

technical side concentrate studying properties class attack relations
satisfying mc ext identifying attack relations serving lower upper bounds classes
relations non satisfying mc ext
one open questions set conditions attack relation satisfies
conditions satisfies mc ext recently direct undercut direct
defeat known attack relations satisfying condition vesic consequently
seemed space attack relations satisfying condition rather narrow note similarity
direct undercut direct defeat however present shows rba belongs
mc ext indicating class instantiations corresponding maxi consistent
operator much larger
formal framework studied classical propositional logic argumentation vast majority ideas considerations present hold
instantiations dungs theory example setting studied modgil prakken
words obtained argumentation frameworks could compared
obtained operator slightly adapting definition operator one study
questions link obtained argumentation system
obtained operator strict defeasible rules argumentation help us
operators argumentation systems returning cannot captured
operator answering questions certainly part future work
