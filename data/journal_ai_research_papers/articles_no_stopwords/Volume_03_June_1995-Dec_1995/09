reduction power consumption maintaining computational power achieved
low cost simd computer architectures comprising large number extremely
simple relatively slow clocked processing elements systems slower device
speeds provide effective mechanism trading power consumption silicon area
maintaining computational power unchanged major drawbacks


solution hardware replication increases silicon area thus

suitable designs extreme area constraints
parallelism must accompanied extra routing requiring extra power issue
must carefully considered optimized
use parallel computer architectures involves redesigning
different computational model
since number processing units must high system size constraints
processing elements must extremely simple performing simple basic operations

much detail former known methods used decrease
presence details necessary choose one decrease strength
feature extracted purpose low pass filter neighborhoodbased anisotropic average filter would reduce presence details
sharpness road boundaries rendering detection dicult since road
