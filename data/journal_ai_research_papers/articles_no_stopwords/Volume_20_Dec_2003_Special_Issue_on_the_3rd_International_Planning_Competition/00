general agreement makes hard particular
approaches best suited particular kinds domains
accepted scientific methodology addressing questions frame precise
hypotheses prior collection data sets order control extraneous
variables might distort reality respect questions date
practice community respect competitions
third competition proceeded previous years collecting data prior detailed
consideration specific questions wished answer community yet
agreed primary role competition provide carefully crafted platform
scientific investigation planners indeed main roles far motivate
researchers field identify goals thereby push forward
horizons publicise progress wider community however competitions
winners natural tendancy draw conclusions competition data
sets state art conclusions scientifically supported
misleading even erroneous therefore argument trying combine
two objectives although admittedly tension might make
difficult combine successfully
way competitions currently conducted
analyses describe post hoc conducted analyses
data collected competition period run experiments
competition participants felt important data
submitted competition comprise evidence judged
identified number analyses think provide interesting information
community following sections explore theme
rigorous way possible within constraints data disposal
difficult work fixed data set collected without precise experimental
questions mind unable test many hypotheses occurred us
analyses data inappropriate incomplete however despite
limitations data set believe able pose answer
important questions comparative performances revealed competition
phrase objectives analyses terms null alternative hyptheses
standard applying statistical tests partly
inspired earlier work howe dahlman work raised standard
evaluation planners done compels community

two performed pairwise comparisons performances tracks

planners tracks use significance level wish
extrapolate collections pairwise comparisons infer confidence p
level transitive relationships planners strips track
largest perform pairwise comparisons confidence level
required transitive picture use confidence level resulting
slightly conservative analysis
use sufficiently large samples distribution used wilcoxon test
approximately normal therefore quote z values indicate significance
differences mean performances paired planners compare
pairs planners cases superiority planner another clear
examination raw data statistical testing obviated
wilcoxon test tells us one planner performs consistently better another
whether consistency statistically significant tell us much better
one planner another could little difference performance
perhaps discrepancy accounted mere implementation differences
consistency difference occurs determines whether statistically
significant discrepancy performances planners one planner perform
consistently better another even though wins time example
comparison b planner might win frequently b
faster solving subset set even though much slower solving
another subset provided subset b sufficiently large
greater number wins due emerge significant example set
ranked according differences performance first
ranking last b obtain score b score
case significant difference emerges regardless magnitude difference
b last three see appendix c rank sum
benefit allowing large numbers small wins outweigh small numbers large wins
desirable large win indication overall better
performance interested trying measure consistency domain independent
behaviour therefore comparing consistency performance across domains given
planners perform differently within domains
size win need indicate complexity underlying
allow us make judgements scalability essentially test reveals
consistent patterns performance across range consider
interest knowing one planner significantly consistently better another
helps us make objective judgement two planners performing better
across varied set variability performances consistent
pattern emerges hard perhaps impossible make judgement objectively
cases comparison wilcoxon test lead statistically
significant conclusions proportion wins one planners higher
consistent null hypothesis equal performance tested z test
proportion see appendix c test yields significant report
