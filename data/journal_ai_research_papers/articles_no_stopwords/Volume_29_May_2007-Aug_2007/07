reputation mechanisms offer effective alternative verification authorities building trust electronic markets moral hazard future clients guide business decisions considering feedback past transactions truthfully exposed cheating
behavior sanctioned thus becomes irrational
therefore becomes important ensure rational clients right incentives
report honestly alternative side payment schemes explicitly reward truthful reports honesty emerge rational behavior clients
repeated presence market end describe mechanism supports
equilibrium truthful feedback obtained characterize set paretooptimal equilibria mechanism derive upper bound percentage false
reports recorded mechanism important role existence
bound played fact rational clients establish reputation reporting
honestly

introduction

plified considerably reputation information shared among large population
thus multiplies expected future gains made accessible honest behavior
existing reputation mechanisms enjoy huge success systems ebay amazon

one important challenge associated designing reputation mechanisms ensure
truthful feedback obtained actual interactions property called incentivecompatibility rational users regard private information observed
valuable asset freely shared worse even agents external incentives
misreport thus manipulate reputation information available agents
harmon without proper measures reputation mechanism obtain unreliable
information biased strategic interests reporters
honest reporting incentives addressed differently depending predominant role reputation mechanisms signaling role useful environments
service offered different providers may different quality clients interacting provider treated equally markets adverse selection
case example market web services different providers possess different
hardware resources employ different makes certain web services better
others nevertheless requests issued web service treated
program clients might experience worse service others differences random determined provider feedback previous clients
statistically estimates quality delivered provider future hence signals
future clients provider selected
sanctioning role hand present settings service requests
issued clients must individually addressed provider think barber
must skillfully shave every client walks shop providers
must exert care costly effort satisfying every service request good quality
enough effort exerted provider better exerting less
effort e g clients anyway pay shave barber better sloppy
job fast possible order time customers moral hazard situation
eliminated reputation mechanism punishes providers exerting effort
low effort negative feedback decreases reputation hence future
business opportunities provider future loss due bad reputation offsets
momentary gain obtained cheating makes cooperative behavior profitable
well known solutions providing honest reporting incentives signaling
reputation mechanisms since clients interacting service receive quality
statistical sense clients private observation influences belief regarding
experience clients web services market mentioned fact one
client bad experience certain web service makes likely believe
clients encounter web service correlation

fiobtaining reliable feedback sanctioning reputation mechanisms

clients private belief feedback reported clients used
design feedback payments make honesty nash equilibrium submitting
feedback clients get paid amount depends value reported
reports submitted clients long others report truthfully
expected payment every client maximized honest report thus equilibrium
miller resnick zeckhauser jurca faltings incentivecompatible payments designed offset reporting costs lying incentives
sanctioning reputation mechanisms payment schemes guaranteed
incentive compatible different clients may experience different service quality
provider decided exert different effort levels private beliefs reporter
may longer correlated feedback clients therefore statistical
properties exploited miller et al longer present
alternative propose different incentives motivate honest reporting
repeated presence client market game theoretic e folk
theorems repeated interactions support equilibria present deviations
made unattractive future penalties even without reputation mechanism client
guide future play depending experience previous interactions first
describe mechanism indeed supports cooperative equilibrium
providers exert effort time reputation mechanism correctly records
client received low quality
certainly applications clients repeatedly interact
seller potential moral hazard barber shop mentioned one
example people prefer going barber hairdresser another example
market delivery services every package must scheduled timely delivery
involves cost provider cost may saved occasionally
dropping package hence moral hazard moreover business clients typically rely
carrier dispatch documents merchandise business
depends quality timeliness delivery incentive form
lasting relationship get good service yet another example business person
repeatedly travels offshore client business person direct interest
repeatedly obtain good service hotel closest clients offices
assume quality observed clients influenced environmental
factors outside control however observable provider despite barbers
best effort sudden movement client generate accidental cut
make client unhappy likewise delivery company may occasionally lose damage
packages due transportation accidents nevertheless delivery company
barber eventually learns certainty delays damages losses entitle
clients complain unsatisfactory service
mechanism propose quite simple asking feedback client
mechanism gives provider opportunity acknowledge failure reimburse
client provider claims good service reputation mechanism record
feedback client contradictory reports provider claims good service
client submits negative feedback may appear one parties lying
therefore client provider sanctioned provider suffers loss
consequence negative report client given small fine

one equilibrium mechanism providers best deliver
promised quality truthfully acknowledge failures caused environmental
factors honest behavior motivated threat mistake drive
unsatisfied client away market future transactions generate sufficient
revenue provider afford risk losing client hence equilibrium
unfortunately socially desired equilibrium unique clients occasionally
accept bad service keep returning provider dont better
alternatives moreover since complaining bad service sanctioned reputation
mechanism clients might reluctant report negative feedback penalties negative
reports clients lack choice drives provider occasionally cheat order
increase revenue
second characterize set pareto optimal equilibria mechanism
prove amount unreported cheating occur limited two factors
first factor limits amount cheating general given quality
alternatives available clients better alternatives increase expectations
clients therefore provider must cheat less order keep customers
second factor limits amount unreported cheating represents cost
incurred clients establish reputation reporting truth stubbornly exposing
bad service happens despite fine imposed reputation mechanism
client signals provider committed report truth signals
eventually change strategy provider full cooperation avoid
punishment negative feedback reputation reporting truthfully course
valuable client therefore rational client accepts lie give reputation
cost building reputation reporting honestly greater
occasional loss created tolerated cheating cost given ease
provider switches cooperative play magnitude fine imposed
negative feedback

disengages cooperative behavior therefore one method reduce impact
malicious clients make sure normal clients make mistakes technical
means example providing automated tools formatting submitting feedback
improved user interfaces make easier human users spot reporting mistakes
greatly limit percentage mistakes made normal clients therefore
reduce amount harm done malicious clients
one concrete method reducing mistakes solicit negative feedback

reporting involves conscious decision mistakes less frequent
hand reporting effort add penalty negative report makes harder
normal clients establish reputation honest reporters alternative methods
