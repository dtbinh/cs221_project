phase transition case one alternation quantifiers thus performing advanced
practical theoretical study phase transition quantified

introduction
last decade seen growth interest phase transition boolean satisfiability
sat clausal version shows sharp transition sense
density clauses increased formulas abruptly change satisfiable
unsatisfiable critical threshold point numerous experimental studies
performed investigation phase transition different variants sat
thus giving strong evidence location transition coincides instances
hard solve meantime theoretical studies conducted order
better understand transitions determining nature phase transition sharp
coarse locating determining precise scaling window better understanding
structure space solutions turn challenging tasks
aroused lot interest different communities namely mathematics computer science
statistical physics see e g dubois monasson selman zecchina
computer science point view success sat due two features
sat provides framework within complexity class np
definitions sharp coarse phase transitions found p janson luczak rucinski

unsatisfiable
conversely suppose elementary cycle nonzero weight ga take
arbitrary truth assignment universal variables x apply ga
since x x x weight edge reduced constant
addition modulo moreover since cycle ga zero weight
corresponding cycle reduced version ga ga zero weight
graph ga corresponds system existential quantifiers
order obtain satisfying truth assignment existential variables suffices
apply following procedure connected component ga consider arbitrary
root vertex assign arbitrary truth value v obtain truth value

edge labelled truth value yet set value
value assignment obtained way satisfies equations
since ga contain cycle nonzero weight
