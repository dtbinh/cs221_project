combinatorial auctions reasonable whenever item desired single agent

loosely speaking essentially degree freedom available truthful vcg mechanisms choice range optimize within range
perfect optimization needed theorem seems intuitive vcg payments identify
agents utility society thus social welfare optimized

special case truthful mechanisms essentially general
method known truthful mechanisms non single dimensional settings moreover
certain settings known indeed truthful mechanisms roberts
lavi et al precisely weighted versions vcg mechanisms called
ane maximizers truthful extend cases well
consequently imply designing truthful mechanisms computationally
intractable requires restricting range outcomes getting unreasonable degenerate mechanisms developing entirely techniques truthful
mechanisms may even exist similar implication intractability
stems computational considerations rather communication considerations cramton et al chapter
second chance mechanism
second part proposes general method circumventing diculty
constructing truthful mechanisms vcg mechanisms lose incentive

comprehensive study tradeo future
interesting future direction develop representations appeal functions
relate time limit imposed agent actual revision function one possibility
represent appeals decision trees agents required supply
leaf type vector v strictly improved given
l instead actual input v v proves mechanism computational time
required compute leaf indeed needed order represent agents revision
function related possibility allow agent purchase additional computational

virtues optimal counterparts similar hold ane maximization
leave much hope development polynomial time truthful mechanisms
many high complexity
second part proposes general method overcoming diculty
constructing truthful mechanisms given underlying optimization
dene second chance mechanism demonstrate
reasonable assumptions agents truth telling still rational strategy
agents agents truthful welfare obtained mechanism least
good one obtained underlying
successful implementation second chance mechanisms relies several tools
developed particular tools description valuations appeal functions
engineering issues require exploration
important stress second chance method yet tested
particular truthfulness agents validated experimentally
hand believe practice small time limits agents appeals likely
guarantee truthfulness agents several questions regarding payment properties
second chance mechanisms open leave future
several open questions directly stem work raised within body
