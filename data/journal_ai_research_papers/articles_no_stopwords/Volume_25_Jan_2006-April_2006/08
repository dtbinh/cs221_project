2. Preliminaries
basic scenario resource allocation negotiation studied paper
artificial society inhabited number agents, initially holds certain
number resources. agents typically ascribe different values (utilities) different bundles resources. may engage negotiation agree reallocation
resources, example, order improve respective individual welfare
(i.e. increase utility). Furthermore, assume interest system
designer distributed negotiation processes somehow result positive
payoff society whole.
2.1 Basic Definitions
instance abstract negotiation framework consists finite set (at least two)
agents finite set resources R. Resources indivisible non-sharable.
allocation resources partitioning R amongst agents A.
Definition 1 (Allocations) allocation
resources function subsets
R A(i) A(j) = { } 6= j iA A(i) = R.
example, given allocation A(i) = {r3 , r7 }, agent would resources r3
r7 . Given particular allocation resources, agents may agree (multilateral) deal
exchange resources currently hold. general case, numbers
agents resources could involved single deal. abstract point view,
deal takes us one allocation resources next. is, may characterise
deal pair allocations.

Definition 2 (Deals) deal pair = (A, A0 ) A0 allocations
resources 6= A0 .
set agents involved deal = (A, A0 ) given = {i | A(i) 6= A0 (i)}.
composition two deals defined follows: 1 = (A, A0 ) 2 = (A0 , A00 ),
1 2 = (A, A00 ). given deal composition two deals concern disjoint sets
agents, deal said independently decomposable.
Definition 3 (Independently decomposable deals) deal called independently
decomposable iff exist deals 1 2 = 1 2 A1 A2 = { }.
Observe = (A, A0 ) independently decomposable exists intermediate
allocation B different A0 intersection {i | A(i) 6= B(i)}
{i | B(i) 6= A0 (i)} empty, i.e. union {i | A(i) = B(i)}
{i | B(i) = A0 (i)} full set agents A. Hence, = (A, A0 ) independently
decomposable implies exists allocation B different A0
either B(i) = A(i) B(i) = A0 (i) agents (we going use fact
proofs necessity theorems later on).
value agent ascribes particular set resources R modelled
means utility function, is, function sets resources real numbers.
going consider general utility functions (without restrictions) several
specific classes functions.
Definition 4 (Utility functions) Every agent equipped utility function
ui : 2R R. going consider following restricted classes utility functions:
ui non-negative iff ui (R) 0 R R.
ui positive iff non-negative ui (R) 6= 0 R R R 6= { }.
ui monotonic iff R1 R2 implies ui (R1 ) ui (R2 ) R1 , R2 R.
P
ui additive iff ui (R) = rR ui ({r}) R R.
ui 0-1 function iff additive ui ({r}) = 0 ui ({r}) = 1 r R.
ui dichotomous iff ui (R) = 0 ui (R) = 1 R R.
Recall that, given allocation A, set A(i) bundle resources held agent
situation. usually going abbreviate ui (A) = ui (A(i)) utility value
assigned agent bundle.
2.2 Deal Types Rationality Criteria
paper investigate kinds negotiation outcomes agents achieve using
different classes deals. class deals may characterised structural constraints
(number agents resources involved, etc.) rationality constraints (relating
changes utility experienced agents involved).
Following Sandholm (1998), distinguish number structurally different types
deals. basic 1-deals, single item passed one agent another.

protocol (Smith, 1980). Deals one agent passes set resources another
agent called cluster deals. Deals one agent gives single item another agent
returns another single item called swap deals. Sometimes necessary

multiagent deal deal could involve number agents, agent passes
one resource agents taking part. Finally, deals combine

could involve number agents number resources. Therefore, every

speaking deals without specifying type, always going refer
combined deals (without structural restrictions).2
agent may may find particular deal acceptable. Whether agent
accept given deal depends rationality criterion applies evaluating deals.
selfish agent may, instance, accept deals = (A, A0 ) strictly improve
personal welfare: ui (A) < ui (A0 ). call criteria this, depend
utilities agent question, personal rationality criteria. want
admit arbitrary rationality criteria, classes deals characterised using
personal rationality criteria alone somewhat narrow purposes. Instead,
going consider rationality criteria local sense depending

2.3 Socially Optimal Allocations Resources

autonomous software agents. agents make local decisions deals
propose accept, analyse system global societal point
view may thus prefer certain allocations resources others. end, welfare
economics provides formal tools assess distribution resources amongst
members society affects well-being society whole (Sen, 1970; Moulin, 1988;
Arrow et al., 2002).
2. ontology deal types discussed is, course, exhaustive. would, instance,
interest consider class bilateral deals (involving exactly two agents number items).

Given preference profiles individual agents society (which, framework, represented means utility functions), social welfare ordering
alternative allocations resources formalises notion societys preferences. Next
going formally introduce important social welfare orderings considered
paper (some additional concepts social welfare discussed towards end
paper). cases, social welfare best defined terms collective utility function.
One example notion utilitarian social welfare.
Definition 7 (Utilitarian social welfare) utilitarian social welfare swu (A)
allocation resources defined follows:
X
swu (A) =
ui (A)
iA

Observe maximising collective utility function swu amounts maximising
average utility enjoyed agents system. Asking maximal utilitarian social
welfare strong requirement. somewhat weaker concept Pareto optimality. allocation Pareto optimal iff allocation higher utilitarian
social welfare would worse agents system (i.e. would
strictly better least one agent without worse others).
Definition 8 (Pareto optimality) allocation called Pareto optimal iff
allocation A0 swu (A) < swu (A0 ) ui (A) ui (A0 ) A.
first goal egalitarian society increase welfare weakest
member (Rawls, 1971; Sen, 1970). words, measure social welfare
society measuring welfare agent currently worst off.
Definition 9 (Egalitarian social welfare) egalitarian social welfare swe (A)
allocation resources defined follows:
swe (A) = min{ui (A) | A}
egalitarian collective utility function swe gives rise social welfare ordering
alternative allocations resources: A0 strictly preferred iff swe (A) < swe (A0 ).
ordering sometimes called maximin-ordering. maximin-ordering takes
account welfare currently weakest agent, insensitive utility fluctuations
rest society. allow finer distinction social welfare different
allocations introduce so-called leximin-ordering.
society n agents, let {u1 , . . . , un } set utility functions
society. every allocation determines utility vector hu1 (A), . . . , un (A)i length n.
rearrange elements vector increasing order obtain ordered utility
vector allocation A, going denote ~u(A). number ~ui (A) ith
element vector (for 1 |A|). is, ~u1 (A) instance, utility value
assigned allocation currently weakest agent. declare lexicographic
ordering vectors real numbers (such ~u(A)) usual way: ~x lexicographically
precedes ~y iff ~x (proper) prefix ~y ~x ~y share common (proper) prefix length
k (which may 0) ~xk+1 < ~yk+1 .
321

fiEndriss, Maudet, Sadri, & Toni

Definition 10 (Leximin-ordering) leximin-ordering alternative allocations
resources defined follows:
A0

~u(A) lexicographically precedes ~u(A0 )

iff

write A0 iff either A0 ~u(A) = ~u(A0 ). allocation resources called
leximin-maximal iff allocation A0 A0 .
Finally, introduce concept Lorenz domination, social welfare ordering
combines utilitarian egalitarian aspects social welfare. basic idea endorse
deals result improvement respect utilitarian welfare without causing
loss egalitarian welfare, vice versa.

k 1 k n, sum referred definition sum
utility values assigned respective allocation resources k weakest agents.
k = 1, sum equivalent egalitarian social welfare allocation. k = n,
equivalent utilitarian social welfare. allocation resources called Lorenz
optimal iff Lorenz dominated allocation.
illustrate social welfare concepts (and use ordered utility
vectors) means example. Consider society three agents two resources,
agents utility functions given following table:
u1 ({ }) = 0
u1 ({r1 }) = 5
u1 ({r2 }) = 3
u1 ({r1 , r2 }) = 8

u2 ({ }) = 0
u2 ({r1 }) = 4
u2 ({r2 }) = 2
u2 ({r1 , r2 }) = 17

u3 ({ }) = 0
u3 ({r1 }) = 2
u3 ({r2 }) = 6
u3 ({r1 , r2 }) = 7

First all, observe egalitarian social welfare 0 possible allocation
scenario, least one agents would get resources all. Let
allocation agent 2 holds full bundle resources. Observe
allocation maximal utilitarian social welfare. corresponding utility vector
h0, 17, 0i, i.e. ~u(A) = h0, 0, 17i. Furthermore, let A0 allocation agent 1 gets
r1 , agent 2 gets r2 , agent 3 content empty bundle. get
ordered utility vector h0, 2, 5i. initial element either vector 0, 0 < 2, i.e.
~u(A) lexicographically precedes ~u(A0 ). Hence, get A0 , i.e. A0 would socially
preferred allocation respect leximin-ordering. Furthermore, A0
Pareto optimal neither Lorenz-dominated other. Starting allocation A0 ,
agents 1 2 swapping respective bundles would result allocation
ordered utility vector h0, 3, 4i, i.e. move would result Lorenz improvement.

3. Rational Negotiation Side Payments
section, going discuss first instance general framework resource
allocation negotiation set earlier. particular variant, shall refer
model rational negotiation side payments (or simply money), equivalent
framework put forward Sandholm agents negotiate order reallocate
tasks (Sandholm, 1998). variant framework, aim negotiate
allocations maximal utilitarian social welfare.
3.1 Individual Rationality
instance negotiation framework, deal may accompanied number
monetary side payments compensate agents involved accepting loss
utility. Rather specifying pair agents much money former
supposed pay latter, simply say much money agent either pays
receives. modelled using call payment function.
Definition 12 (Payment functions) payment function function p real
numbers satisfying following condition:
X
p(i) = 0
iA

Here, p(i) > 0 means agent pays amount p(i), p(i) < 0 means
receives amount p(i). definition payment function, sum payments
0, i.e. overall amount money present system change.3
rational negotiation model, agents self-interested sense proposing accepting deals strictly increase welfare (for justification
approach refer Sandholm, 1998). myopic notion individual rationality may
formalised follows.
Definition 13 (Individual rationality) deal = (A, A0 ) called individually rational
iff exists payment function p ui (A0 ) ui (A) > p(i) A, except
possibly p(i) = 0 agents A(i) = A0 (i).
is, agent prepared accept deal iff pay less gain
utility get paid loss utility, respectively. agents
affected deal, i.e. case A(i) = A0 (i), may payment all. example,
ui (A) = 8 ui (A0 ) = 5, utility agent would reduced 3 units
accept deal = (A, A0 ). Agent agree deal accompanied
side payment 3 units; is, payment function p satisfies 3 > p(i).
given deal, usually range possible side payments. agents
manage agree particular one matter consideration abstract level
discussing framework here. assume deal go ahead
long exists suitable payment function p. point
3. overall amount money present system stays constant throughout negotiation process,
makes sense take account evaluation social welfare.

323

fiEndriss, Maudet, Sadri, & Toni

assumption may justified circumstances. instance, utility functions
publicly known agents risk-takers, potential deal may identified
such, agents may understate interest deal order
maximise expected payoff (Myerson & Satterthwaite, 1983). Therefore, theoretical
results reachability socially optimal allocations reported apply
assumption strategic considerations prevent agents making
mutually beneficial deals.
3.2 Example
example, consider system two agents, agent 1 agent 2, set two
resources R = {r1 , r2 }. following table specifies values utility functions u1
u2 every subset {r1 , r2 }:
u1 ({ }) = 0
u1 ({r1 }) = 2
u1 ({r2 }) = 3
u1 ({r1 , r2 }) = 7

u2 ({ }) = 0
u2 ({r1 }) = 3
u2 ({r2 }) = 3
u2 ({r1 , r2 }) = 8

suppose agent 1 initially holds full set resources {r1 , r2 } agent 2
resources begin with.
utilitarian social welfare initial allocation 7, could 8, namely
agent 2 resources. going see next, simple class 1-deals alone
always sufficient guarantee optimal outcome negotiation process (if agents
abide individual rationality criterion acceptability deal). example,
possible 1-deals would pass either r1 r2 agent 1 agent 2. either
case, loss utility incurred agent 1 (5 4, respectively) would outweigh gain
agent 2 (3 either deal), payment function would make deals
individually rational. cluster deal passing {r1 , r2 } agent 1 2,
hand, would individually rational agent 2 paid agent 1 amount of, say, 7.5 units.
Similarly example above, construct scenarios swap deals
multiagent deals necessary (i.e. cluster deals alone would sufficient
guarantee maximal social welfare). follows Theorem 2, going
present later section. Several concrete examples given Sandholm (1998).
3.3 Linking Individual Rationality Social Welfare
following result, first stated form Endriss et al. (2003a), says deal (with
money) individually rational iff increases utilitarian social welfare. mainly going
use lemma give simple proof Sandholms main result sufficient contract
types (Sandholm, 1998), found useful applications right (Dunne
et al., 2005; Dunne, 2005; Endriss & Maudet, 2005).
Lemma 1 (Individually rational deals utilitarian social welfare) deal =
(A, A0 ) individually rational iff swu (A) < swu (A0 ).
324

fiNegotiating Socially Optimal Allocations Resources

Proof. : definition, = (A, A0 ) individually rational iff exists payment
function p ui (A0 ) ui (A) > p(i) holds A, except possibly p(i) = 0
case A(i) = A0 (i). add inequations agents get:
X

(ui (A0 ) ui (A)) >

iA

X

p(i)

iA

definition payment function, righthand side equates 0 while, definition
utilitarian social welfare, lefthand side equals swu (A0 ) swu (A). Hence, really get
swu (A) < swu (A0 ) claimed.
: let swu (A) < swu (A0 ). show = (A, A0 ) individually
rational deal. done prove exists payment function p
ui (A0 ) ui (A) > p(i) A. define function p : R follows:
p(i) = ui (A0 ) ui (A)

swu (A0 ) swu (A)
|A|

(for A)

P
First, observe p really payment function, get iA p(i) = 0.
get ui (A0 ) ui (A) > p(i) A, swu (A0 ) swu (A0 ) > 0. Hence,
must indeed individually rational deal.
2
Lemma 1 suggests function swu indeed provide appropriate measure
social well-being societies agents use notion individual rationality (as given
Definition 13) guide behaviour negotiation. shows individual
rationality indeed local rationality criterion sense Definition 6.
3.4 Maximising Utilitarian Social Welfare
next aim show sequence deals rational negotiation model
side payments converge allocation maximal utilitarian social welfare;
is, class individually rational deals (as given Definition 13) sufficient
guarantee optimal outcomes agent societies measuring welfare according utilitarian
programme (Definition 7). originally shown Sandholm (1998)
context framework rational agents negotiate order reallocate tasks
global aim minimise overall costs carrying tasks.
Theorem 1 (Maximal utilitarian social welfare) sequence individually rational deals eventually result allocation maximal utilitarian social welfare.
Proof. Given set agents well set resources R required
finite, finite number distinct allocations resources. Furthermore, Lemma 1, individually rational deal strictly increase utilitarian social
welfare. Hence, negotiation must terminate finite number deals. sake
contradiction, assume terminal allocation maximal utilitarian
social welfare, i.e. exists another allocation A0 swu (A) < swu (A0 ). then,
Lemma 1, deal = (A, A0 ) would individually rational thereby possible,
contradicts earlier assumption terminal allocation.

first sight, result may seem almost trivial. notion multilateral deal without
structural restrictions powerful one. single deal allows number
resources moved number agents. point view,
particularly surprising always reach optimal allocation (even single
step!). Furthermore, finding suitable deal complex task, may always
viable practice. crucial point Theorem 1 sequence deals
result optimal allocation. is, whatever deals agreed early stages
negotiation, system never get stuck local optimum finding allocation
maximal social welfare remains option throughout (provided, course, agents
actually able identify deal theoretically possible). Given restriction
deals individually rational agents involved, social welfare must increase
every single deal. Therefore, negotiation always pays off, even stop early
due computational limitations.
issue complexity still important one. full range deals large
managed practice, important investigate close get finding
optimal allocation restrict set allowed deals certain simple patterns.
Andersson Sandholm (2000), instance, conducted number experiments
sequencing certain contract/deal types reach best possible allocations within
limited amount time. complexity-theoretic analysis problem deciding
whether possible reach optimal allocation means structurally simple types
deals (in particular 1-deals), refer recent work Dunne et al. (2005).
3.5 Necessary Deals
next theorem improves upon Sandholms main result regarding necessary contract
types (Sandholm, 1998), extending cases either utility functions
monotonic utility functions dichotomous.4 Sandholms original result, translated
terminology, states system (consisting set agents
set resources R) (not independently decomposable) deal system,

Theorem 2 (Necessary deals side payments) Let sets agents resources fixed. every deal independently decomposable, exist

continues case even either utility functions required monotonic

|R| + R = A0 (i) (R = A(i) 6= j)
ui (R) =

otherwise
Observe ui monotonic utility function every A. get swu (A0 ) = |R|+|A|
swu (A) = swu (A0 ) . = (A, A0 ) individually decomposable,
exists allocation B different A0 either B(i) = A(i) B(i) =
A0 (i) agents A. Hence, swu (B) swu (A) allocation B.
is, A0 (unique) allocation maximal social welfare allocation
higher social welfare A. Therefore, make initial allocation
= (A, A0 ) would deal increasing social welfare. Lemma 1, means
would individually rational (and thereby possible) deal. Hence,
indeed necessary achieve maximal utilitarian social welfare.
proof case dichotomous utility functions similar; need
show suitable collection dichotomous utility functions constructed. Again,
let j agent A(j) 6= A0 (j). use following collection functions:

1 R = A0 (i) (R = A(i) 6= j)
ui (R) =
0 otherwise
get swu (A0 ) = |A|, swu (A) = swu (A0 )1 swu (B) swu (A) allocations
B. Hence, socially optimal and, initial allocation, would
deal individually rational.

negotiation framework (see Dunne et al., 2005; Chevaleyre et al., 2004; Endriss &

Proof. Termination shown Theorem 1. going show that, whenever

conclude section briefly mentioning two recent results extend,
different ways, result stated Theorem 3 (a detailed discussion, however, would
beyond scope present paper). first results shows rational
deals involving k resources sufficient convergence allocation

respect common partition R i.e. synergies across different parts partition
possible overall utility defined sum utilities different sets
partition (Fishburn, 1970) set partition k elements
(Chevaleyre et al., 2005a).
second result concerns maximality property utility functions respect

slightly general class additive functions considered (namely,
possible assign non-zero utility empty bundle), maximal sense
class functions strictly including class modular functions would still possible

social welfare cases.

4. Rational Negotiation without Side Payments
implicit assumption made framework presented far every
agent got unlimited amount money available able pay agents
whenever required deal would increase utilitarian social welfare. Concretely,
initial allocation A0 allocation maximal utilitarian social welfare,
agent may require amount money difference ui (A0 ) ui (A)
able get negotiation process. context task contracting,
framework proposed originally (Sandholm, 1998), may justifiable,
resource allocation problems seems questionable make assumptions
unlimited availability one particular resource, namely money. section, therefore
investigate extent theoretical results discussed previous section persist
apply consider negotiation processes without monetary side payments.
4.1 Example
scenario without money, is, allow compensatory payments,
cannot always guarantee outcome maximal utilitarian social welfare. see this,
consider following simple problem system two agents, agent 1 agent 2,
single resource r. agents utility functions defined follows:
u1 ({ }) = 0
u1 ({r}) = 4

u2 ({ }) = 0
u2 ({r}) = 7

suppose agent 1 initially owns resource. passing r agent 1 agent 2
would increase utilitarian social welfare amount 3. framework money,
agent 2 could pay agent 1, say, amount 5.5 units deal would individually
rational them. Without money (i.e. p 0), however, individually rational
deal possible negotiation must terminate non-optimal allocation.
329

fiEndriss, Maudet, Sadri, & Toni

maximising social welfare generally possible, instead going investigate
whether Pareto optimal outcome (see Definition 8) possible framework without
money, types deals sufficient guarantee this.
4.2 Cooperative Rationality
become clear due course, order get desired convergence result, need
relax notion individual rationality little. framework without money,
want agents agree deal, least maintains utility (that is, strict
increase necessary). However, still going require least one agent strictly
increase utility. could, instance, agent proposing deal question.
call deals conforming criterion cooperatively rational.6
Definition 14 (Cooperative rationality) deal = (A, A0 ) called cooperatively rational iff ui (A) ui (A0 ) agent j uj (A) < uj (A0 ).
analogy Lemma 1, still swu (A) < swu (A0 ) deal = (A, A0 )
cooperatively rational, vice versa. call instance negotiation framework
deals cooperatively rational (and hence include monetary component)
model rational negotiation without side payments.
4.3 Ensuring Pareto Optimal Outcomes
next theorem show, class cooperatively rational deals sufficient
guarantee Pareto optimal outcome money-free negotiation. constitutes analogue
Theorem 1 model rational negotiation without side payments.
Theorem 4 (Pareto optimal outcomes) sequence cooperatively rational deals
eventually result Pareto optimal allocation resources.
Proof. Every cooperatively rational deal strictly increases utilitarian social welfare (this
need condition least one agent behaves truly individually rational
deal). Together fact finitely many different allocations
resources, implies negotiation process eventually terminate.
sake contradiction, assume negotiation ends allocation A, Pareto
optimal. latter means exists another allocation A0 swu (A) < swu (A0 )
ui (A) ui (A0 ) A. ui (A) = ui (A0 ) A,
swu (A) = swu (A0 ); is, must least one j uj (A) < uj (A0 ).
deal = (A, A0 ) would cooperatively rational, contradicts assumption
terminal allocation.
2
Observe proof would gone deals required strictly
rational (without side payments), would necessitate ui (A) < ui (A0 ) A.
Cooperative rationality means, instance, agents would prepared give away
resources assign utility value 0, without expecting anything return.
6. Note cooperatively rational agents still essentially rational. willingness cooperate
extends cases benefit others without loss utility themselves.

framework money, another agent could always offer agent infinitesimally
small amount money, would accept deal.
Therefore, proposed weakened notion rationality seems indeed reasonable

Hence, Theorem 4, deal could never necessary achieve Pareto optimal allocation either.

5. Egalitarian Agent Societies
section, going apply methodology used study
optimal outcomes negotiation systems designed according utilitarian principles
first part paper analysis egalitarian agent societies. classical
counterpart utilitarian collective utility function swu egalitarian collective
utility function swe introduced Definition 9 (Moulin, 1988; Sen, 1970; Rawls, 1971).
Therefore, going study design agent societies negotiation
guaranteed converge allocation resources maximal egalitarian social welfare.
first aim identify suitable criterion agents inhabiting egalitarian
agent society may use decide whether accept particular deal. Clearly, cooperatively rational deals, instance, would ideal choice, Pareto optimal
allocations typically optimal egalitarian point view (Moulin, 1988).
5.1 Pigou-Dalton Transfers Equitable Deals
searching economics literature class deals would benefit society
egalitarian system soon encounter Pigou-Dalton transfers. Pigou-Dalton
principle states whenever utility transfer two agents takes place
reduces difference utility two, transfer considered
socially beneficial (Moulin, 1988). context framework, Pigou-Dalton transfer
(between agents j) defined follows.
Definition 15 (Pigou-Dalton transfers) deal = (A, A0 ) called Pigou-Dalton
transfer iff satisfies following criteria:
two agents j involved deal: = {i, j}.
deal mean-preserving: ui (A) + uj (A) = ui (A0 ) + uj (A0 ).
deal reduces inequality: |ui (A0 ) uj (A0 )| < |ui (A) uj (A)|.
332

fiNegotiating Socially Optimal Allocations Resources

second condition definition could relaxed postulate ui (A) + uj (A)
ui (A0 ) + uj (A0 ), allow inequality-reducing deals increase overall utility.
Pigou-Dalton transfers capture certain egalitarian principles; sufficient
acceptability criteria guarantee negotiation outcomes maximal egalitarian social
welfare? Consider following example:
u1 ({ }) = 0
u1 ({r1 }) = 3
u1 ({r2 }) = 12
u1 ({r1 , r2 }) = 15

u2 ({ }) = 0
u2 ({r1 }) = 5
u2 ({r2 }) = 7
u2 ({r1 , r2 }) = 17

first agent attributes relatively low utility value r1 high one r2 . Furthermore, value resources together simply sum individual utilities, i.e.
agent 1 using additive utility function (no synergy effects). second agent ascribes
medium value either resource high value full set. suppose
initial allocation resources A(1) = {r1 } A(2) = {r2 }. inequality
index allocation |u1 (A) u2 (A)| = 4. easily check inequality
fact minimal allocation (which means inequality-reducing deal,
certainly Pigou-Dalton transfer, given allocation). However, allocation A0
A0 (1) = {r2 } A0 (2) = {r1 } would result higher level egalitarian social welfare
(namely 5 instead 3). Hence, Pigou-Dalton transfers alone sufficient guarantee
optimal outcomes negotiations egalitarian agent societies. need general
acceptability criterion.
Intuitively, agents operating according egalitarian principles help
fellow agents worse (as long afford
without ending even worse). means, purpose exchange
resources improve welfare weakest agent involved respective
deal. formalise idea introducing class equitable deals.
Definition 16 (Equitable deals) deal = (A, A0 ) called equitable iff satisfies
following criterion:
min{ui (A) | } < min{ui (A0 ) | }
Recall = {i | A(i) 6= A0 (i)} denotes set agents involved deal .
Given = (A, A0 ) deal require 6= A0 , never empty set
(i.e. minima referred definition well-defined). Note equitability
local rationality criterion sense Definition 6.
easy see Pigou-Dalton transfer equitable deal,
always result improvement weaker one two agents concerned.
converse, however, hold (not even restrict deals involving
two agents). fact, equitable deals may even increase inequality agents
concerned, namely cases happier agent gains utility weaker does.
literature multiagent systems, autonomy agent (one central
features distinguishing multiagent systems distributed systems) sometimes
equated pure selfishness. interpretation agent paradigm,
333

fiEndriss, Maudet, Sadri, & Toni

notion equitability would, course, make little sense. believe, however,
useful distinguish different degrees autonomy. agent may well autonomous
decision general, still required follow certain rules imposed society (and
agreed agent entering society).
5.2 Local Actions Global Effects
going prove two lemmas provide connection local
acceptability criterion given notion equitability two egalitarian social
welfare orderings introduced Section 2.3 (i.e. maximin-ordering induced swe
well leximin-ordering).
first lemma shows global changes reflected locally. deal happens
increase (global) egalitarian social welfare, is, results rise respect
maximin-ordering, deal fact equitable deal.
Lemma 2 (Maximin-rise implies equitability) A0 allocations
swe (A) < swe (A0 ), = (A, A0 ) equitable deal.
Proof. Let A0 allocations swe (A) < swe (A0 ) let = (A, A0 ).
agent minimal utility allocation must involved , egalitarian social
welfare, thereby agents individual utility, higher allocation A0 . is,
min{ui (A) | } = swe (A). Furthermore, A, certainly
swe (A0 ) min{ui (A0 ) | }. Given original assumption swe (A) < swe (A0 ),
obtain inequation min{ui (A) | } < min{ui (A0 ) | }. shows
indeed equitable deal.
2
Observe converse hold; every equitable deal necessarily increase
egalitarian social welfare (although equitable deal never decrease egalitarian social
welfare either). is, instance, case agents currently better
involved deal. fact, argued already end Section 2.2,
class deals characterisable local rationality criterion (see Definition 6) would
always result increase egalitarian social welfare.
able detect changes welfare resulting equitable deal require
finer differentiation alternative allocations resources given leximinordering. fact, shall see next, equitable deal shown result strict
improvement respect leximin-ordering.
Lemma 3 (Equitability implies leximin-rise) = (A, A0 ) equitable deal,
A0 .
Proof. Let = (A, A0 ) deal satisfies equitability criterion define =
min{ui (A) | }. value may considered partitioning ordered utility
vector ~u(A) three subvectors: Firstly, ~u(A) got (possibly empty) prefix ~u(A)<
elements strictly lower . middle, got subvector ~u(A)=
(with least one element) elements equal . Finally, ~u(A) got suffix
~u(A)> (which may empty) elements strictly greater .
334

fiNegotiating Socially Optimal Allocations Resources

definition , deal cannot affect agents whose utility values belong ~u(A)< .
Furthermore, definition equitability, < min{ui (A0 ) | }, means
agents involved end utility value strictly
greater , least one agents come ~u(A)= . collect
information ~u(A0 ), ordered utility vector second allocation A0 . Firstly,
prefix ~u(A0 )< identical ~u(A)< . followed (possibly empty)
subvector ~u(A0 )= elements equal must strictly shorter
~u(A)= . remaining elements ~u(A0 ) strictly greater . follows
~u(A) lexicographically precedes ~u(A0 ), i.e. A0 holds claimed.
2
Again, converse hold, i.e. every deal resulting leximin-rise necessarily
equitable. Counterexamples deals utility value weakest agent involved
stays constant, despite improvement respect leximin-ordering
level society.
well-known result welfare economics states every Pigou-Dalton utility transfer
results leximin-rise (Moulin, 1988). Given observed earlier every deal
amounts Pigou-Dalton transfer equitable deal, result
regarded simple corollary Lemma 3.
5.3 Maximising Egalitarian Social Welfare
next aim prove convergence result egalitarian framework (in analogy
Theorems 1 4). going show systems agents negotiate equitable
deals always converge towards allocation maximal egalitarian social welfare.
Theorem 7 (Maximal egalitarian social welfare) sequence equitable deals
eventually result allocation resources maximal egalitarian social welfare.
Proof. Lemma 3, equitable deal result strict rise respect leximinordering (which irreflexive transitive). Hence, finite number
distinct allocations, negotiation terminate finite number deals.
suppose negotiation terminated equitable deals possible. Let
corresponding terminal allocation resources. claim allocation
maximal egalitarian social welfare. sake contradiction, assume not, i.e.
assume exists another allocation A0 system swe (A) < swe (A0 ).
then, Lemma 2, deal = (A, A0 ) equitable deal. Hence, still
possible deal, namely , contradicts earlier assumption terminal
allocation. shows allocation maximal egalitarian social welfare,
proves claim.

welfare (but would still cause leximin-rise). demonstrated
means simple example. Consider system three agents two resources.
following table fixes utility functions:
u1 ({ }) = 0
u1 ({r1 }) = 5
u1 ({r2 }) = 0
u1 ({r1 , r2 }) = 5

u2 ({ }) = 6
u2 ({r1 }) = 7
u2 ({r2 }) = 6.5
u2 ({r1 , r2 }) = 7.5

u3 ({ }) = 8
u3 ({r1 }) = 9
u3 ({r2 }) = 8.5
u3 ({r1 , r2 }) = 9.5

possible interpretation functions would following. Agent 3 fairly well

with. Agent 1 poorest agent attaches great value r1 , interest

utility vector h5, 6, 8.5i increase egalitarian social welfare 5, maximum
achievable system. However, still another equitable deal could
implemented latter allocation: agent 3 could offer r2 agent 2. course,
deal affect agent 1. resulting allocation would ordered utility
vector h5, 6.5, 8i, corresponds leximin-maximal allocation.
able detect situations social welfare maximum already reached
equitable deals still possible, able stop negotiation (assuming
interested maximising swe quickly possible), however, would require
non-local rationality criterion. criterion takes welfare agents involved

deal would increase minimum utility society (see discussion Lemma 2).
could define class strongly equitable deals equitable deals top

equitable, every single deal (that independently decomposable) may
necessary guarantee optimal result (that is, sequence equitable deals excluding

utility functions initial allocation sequence equitable deals leading allocation maximal egalitarian social welfare would include .
continues case even utility functions required dichotomous.
Proof. Given set agents set resources R, let = (A, A0 ) deal
system. 6= A0 , (at least one) agent j A(j) 6= A0 (j).
use particular j fix suitable (dichotomous) utility functions ui agents
sets resources R R follows:

ui (R) =

1 R = A0 (i) (R = A(i) 6= j)
0 otherwise

is, allocation A0 every agent assigns utility value 1 resources holds.
true allocation A, sole exception agent j, assigns
value 0. allocation, agents assign value 0 set resources,
unless set either allocation A0 . independently
decomposable, happen least one agent every allocation different
A0 . Hence, every allocation least one agent assign utility value
0 allocated bundle. get swe (A0 ) = 1, swe (A) = 0, swe (B) = 0 every
allocation B, i.e. A0 allocation maximal egalitarian social welfare.

initial allocation resources, deal would result strict rise
respect leximin-ordering. Thus, Lemma 3, would equitable
deal. Hence, set admissible deals restricted equitable deals indeed
necessary reach allocation maximal egalitarian social welfare.
2
result shows, again, structurally simple class deals (such
class deals involving two agents time) would sufficient guarantee
optimal outcome negotiation. case even agents limited
options modelling preferences (as case dichotomous utility functions).11
negative necessity result shared two instances negotiation framework considered, currently positive results sufficiency

using additive 0-1 functions, complex deals involving agents time may
required reach allocation maximal egalitarian social welfare (a concrete example
may found Endriss et al., 2003b).
11. However, observe unlike two variants framework rational negotiation,
necessity result scenarios monotonic utility functions (see Theorems 2 5). Using
collection monotonic utility functions proof Theorem 2 would allow us draw
conclusions regarding respective levels egalitarian social welfare A0 one hand,
allocations B other.

6. Negotiating Lorenz Optimal Allocations
section, going analyse framework resource allocation negotiation
view notion Lorenz optimal allocations introduced Definition 11. begin
somewhat general discussion possible local rationality criteria acceptability
given deal.
6.1 Local Rationality Criteria Separability
far, studied three different variants negotiation framework: (i) rational negotiation side payments (aiming maximising utilitarian social welfare); (ii) rational
negotiation without side payments (aiming Pareto optimal outcomes); (iii) negotiation egalitarian agent societies. first two instances framework, agents
either individually rational cooperatively rational, natural choices

third variant framework, applies egalitarian agent societies, attractive conceptual technical reasons. Conceptually, egalitarian social welfare

agents changing utility whether given deal result increase social
welfare. Compare notion local rationality criterion (Definition 6);
depends agents changing bundle whether deal acceptable. change
utility presupposes change bundle (but vice versa). Hence, every separable
social welfare ordering corresponds class deals characterised local rationality

rise local rationality criterion proving general convergence theorem becomes
straightforward.12 leximin-ordering, instance, separable (Moulin, 1988),

Similarly, ordering alternative allocations induced notion Lorenz domination (Definition 11) separable. Hence, definition appropriate class

instance, immediate consequence Definitions 11 14 that, whenever = (A, A0 )
cooperatively rational deal, must Lorenz dominated A0 . may easily
verified, deal amounts Pigou-Dalton transfer (see Definition 15) result
Lorenz improvement. hand, difficult construct examples
show case class equitable deals anymore (see Definition 16).
is, equitable deals result Lorenz improvement, others not.
next goal check whether possible combine existing rationality criteria
define class deals captures notion Lorenz improvements far
as, two allocations A0 Lorenz dominated A0 , exists
sequence deals (or possibly even single deal) belonging class leading
A0 . Given cooperatively rational deals Pigou-Dalton transfers always
result Lorenz improvement, union two classes deals may seem
promising candidate. fact, according result reported Moulin (1988, Lemma 2.3),
case Lorenz improvement implemented means sequence
Pareto improvements (i.e. cooperatively rational exchanges) Pigou-Dalton transfers.
important stress seemingly general result apply negotiation
framework. see this, consider following example:
u1 ({ }) = 0
u1 ({r1 }) = 6
u1 ({r2 }) = 1
u1 ({r1 , r2 }) = 7

u2 ({ }) = 0
u2 ({r1 }) = 1
u2 ({r2 }) = 6
u2 ({r1 , r2 }) = 7

u3 ({ }) = 0
u3 ({r1 }) = 1
u3 ({r2 }) = 1
u3 ({r1 , r2 }) = 10

Let allocation agent 3 owns resources, i.e. ~u(A) = h0, 0, 10i
utilitarian social welfare currently 10. Allocation Pareto optimal,
allocation would strictly worse agent 3. Hence, cooperatively rational
deal would applicable situation. observe deal involving
two agents would best result new allocation utilitarian social welfare 7 (this
would deal consisting either passing resources one agents,
passing preferred resource either agent 1 agent 2, respectively). Hence,
deal involving two agents (and particular Pigou-Dalton transfer) could possibly
result Lorenz improvement. However, allocation Lorenz dominates

6.3 Simple Pareto-Pigou-Dalton Deals 0-1 Scenarios
cannot use existing rationality criteria compose criterion captures notion
Lorenz improvement (and would allow us prove general convergence theorem),
going investigate far get scenario restricted utility functions.
Recall definition 0-1 scenarios utility functions used indicate
whether agent need particular resource. shall see next, 0-1
scenarios, aforementioned result Moulin apply. fact, even sharpen
little showing Pigou-Dalton transfers cooperatively rational deals involving
single resource two agents required guarantee negotiation outcomes

Definition 17 (Simple Pareto-Pigou-Dalton deals) deal called simple
Pareto-Pigou-Dalton deal iff 1-deal either cooperatively rational PigouDalton transfer.
going show class deals sufficient guarantee Lorenz optimal
outcomes negotiations 0-1 scenarios
Theorem 9 (Lorenz optimal outcomes) 0-1 scenarios, sequence simple
Pareto-Pigou-Dalton deals eventually result Lorenz optimal allocation resources.
Proof. pointed earlier, deal either cooperatively rational PigouDalton transfer result Lorenz improvement (not case 0-1 scenarios).
Hence, given finite number distinct allocations resources,
finite number deals system reached allocation simple
Pareto-Pigou-Dalton deals possible; is, negotiation must terminate. Now,
sake contradiction, let us assume terminal allocation optimal, i.e.
exists another allocation A0 Lorenz dominates A. Amongst things, implies
swu (A) swu (A0 ), i.e. distinguish two cases: either (i) strict

r j would cooperatively rational hence simple Pareto-PigouDalton deal. contradicts assumption terminal allocation.
let us assume utilitarian social welfare remained constant, i.e. swu (A) =
swu (A0 ). Let k smallest index ~uk (A) < ~uk (A0 ). (This first k

section, going briefly consider two notions social preference
discuss context framework resource allocation negotiation. Firstly,
going introduce idea elitist agent societies, social welfare tied
welfare agent currently best off. going discuss societies
envy-free allocations resources desirable.
7.1 Elitist Agent Societies
Earlier discussed maximin-ordering induced egalitarian collective utility
function swe (see Definition 9). ordering actually particular case class social
welfare orderings, sometimes called k-rank dictators (Moulin, 1988), particular
agent (the one corresponding kth element ordered utility vector) chosen
representative society. Amongst class orderings, another particularly
interesting case welfare society evaluated basis happiest
agent (as opposed unhappiest agent, case egalitarian welfare). call
elitist approach measuring social welfare.
Definition 18 (Elitist social welfare) elitist social welfare swel (A) allocation
resources defined follows:
swel (A) = max{ui (A) | A}
elitist agent society, agents would cooperate order support champion (the
currently happiest agent). approach may seem somewhat unethical far
human society concerned, believe could indeed appropriate
certain societies artificial agents. applications, distributed multiagent system
may merely serve means helping single agent system achieve goal.
However, may always known advance agent likely achieve
goal therefore supported peers. typical scenario could

agent achieves goal matter happens others. egalitarian agent
societies, contradict idea agents autonomous entities. Agents may
physically distributed make autonomous decisions variety issues
whilst adhering certain social principles, case elitist ones.
technical point view, designing criterion would allow agents inhabiting elitist agent society decide locally whether accept particular deal
similar egalitarian case. analogy case equitable deals defined
earlier, suitable deal would increase maximal individual welfare amongst
agents involved one deal. egalitarian case, class deals
characterised local rationality criterion would exactly capture range deals
resulting increase elitist social welfare (because every agent system would
consulted first determine currently best off). prove convergence,
would resort auxiliary social welfare ordering (similarly use
leximin-ordering proof Theorem 7).
course, many cases much simpler way finding allocation
maximal elitist social welfare. instance, agents use monotonic utility functions,
moving resources agent assigning highest utility value full bundle
R would optimal elitist point view. generally, always find
elitist optimum checking whose utility function got highest peak. is,
highest possible elitist social welfare easily determined centralised manner,
distributed approach still provide useful framework studying process
actually reaching optimal allocation.
7.2 Reducing Envy amongst Agents
final example interesting approach measuring social welfare agent society
issue envy-freeness (Brams & Taylor, 1996). particular allocation resources,
agent may envious another agent would prefer agents set resources
own. Ideally, allocation envy-free.
Definition 19 (Envy-freeness) allocation resources called envy-free iff
ui (A(i)) ui (A(j)) agents i, j A.
egalitarian social welfare, related fair division resources amongst agents.
Envy-freeness desirable (though always achievable) societies self-interested agents
cases agents collaborate longer period time.
case, agent believe ripped off, would incentive
leave coalition may disadvantageous agents society
whole. words, envy-freeness plays important role respect stability
group. Unfortunately, envy-free allocations always exist. simple example would
system two agents single resource, valued them.
whichever agent holds single resource envied agent.
Furthermore, aiming agreeing envy-free allocation resources always
compatible with, say, negotiating Pareto optimal outcomes. Consider following example
two agents identical preferences alternative bundles resources:
342

fiNegotiating Socially Optimal Allocations Resources

u1 ({ }) = 0
u1 ({r1 }) = 1
u1 ({r2 }) = 2
u1 ({r1 , r2 }) = 0

u2 ({ }) = 0
u2 ({r1 }) = 1
u2 ({r2 }) = 2
u2 ({r1 , r2 }) = 0

example, either one two allocations one agent owns resources
none would envy-free (as agent would prefer ones bundle
own). However, allocation would Pareto optimal. hand,
allocation agent owns single resource would Pareto optimal,
envy-free (because agent holding r1 would rather r2 ).
stress envy defined sole basis agents private preferences,
i.e. need take agents utility functions account. Still, whether
agent envious depend resources holds, resources
could hold whether agents currently hold preferred bundle.
somewhat paradoxical situation makes envy-freeness far less amenable methodology
notions social welfare discussed paper.
able measure different degrees envy, could, example, count number
agents envious given allocation. Another option would compute
agent experiences envy difference ui (A(i)) ui (A(j))
agent j envies most. sum differences would
provide indication degree overall envy (and thereby social welfare).
spirit egalitarianism, third option would identify degree envy society
degree envy experienced agent envious (Lipton, Markakis,
Mossel, & Saberi, 2004). However, possible define local acceptability criterion
terms utility functions agents involved deal (and those)
indicates whether deal question would reduce envy according metric.
simple consequence fact deal may affect degree envy experienced
agent involved deal (because could lead one participating
agents ending bundle preferred non-concerned agent question).

Specifically, proved following technical results:
class individually rational deals14 sufficient negotiate allocations
maximal utilitarian social welfare (Theorem 1).
domains additive utility functions, class individually rational 1-deals
sufficient negotiate allocations maximal utilitarian social welfare (Theorem 3).
class cooperatively rational deals sufficient negotiate Pareto optimal allocations (Theorem 4).
domains 0-1 utility functions, class cooperatively rational 1-deals
sufficient negotiate allocations maximal utilitarian social welfare (Theorem 6).
class equitable deals sufficient negotiate allocations maximal egalitarian social welfare (Theorem 7).
domains 0-1 utility functions, class simple Pareto-Pigou-Dalton deals
(which 1-deals) sufficient negotiate Lorenz optimal allocations (Theorem 9).
three convergence results apply deals without structural restrictions
(rather 1-deals), proved corresponding necessity results (Theorems 2, 5,
8). theorems show given deal (defined pair allocations)

constrained various rationality criteria) negotiate socially optimal allocation

complexity results concern computational complexity finding socially optimal allocation, independently concrete negotiation mechanism used. mentioned
