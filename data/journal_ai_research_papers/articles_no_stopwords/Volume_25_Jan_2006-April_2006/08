given preference profiles individual agents society framework represented means utility functions social welfare ordering
alternative allocations resources formalises notion societys preferences next
going formally introduce important social welfare orderings considered
additional concepts social welfare discussed towards end
cases social welfare best defined terms collective utility function
one example notion utilitarian social welfare
definition utilitarian social welfare utilitarian social welfare swu
allocation resources defined follows

observe maximising collective utility function swu amounts maximising
average utility enjoyed agents system asking maximal utilitarian social
welfare strong requirement somewhat weaker concept pareto optimality allocation pareto optimal iff allocation higher utilitarian
social welfare would worse agents system e would
strictly better least one agent without worse others
definition pareto optimality allocation called pareto optimal iff
allocation swu swu ui ui
first goal egalitarian society increase welfare weakest
member rawls sen words measure social welfare
society measuring welfare agent currently worst
definition egalitarian social welfare egalitarian social welfare swe
allocation resources defined follows
swe min ui
egalitarian collective utility function swe gives rise social welfare ordering
alternative allocations resources strictly preferred iff swe swe
ordering sometimes called maximin ordering maximin ordering takes
account welfare currently weakest agent insensitive utility fluctuations
rest society allow finer distinction social welfare different
allocations introduce called leximin ordering
society n agents let u un set utility functions
society every allocation determines utility vector hu un length n
rearrange elements vector increasing order obtain ordered utility
vector allocation going denote u number ui ith
element vector u instance utility value
assigned allocation currently weakest agent declare lexicographic
ordering vectors real numbers u usual way x lexicographically
precedes iff x proper prefix x share common proper prefix length
k may xk yk


fiendriss maudet sadri toni

definition leximin ordering leximin ordering alternative allocations
resources defined follows


u lexicographically precedes u

iff

write iff u u allocation resources called
leximin maximal iff allocation
finally introduce concept lorenz domination social welfare ordering
combines utilitarian egalitarian aspects social welfare basic idea endorse
deals improvement respect utilitarian welfare without causing
loss egalitarian welfare vice versa

notion equitability would course make little sense believe however
useful distinguish different degrees autonomy agent may well autonomous

welfare thereby agents individual utility higher allocation
min ui swe furthermore certainly

able detect changes welfare resulting equitable deal require
finer differentiation alternative allocations resources given leximinordering fact shall see next equitable deal shown strict

proof let deal satisfies equitability criterion define
min ui value may considered partitioning ordered utility

least one element elements equal finally u got suffix
u may empty elements strictly greater

definition deal cannot affect agents whose utility values belong u
furthermore definition equitability min ui means

welfare would still cause leximin rise demonstrated
means simple example consider system three agents two resources
following table fixes utility functions
u

possible interpretation functions would following agent fairly well
case obtaining resources r r great impact
personal welfare true agent although slightly less well begin
agent poorest agent attaches great value r interest
r suppose agent initially holds resources corresponds ordered utility
vector h passing r agent would lead allocation ordered
utility vector h increase egalitarian social welfare maximum
achievable system however still another equitable deal could
implemented latter allocation agent could offer r agent course
deal affect agent resulting allocation would ordered utility
vector h corresponds leximin maximal allocation
able detect situations social welfare maximum already reached
equitable deals still possible able stop negotiation assuming
interested maximising swe quickly possible however would require
non local rationality criterion criterion takes welfare agents involved
particular deal account could sharp enough tell us whether given
deal would increase minimum utility society see discussion lemma
could define class strongly equitable deals equitable deals top
require currently weakest agent involved deal would
sharper criterion would spirit distributivity locality
every single agent would involved every single deal sense everyone
announce utility order able determine weakest
necessity
next theorem restrict set admissible deals
equitable every single deal independently decomposable may
necessary guarantee optimal sequence equitable deals excluding
could possibly allocation maximal egalitarian social welfare furthermore
theorem improves upon previous endriss et al b showing
holds even utility functions required dichotomous
theorem necessary deals egalitarian systems let sets agents resources fixed every deal independently decomposable exist
theorem corrects mistake original statement endriss et al b

utility functions initial allocation sequence equitable deals leading allocation maximal egalitarian social welfare would include
continues case even utility functions required dichotomous
proof given set agents set resources r let deal
system least one agent j j j
use particular j fix suitable dichotomous utility functions ui agents
sets resources r r follows

otherwise

allocation every agent assigns utility value resources holds
true allocation sole exception agent j assigns
value allocation agents assign value set resources
unless set allocation independently

hence every allocation least one agent assign utility value

initial allocation resources deal would strict rise
respect leximin ordering thus lemma would equitable

necessary reach allocation maximal egalitarian social welfare

shows structurally simple class deals
class deals involving two agents time would sufficient guarantee

negotiating lorenz optimal allocations
section going analyse framework resource allocation negotiation
view notion lorenz optimal allocations introduced definition begin
somewhat general discussion possible local rationality criteria acceptability
given deal
local rationality criteria separability
far studied three different variants negotiation framework rational negotiation side payments aiming maximising utilitarian social welfare ii rational
negotiation without side payments aiming pareto optimal outcomes iii negotiation egalitarian agent societies first two instances framework agents
individually rational cooperatively rational natural choices
formalise widely made assumptions agents purely self interested myopic scenarios without monetary side payments respectively
third variant framework applies egalitarian agent societies attractive conceptual technical reasons conceptually egalitarian social welfare
interest largely neglected multiagent systems literature
despite classical counterpart widely used notion utilitarian social welfare technically analysis egalitarian agent societies interesting
egalitarian social welfare admit definition local rationality criterion
directly captures class deals resulting increase respect metric
took detour via leximin ordering prove termination
class social welfare orderings captured deals conforming
local rationality criterion closely related class separable social welfare orderings
moulin nutshell social welfare ordering separable iff depends
agents changing utility whether given deal increase social
welfare compare notion local rationality criterion definition
depends agents changing bundle whether deal acceptable change
utility presupposes change bundle vice versa hence every separable
social welfare ordering corresponds class deals characterised local rationality
criterion vice versa means every separable social welfare ordering gives
rise local rationality criterion proving general convergence theorem becomes
straightforward leximin ordering instance separable moulin
going discuss social welfare ordering
similarly ordering alternative allocations induced notion lorenz domination definition separable hence definition appropriate class
deals proof general convergence would yield significant
insights however analysis effects previously intro indeed case framework rational negotiation side payments central argument
proof theorem lemma shows individual rationality fact equivalent
local rationality criterion induced swu
suitable rationality criterion would simply amount lexicographic comparison ordered utility
vectors subsociety agents involved deal question

duced rationality criteria agent societies social well assessed terms
lorenz condition rather instructive going see next
lorenz domination existing rationality criteria
going try establish connections global welfare measure induced
notion lorenz domination one hand local criteria
acceptability proposed deal individual agents may choose apply
instance immediate consequence definitions whenever
cooperatively rational deal must lorenz dominated may easily
verified deal amounts pigou dalton transfer see definition
lorenz improvement hand difficult construct examples
case class equitable deals anymore see definition
equitable deals lorenz improvement others
next goal check whether possible combine existing rationality criteria
define class deals captures notion lorenz improvements far
two allocations lorenz dominated exists
sequence deals possibly even single deal belonging class leading
given cooperatively rational deals pigou dalton transfers
lorenz improvement union two classes deals may seem
promising candidate fact according reported moulin lemma
case lorenz improvement implemented means sequence
pareto improvements e cooperatively rational exchanges pigou dalton transfers
important stress seemingly general apply negotiation

let allocation agent owns resources e u h
utilitarian social welfare currently allocation pareto optimal
allocation would strictly worse agent hence cooperatively rational
deal would applicable situation observe deal involving
two agents would best allocation utilitarian social welfare
would deal consisting passing resources one agents
passing preferred resource agent agent respectively hence
deal involving two agents particular pigou dalton transfer could possibly
lorenz improvement however allocation lorenz dominates
namely allocation assigning one first two agents respectively
preferred resource allocation r r
got ordered utility vector h
reason general reported moulin applicable domain
cannot use pigou dalton transfers implement arbitrary utility transfers
moulin assumes every possible utility vector constitutes feasible agreement


fiendriss maudet sadri toni

context resource allocation would mean allocation every possible
utility vector framework agents negotiate finite number indivisible
resources however range feasible allocations limited instance
example feasible allocation ordered utility vector h moulins
system agents could first move h h pigou dalton transfer
h h pareto improvement system hand
possible
simple pareto pigou dalton deals scenarios
cannot use existing rationality criteria compose criterion captures notion
lorenz improvement would allow us prove general convergence theorem
going investigate far get scenario restricted utility functions
recall definition scenarios utility functions used indicate
whether agent need particular resource shall see next
scenarios aforementioned moulin apply fact even sharpen
little showing pigou dalton transfers cooperatively rational deals involving
single resource two agents required guarantee negotiation outcomes
lorenz optimal first give formal definition class deals
definition simple pareto pigou dalton deals deal called simple
pareto pigou dalton deal iff deal cooperatively rational pigoudalton transfer
going class deals sufficient guarantee lorenz optimal
outcomes negotiations scenarios
theorem lorenz optimal outcomes scenarios sequence simple
pareto pigou dalton deals eventually lorenz optimal allocation resources
proof pointed earlier deal cooperatively rational pigoudalton transfer lorenz improvement case scenarios
hence given finite number distinct allocations resources
finite number deals system reached allocation simple
pareto pigou dalton deals possible negotiation must terminate
sake contradiction let us assume terminal allocation optimal e
exists another allocation lorenz dominates amongst things implies
swu swu e distinguish two cases strict
increase utilitarian welfare ii remained constant scenarios former
possible least one resource r r two agents j
ui r uj r well r r j e r moved
agent need agent j need deal moving
r j would cooperatively rational hence simple pareto pigoudalton deal contradicts assumption terminal allocation
let us assume utilitarian social welfare remained constant e swu
swu let k smallest index uk uk first k
inequality definition strict observe cannot k

would contradict swu swu shall call agents contributing first
k entries ordered utility vector u poor agents remaining ones
rich agents scenario must resource r r owned
rich agent allocation poor agent j allocation needed
agents e ui r uj r moving resource
agent agent j would constitute pigou dalton transfer hence simple
pareto pigou dalton deal allocation contradicts earlier assumption

summary shown allocation resources simple
pareto pigou dalton deals possible must lorenz optimal allocation ii
allocation reached implementing finite number simple paretopigou dalton deals earlier convergence agents need worry
deals implement long simple pareto pigou dalton deals

variations
section going briefly consider two notions social preference
discuss context framework resource allocation negotiation firstly
going introduce idea elitist agent societies social welfare tied
welfare agent currently best going discuss societies
envy free allocations resources desirable
elitist agent societies
earlier discussed maximin ordering induced egalitarian collective utility
function swe see definition ordering actually particular case class social
welfare orderings sometimes called k rank dictators moulin particular
agent one corresponding kth element ordered utility vector chosen
representative society amongst class orderings another particularly
interesting case welfare society evaluated basis happiest
agent opposed unhappiest agent case egalitarian welfare call
elitist measuring social welfare
definition elitist social welfare elitist social welfare swel allocation
resources defined follows
swel max ui
elitist agent society agents would cooperate order support champion
currently happiest agent may seem somewhat unethical far
human society concerned believe could indeed appropriate
certain societies artificial agents applications distributed multiagent system
may merely serve means helping single agent system achieve goal
however may known advance agent likely achieve
goal therefore supported peers typical scenario could


fiendriss maudet sadri toni

system designer launches different agents goal aim least one
agent achieves goal matter happens others egalitarian agent
societies contradict idea agents autonomous entities agents may
physically distributed make autonomous decisions variety issues
whilst adhering certain social principles case elitist ones
technical point view designing criterion would allow agents inhabiting elitist agent society decide locally whether accept particular deal
similar egalitarian case analogy case equitable deals defined
earlier suitable deal would increase maximal individual welfare amongst
agents involved one deal egalitarian case class deals
characterised local rationality criterion would exactly capture range deals
resulting increase elitist social welfare every agent system would
consulted first determine currently best prove convergence
would resort auxiliary social welfare ordering similarly use
leximin ordering proof theorem
course many cases much simpler way finding allocation
maximal elitist social welfare instance agents use monotonic utility functions
moving resources agent assigning highest utility value full bundle
r would optimal elitist point view generally
elitist optimum checking whose utility function got highest peak
highest possible elitist social welfare easily determined centralised manner
distributed still provide useful framework studying process
actually reaching optimal allocation
reducing envy amongst agents
final example interesting measuring social welfare agent society
issue envy freeness brams taylor particular allocation resources
agent may envious another agent would prefer agents set resources
ideally allocation envy free
definition envy freeness allocation resources called envy free iff
ui ui j agents j
egalitarian social welfare related fair division resources amongst agents
envy freeness desirable though achievable societies self interested agents
cases agents collaborate longer period time
case agent believe ripped would incentive
leave coalition may disadvantageous agents society
whole words envy freeness plays important role respect stability
group unfortunately envy free allocations exist simple example would
system two agents single resource valued
whichever agent holds single resource envied agent
furthermore aiming agreeing envy free allocation resources
compatible say negotiating pareto optimal outcomes consider following example
two agents identical preferences alternative bundles resources

example one two allocations one agent owns resources

however allocation would pareto optimal hand

stress envy defined sole basis agents private preferences
e need take agents utility functions account still whether
agent envious depend resources holds resources
could hold whether agents currently hold preferred bundle
somewhat paradoxical situation makes envy freeness far less amenable methodology
notions social welfare discussed
able measure different degrees envy could example count number
agents envious given allocation another option would compute
agent experiences envy difference ui ui j
agent j envies sum differences would
provide indication degree overall envy thereby social welfare
spirit egalitarianism third option would identify degree envy society
degree envy experienced agent envious lipton markakis
mossel saberi however possible define local acceptability criterion
terms utility functions agents involved deal
indicates whether deal question would reduce envy according metric
simple consequence fact deal may affect degree envy experienced
agent involved deal could lead one participating
agents ending bundle preferred non concerned agent question

conclusion
