tackle vocabulary conversational systems previous work applied
unsupervised learning approaches co occurring speech eye gaze interaction
automatically acquire words although approaches shown promise several
issues related human language behavior human machine conversation
addressed first psycholinguistic studies shown certain temporal regularities
human eye movement language production regularities potentially
guide acquisition process incorporated previous unsupervised approaches second conversational systems generally existing knowledge
base domain vocabulary existing knowledge potentially
help bootstrap constrain acquired words incorporated
previous third eye gaze could serve different functions human machine conversation gaze streams may closely coupled speech stream thus
potentially detrimental word acquisition automated recognition closely coupled
speech gaze streams conversation context important address issues
developed approaches incorporate user language behavior domain knowledge
conversation context word acquisition evaluated approaches context situated dialogue virtual world experimental shown
incorporating three types contextual information significantly improves word
acquisition performance

introduction

encountered vocabulary outside systems knowledge system tends
fail conversational interfaces become increasingly important many applications remote interaction robots lemon gruenstein peters fong

idea shown previous work yu ballard liu chai jin
parallel data visual perception spoken utterances used unsupervised
approaches automatically identify mappings words visual entities
thus acquire words previous approaches provide promising direction
mainly rely co occurrence words visual entities completely unsupervised manner however human machine conversation different types
extra information related human language behaviors characteristics conversation
systems although extra information potentially provide supervision guide
word acquisition process improve performance systematically explored
previous work
first large body psycholinguistic studies shown eye gaze tightly linked
human language processing evident language comprehension tanenhaus spivey knowiton eberhard sedivy eberhard spivey knowiton sedivy
tanenhaus allopenna magnuson tanenhaus dahan tanenhaus
spivey tanenhaus eberhard sedivy language production meyer sleiderink
levelt rayner griffin bock bock irwin davidson leveltb
brown schmidt tanenhaus griffin specifically human language production directly relevant automated computer interpretation human language
studies found significant temporal regularities mentioned objects
corresponding words meyer et al rayner griffin bock object
naming tasks onset word begins approximately one second speaker
looked corresponding visual referent griffin gazes longer
difficult name referent retrieve meyer et al griffin
ms articulation object name begins eyes move next object relevant task meyer et al findings suggest eyes move
mentioned objects corresponding words uttered although language
behavior used constrain mapping words visual objects
incorporated previous approaches
second practical conversational systems existing knowledge application domains vocabularies knowledge base acquired development
time authored domain experts automatically learned available data
although existing knowledge rather limited desired enhanced automatically online e g automated vocabulary acquisition provides important
information structure domain existing vocabularies
bootstrap constrain word acquisition type domain knowledge
utilized previous approaches
third although psycholinguistic studies provide us sound empirical basis
assuming eye movements predictive speech gaze behavior interactive
setting much complex different types eye movements kahneman
naturally occurring eye gaze speech production may serve different
functions example engage conversation manage turn taking nakano
reinstein stocky cassell furthermore interacting graphic display
user could talking objects previously seen display something
completely unrelated object user looking therefore speechgaze pairs word acquisition detrimental type gaze mostly useful

word acquisition kind reflects underlying attention tightly links
content co occurring speech thus automatically recognizing closely coupled speech
gaze streams online conversation word acquisition important however
examined previous work
address three issues developed approaches automatic word
acquisition incorporate findings user language behavior psycholinguistic
studies particular temporal alignment spoken words eye gaze utilize
existing domain knowledge automatically identify closely coupled speech
gaze streams conversation context evaluated approaches context
situated dialogue virtual world experimental shown incorporating
three types contextual information significantly improves word acquisition
performance simulation studies demonstrate effect automatic online
word acquisition improving language understanding human machine conversation
following sections first introduce domain data collection investigation describe enhanced word acquisition incorporate
additional contextual information e g language behavior spoken words eye
gaze domain knowledge conversation context finally present empirical evaluation
enhanced demonstrate effect online word acquisition spoken

proaches several limitations first incorporation domain knowledge
semantic relatedness wordnet restrict acquired words appear
wordnet certainly desirable limitation readily addressed
changing way word probability distribution tailored semantic relatedness
section section example one simple way keep probability
mass words wordnet tailor distribution words
occur wordnet semantic relatedness object
second current acquired words limited words
recognized speech recognizer shown section speech recognition
performance rather poor experiments partly due lack language
specifically trained domain approaches improve speech recognition
example referential semantic language model described schuler wu
schwartz potentially improve acquisition performance furthermore set
acquired words bounded vocabulary speech recognizer words
dictionary acquired break barrier inspired previous
work yu ballard taguchi et al currently extending
incorporate grounding acoustic phoneme sequences domain concepts
another limitation current approaches incapable acquiring
multiword expressions map single words domain concepts however
observe multiword expressions e g rubiks cube data examine
issue future work incorporating linguistic knowledge modeling
fertility entities example ibm model
simplicity current limits word acquisition performance
example alignment model temporal information directly incorporates findings
psycholinguistic studies studies generally conducted much simpler
settings without interaction recent work fang chai ferreira shown
correlations intensity gaze fixations objects denoted linguistic centers


ficontext word acquisition situated dialogue virtual world

e g forward looking centers centering theory grosz joshi weinstein
plan incorporate improve alignment modeling future
improve performance another interesting direction take consideration interactive nature conversation example combining dialog management
solicit user feedback acquired words however important identify
strategies balance trade explicit feedback solicitation thus lengthening interaction quality acquired words reinforcement learning
potential address

conclusions
motivated psycholinguistic findings investigate use eye gaze automatic word acquisition multimodal conversational systems presents several
enhanced incorporate user language behavior domain knowledge conversation context word acquisition experiments shown enhanced
significantly improve word acquisition performance
recent advancement eye tracking technology made available non intrusive eye
tracking devices tolerate head motion provide high tracking quality integrating eye tracking conversational interfaces longer beyond reach believe
incorporating eye gaze automatic word acquisition provides another potential
improve robustness human machine conversation
