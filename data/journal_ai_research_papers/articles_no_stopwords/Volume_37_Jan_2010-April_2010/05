action theories multimodal logic
let act set atomic action constants given dynamic

modal operator suppose multimodal logic independently axiomatized kracht wolter e logic fusion interaction
different modal operators
prop p p pn denotes finite set propositional constants called fluents
elementary atoms examples token agent token coffee
agent holds coffee lit p p p prop set literals use
denote literal p identify p denote atom
use small greek letters denote boolean propositional formulas
recursively defined usual way
p
denotes fml set boolean formulas example
boolean formula coffee hot propositional valuation v maximal consistent set
literals denote v fact v satisfies propositional formula val
denote set valuations satisfying cpl denote classical propositional
logic cpl respective consequence relation cn denotes logical consequences

propositional formula atm denotes set elementary atoms actually
occurring example atm p p p p p
boolean formula ip denotes set prime implicants quine

see chapter marquis denote prime implicant given
abbreviates literal given set x x denotes complement
hence atm denotes prop atm

frame ramification qualification
last years effort reasoning actions community
devoted searching satisfactory solutions frame ramification

roughly speaking frame mccarthy hayes relates need
inferring persistence facts world execution action known

several possibly interdependent effects stating explicitly huge
task scenario want able infer buy hot without saying theory

issue ensuring action executable given context specifying sufficient

modal approaches applies framework reasoning
