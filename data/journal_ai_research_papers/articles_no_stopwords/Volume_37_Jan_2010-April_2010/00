performance method measuring text text semantic relatedness two tasks namely
sentence sentence similarity paraphrase recognition experimental evaluation shows
proposed method outperforms every lexicon method semantic relatedness selected

past decades several improvements proposed techniques towards inventing sophisticated weighting schemes text words example tf idf
