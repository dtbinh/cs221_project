vcg mechanisms
key positive technique mechanism design vcg payment scheme
payment scheme bidder pays hi vi j vj algorithmic output
hi arbitrary function depend vi unfortunately vcg
works perfectly well game theoretic perspective useful computational
settings since multi unit auctions interesting combinatorial optimization
calculating exact optimum intractable
one naive idea use approximation approximate solution
let bidder pay hi vi j vj applying idea case
multi unit auction tempting particular light known approximation
unfortunately turns general approximation together vcg payments truthful mechanism
phenomenon studied nisan ronen observed
following family allocation yield truthful vcg mechanisms
definition allocation produces output input
v vn set possible alternatives called maximal range henceforth mir completely optimizes social welfare subrange r e
r v vn arg maxar vi

main nisan ronen states essentially
vcg mechanisms incentive compatible
theorem nisan ronen allocation incentive compatible
vcg mechanism combinatorial auctions equivalent maximal range
equivalent means social utilities identical inputs e b

easily get lower bound computationally efficient mir considered start lower bound black box
model lower bound number queries bidders must queried
holds type query e general communication setting
proposition let mir multi unit auctions achieves approximation ratio better communication complexity
proof case two bidders optimal known communication
complexity
lemma nisan segal finding optimal allocation multi unit auctions requires bits communication even two bidders even
finding value allocation lower bound applies nondeterministic
settings
thus mir bidders uses bits communication
non optimal thus argued gives better approximation case
bidders follows setting valuations first two
considering allocations items allocated first two bidders
second rules existence fptas k minded bidders

essentially applies allow single minded bidders e g xor bids
bidding language used kothari et al see next section description

multi unit auctions follows every polynomial time mir exist
large enough n range complete allocations full unless p n p
lemma follows discussion
concludes proof lower bounds mir mechanisms draw
conclusion vcg mechanisms one technical detail explicitly mentioned lower bounds mir vcg mechanisms

bidders rounded power near bidders
e rounded nearest power except one arbitrary bidder e
gets remaining items allocation range analysis similar
