1.1 VCG-Based Mechanisms
key positive technique mechanism design VCG payment scheme.
payment scheme bidder pays hi (vi ) j6=i vj (a), algorithmic output,
hi arbitrary function depend vi . Unfortunately, VCG

settings, since multi-unit auctions, interesting combinatorial optimization
problems, calculating exact optimum intractable.
One naive idea use approximation algorithm find approximate solution

phenomenon studied Nisan Ronen (2007). observed
following family allocation algorithms yield truthful VCG-based mechanisms:
Definition: allocation algorithm (that produces output input
v1 , ..., vn , set possible alternatives) called maximal-in-range (henceforth MIR) completely optimizes social welfare subrange R A. I.e.,
R A, v1 , ..., vn , arg maxaR vi (a).
I.e., MIR algorithms use following natural simple strategy find approximately
optimal solution: optimally search within pre-specified sub-range feasible
solutions subrange optimal search algorithmically feasible.
main result Nisan Ronen (2007) states essentially
VCG-based mechanisms incentive compatible.
Theorem (Nisan & Ronen, 2007): allocation algorithm incentive-compatible
VCG-based mechanism combinatorial auctions equivalent maximal-in-range algorithm.
Equivalent means social utilities identical inputs, i.e. b
outputs two allocation algorithms input v1 , . . . , vn vi (a) = vi (b).
particular, outputs must coincide generically except perhaps case ties. Nisan
Ronen (2007) prove two specific types mechanism design problems,
result general (Dobzinski & Nisan, 2007).
Following Nisan Ronen (2007), Dobzinski Nisan (2007) view result
negative one. Namely, show setting combinatorial auctions
submodular bidders, MIR algorithms much power. might imply
setting truthful deterministic mechanisms much power, since Lavi
et al. (2003) give partial evidence truthful mechanisms provide good
approximation ratio must MIR.

losing small factor approximation ratio.
1.3 Discussion Open Questions
main open problem remains determine best approximation ratio obtained truthful way. general method known constructing mechanisms
VCG, lower bounds state VCG cannot take us further. Furthermore,
Lavi et al. (2003) show 2 bidders black-box model, items allocated,
MIR algorithms truthful way obtain reasonable approximation ratio.
Combined lower bounds, get better-than- 12 truthful approximation
possible polynomial time, 2 bidders items allocated. intriguing
open question understand whether condition items allocated indeed
necessary.
Another issue paper highlights inherent difference obtaining
approximation algorithms single-parameter environments multi-parameter environments. single parameter environment private information bidder consists
one number, multi-parameter environments private information consists
one number. Recall single parameter variant multi-unit auctions, assume bidders single-minded, exists truthful FPTAS
(Briest et al., 2005). However, variants discuss paper multi-parameter,
indeed lower bounds suggest obtaining FPTAS impossible (if one prove
mechanisms give good approximation ratio must MIR).

Otherwise, valuations given us black boxes. algorithms, black
