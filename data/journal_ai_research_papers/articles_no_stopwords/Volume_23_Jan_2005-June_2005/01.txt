1. Introduction
Mechanisms negotiating allocation resources within group agents form important body work within study multiagent systems. Typical abstract models
derive game-theoretic perspectives economics among issues
addressed strategies agents use obtain particular subset resources available, e.g. (Kraus, 2001; Rosenschein & Zlotkin, 1994; Sandholm, 1999), protocols
process settling upon allocation resources among agents involved
agreed, e.g. (Dignum & Greaves, 2000; Dunne, 2003; Dunne & McBurney, 2003; McBurney
et al., 2002).

Two major applications abstract view Definition 1 exploited
e-commerce distributed task realisation. first R represents collection
commodities offered sale individual agents seek acquire subset these,
value agent attaches specific set described agents utility function.

order realise complex task, e.g. complex task may transport goods
central warehouse set cities. example R describes locations
goods must dispatched given allocation defines places
agent must arrange deliveries. utility functions cases model cost agent
associates carrying alloted sub-tasks.
Within general context Definition 1, number issues arise stemming
observation unlikely initial allocation seen satisfactory
either respect views agents system respect divers global
considerations. Thus, proposing changes initial assignment individual agents
seek obtain better allocation. scenario raises two immediate questions:
evaluate given partition thus basis forming improved optimal allocations;
and, issue underlying main results paper, restrictions imposed

shall subsequently review widely studied approaches defining
conditions allocations seen better others. purposes

natural aim agents within commodity trading context seek allocation

allocation, P , envy-free agent assigns greater utility resource set (Pj ) held
another agent respect resource set (Pi ) actually

general terms two approaches considered treating
question finite collection resources might distributed among set agents
order optimise criterion interest: contract-net based methods, e.g. (Dunne
et al., 2003; Endriss et al., 2003; Endriss & Maudet, 2004b; Sandholm, 1998, 1999) deriving
work Smith (1980); combinatorial auctions, e.g. (Parkes & Ungar, 2000a,
2000b; Sandholm et al., 2001; Sandholm, 2002; Sandholm & Suri, 2003; Tennenholz, 2000;
Yokoo et al., 2004, amongst others). significant difference extent

may, informally, regard view agents myopic, sense

number reasons agent may adopt views, e.g. consider
following simple protocol agreeing reallocation.
reallocation resources agreed sequence stages,
involves communication two agents, Ai Aj . communication
consists Ai issuing proposal Aj form (buy, r , p), offering purchase
r Aj payment p; (sell , r , p), offering transfer r Aj return

summary, identify two important influences lead contexts
agents prefer move towards reallocation via sequence rational deals. Firstly,

case, A2 makes decision solely whether r immediate use, i.e. A2 myopic.

1.1 Preliminary Definitions
begin, first formalise concepts deal contract path.
Definition 2 Let hA, R, Ui resource allocation setting. deal pair hP , Qi
P = hP1 , . . . , Pn Q = hQ1 , . . . , Qn distinct partitions R. effect implementing deal hP , Qi allocation resources specified P replaced
specified Q. Following notation (Endriss & Maudet, 2004b) deal = hP , Qi,
use indicate subset involved, i.e. Ak Pk 6= Qk .
Let = hP , Qi deal. contract path realising sequence allocations
= hP (1) , P (2) , . . . , P (t1) , P (t)
P = P (1) P (t) = Q. length , denoted || 1, i.e. number
deals .
two methods use reduce number deals single
agent may consider seeking move allocation another, thereby
avoiding need choose exponentially many alternatives: structural rationality
constraints. Structural constraints limit permitted deals bound
number resources and/or number agents involved, take consideration
view agent may whether allocation improved. contrast, rationality
constraints restrict deals hP , Qi Q improves upon P according
particular criteria. article consider two classes structural constraint: Ocontracts, defined considered (Sandholm, 1998), shall refer (k )contracts.
Definition 3 Let = hP , Qi deal involving reallocation R among A.
a. one contract (O-contract)
O1. = {i , j }.
O2. unique resource r Pi Pj Qi = Pi {r } Qj = Pj \ {r }
(with r Pj ) Qj = Pj {r } Qi = Pi \ {r } (with r Pi )
b. value k 2, deal = hP , Qi (k )-contract 2 |A | k
iA Qi = iA Pi .
Thus, O-contracts involve transfer exactly one resource particular agent
another, resulting number deals compatible given allocation exactly
(n 1)m: resources reassigned current owner
n 1 agents.
Rationality constraints arise number different ways. example,
standpoint individual agent Ai given deal hP , Qi may three different outcomes:
ui (Pi ) < ui (Qi ), i.e. Ai values allocation Qi superior Pi ; ui (Pi ) = ui (Qi ), i.e.
Ai indifferent Pi Qi ; ui (Pi ) > ui (Qi ), i.e. Ai worse

however, show definitions equivalent following.

shall consider alternative bases rationality constraints later: primarily
interest within so-called money free settings (so compensatory payment loss

central issue interest paper concerns properties contract-net
graph allowed deals must satisfy structural rationality constraint.
Thus, consider arbitrary predicates deals hP , Qi cases interest
combining structural rationality condition have,
Definition 5 predicate distinct pairs allocations, contract path
hP (1) , P (2) , . . . , P (t1) , P (t)
realising hP , Qi -path 1 < t, hP (i) , P (i+1) -deal,
(P (i) , P (i+1) ) holds. say complete deal may realised -path.
We, further, say complete respect -deals (where predicate
distinct pairs allocations) deal () holds may realised -path.
main interest earlier studies ideas areas identifying
necessary and/or sufficient conditions deals complete respect particular
criteria, e.g. (Sandholm, 1998); establishing convergence termination properties, e.g. Endriss et al. (2003), Endriss Maudet (2004b) consider deal types, ,
every maximal1 -path ends Pareto optimal allocation, i.e. one
reallocation agent improves utility lead another agent suffering
loss. Sandholm (1998) examines restrictions e.g. (P , Q) = >

cases (P , Q) = > deal hP , Qi individually rational.

Thus deciding rational plan possible already computationally hard.

a2. pair allocations P (i) P (i+j ) occurring , j 2

Thus (a1) ensures suitable contract path, (a2) guarantee
exactly one allocation, P (i+1) , reached within given
allocation P (i) means 0 -deal.
b. Define utility functions Un = hu1 , . . . , un following properties

b3. every allocation P (i) contract path every allocation Q

Thus, (a1) (b2) ensure hP (1) , P (t) defined value respect

properties given (a2) (b3) indicate (within constructed resource
