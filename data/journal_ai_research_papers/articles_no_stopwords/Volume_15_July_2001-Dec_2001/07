note finding optimal path graphical nphard variety common learning approaches negative learning optimal
path graphical stands contrast positive learning tree graphical
hardness highlights one potential source hardness
one make easy dicult choosing inappropriate subclass
perhaps carefully choosing broader class tree graphical one
identify interesting classes graphical finding optimal
model tractable
another interesting class graphical described note class
undirected graphical e g lauritzen methods learning undirected
graphical closely related methods described section fact
case undirected path scoring formulas described section identical
common approaches therefore np hardness directed path
presented note applies learning undirected path
finally important note good heuristics exist finding
weighted hamiltonian paths karp held heuristics used identify
good quality path rely fact optimal tree model easily
found score least large path model
