bidding strategy

tac defined simple enough low barrier entry yet complex
enough prevent tractable solution via direct game theoretic analysis given
optimal solution attainable use principled takes advantage
details tac scenario general attac aims robust parameter
space defined tac well conceivable opponent strategies
every bidding opportunity attac begins computing profitable
allocation goods clients shall denote g given goods currently
owned current prices hotels ights see section caveat
purposes computation attac allocates consider buying selling
entertainment tickets cases g computed integer linear programming
described section
attac high level bidding strategy following two observations


fiattac adaptive autonomous bidding agent

auctions open
obtain updated market prices
compute g profitable allocation goods given current holdings
prices
bid different modes
passive bid keep options open
active end bid aggressively packages
allocate
compute g closed auctions allocate purchased goods clients
table overview attac high level strategy
since airline prices periodically increase decrease equal probability expected change price airline auction indeed shown
airline auction considered isolation waiting end game
purchase tickets optimal strategy except rare case price reaches
lowest allowed value
since hotel prices monotonically increasing game proceeds hotel prices
eventual closing prices
therefore attac aims delay purchases particularly airline
purchases late game attac high level bidding strategy
premise best delay committing current g long possible
although continually reevaluates g therefore never technically committed
anything markets rarely advantageous change client travel
package would mean wasting airline ticket expensive hotel room thus requiring
additional ones purchased
attac accomplishes delay commitment bidding two different modes
passive active passive mode lasts game designed keep
many options open possible passive mode attac computes average
time takes compute place bids tb tb average time takes go
one iteration loop step table found tb ranged
seconds well minute primarily dependent upon server load call
time left game tl tl tb attac switches active mode
buys airline tickets required current g places high bids
required hotel rooms note attac expects run bidding iterations
active mode fact iteration necessary huge cost failing
complete iteration end game active iterations leaves
room error
current g current mode tl attac bids ights hotel
rooms entertainment tickets

flights

passive mode attac bid airline auctions active mode
attac buys currently unowned airline tickets needed current g
cases means bids airline tickets first bidding opportunity
active mode however face drastically changing hotel entertainment
ticket prices g could change suciently necessitate purchasing additional ights instead simply ones already purchased
hotels

passive mode attac bids hotel auctions try win hotels
cheaply auction close early try prevent hotel auctions closing
early might advantageous prevent hotel auction closing rooms
currently desired order keep open option switching hotel future
market prices warrant
hotel room type grand hotel night let hi number

attac outstanding bids would already win n rooms auction close

attac wins n rooms cheaply competitors lose opportunity get
rooms type later game otherwise attac bids n rooms

per room type benefit maintaining exibility later game
exact parameters chosen ad hoc fashion without detailed experimentation

sunk cost price tends
notice attac bids full marginal utility hotel room required
client travel package alternative would divide marginal utility
number rooms package would eliminated risk spending
hotels itinerary worth hand failing win single hotel
room enough invalidate entire itinerary attac bids full marginal utility
maximize chance valid itineraries obtained clients combinatorial

allocation strategy
evident section attac relies heavily computing current
profitable allocation goods clients g since g changes prices change attac
needs recompute every bidding opportunity integer linear programming
attac able compute optimal final allocations every game instance
tournament finals one entrants
tac participants used form greedy strategy allocation greenwald
stone computationally feasible quickly determine maximum utility
achievable client given set purchased goods move client remaining
goods etc however greedy strategy lead suboptimal solutions example
consider clients b identical travel days iad idd well identical
entertainment values ev ghv b ghv agent
exactly one type hotel room day optimal assignment clearly
assign bgh client b however client utility optimized first
assigned bgh leaving b stay lfi agent resulting score would less
could
improvement basic greedy strategy implemented heuristic
implements greedy strategy random client orderings chooses
profitable resulting allocation empirically resulting allocation often optimal
never far optimal addition quick compute set seven
games tournament greedy allocator run approximately
times produced allocations averaged optimal value

hotel bidding

perhaps significantly attac predicts closing prices hotel auctions
closing prices previous games hotel bidding tac particularly challenging
due extreme volatility prices near end game stated section
end game attac bids marginal utility desired hotel room
often excess
preliminary competition agents bid marginal utilities hotel
rooms however generally dominated competitors agents
high bidders bidding winning hotels bid paying far
less bids observed dominant strategy preliminary rounds
agents including attac adopted high bidding strategy actual
competition many negative scores prices skyrocketed last moments
game high bids given room
section stated attac computes g current prices
hotel rooms prices eventually become high attac would
end paying high price hotel rooms else fail get travel packages
clients alternative avoid counting obtaining contentious
hotel rooms
since strategies changing last minute finals way
identify priori hotels would contentious whether hotel prices would
actually skyrocket tournament therefore attac divided hotel rooms
equivalence classes exploiting symmetries game hotel rooms days
equally demand rooms days assigned priors
expected closing prices rooms adjusted priors observed
closing prices tournament

finals le fleabag inn days fairly contentious whenever
actual price hotel less predicted closing price attac used

opponent modeling precluded system dynamics nonetheless attac
adaptivity one keys success particularly avoiding skyrocketing hotels
nd rd place agents used different strategy prepare possibility
skyrocketing hotels rather avoiding popular hotels entirely tracking closing
prices across game instances discouraged agents bidding many
particular hotel room thus spreading demand across rooms greenwald
stone strategy safer limit e continues work even
everyone uses greater potential cost agent event hotel prices
skyrocket since agent still distribute demand less desirable rooms
hand attac would notice prices skyrocketing thus
bid optimal travel packages given current prices

conclusion future work

tac first autonomous bidding agent competition successful event minor improvements would increase interest multiagent learning
perspective

currently incentive buy airline tickets end game

price ights tend increase supply limited agents would
balance advantage keeping options open savings committing
travel packages earlier

information structure tac setup impossible observe

bidding patterns individual agents games nonetheless strategic
behavior individual agents often profoundly affected market dynamics particularly
hotel auctions seems would beneficial able directly observe
behavior individual agent information available regarding
bidding behavior agents game agents could infer
clients preferences therefore market supply demand prices tac agents
would potentially able learn predict market behavior game proceeds

without modifications hope able participate future tacs
goal adding additional adaptive elements attac
another direction future apply lessons learned tac real
simultaneous interacting auctions straightforward write bidding agents participate line auctions single good value client fixed ahead time
agent bid slightly ask price auction closes price exceeds
