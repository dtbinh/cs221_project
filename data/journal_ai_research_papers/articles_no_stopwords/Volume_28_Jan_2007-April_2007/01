introduction
merging operators aim defining beliefs goals group agents beliefs goals member group though beliefs goals distinct notions
merging operators typically used merging beliefs goals thus

characterizing rational belief merging operators used characterizing
well rational goal merging operators
whatever beliefs goals merged numerous situations agents
preferences possible merging process e merged bases
far goals concerned agent surely satisfied individual goals chosen
goals group case belief merging agent interested
imposing beliefs group e convincing agents especially
decision stage group level may depend beliefs

example three friends marie alain pierre want spend summer holidays
together determine whether go seaside mountains stay home determine whether take long period
vacations goals marie go seaside mountains
long period otherwise wants go mountains stay home
goals alain go seaside long period go mountains
short period finally pierre interested going seaside
long period otherwise prefers stay home one uses common merging operator
defining choice group goals group go
seaside long period go mountains stay home short period
accordingly group may choose go seaside long period
among goals marie however marie lies claims short period
wants go mountains stay home merging process
different indeed case goals group go mountains
short period stay home corresponds goals marie
similarly strategy proofness issue considered many belief merging scenarios rational decision making typically takes account true state
world agents conflicting beliefs belief merging used
determine true state world group manipulating belief
merging process way agent change resulting beliefs group level
make close beliefs consequence decisions made group
may change become closer agent would made alone instance
assume three friends agree mountains must avoided weather
bad beliefs group weather bad decision go
mountains given pierre believes weather bad may
tempted make weather bad accepted group level therefore collective
decision go mountains
several multi agent settings agents exchange information
must make individual decisions beliefs many scenarios agents tempted
get informational advantage agents achieved gathering
much information possible hiding ones indeed better informed
may help agent making better decisions agents group instance
shoham tennenholtz investigate non cooperative computation agent delivers piece information truthfully pieces used compute
value commonly known function value given back agents
aim agent get true value function possible
one get work shoham tennenholtz information considered
abstract level assuming information represent beliefs function belief
merging operator agent wants get true merged base possibly
one get contrastingly scenarios decisions made collectively

close beliefs focus issue
addressed many everyday life situations let us illustrate example
example position available university committee charge
recruitment determine right profile position four criteria
considered skills teaching skills relationship skills past positions
candidate suppose member committee believes important criteria
job skills relationship skills better recruit candidate
got good position past pleased recruitment group shares
beliefs right profile tempted manipulate merging process
order achieve situation
determining whether belief goal merging operator strategy proof negative case identifying restrictions strategy proofness ensured thus
important issue indeed merging operators intended characterize beliefs goals
group agents beliefs goals agent group obviously
objective cannot reached agents report true beliefs goals
easily case manipulable merging operators used since agents
tempted manipulate process case
since merging operators typically used artificial systems one wonder whether
strategy proofness really relevant issue context answer actually depends
sophistication agents consideration thus distributed database
setting low level agents e databases typically evaluation preference
merged base strategy proofness issue make sense
story agents goals reasoning capacities case cannot
discarded agents able foresee weakenesses aggregation process
exploit benefits high level artificial agents involved
strategy proofness even stricking case human agents
superior computational abilities artificial systems
strategy proofness issue studied years domain social choice
theory arrow sen suzumura important objective design preference
aggregation procedures particular voting procedures strategy proof
famous known gibbard sattherwaite theorem objective cannot
reached absolute manner number sensible requirements strategyproof voting procedure may exist gibbard satterthwaite strategy proofness
