case several restrictions merging process considered.

1. Introduction
Merging operators aim defining beliefs/goals group agents beliefs/goals member group. Though beliefs goals distinct notions,
merging operators typically used merging either beliefs goals. Thus,
logical properties literature (Revesz, 1993, 1997; Konieczny & Pino Perez, 1998,
2002) characterizing rational belief merging operators used characterizing
well rational goal merging operators.
Whatever beliefs goals merged, numerous situations agents
preferences possible results merging process (i.e., merged bases).
far goals concerned, agent surely satisfied individual goals chosen
goals group. case belief merging, agent interested
imposing beliefs group (i.e., convincing agents), especially
result decision stage group level may depend beliefs
group.
So, soon agent participates merging process, strategy-proofness problem
considered. question is: possible given agent improve result
merging process respect point view lying true beliefs/goals,
given knows (or least assumes) beliefs/goals agent group
way beliefs/goals merged?
illustration, let us consider following scenario goal merging (that
used running example rest paper):

Example 1 Three friends, Marie, Alain Pierre want spend summer holidays
together. determine whether go seaside and/or mountains, stay home, determine whether take long period
vacations not. goals Marie go seaside mountains
long period; otherwise wants go mountains, only, stay home.
goals Alain go seaside long period; go mountains
short period. Finally, Pierre interested going seaside
long period, otherwise prefers stay home. one uses common merging operator
defining choice group,1 goals group either go
seaside long period, go mountains stay home short period.
Accordingly, group may choose go seaside, only, long period,
among goals Marie. However, Marie lies claims that, short period,
wants go mountains only, stay home, result merging process
different. Indeed, case, goals group go mountains
short period, stay home, corresponds goals Marie.
Similarly, strategy-proofness issue considered many belief merging scenarios, rational decision making typically takes account true state
world. agents conflicting beliefs it, belief merging used
determine true state world group; manipulating belief
merging process way agent change resulting beliefs group level
make close beliefs. consequence, decisions made group
may change become closer agent would made alone. instance,
assume three friends agree mountains must avoided weather
bad. beliefs group weather bad, decision go
mountains given up. Pierre believes weather bad, may
tempted make weather bad accepted group level. Therefore, collective
decision go mountains.
several multi-agent settings agents exchange information
must make individual decisions based beliefs. many scenarios, agents tempted
get informational advantage agents, achieved gathering
much information possible hiding ones. Indeed, better informed
may help agent making better decisions agents group. instance,
Shoham Tennenholtz (2005) investigate non-cooperative computation: agent delivers piece information (truthfully not), pieces used compute
value (commonly-known) function, value given back agents;
aim agent get true value function, possible
one get it. work Shoham Tennenholtz (2005), information considered
abstract level; assuming information represent beliefs function belief
merging operator, agent wants get true merged base possibly
one get it. Contrastingly, scenarios, decisions made collectively
based beliefs group, agents satisfied beliefs group

3. Merging Operators
recall section two main families merging operators literature.
first family defined selection interpretations (model-based operators).
second family defined selection formulas union bases (formulabased operators). details two families, see example (Konieczny, Lang,
& Marquis, 2004).
3.1 Model-Based Operators
first family based selection models integrity constraints,
closest ones profile. Closeness usually defined notion distance
aggregation function (Revesz, 1997; Konieczny & Pino Perez, 1998, 1999; Lin & Mendelzon,
1999; Liberatore & Schaerf, 1998).
Definition 1 (pseudo-distances)
pseudo-distance interpretations total function : W W 7 R+ s.t.
, 0 , 00 W: d(, 0 ) = d( 0 , ), d(, 0 ) = 0 = 0 .
distance interpretations pseudo-distance satisfies triangular
inequality: , 0 , 00 W, d(, 0 ) d(, 00 ) + d( 00 , 0 ).
Two widely used distances interpretations Dalal distance (Dalal, 1988),
denoted dH , Hamming distance interpretations (the number propositional atoms two interpretations differ); drastic distance, denoted

f (x) = x.

3.2 Formula-Based Operators
main family merging operators gather so-called formula-based operators
syntax-based operators. Formula-based operators based selection consistent subsets formulas union bases profile E. Several operators
obtained letting vary selection criterion. result merging process
set consequences inferred selected subsets (Baral, Kraus, Minker, &
Subrahmanian, 1992; Rescher & Manor, 1970; Konieczny, 2000). operators,
syntactic form bases may easily influence result merging process: replacb = {1 . . . n } may
ing base K = {1 , . . . , n } (logically equivalent) base K
lead change corresponding merged base (while case model-based
operators).
Definition 4 (maximal consistent subsets) Let K base integrity constraint. maxcons(K, ) set maximal (w.r.t. set inclusion) consistent
subsets (maxcons short) K {} contains , i.e., maxcons(K, ) set
consistent satisfy:
K {},
,
0 K {}, 0 consistent.
maximality must taken respect cardinality (instead set inclusion),
shall use notation maxconscard (K, ).
Now, profile E integrity constraint , set

Observe set-theoretic union (and multi-set union) used here.
following operators defined far (Baral, Kraus, & Minker, 1991; Baral
et al., 1992; Konieczny, 2000):

much. operators defined Baral et al. (1992), except 4C5

5. Strategy-Proofness Results
general case, family model-based operators family formulabased operators strategy-proof three indexes consider. means
operators families strategy-proof. However, imposing
restrictions may lead strategy-proofness results. Considering
systematic way allows us draw strategy-proofness landscape families.
following, consider four natural restrictions merging process, listed
below:
4. I.e., (E) always consistent.

59

fiEveraere, Konieczny & Marquis

first restriction concerns number bases merged. question
following: number bases involved merging process influence
strategy-proofness operator? general, answer positively
question. precisely, distinction cases #(E) = 2
#(E) > 2. situations, manipulation possible two bases,
bases, becomes possible. Since base {>} typically plays role
neutral element operators consider (i.e., 4 (E) 4 (E t{>})),
operator strategy-proof profiles n bases, strategy-proof
profiles > n bases.
second parameter completeness beliefs/goals agent aims
manipulating. cases, strong beliefs/goals renders manipulation impossible. Working complete bases (i.e., singleton sets models) makes
merging process close uninominal vote, i.e., vote unique interpretation.
third significant parameter presence integrity constraints. one hand,
nontrivial integrity constraints ( 6 >) make manipulation possible,
case integrity constraints considered, converse
holds.
Another restriction bears available manipulations. general case untruthful agent free reporting base, even quite far true base.
However, numerous situations agents participating
merging process information true base. cases, agents
report bases close real ones. Two particular manipulations
studied: erosion manipulation agent pretends believe/desire
(the agent gives parts models); dilatation manipulation
agent pretends believe/desire less (the agent gives
parts countermodels).
5.1 Model-Based Operators
first result general strategy-proofness result (i.e., aggregation
function distance) model-based operators. surprising
one reminds existence Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem, states
good strategy-proof preference aggregation method (see Section 7).
However, quite general strategy-proofness results obtained. following
theorem gives them, organized general one (for aggregation
function drastic distance dD considered), specific ones (for distance
aggregation function ):

Note wip index iwip close probabilistic index ip . probabilistic index measures closeness merged base agent base, whereas wip

However, corresponding notion strategy-proofness (and fortiori one induced

merging scenario:
Example 6 Consider K = K1 = b.We dH , ({K, K1 }) b.
agent gives K 0 = {a b} instead K, merged base dH , ({K 0 , K1 }) a.
Accordingly, example manipulation (WIP) (iwip (dH , ({K, K1 })) = 12 <
iwip (dH , ({K 0 , K1 })) = 1).
example, untruthful agent actually manages change merged base
one similar initial base (with respect iwip ).
fully satisfied merged base equivalent b still strictly prefers initial
base {a}, despite fact b refines beliefs. Accordingly, agent
wants preserve beliefs ignorance. many scenarios agent
participates merging process order get new information, counter-intuitive.
Chopra et al. (2006) give general definitions strategy-proofness, considering
similarity relations. propositional case, suffer above-mentioned
drawback. explains investigate strategy-proofness purely

get dmin (E tdD ,f {K}) dD (, E {K 0 }).
Since dmin (E tdD ,f {K}) = dmin (E tdD ,f {K 0 }) (1), obtain: dmin (E tdD ,f

Hence: [K] [E 4dD ,f K] [K] [E 4dD ,f K 0 ].
Finally, let model K model E 4dD ,f K 0 : |= K (E 4dD ,f

definition min since |= (because |= E 4dD ,f K 0 ), deduce

Lemma 1 E = {K1 , K2 }, d,
> (E) K1 > (E) K2 consistent.

Proof:
show d,

symmetry). Reductio ad absurdum. Let us suppose two bases K1 K2 ,
d,
> ({K1 , K2 }) inconsistent K1 . deduce that:
0 |= K1 , |= K1 , d(, K1 4d, K2 ) > d( 0 , K1 4d, K2 ),
K1 4d, K2 light notation d,

Since |= K1 , d(, K1 ) = 0, get 0 |= K1 , |= K1 , d(, K2 ) >
d( 0 , K1 ) + d( 0 , K2 ). particular, consider 1 |= K1 s.t. d( 0 , 1 ) = d( 0 , K1 )
(such 1 exists definition d( 0 , K1 )), have: d(1 , K2 ) > d( 0 , 1 ) +
d( 0 , K2 ). Similarly, consider 2 |= K2 s.t. d( 0 , 2 ) = d( 0 , K2 ), get:
d(1 , K2 ) > d( 0 , 1 ) + d( 0 , 2 ) ().
definition d, |= K2 , d(1 , K2 ) d(1 , ); particular, d(1 , K2 )
d(1 , 2 ). transitivity , (*), get d(1 , 2 ) > d( 0 , 1 ) + d( 0 , 2 ).
contradicts triangular inequality.

Let us prove main theorem:
Weak drastic index. two bases K1 K2 , always idw (K1 , K1 4 K2 ) = 1,
d,

(idw maximal).

d,

d,

and:

Since d,

0
d,

Since 2 |= K1 K2 , conclude every model d,

d(, {K1 , K2 }) = 0. |= > ({K1 , K2 }), d(, K1 ) = d(, K2 ) = 0.
Hence |= d,
