abstract
test incomplete search constraint satisfaction sat need source hard satisfiable benchmark instances simple way
choose random truth assignment choose clauses randomly
among satisfied however method tends produce easy since
majority literals point toward hidden assignment last year achlioptas
jia moore proposed generator cancels effect hiding
complement achlioptas jia moore resulting formulas
appear hard dpll random sat formulas hidden
assignment solved walksat polynomial time
propose method cancel attraction choosing clause
literals satisfied probability proportional q q varying
q generate formulas whose variables bias e equally likely
true false even cause formula deceptively point away present
theoretical experimental suggesting formulas exponentially hard
dpll incomplete walksat
