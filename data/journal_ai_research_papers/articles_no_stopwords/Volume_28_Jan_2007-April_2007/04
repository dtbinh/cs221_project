abstract
encouraging voters truthfully reveal preferences election long
important issue recently computational complexity suggested means
precluding strategic behavior previous studies shown voting protocols
hard manipulate used n p hardness complexity measure worst case
analysis may insufficient guarantee resistance manipulation
indeed demonstrate n p hard manipulations may tractable averagecase purpose augment existing theory average case complexity
concepts particular consider elections distributed respect junta
distributions concentrate hard instances use techniques prove
scoring protocols susceptible manipulation coalitions number candidates constant

introduction
multiagent environments often inhabited heterogeneous selfish agents continually
interacting sharing common goals settings agents may diverse
even conflicting preferences therefore reaching consensus among agents long
important issue
general well studied well understood scheme preference aggregation voting
agents reveal preferences ranking set candidates winner determined
according voting protocol candidates election beliefs plans ephrati
rosenschein schedules haynes sen arora nadella indeed many
less obvious entities movies ghosh mundhe hernandez sen
applications voting place methods motivated theoretical guarantees
provided voting protocols instance ghosh et al present movie
recommender system relies voting makes use voting properties generate
convincing explanations different recommendations
however obstacle plagued voting theory social choice
theory general strategic behavior part voters setting self interested
agent may reveal preferences untruthfully believes would make final outcome
elections favorable manipulation generally regarded since
makes actual ballot complex game voters react counter react
strategies others require larger investment computational
resources voters may socially undesirable alternative chosen

celebrated gibbard satterthwaite theorem gibbard satterthwaite
establishes deterministic voting protocol non dictatorial
elections agent better voting untruthfully consequently possible
design nonmanipulable voting system guarantee voters act honestly
fortunately reasonable make assumption agents computationally bounded therefore although principle agent may able manipulate
election computation required may infeasible motivated researchers
study computational complexity manipulating voting protocols indeed
demonstrated several voting protocols n p hard manipulate single
voter bartholdi tovey trick bartholdi orlin hereinafter mainly
focus attention setting multiple manipulators collude order achieve
certain outcome setting manipulation even harder known
coalitional manipulation n p hard numerous voting protocols even
number candidates constant
suggest computational complexity may cure malady
called manipulation computer science though notion hardness usually
considered sense worst case complexity indeed complexity
manipulation use n p hardness complexity measure therefore could still
case instances easy manipulate put differently
strategic voter may usually succeed finding beneficial manipulation efficiently
even hard worst case truly significant issue
average case complexity manipulations
sadly far attempts design voting protocol resistant manipulations
average case failed suggests manipulation inherently
easy average case pushes us analytically support claim must
characterize settings protocols easily manipulated average case
relatively little known theory average case complexity exists trevisan
theory introduces concept distributional defines reduction
distributional known average case complete
however goal existing theory define hard
average case provide criteria deciding easy
engage novel average case analysis criteria propose
coming interesting distribution instances respect
average case complexity computed difficult task solution may controversial analyze whose instances distributed respect junta
distribution distribution must satisfy several conditions arguably guarantee focuses instances harder manipulate consider protocol
susceptible manipulation polynomial time usually
manipulate probability failure instances distributed according
junta distribution must inverse polynomial known heuristic
polynomial time
use methods analytically establish following important
family voting protocols called scoring protocols susceptible coalitional manipulation
dictatorial protocol agent dictates outcome regardless others choices

theorem

theorem conitzer lang sandholm justifies focus family
sensitive scoring protocols stronger version proposition independently

since required proving hardness property junta distribution shall
design
proposition let p sensitive scoring protocol cwm p n p hard even

definition partition given set integers ki summing
k asked whether subset integers sum k
well known partition n p complete
proof proposition reduce arbitrary instance partition following
cwm instance candidates b p v k
voters voting b p k voters voting b p v
every ki vote weight ki observe v b get
k points
assume first partition exists let voters v one half partition
vote p b let half vote p b vote b
k k k
votes p k points thus manipulation
conversely assume manipulation exists clearly must exist manipulation
voters v vote p b p b manipulators
gain anything placing p top scoring protocol manipulation p
k points b already k points
v therefore b must gain less k points voters
v voter corresponding ki contributes ki points follows
sum ki corresponding voters voting p b less k
likewise voters voting p b equivalently sum k since
ki integers cases sum must k hence
partition
since instance cwm translated instance scwm obvious
way
