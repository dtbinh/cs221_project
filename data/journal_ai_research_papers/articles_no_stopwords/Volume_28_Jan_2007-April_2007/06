introduction
recent years seen emergence internet platform multifaceted economic
interaction technical level computer communication routing storage computing level electronic commerce many forms studying interactions
raises questions economics necessity taking computational considerations account deals one question design
auctions optimally restricted use small amount communication
studies effect severely restricting amount communication allowed
single item auction bidder privately knows real valued willingness pay
item allowed send k possible messages auctioneer must
allocate item determine price basis messages received
example bidder may able send bits information case k
simplest case k e bidder sends single bit information contrast
usual auction design formulation bidders communicate real numbers
communicating real number may seem excessively burdensome
several motivations studying auctions severe restrictions communication first auctions used allocating low level computing resources
