preliminaries
assume countable number propositional variables x x standard connectives literal variable xi positive literal negation
xi negative literal propositional formula well formed formula built finite
number variables connectives v ar denotes set variables occur
propositional formula clause finite disjunction literals propositional formula conjunctive normal form cnf written finite conjunction
clauses instance x x x x x cnf dual notions
clause cnf notions term finite conjunction literals disjunctive
normal form dnf finite disjunction terms
assignment set variables v set literals contains exactly one
literal per variable v model propositional formula assignment
v ar satisfies usual way assigns xi iff xi
write tuple e g x x x x write value assigned
xi set propositional formula
said satisfiable formula said imply propositional formula
written generally identify sets boolean
functions use notations negation disjunction
notion projection important rest assignment
set variables v v write selecta set literals
formed upon e g select x x projecting set assignments onto subset
variables intuitively consists replacing assignment selecta
sake simplicity however define projection set built upon
set variables yields following definition
definition projection let v x xn set variables set assignments v v projection onto set assignments v
selecta selecta
instance let set assignments v
x x x x let x x easily seen

since selecta
remark projection set formula onto set variables
set general consequence independent
variables note projection onto set
formula obtained forgetting variables occurring details


filogic abduction

variable forgetting independence refer reader work lang et
al lang et al
useful note straightforward properties projection let denote
two sets assignments set variables v let v first projection
distributive disjunction e distributive
conjunction depend variables depends e exist
v depend v
holds note true general case note finally
general

model abduction
formalize model sake simplicity first define abduction
notions hypothesis explanation
definition abduction triple called abduction satisfiable propositional formulas set variables
v ar v ar called knowledge base query set
abducibles
definition hypothesis explanation let abduction
hypothesis set literals formed upon seen conjunction
hypothesis e explanation e satisfiable e
proper subconjunction e explanation e called best explanation
note framework allow one specify variable must occur unnegated
resp negated explanation think prohibiting restriction since
abducibles intuitively meant represent variables whose values e g modified observed repaired matter sign explanation note
restriction general framework defined abducibles
literals hypotheses conjunctions abducibles marquis
interested computational complexity computing best explanation
given abduction asserting none following usual model
establish complexities respect size representations
number abducibles hardness following associated decision
usually considered least one explanation obviously latter
hard function

first two classes proved polynomial general method solving abduction
notion prime implicants last one obvious since information
explicitely given input four others exhibited ad hoc
let us mention amilhastre et al study related
general framework multivalued theories instead propositional formulas e
domain variables restricted authors mainly
far note concerned deciding whether exists explanation still
p complete amilhastre et al table
note stated exact framework papers cited
still hold let us mention enumerating
best explanations given abduction great interest eiter makino
provide discussion first mainly case
knowledge base horn

general
give principle let us stress first well e g marquis
construction marquis section outline matches point point definition
best explanation ideas marquis anyway rather close
first interested hypotheses every abducible x occurs
negated unnegated let us call full hypotheses note indeed every explanation
e abduction subconjunction full explanation f indeed since e
definition e satisfiable implies suffices let f selecta
model e minimization f discussed later


filogic abduction

proposition let abduction f full hypothesis
f explanation exists assignment v ar
f selecta
proof assume first f explanation exists assignment
v ar f thus f selecta ii f e
f unsatisfiable thus f
selecta thus

thus conversely let f selecta
since f satisfiable ii since



selecta f thus f unsatisfiable thus
f

thus characterized full explanations given abduction
minimizing explanation f since following greedy procedure
given selman levesque reduces f best explanation
every literal f
f f f endif
endfor
note depending order literals f considered may
different cases best explanation
finally give general computing best explanation given
abduction correctness follows directly proposition
propositional formula
unsatisfiable return explanation
else
model
f selecta
minimize f
return f
endif

polynomial classes
explore polynomial classes abduction allows
exhibit throughout section n denotes number variables v ar
affine formulas
propositional formula said affine xor cnf schaefer kavvadias
sideri zanuttini written finite conjunction linear equations
two element field e g x x x x x seen equations
play role affine formulas clauses cnfs roughly affine formulas represent
conjunctions parity equivalence constraints class proves interesting knowledge
representation since one hand tractable common reasoning tasks


fibruno zanuttini

hand affine approximations knowledge base made small
efficiently learnable zanuttini projecting affine formula onto
subset variables quite easy enabling run polynomial time
proof following lemma easily obtained gaussian elimination curtis
triangulate variables put rightmost keep equations
formed upon full details given technical report version zanuttini
lemma let affine formula containing k equations v ar
affine formula containing k equations
computed time k v ar
proposition represented affine formula containing k equations
disjunction k linear equations subset v ar searching best
explanation done time k k k k k n
sketch proof easily seen affine formula containing k k equations
n variables computed time linear size formula
projected onto time k k n straightforwardly get disjunction
k k linear equations use distributivity
solving satisfiability recall sat solved time
k n affine formula k equations n variables elimination method
gauss curtis remaining operations straightforward

note variables literals clauses special cases disjunctions linear equations
dnfs
though class dnf formulas good computational properties abduction
remains hard whole even additional restrictions recall
tautology one deciding whether given dnf formula represents
identically true function conp complete
proposition deciding whether least one explanation given abduction
np complete given dnf even variable
v ar
sketch proof membership np obvious since deduction dnfs polynomial
easily seen tautological abduction
x x v ar explanation x variable occuring see dnf
x implication x x dnf get

however represented dnf projecting onto easy indeed properties projection suffices cancel literals formed upon
consequently dnf containing k terms dnf
containing k terms computed time k v ar
thus subclasses class dnfs allow polynomial
abduction state first quite generally note assumptions
satisfied natural classes dnfs e g horn dnfs e dnfs


filogic abduction

one positive literal per term similarly horn renamable dnfs e
turned horn dnf replacing variables negation
simplifying double negations everywhere formula dnfs dnfs
two literals per term omit proof following proposition since essentially
proposition simply follow execution
proposition let class dnfs stable removal occurrences
literals tautology polynomial restricted belong
clause subset v ar searching best explanation
done polynomial time
thus establish abduction tractable among others horn renamable
dnf including horn reverse horn cases dnf clause
finally let us point similar proof obtain polynomiality
obtained strengthening restriction proposition
weakening
proposition represented horn resp reverse horn dnf k terms
positive resp negative cnf k clauses subset v ar
searching best explanation done time k kk n
holds represented positive resp negative dnf k terms
horn resp reverse horn cnf k clauses
note variables literals terms special cases reverse horn
cnfs variables positive resp negative clauses positive resp negative
terms special cases positive resp negative cnfs

discussion perspectives
general presented note allows us derive polynomial restrictions
abduction even discussed lack space allows
unify previously known restrictions cnf dnf
monotone cnf given clause following list summarizes main
polynomial restrictions
given affine formula disjunction linear equations proposition
horn renamable dnf given clause proposition
dnf given clause proposition
horn reverse horn dnf positive negative cnf proposition
negative positive dnf reverse horn horn cnf proposition
moreover even guarantee efficiency general case presentation
depend syntactic form uses standard
operations boolean functions projection conjunction negation

another interesting feature minimization computes
explanations intentionnally consequently full explanations enumerated
roughly delay formula representing however
course guarantee two would minimized
best explanation prevents concluding enumerate
best explanations trying extend direction would interesting
details enumeration refer reader eiter makinos work eiter
makino
identified selman levesque central task notion projection set variables isolates subtask however notion
projection concerns variables literals prevents imposing sign
literals hypotheses formed upon contrariwise general formalizations
proposed abduction marquis marquis even think prohibiting restriction would interesting try fix weakness
preserving polynomial classes
another interest behaviour
propositional formulas generally multivalued theories domain
variables restricted e g signed formulas beckert et al
framework used instance configuration amilhastre et al
easily seen still correct framework however still left
study cases running time polynomial
finally great interest deciding relevance necessity
abducible eiter gottlob abducible x said relevant abduction
least one best explanation containing x x necessary
best explanations contain x x easily seen x necessary
x explanation hence showing
polynomial restrictions search explanations polynomial well deciding
necessity hypothesis soon stable substitution x
case restrictions considered note contrastingly
know relation relevance study would
great interest
