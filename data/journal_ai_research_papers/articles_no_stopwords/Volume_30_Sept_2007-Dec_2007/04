object consolidation reference reconciliation
long history recent years seen significant fruitful
however spite widespread interest
practical nature many publicly accessible databases remain unresolved
partially resolved best popular publication databases citeseer pubmed
representative examples citeseer contains several records author
author names pubmed resolved due variety reasons
ranging rapid often uncontrolled growth databases computational
expenses involved maintaining resolved entities
yet millions users access query databases everyday mostly seeking information implicitly explicitly requires knowledge resolved entities example
may query citeseer database computer science publications looking books
russell pasula marthi milch russell shpitser query would easy
answer author names citeseer correctly mapped entities
unfortunately case according citeseer records stuart russell peter
norvig written different books together one main reasons behind databases containing unresolved entities entity resolution generally perceived
expensive process large databases maintaining clean database requires
significant effort keep pace incoming records alternatively may searching
different online social network communities person named jon doe case
online community may individually records clean even query
return records sources aggregated together may multiple
representations jon doe entity additionally cases sufficient
simply return records match query name russell jon doe exactly
order retrieve references correctly may need retrieve records similar
names well stuart russel john doe importantly
useful need partition records returned according real world
entities correspond fly partitioning returned
necessary accessing third party external databases provide full access
possibly due privacy concerns accessed via specific query
interfaces
propose alternative solution answering entity resolution queries
obviate need maintaining resolved entities database instead
investigate entity resolution query time goal enable users query
unresolved partially resolved database resolve relevant entities fly user
may access several databases everyday want resolve entities every
database queries needs resolve entities relevant
particular query instance looking books stuart russell citeseer
useful resolve authors citeseer since resolution needs
performed query time requirement resolution process needs quick
even entirely accurate
though entity resolution queries addressed literature
significant progress general entity resolution recent focused use additional relational information database references improve
