speakers personality traits fundamental dimension variation humans
personality typically assessed along five dimensions known big five
extraversion vs introversion sociable assertive playful vs aloof reserved shy
emotional stability vs neuroticism calm unemotional vs insecure anxious
agreeableness vs disagreeable friendly cooperative vs antagonistic faultfinding
conscientiousness vs unconscientious self disciplined organised vs inefficient careless
openness experience intellectual insightful vs shallow unimaginative
five personality traits repeatedly obtained applying factor analyses

hi characterise extraverts

markers big five traits
pennebaker king identify many linguistic features associated
big five personality traits use linguistic inquiry word count liwc
tool count word categories essays written students whose personality
assessed questionnaire authors small significant correlations
linguistic dimensions personality traits neurotics use st person singular
pronouns negative emotion words less positive emotion words hand
agreeable people express positive fewer negative emotions use fewer
articles conscientious people avoid negations negative emotion words words reflecting
discrepancies e g would finally openness experience characterised
preference longer words words expressing tentativity e g perhaps maybe
well avoidance st person singular pronouns present tense forms
additionally mehl et al study markers personality perceived observers
use words related insight avoidance past tense indicates
openness experience swearing marks disagreeableness authors
linguistic cues vary greatly across gender example males perceived
conscientious produce filler words females dont gender differences
found markers self assessed personality use nd person pronouns indicates
conscientious male unconscientious female
gill oberlander study correlates emotional stability neurotics use concrete frequent words however observers dont
use cues correctly observer reports neuroticism correlate negatively selfreports
concerning prosody smith et al speech rate positively correlated perceived competence conscientiousness speech rate inverted u
relationship benevolence agreeableness suggesting need non linear
traits produced findings others reason might
