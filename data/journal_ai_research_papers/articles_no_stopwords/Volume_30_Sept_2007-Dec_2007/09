introduction
great deal written logical representation common sense reasoning
change since publication mccarthy hayess seminal
many theories proposed see example monographs sandewall
shanahan reiter
theories treat events deductively along lines representation actions
used planner strips fikes nilsson event type defined
preconditions effects example blocks world preconditions unstacking
block x block x x clear block top robot hand
empty effects hand holding x clear preconditions
false change matter deduction particular event token event
type occurs particular preconditions hold particular effects deduced
necessarily follow events kind called deductive events
view natural events represented deductively called deductionism
deductive event types thought invariable regularities uniformities sequence viewed way strips representation events seen descended
considered hume mill discussions causation hume bk
pt iii suggests inductively acquire knowledge regularities succession
form type events followed b type events consider type events
cause b type events whenever see type event expect
followed b type event mill bk iii ch complicates picture considering
assemblages conditions single assemblage might consist type event together
certain conditions must present positive conditions certain conditions
must absent negative conditions example assemblage concerning
lighting matches might include striking match presence oxygen
absence dampness match head
events assumed include physical actions agents whether intentional unintentional

mill thought possible least principle define assemblages
detailed enough ensure effects every event combination
objects events given concurrence circumstances positive negative
occurrence followed phenomenon p
however hume pp already argued possibility
possible regularity matter long continued past continue
future consequently set sentences report observed ever
logically implies anything observed goodman p
puts happened imposes logical restrictions happen
deductionism plausible necessary assume nature uniform
future resemble past past regularities continue clearly uniformity
cannot justified appealing experience difficult see else
justified see goodmans discussion pp without justification deductionism
regarded suspect theory
deductionism suspect practice impossible practice define preconditions together occurrence event sufficient ensure
effects follow example russell p considers conflicting
events put penny slot draw ticket earthquake upsets machine calculations order sure expected
effect must know nothing environment interfere
means supposed cause adequate insure effect russell
observes cannot usefully solve complicating preconditions
soon include environment probability repetition diminished
last whole environment included probability repetition becomes almost
nil pp
specifying preconditions sufficient arises mackies
account causal regularities invariable regularities sequence example least
part answer question caused particular fire set
conditions positive negative including presence
inflammable material absence suitably placed sprinkler doubt quite
number others mackie p list conditions incomplete even
causal regularities hold objects seldom ever known full causal
knowledge progresses gradually towards formulation regularities hardly
ever gets causal regularities known typically incomplete know
certain elliptical gappy universal propositions mackie p
sufficient preconditions becomes acute consider formal representations intended practical use preconditions
computationally tractable mccarthy p gives example boat
cross river given boat rowing boat equipped oars
manned oarsman used convey two passengers across river provided
boat leak provided hit rock provided
hit another boat provided overturned hippopotamus
sunk meteorite vapourized thermonuclear blast etc seems list
qualifications need added limited limits imagination
accordingly mccarthy calls sufficient preconditions qualification

response deductionists might argue representations abstractions
works well simple domains assumed qualifications arise domains might argue uniformity assumption
reasonable deductive theories provide useful representation may well
true theories kind cannot readily extended complex less uniform
domains additional complexity required preconditions quickly becomes
overwhelming thus deductionist may appropriate certain applications
mathematical analysis high level programming languages elementary commands viewed abstract operations data inappropriate
representation predictive reasoning natural events events everyday
experience irregular treated deductively moreover deductionist abstraction better thought idealization problematic one
preconditions deductive event hold occurrence effects logically
guaranteed follow natural force intervene prevent
deductive events thus natural supernatural idealization creates technical
difficulties comes representation events variable effects including
non deterministic context dependent effects effects deduced representation conflicting events events whose effects individually
consistent jointly inconsistent joint effects cannot consistently deduced
consequently deductionist theories phenomena discussed
sequel face unnecessary self imposed difficulties difficult escape conclusion
representing natural events deductively deductionism starts wrong foot
conclusion hardly surprising consider predictive reasoning
natural events inductive rather deductive nature major purpose
predictive reasoning support practical reasoning reasoning
predictive reasoning normally partial knowledge incomplete belief
causal regularities mackie observes contexts events concerned
occur tends conjectural seeks produce reasonable conclusions
basis known tends produce conclusions supradeductive may deducible known defeasible may turn
wrong accordingly definitions practical non omniscient rationality
typically couched terms utility expected rather actual outcomes
actions russell norvig p illustrate point follows walking
along champs elysees one day see old friend across street
traffic nearby otherwise engaged rational start cross street
meanwhile feet cargo door falls passing airliner make
philosophy term inductive reasoning applied form qualitative non deductive reasoning thus includes enumerative induction general rule inferred non exhaustive
set inferences example emeralds observed green therefore
emeralds green form reasoning underlies knowledge regularities
comes inductive events idea explained text produce reasonable
conclusions outcomes basis partial information ai inductive reasoning
kind formalized non monotonic logics

side street flattened irrational cross street unlikely
obituary would read idiot attempts cross street
change perspective substantial simplification specifying preconditions longer concerned invariable regularities sequence
necessary connections events effects rather regularities
sequence normally hold fairly dependable regularities sequence russell p expected connections events effects consequently
define preconditions together associated events form conditions
normally sufficient associated effects otherwise minimal
sense part redundant preconditions kind tend
tractable simple useful occur frequently practice
give humeian account predictions involving natural events terms
fairly dependable regularities expectations engender event occurs
preconditions obtain aware anything prevent effects
following form clear expectation know effects follow
rational reasonable predict example block unstacked
block b preconditions obtain aware preventer
clearly expect predict longer b complex cases involve
conflicting events case clear expectation outcome
rational predict example clearly expect predict airliner door
crush rather bounce intrepid pedestrian example consider
two conflicting outcomes possible one probable however
cases expectations unclear torn conflicting expectations
know expect cases seems reasonable adopt cautious
restrict predictions effects clearly expect example
fair coin tossed clear expectation side
land half expect land heads half expect land
tails consider two conflicting outcomes equally probable caution dictates
predict coin lands one side
predict two sides land note expectations
incomplete knowledge predictions defeasible example
unbeknown us block glued block b unstacked b

however methodology limited two ways
firstly question trajectory semantics justified provides
formal definition intended given example iad family
sure selects given example correspond
ones would select sufficient simply stipulate case
possible justify formal pragmatics proving equivalent another
case pcm trajectory semantics however point formal pragmatics
squared intuitions means argument kind employed
thus best hope thesis relating formal theory prediction
intuitive notion kripke remarked mathematical substitute
philosophy
secondly trajectory semantics restricted iad family essentially
strips events would need extended iadcsn family could
applied event theories
nevertheless would worthwhile attempt undertake mathematical assessment event theories relative formal theory extension
trajectory semantics possible mathematical investigations kind provide additional means justifying formal theories attempt prove equivalence
two theories fails typically highlight inadequacies one
suggest intuitions behind need refined alternatively
possible prove theories equivalent would provide mutuallysupporting evidence robustness intuitions underlying would
suggest despite appearances contrary two formal theories capture

conclusion
began arguing deductionism logical mistake made case inductionism began basic theory inductive events provides basis
integrated solution qualification frame introduced
distinction primary secondary events order represent causal structure
natural events thereby providing basis solution ramification
representing non determinism finally introduced event preferences used express defeasible preferences outcomes conflicting
simultaneous events development theory illustrates benefit starting
right foot inductive rather deductive events basic theory simple
intuitive extensions require addition axioms
refinement one clause formal pragmatics
simple cases may little choose deductive inductive theories events produce predictions wrong however inductive
representation natural events accurate reflects defeasibility
representation inductive events makes possible define primary secondary events
defeasible event preferences turn make possible give accurate representations ramifications non determinism conflicting events turn makes
possible represent complex cases accurately instance example two
stooges attempt move location one expected succeed however three
none succeeds inductive events example elaborated
thus two stooges attempt move preferred one fails independent
reason slips say stooge normally succeeds unless slips
case three attempt move ollie slips stan expected succeed
slips charlie expected succeed may slip moreover
example readily combined others example stooge could carry stack
blocks block moves block beneath stooge holding
moves know theory events represent reasoning subtlety
