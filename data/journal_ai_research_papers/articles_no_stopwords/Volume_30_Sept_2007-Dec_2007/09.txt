Abstract
paper develops inductive theory predictive common sense reasoning.
theory provides basis integrated solution three traditional problems
reasoning change; frame, qualification, ramification problems. theory
capable representing non-deterministic events, provides means stating
defeasible preferences outcomes conflicting simultaneous events.

1. Introduction
great deal written logical representation common sense reasoning
change since publication McCarthy Hayess (1969) seminal paper,
many theories proposed; see, example, monographs Sandewall (1994),
Shanahan (1997), Reiter (2001).
theories treat events1 deductively, along lines representation actions
used planner strips (Fikes & Nilsson, 1971). event type defined
preconditions effects. example, blocks world, preconditions unstacking
block x block x y, x clear (no block top it), robot hand
empty. effects hand holding x, clear, preconditions
false. Change matter deduction. particular event (a token event
type) occurs particular preconditions hold, particular effects deduced,
necessarily follow, it. Events kind called deductive events
view natural events represented deductively called Deductionism.
Deductive event types thought invariable regularities (or uniformities) sequence. Viewed way strips representation events seen descended
considered Hume Mill discussions causation. Hume (1739, Bk
I, Pt III) suggests inductively acquire knowledge regularities succession
form: A-type events followed B-type events. consider A-type events
cause B-type events, whenever see A-type event expect
followed B-type event. Mill (1898, Bk III, Ch 5) complicates picture considering
assemblages conditions. single assemblage might consist A-type event together
certain conditions must present (positive conditions) certain conditions
must absent (negative conditions). example, assemblage concerning
lighting matches might include striking match, presence oxygen,
absence dampness match head.

Mill (1898) thought possible, least principle, define assemblages
detailed enough ensure effects: every event combination
objects events, given concurrence circumstances, positive negative,
occurrence always followed phenomenon (p. 214).
However, Hume (1777, pp. 36-38) already argued possibility. always
possible regularity, matter long continued past, continue
future. Consequently set sentences report observed ever
logically implies anything observed. Goodman (1954, p. 59)
puts it, happened imposes logical restrictions happen. So,
Deductionism plausible, necessary assume Nature uniform;
future resemble past, past regularities continue. Now, clearly, Uniformity
cannot justified appealing experience, difficult see else
justified; see, Goodmans discussion (pp. 61-62). Without justification, Deductionism
regarded suspect theory.
Deductionism suspect practice, impossible practice define preconditions which, together occurrence event, sufficient ensure
effects follow. example, Russell (1913, p. 7) considers problem conflicting
events: put penny slot, draw ticket earthquake upsets machine calculations. order sure expected
effect, must know nothing environment interfere it.
means supposed cause not, itself, adequate insure effect. Russell
observes cannot usefully solve problem complicating preconditions because:
soon include environment, probability repetition diminished, until,
last, whole environment included, probability repetition becomes almost
nil (pp. 7-8).
problem specifying preconditions always sufficient arises Mackies
account causal regularities (invariable regularities sequence). example, least
part answer [to question caused particular fire] set
conditions (of positive negative), including presence
inflammable material, absence suitably placed sprinkler, doubt quite
number others (Mackie, 1975, p. 16). list conditions incomplete because, even
causal regularities hold objects, seldom, ever, known full: Causal
knowledge progresses gradually towards formulation regularities, hardly
ever gets there. Causal regularities known typically incomplete . . . know
certain elliptical gappy universal propositions (Mackie, 1974, p. 66).
sufficient-preconditions problem becomes acute consider formal representations intended practical use, preconditions
computationally tractable. McCarthy (1977, p. 1040) gives example using boat
cross river. Given boat rowing boat, equipped oars,
manned oarsman, used convey two passengers across river; provided
boat leak, provided hit rock, provided
hit another boat, provided overturned hippopotamus,
sunk meteorite, vapourized thermonuclear blast, etc. seems list
qualifications need added limited limits imagination.
Accordingly, McCarthy calls sufficient-preconditions problem qualification problem.

response, Deductionists might argue representations abstractions
approach works well simple domains, assumed qualifications arise. domains, might argue, uniformity assumption
reasonable, deductive theories provide useful representation. may well
true, but, theories kind cannot readily extended complex (less uniform)
domains additional complexity required preconditions quickly becomes
overwhelming. Thus Deductionist approach may appropriate certain applications,
mathematical analysis high-level programming languages elementary commands viewed abstract operations data. inappropriate
representation predictive reasoning natural events, events everyday
experience, irregular treated deductively. Moreover, Deductionist abstraction better thought idealization, problematic one that.
preconditions deductive event hold occurrence, effects logically
guaranteed follow, natural force intervene prevent so.
Deductive events thus natural, supernatural. idealization creates technical
difficulties comes representation events variable effects (including
non-deterministic context-dependent effects) effects always deduced, representation conflicting events (events whose effects individually
consistent jointly inconsistent) joint effects cannot consistently deduced.
Consequently Deductionist theories phenomena (some discussed
sequel) face unnecessary, self-imposed, difficulties. difficult escape conclusion
that, representing natural events deductively, Deductionism starts wrong foot.
conclusion hardly surprising consider predictive reasoning
natural events inductive, rather deductive, nature.2 major purpose
predictive reasoning support practical reasoning; is, reasoning do.
Predictive reasoning normally based partial knowledge (or incomplete belief),
causal regularities, Mackie observes, contexts events concerned
occur. tends conjectural seeks produce reasonable conclusions
basis known. result tends produce conclusions supradeductive (which may deducible known) defeasible (which may turn
wrong).3 Accordingly, definitions (practical, non-omniscient) rationality
typically couched terms utility expected (rather actual) outcomes
actions. Russell Norvig (2003, p. 36) illustrate point follows: walking
along Champs Elysees one day see old friend across street.
traffic nearby otherwise engaged, rational, start cross street.

obituary would read Idiot attempts cross street.
change perspective results substantial simplification problem specifying preconditions. longer concerned invariable regularities sequence,
necessary connections events effects, rather regularities
sequence normally hold; fairly dependable regularities sequence (Russell, 1913, p. 8), expected connections events effects. Consequently
define preconditions which, together associated events, form conditions
normally sufficient associated effects, otherwise minimal
sense part redundant. Preconditions kind tend
tractable (simple) useful (to occur frequently practice).
give Humeian account predictions involving natural events terms
(fairly) dependable regularities expectations engender. event occurs,
preconditions obtain, aware anything prevent effects
following, form clear expectation (we know) effects follow,
rational (reasonable) predict them. example, block unstacked
block B, preconditions obtain, aware preventer,
clearly expect, predict, longer B. complex cases involve
conflicting events. If, case, clear expectation outcome,
rational predict it. example, clearly expect, predict, airliner door
crush, rather bounce off, intrepid pedestrian. example consider
two conflicting outcomes possible, one probable. However,
cases expectations unclear; torn conflicting expectations
know expect. cases seems reasonable adopt cautious
approach, restrict predictions effects clearly expect. example,
fair coin tossed, clear expectation side
land. half expect land heads half expect land
tails. consider two conflicting outcomes equally probable. caution dictates
predict coin lands one side other,
predict two sides land on. Note that, expectations based
incomplete knowledge, predictions based defeasible. example,
if, unbeknown us, block glued block B unstacked B,
event effects predict have.
thus begin thinking natural events defeasible strips events, stripslike events whose effects always follow (when occur preconditions
true), inferring effects inductively. Accordingly, events kind
called inductive events, view natural events represented inductively
called Inductionism. logic understood include deductive inductive inference, Inductionist objection Deductionism stated succinctly:

generally, occurrence several simultaneously occurring events).

order represent epistemic partiality natural economical way EL based
Kleenes (1952, 64) strong three-valued logic.5 Kleene introduced truth value undefined order accommodate undecidable mathematical sentences. However
suggested undefined could interpreted unknown, where: unknown category regard proposition falling, whose value either
know choose moment disregard; exclude two
possibilities true false (p. 335). Thus understood, undefined truth value
par true false, introduction intended practical, logically
conservative, way reasoning partial information; rather revolutionary attack
classical logic.6
keeping interpretation, truth value sentence classical
(either true false) enough known determine it. formal semantics
propositional case thus given follows. model, , consists possibly
partial evaluation function, V , assigns one classical truth value
atomic proposition. truth (|=) falsity (=|) sentences defined
following truth falsity conditions:
|= p iff V (p) = true
=| p iff V (p) = false
|= iff =|
=| iff |=
condition: occurrence event e cause effect context c iff (i) e sufficient cause
c, (ii) depends e closest context c e sufficient cause .

Kripke, 1975, basis theory truth), choice use likely appear
natural one them. However, Kleenes logic may unfamiliar readers reasoning actions
change community, may well wonder used established classical
language Situation Calculus (McCarthy & Hayes, 1969). full justification choice
would involve lengthy comparison languages. short, simpler acknowledge epistemic
partiality ubiquitous feature predictive reasoning deal directly, Kleenes
logic, rather indirectly classical logic; means syntactic encoding circumscription (as
Situation Calculus), using modal logic (as TK, Shoham, 1988). representation
partiality Kleenes logic optimal; cost associated representation
unknown. contrast, partiality classical reasoning requires consideration class
models (or possible worlds) large enough ensure unwanted noise (arbitrary,
compulsory, assignments classical truth values sentences whose truth values determined
theory question) eliminated. profligacy significant considering contemplated
model-building implementation event theories (Bell, 1996, 1); see remarks implementation

requirement V assigns least one classical truth value atomic proposition.

defined as: =Df ( ); true either disjunct true, false
disjuncts false, undefined otherwise. exclusive disjunction defined
as: =Df ( ) ( ); true truth values

Kleenes logic perhaps called demi-classical, becomes classical
truth values constituent atomic sentences classical. Unsurprisingly then,
use Kleenes logic not, itself, solve problems predictive reasoning
beyond representing partiality. is, example, reliance special
causal notion consequence, Linear Logic (Girard, 1987).
expressiveness Kleenes language greatly enhanced adding classicallyvalued definedness operator it. sentence true defined (is either true
false), false otherwise:

|= iff either |= =|
=| iff neither |= =|

classically-valued operators defined follows:

=Df
=Df

F =Df
U =Df
=Df (T T) (F F) (U U)

Thus, sentences : true true, false otherwise; F true
false, false otherwise; U true undefined, false otherwise;

terms physical facts, theoretical facts supervene physical facts; is, fixing
physical facts point time fixes theoretical facts point time.
event theories, physical theoretical relations identified means secondorder predicates Phys Theo respectively. Thus Axiom (2) states every object
relation either physical relation theoretical relation. matter notational

right-hand equivalence classically valued. Note that, event theories
contain occurrences Theo relation, Axiom (2) unnecessary Axiom (3)
simplified accordingly.
turn intended interpretation event theories.
intended interpretation, Axiom (1) used generate expected outcomes
events. Pre(e)(t) Occ(e)(t) true, consistent assume
success atom Succ(e)(t) true, success assumption made, axiom
used conclude expected effects, Eff(e)(t+1), true. Thus interpreted
axiom states that, accompanied preconditions, occurring events normally
sufficient (are normally followed by) effects. interpreted way,
axiom amounts common sense law change.
Similarly, intended interpretation, Axiom (3) used generate expected
persistence physical facts. R physical relation, object atom R(x)(t) defined,
consistent assume inertia atom Inert(R, hxi)(t) true, inertia
assumption made, axiom used conclude truth value R(x) persists
t+1.13 Thus interpreted, axiom states physical facts normally persist,
amounts common sense law inertia.
intended interpretations axioms (1) (3) often conflict. example,
unstack-A-from-B event occurs, preconditions true, relevant facts
events involved, consistent assume unstack event succeeds,
consistent assume fact B inert, assumptions cannot
made success unstack event implies longer B.
cases suggest change always priority inertia, success
assumptions always priority inertia assumptions. conflict resolution
principle defended appealing regularity-based (Humeian) expectation
change. Thus, case hand, experience taught us unstack events
sort described normally succeed, form clear expectation effects
follow. contrast, giving priority inertia would, contrary expectation, result
nothing changing, adopting neutral stance would, contrary expectation, produce
unclear outcome.
intended interpretation event theories enforced formal pragmatics,
defines class preferred models given event theory. section

13. R(x)(t) defined, then, become clear, atom safely ignored. Inert(R, hxi)(t)
consistently assumed, formal pragmatics (in particular, minimization evidential
atoms t+1) ensures R(x)(t+1) undefined, thereby satisfying axiom.

However, whereas effects successful inductive events certain invariable,
effects natural events may uncertain they, least, may vary
according context events occur.
may seem context-dependent effects, ramifications, represented
domain axioms. However, following example, based Lifschitzs (1990) lampcircuit example Bakers (1991) ice-cream example, shows approach
simplistic.
Example 3 Ollie location L1, holding block B, moves location L2.
expect that, result, Ollie reach L2. Moreover, Ollie holding block
moves, expect move L2.
may seem example represented event theory 3 = Ind
{(12), . . . , (16)}; where:
x, l, l , t(Pre(Move(x, l, l ))(t) At(x, l)(t))

Thus effects Move simplified. fact moved object longer

different locations simultaneously, together appropriate inequality. intention
use Axiom (15) infer Ollies movement results movement block B. For,
given Ollie holding B gets L2, follows axiom B L2

However, two representative preferred 1 models 3 , partially

sense secondary event succeed invoked invoked
successful event.22 Given distinction, ramifications represented invoking
appropriate secondary events appropriate contexts. Thus, Example 3, Ollies moving
represented primary event which, holding block B moves,
invokes secondary move-B event. move-B event occurs invoked,
succeeds move-Ollie event does. Note secondary events may, turn,
invoke events causally dependent them. instance, current
example block B placed top block B, invoked move-B event turn
invoke move-B event. thus tertiary events, events ever higher order.

philosophical terms, invocations provide means representing contemporaneous

contemporaneous sufficient causation thought terms regularities, however

Contemporaneous (sufficient) causation events naturally required asymmetric (axioms (19) (20)). However, suggested cases

Secondary events used represent non-deterministic effects.
Non-deterministic effects may arise uncertainty preconditions. Suppose, example, initial positions blocks B B uncertain, either B
B conversely, B moved. Intuitively resulting location B
uncertain. B B, B moved location B, otherwise
B remained was. easy see Example 4 adapted
represent example faithfully. B B initially, move-B event invokes
secondary move-B event (Axiom (23)) results B moving B, otherwise
location B remains unchanged. resulting theory thus two representative
preferred1 models; one B moves, one B move.
non-deterministic effects may arise outcome events question
uncertain. successful, non-deterministic event regularly followed definite
effect, rather one set mutually exclusive possible effects; classic
example tossing fair coin. terms used introduction, expectations
regarding outcome events unclear. order see secondary events
needed represent these, consider following attempt represent coin-tossing.
Example 6 Suppose fair coin showing heads initially coin tossed.
coin fair, result uncertain; coin may show heads may show
tails. Let 6 = Ind {(40), (41), (42)} where:
t(Pre(Toss)(t) (Heads(t) Tails(t)))

Then, contrary intention, 6 deterministic 1 . 6 single representative preferred 1

If, example, one alternative effects event preserves status

three events true time 1 (axioms (40), (42)-(44)). However, view

TossT succeed Toss (Axiom (18)). Moreover, consistent assume
Toss succeed time 1 , follows (Definition 8.2) Toss succeed

represent simultaneous events forced police events regulate
effects. Gelfond, Lifschitz, Rabinov (1991) suggest done means
cancellations. Suppose, example, bowl full soup. one side
bowl lifted, soup spilt. However, sides bowl lifted
simultaneously, soup spilt. interactions represented means
two elementary lift events (lift-left-side, lift-right-side) composition (lift-bothsides). either elementary events occurs isolation, effect
soup spilt. complex event occurs, spill-effects component actions
cancelled, result bowl lifted soup spilt.
However cancellations appropriate ignore possibility failure. Suppose
reality one elementary lift events fails hand slips. effects
component event cancelled soup spilt.
cancellation cancelled?
Conflicts pose problem inductive events. faced conflicting events expect succeed. Some, possibly all,
expectations regarding events uncertain. reflected formal theory:
conflicting effects give rise conflicting success atoms, resulting failure rather inconsistency. However possibility failure raises problem over-weak predictions
(which amusingly complements over-strong problem Deductionism). two inductive events conflict (and interactions involving them), succeeds
preferred model fails, consequently nothing definite
disjunction effects predicted. appropriate events equal
status; indeed, provides basis representation non-deterministic events given
previous section. appropriate expect one events
succeed. Suppose, example, Stan Ollie attempt move location
simultaneously one succeed. Suppose Ollies success
likely Stans, say bigger. normally expect Ollie
succeed Stan fail. However, abnormal independent circumstances
lead us expect Ollie fail, lead us expect Stan
fail also. Indeed, circumstances, expect Stan succeed. example,
Ollie trips, expect Stan succeed; although, course, may trip,
etc.
Asymmetric expectations kind thought event preferences, preferences outcomes events. Thus events e e conflict, expect
e succeed, success e preferred e . However, examples
show, preferences kind defeasible order prejudice success
non-preferred event preferred event fail independent reason.
Event preferences represented EL preference atoms, event atoms

Thus axioms (53)-(56) define elementary lift-left (LiftL), lift-right (LiftR) spill events.
Axiom (57) states soup spilt, occurrence either elementary lift
event invokes spill event. Axioms (58)-(60) define complex lift-both event (Lift),

second part, let preferred 2 model 9 {Succ(Lift)(1)}. Then,
above, events Lift, LiftL, LiftR, Spill supported time 1 . Lift
fails (when supported) time 1 , one component lift-events must fail
time 1 (axioms (1), (53), (54), (59)). However component event succeeds

reasoning include several characteristics classified belonging

trajectory semantics, defines class intended models given example
family IAD, uses prove correctness (to provide validations for) various
formal pragmatics theories expressed appropriate formal languages. example,
simple form chronological minimization called PCM proved valid family

extension (Toronto) Situation Calculus (Lin & Reiter, 1994). appearance
unanalyzed causation relation formal theory events seems beg question;
appeal made complex notion (causation) order give analysis
simpler one (change). However, rather view causation relation appeal
full-blown causation (see Footnote 4), better view means encoding detailed
causal knowledge. Lins theory ternary relation Caused (p, v, s) true fluent p
caused (by something unspecified) truth value v situation (p. 1986).
keeping interpretation, two axioms given:
Caused (p, true, s) Holds(p, s) ,
Caused (p, f alse, s) Holds(p, s) .
Thus fluent p caused value true (false) situation s, p holds (does
hold) situation s. way illustration, Lin discusses example spring
loaded suitcase. locks up, suitcase opens. Initially suitcase
closed, one lock up, down, down-lock flipped. Naturally expect
suitcase open result. However, attempts formalize example using
ordinary domain axiom inertia fail; lamp circuit example, lock
remains intended models, unintended models
suitcase remains closed lock changes position result. Consequently Lin
proposes causal domain axiom:
up(L1, s) up(L2, s) Caused (open, true, s) ;

(81)

states locks L1 L2 situation s, suitcase Caused
open s. intention axioms interpreted causally
(positively), effect achieved circumscribing Caused relation adding
inertia axiom states fluents Caused change persist. Thus
according Lins account, ramifications arise result causally-directed domain axioms
(81), facts cause facts change. Indeed, Lin (p. 1986) says (81)
that:
[T]he physical spring loaded mechanism behind causal rule abstracted away. care, may well device
made spring, bombs blow open suitcase time two
locks position. seems natural say fluent open
caused true fact two locks position.
However seems odd common sense point view, events
cause change facts otherwise inert. Moreover, actual cause
abstracted away, difficult see Lins account could extended order include
treatment qualifications; example, suitcase may fail open locks
mechanism rusty, someone sitting suitcase, etc. contrast,

obvious represent problem using primary secondary events; context
one lock down, flipping down-lock invokes secondary
event which, succeeds, additional effect suitcase open. Moreover,
noted above, introduction secondary events makes possible represent
complex examples ramifications, Example 4.
Secondary events compared natural actions proposed Reiter
(1996), Lin (1998), Pinto (1998). addition actions initiated agents, suggest
natural actions arise due nature world (the Laws
Nature, etc.), guaranteed succeed. use illustrated Pintos
treatment Lifschitzs (1990) lamp-circuit example. switches circuit
position (both down) lamp on, otherwise off. Initially
switches opposite positions one flipped. Clearly expect lamp
result. However attempts formalize example using domain axioms
inertia axiom fail. intended models switch retains position inertia
lamp comes result flip event. However unintended models
lamp remains inertia consequently switch mysteriously
changes position result; problem essentially posed Example 3.
Pintos treatment problem, agent flipping switch results natural action
current flowing circuit, turn results lamp on. natural
action current flowing resolves conflict alternative uses inertia
axiom bringing intermediary state switches (as flowing
current affect position) inertia axiom applied
intended way (as flowing current guaranteed effect lamp on).
proposal aims solve causal-directedness problem introducing additional
events can, perhaps, seen lying somewhere Thielschers logical approach
representational approach. Unlike natural events, natural actions deductive.
difficult see natural actions could used represent qualifications.
example, natural action current flowing guaranteed succeed (turning
lamp on), reality current might flow wire loses conductivity, cut,
etc. clearly complication represented using natural events. context
switches opposite positions, flipping switch invokes secondary event
which, succeeds, results lamp on; lamps coming thus defeasible
secondary effect flipping switch. Moreover, natural actions independent
actions agents, secondary events causally dependent (at least one of)
events invoke them.
Event preferences (Section 5) introduced previous research (Bell, 2001, Simultaneous events). presentation substantially improved, and, examples
show, combination event preferences secondary events provides interesting new
possibilities.
Recently Vo Foo (2005) suggested inductive theory reasoning action

8. Conclusion
began arguing Deductionism logical mistake, made case Inductionism. began basic theory inductive events, provides basis
integrated solution qualification frame problems. introduced
distinction primary secondary events order represent causal structure
natural events, thereby providing basis solution ramification problem
problem representing non-determinism. Finally, introduced event preferences, used express defeasible preferences outcomes conflicting
simultaneous events. development theory illustrates benefit starting
right foot, inductive, rather deductive, events. basic theory simple
intuitive, extensions require addition axioms
refinement one clause formal pragmatics.
simple cases may little choose deductive inductive theories events; produce predictions wrong. However inductive
representation natural events accurate reflects defeasibility.
representation inductive events makes possible define primary secondary events,
defeasible event preferences. turn make possible give accurate representations ramifications, non-determinism, conflicting events. turn makes
possible represent complex cases accurately. instance, Example 8, two
stooges attempt move location, one expected succeed, however three
do, none succeeds. always inductive events, example elaborated.
Thus two stooges attempt move preferred one fails independent
reason (he slips, say), stooge normally succeeds (unless slips).
case three attempt move, Ollie slips, Stan expected succeed.
slips, Charlie expected succeed; may slip. Moreover,
example readily combined others. example, stooge could carry stack
blocks; block moves block beneath it, stooge holding it,
moves. know theory events represent reasoning subtlety
complexity.
