aspect set search queries together represent distinct information need relevant
original search query serve eective means explore space aspector
computes aspects orthogonal high combined coverage
aspector combines two sources information compute aspects discover
candidate aspects analyzing query logs cluster eliminate redundancies

introduction
web search engines today predominantly answer queries simple ranked list
method successful relies assumption users information need satised single page web however several studies broder
rose levinson alluded fact many user queries merely
beginning exploration unknown space information queries likely
better served users provided summary relevant information space
means conveniently exploring paraphrase rather nding needle
haystack queries would benet summarizing haystack rajaraman
several commercial attempts recently made provide better answers
queries including systmes carrot clusty kosmix yahoo glue
describes aspector system addresses following given
exploratory search query q compute set aspects enables convenient exploration
web content relevant q dene aspect set search
queries together represent distinct information need relevant original search

relevant information search engine users might interested two simple ways
search engine utilize aspects oer related searches categorize search
aspects relevant aspects form basis
mashup interfaces e g aspect pictures trigger inclusion images
weather trigger weather report gadget computing aspects queries seen
rst step towards mining knowledge base called database user intentions battelle

aspector computes aspects query q search engine query log augmented
information knowledge base created mass collaboration wikipedia given
query q related queries extracted query log candidate aspects
logs excellent mirror users interests noisy redundant
aspects e g top related queries vietnam travel include vietnam visa vietnam travel
visa furthermore query logs limited utility generating aspects less popular
queries e g much fewer related queries laos travel vietnam travel
describe following algorithmic innovations address challenges first
redundant candidate aspects removed search second apply
class label propagation bipartite graph compute high quality aspects even
long tail less popular queries finally knowledge bases used
group candidate aspects categories represent single information need believe
solution demonstrates interesting interplay query logs knowledge
bases yet investigated literature
describe detailed experimental evaluation aspector compare aspects
generated aspector three possible competing approaches related searches
proposed google com cluster labels proposed clusty com navigational searches
proposed bing com related searches navigational searches typically generated analysis query logs cluster labels generated grouping search
original query extracting labels documents within cluster
aspects diverse three systems
aspects span larger space information expose

definition

queries assume queries sequence keywords typical searchengine interfaces techniques meant apply arbitrary queries focus
exploratory queries specically assume entity names e g
country vietnam entity property name e g vietnam travel thus
interested computing aspects entities general context particular
property
handle segmenting entity property names
queries previous work bergsma wang tan peng addressed
question identifying exploratory queries query stream
beyond scope
aspects aspect query q meant describe particular sense q corresponding information need specically aspect represented collection
search queries related q given q compute set aspects along
scores p ai q used rank
since aspects collections search queries compare aspects search
retrieved queries constitute aspects meant capture diverse
dimensions along organize exploration entire space information
relevant query hence set aspects computed query
following properties
orthogonality given two aspects search
dierent
coverage search provided aspects oer good overview
relevant space information
thus two sets aspects computed query compared
pairwise orthogonality constituent aspects combined coverage
aspects evaluation aspects inherently subjective typical area web
search hence present user studies aspects computed dierent approaches
qualitatively rated large number independent users note
compare dierent approaches computing aspects focus dierent ways
presented users

alternative approaches

knowledge bases especially created large community contributors

good set aspects query example consider properties associated
cambodia wikipedia infobox capital flag population gdp etc none
words appear top frequent queries contain word cambodia addition
knowledge base limited describing well dened entities example cambodia
entity knowledge base cambodia travel however queries web cover
much well dened entities
underlying reason knowledge bases fall short constructors choose
attributes traditional design principles good aspects follow
principles example turns cambodia travel good aspect vietnam travel
many people consider side trip cambodia visiting vietnam however
designing knowledge base cambodia would never attribute vietnam
instead knowledge base would assert vietnam cambodia neighbors
include rule states x next x travel may aspect
travel unfortunately coming rules specifying precise preconditions
formidable task highly dependent instances applies example
pakistan travel aspect india travel even though two countries neighbors

eliminating duplicate aspects

represent identical similar user intents particular note set
