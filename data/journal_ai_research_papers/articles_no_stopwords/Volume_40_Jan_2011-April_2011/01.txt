1. Introduction
standard propositional logic, classical entailment distinguish among formulas
entail another formula. example, let x, z three atoms.
neither x z classically entails x y. However, x seems intuitively closer x
z. reason that, x considered union two parts x y,
x exactly one them. hand, z completely irrelevant x y.
example motivates us consider notion partial entailment. comparison classical entailment, partial entailment intends capture partial satisfaction
relationship two formulas respect background theory. standard propositional logic, formula P entails another formula Q respect formula set
intuitively means circumstance , P true Q true.
contrast, formula P partially entails another formula Q respect formula set
intuitively means that, circumstance , P true part Q
true. Partial entailment widely used everyday life. example, suppose

final examination. cannot achieve them, could satisfied
achieve one them. least, better achieving none.
Let us consider example. Suppose background formula set empty
objective formula x y. Consider following four formulas: x, x z, x
z. Clearly, none formulas classically entails x y. However, x, x z x
entail x, regarded part x y. contrast, z irrelevant x y. Thus,
one conclude that, extent, x, x z x partially satisfy x z
not.

One may observe exists difference x x z partially
satisfying x y. is, x z contains new atom z, irrelevant x y.
hand, x exactly part x y. words, x z contains irrelevancy
(namely z) partially satisfying x x not. Another observation
x y. Although entails x (a part x y), entails y, contradicts
(also part x y). words, x side effect (namely y) besides
partially satisfying x y.
background theory crucial partial entailment. example, consider z
x again. Suppose background formula set empty. case, z
partially satisfy x y. background formula set turns {z x}, z
partially satisfy x since background theory, z holds, x holds well.
Based observations intuitions, paper, formalize notion partial entailment two formulas respect background theory

intuitions summarized Table 1. course, require partial
satisfaction two formulas. However, weak partial entailment may allow
irrelevancies side effects, whilst partial entailment prohibits side effects still may
allow irrelevancies, strong partial entailment strongest one prohibits
irrelevancies.

2.1 Simple Case
begin define notions partial entailments two formulas respect
background formula set considering rather simple case. is, two
formulas consistent conjunctions literals background formula set assumed
empty.
Definition 1 Let 0 two consistent sets literals.
say weakly partially entails 0 0 6= .
say partially entails 0 0 6= 0 = .
say strongly partially entails 0 0 .
Definition 1 simply follows intuitions presented introduction section (see
Table 1). simple case, 0 consistent set literals. Thus, parts 0
regarded elements (or subsets) 0 . Recall intuitive sense partial
satisfaction. is, holds, parts 0 hold well. means
exists part 0 , subset . Clearly, precisely captured
0 6= , exactly definition weak partial entailment simple case.
partial entailment, forbid side effects based partial satisfaction. Again, since 0
consistent set literals, side effects 0 regarded complementary
literal elements (or subsets) 0 . Hence, side effects 0 means
mention complementary literal elements (or subsets) 0 . Clearly,
precisely captured 0 = , 0 set complementary literals
elements 0 . Together 0 6= , forms definition partial entailment
simple case.

Finally, consider strong partial entailment. require additionally
irrelevancy. irrelevancies 0 considered atoms (or literals)
mentioned 0 . Hence, irrelevancy 0 means atom
(or literal) mentioned 0 . Formally, precisely captured
Atom() Atom( 0 ) (or 0 ). Whatever case is, together two conditions
0 6= 0 = , equivalent 0 6= , definition
strong partial entailment simple case.
Example 1 Recall example proposed introduction section. According Definition 1, easy check x, x x z weakly partially entail x z
not; x x z partially entail x x z not; x strongly partially
entails x x y, x z z not. results coincide intuitions
observations discussed introduction section.
Comparing weak partial entailment partial entailment, one may observe x

side effect x y. Comparing partial entailment strong partial entailment,
one may observe x z partially entails x strongly partially entail
x y. Again, coincides discussions since z irrelevancy x y. 2
interesting phenomenon relationships partial entailments
classical entailment. simple case, easy see classically entails 0 ,
partially entails 0 . Also, weakly partially entails 0 . means classical
entailment special case (weak) partial entailment extent. However,
hold strong partial entailment. instance, x classically entails x,
strongly partially entail x since irrelevancy respect x.
first glance, seems result strange sense term partial
entailment generalization classical entailment. However, mean
classical entailment prohibits side effects irrelevancies. Thus, intuitive
sense, one conclude classical entailment special case weak
partial entailment, may mutually different partial entailment strong partial
entailment. Interestingly, show later, classical entailment indeed prohibits side
effects. means classical entailment special case partial entailment well.
However, classical entailment may allow irrelevancy (e.g., x classically entails x
irrelevancy x). Hence, roughly speaking, classical entailment special case
partial entailment weak partial entailment, classical entailment strong partial
entailment mutually different.
Definition 1 gives basic impression notions partial entailments.
following, consider extend three notions partial entailments general sense,

Marquis (2000).
Roughly speaking, prime implicant formula minimal set (in sense
set inclusion) literals entails formula. notion prime implicant
relativized respect background formula set follows.
Definition 2 (Relativized prime implicant) literal set prime implicant
formula P respect formula set if:
1. consistent.
2. |= P .
3. exist literal set 0 satisfies two conditions.
set prime implicants P respect denoted P I(, P ). convenience, omit empty.
Intuitively, prime implicant P w.r.t. minimal set information needed
order satisfy P circumstance . Condition 1 requires set information feasible, i.e., must consistent background formula set. Condition
2 means set information implicant, i.e., indeed powerful enough
satisfy P w.r.t. . Finally, condition 3 requires set information prime, i.e.,
minimal set information satisfying P w.r.t. .
Example 2 According Definition 2, prime implicant x {x, y},
x two prime implicants, namely {x} {y}. background formula set indeed
plays important role. Clearly, x unique prime implicant {x}. However, {y}
prime implicant x respect background formula set {y x}. 2
well known relativized notion prime implicant similar notion
logic-based abduction (Eiter & Gottlob, 1995; Selman & Levesque, 1990; Eiter & Makino,
2007). different characterizations abduction literature. Here, consider
one well-studied forms (Selman & Levesque, 1990; Eiter & Makino, 2007).
Definition 3 (Selman & Levesque, 1990) Let theory, F formula H set
literals. (abductive) explanation F respect H minimal set
H that:
1. consistent,
2. |= F .
Following definitions, observed relativized notion prime
implicant abduction simply transformed other. precisely, suppose
theory, F formula H set literals. Let Lit set literals
language. Then, prime implicant F w.r.t. iff abductive explanation
F respect Lit. Conversely, abductive explanation F respect
H iff prime implicant F w.r.t. mentions literals H.

Another closely related notion prime implicant dual, called prime implicate,
interests many areas well. Roughly speaking, prime implicate

Many properties relation prime implicate discussed summarized Marquis (2000). surprisingly, similar results hold prime implicant well.

Together Proposition 2, Proposition 3 indicates correspondence relationship

Proposition 4 Let P formula set formulas. |= P

Proposition 5 Let P Q two formulas set formulas. |= P Q iff

conclude, prime implicants formula P w.r.t. formula set play two roles.
Cases: one hand, exists assignment satisfying P , according
Proposition 2, exists subset prime implicant P w.r.t. .

introduced following.
2.3 Definitions Partial Entailments

Definition 4 (Weak partial entailment) formula P weakly partially entails formula Q respect formula set , denoted P W

1. P I(, P ) empty.
2. P I(, P ), exists 0 P I(, Q), 0 6= .

1. P I(, P ) empty.
2. P I(, P ), exists 0 P I(, Q), 0 6= 0 =

2. P I(, P ), exists 0 P I(, Q), 0 .

Clearly, definitions generalizations Definition 1 proposed Section 2.1 since
unique prime implicant literal set itself. Note difference among
definitions partial entailments indeed presented Section 2.1 simple case.
Definitions 4-6 require literal set P I(, P ), exists literal
set P I(, Q) two literal sets satisfy corresponding relationships
presented Definition 1 respectively.
Let us take closer look condition 2 Definition 4. Recall intuitive sense

discussed Section 2.2, prime implicants P w.r.t. represent cases
make P true . Also, prime implicants Q w.r.t. capture idea
part Q . Hence, condition 2 means that, intuitively, cases
P true (captured prime implicants P w.r.t. ), exists
way achieve Q (captured prime implicant Q w.r.t. ),
former partially satisfies latter (reduced simple case Definition 1). addition,
condition 1 Definition 4 ensures exists least one situation. intuitive
senses Definitions 5 6 explained similar way.
Example 3 Let background theory {x y, z y}. Consider two formulas P =
(x r) (y s) Q = (x z) (x s). prime implicants P w.r.t.
follows: {x, r}, {y, s}, {r, s}, {z, s}, {y, r} {x, s}. Notice {y, r} prime
implicant P w.r.t. although literal even occur P .
hand, prime implicants Q w.r.t. follows: {x, z}, {x, s} {z, s}. Notice
{x, y, s} prime implicant Q w.r.t. since {x, s} subset
satisfies Q .
According definitions, P weakly partially entail Q w.r.t.
since prime implicant {y, r} P w.r.t. intersection
prime implicants Q w.r.t. . Also, P (strongly) partially entail
Q w.r.t. either. Conversely, Q (weakly) partially entails P w.r.t. , whilst
strongly partially entail P w.r.t. . 2
Note possible relations two formulas w.r.t. background

partial entailments, use style definition sense require

two literal sets.

explained analogously classical entailment. Note formula P classically entails

Certainly, possible styles, including , . instance,
style definition weakest case be: exists P I(, P )
0 P I(, Q), 0 6= . Although definitions might interesting useful
elsewhere, fail capture basic idea partial satisfaction.
Example 4 Consider two formulas x z x y. former two prime implicants,
namely {x} {z}, latter unique prime implicant, namely {x, y}.
use style definition, x z (weakly, strongly) partially entails x y. However,

words, assignment {x, y, z} satisfies x z x y. Hence, exists case
x z true none parts x true.
Consider formula x y, two prime implicants, {x} {y}. take
style definition one, formula (weakly, strongly) partially entail

Another feasible direction definitions switch formulas P Q. instance,
switched- style definition weakest case is: P I(, Q), exists

style definitions, fail capture basic idea partial satisfaction either. Again,
recall intuition partial entailments. is, P true (under context ),
part Q true well (under context ). Similar classical entailment,
naturally suggests order P Q definitions partial entailments. Also,

shown Example 4, suitable defining notions partial entailments.
understand switched- style switched- style definitions fail capturing
partial entailments, let us consider following example.
Example 5 Consider two formulas x x. former two prime implicants,
namely {x, y} {x, y}, latter unique prime implicant, namely {x}.
take switched- style definition, x (weakly, strongly) partially entails
x. However, intuitive {x, y} achieves x achieves x.
Hence, exists case x true x false.
Again, consider formula x y. two prime implicants, namely {x} {y}.
Intuitively, formula (weakly, strongly) partially entail itself. However,
case apply switched- style definition. 2
One fundamental properties relationships among three notions partial
entailments. following proposition shows weak partial entailment weaker

Then, formulas P inconsistent , P (weakly, strongly) partially
entail formula Q. Also, formulas P entailed , P (weakly, strongly)
partially entail formula Q. However, reasons two cases different.
former, reason P I(, P ) empty (see Proposition 4), thus P excluded
item 1 definitions. latter, reason P I(, P ) = {} (see Proposition
4 again), thus prime implicant P w.r.t. intersections prime
implicants. say formula P trivial respect background formula set
|= P |= P . Otherwise, say P nontrivial respect . following
proposition shows trivial formula neither (weakly, strongly) partially entail

Proposition 7 (Non-Triviality) Let formula set P Q two formulas.

Proposition 8 (Extension Classical Entailment) Let formula set P

Proposition 8 shows partial entailment extension classical entailment
considering nontrivial formulas, weak partial entailment. converses hold.
simple example, x (weakly) partially entails x x classically entail x y.
Note strong partial entailment classical entailment mutually different.
example, x classically entails x x strongly partially entail x. Conversely,
x strongly partially entails xy x classically entail xy. demonstrated

formal definitions.
Certainly, one consider inference rules, instance, Contraposition. is,

2.5 Discussions
One may doubt whether partial entailments directly captured within classical propositional logic. example, one may define partial entailment follows. formula P
partially entails formula Q w.r.t. formula set iff exists formula R
{R} 6|= Q {P, R} |= Q. However, definition cannot capture partial satisfaction. fact, every formula P 6|= P Q, always exists formula
V
R (Let R P Q). Even restrict R consistent literal sets, definition
capture partial satisfaction either. instance, x partially entail x
according definition since (x y) |= x y. However, conclusion counterintuitive. alternative possibility, since P partially entails Q intuitively means
P entails parts Q, one may define partial entailment as: formula P partially
entails formula Q iff exists Q0 Q00 |= Q Q0 Q00 , Q00 6|= Q0
P |= Q0 . However, definition fails capture essence partial entailment either.
instance, according definition, x partially entails since |= (xy)(xy),
x 6|= x y, x |= x y.
According definitions partial entailments, x (weakly, strongly) partially entails
x x y. One may conclude result indicates conjunction
disjunction play similar role partial entailments. However, case.
example, reasons x partially entails x x partially entails x
completely different. former case, reason x part x y,
latter case, reason x classically entails x y. fact, conjunction disjunction
play totally different roles partial entailments. instance, x partially entails x,
x not. examples easily found.

Another evidence illustrate differences conjunction disjunction
consider another special case partial entailments restricting formulas clauses,
i.e., disjunction literals, assuming background theory empty.
Proposition 10 Let 0 two non-valid clauses (i.e., disjunctions two consistent
sets literals). following statements equivalent.
1. subset 0 represented two sets literals.
2. classically entails 0 .
3. weakly partially entails 0 .
4. partially entails 0 .
5. strongly partially entails 0 .
Proposition 10 states setting, classical entailment three kinds
partial entailments coincide. Compared Proposition 10 Definition 1, disjunction
conjunction quite different partial entailments.
mentioned earlier, Substitution principle hold three kinds
partial entailments general. means that, partial entailments, atoms indeed
play different role formulas. instance, x (weakly, strongly) partially entails x y.
However, necessary case P partially entails P Q. shows difference
partial entailments classical entailment due fact Substitution
principle holds standard propositional logic.

4. Related Work
section 2, discussed relationships partial entailments classical entailment. Here, consider relationships partial entailments
related notions literature, including family notions relevance relatives, formula-variable independence (Boutilier, 1994; Lang et al., 2003), relevance
formulas (Lakemeyer, 1995, 1997), novelty (Marquis, 1991) probabilistic positive relevance (Zhou & Chen, 2006), partial satisfaction formula (Lieberherr &
Specker, 1981; Kappeli & Scheder, 2007).
4.1 Formula-Variable Independence
Lang et al. (2003) defined notion formula-variable independence formula
set atoms. Roughly speaking, formula independent set atoms
formula rewritten another one mentions atoms set atoms.
Definition 7 (Lang et al., 2003) formula F variable-independent set V
variables iff exists formula G |= F G Atom(G) V = .
Also, Lang et al. proved variable-independence coincides notions influenceability introduced Boutilier (1994) relevance formula set atoms
introduced Lakemeyer (1997).
shown Lang et al. (2003), notion formula-variable independence
reformulated prime implicant. Here, show reformulated weak partial
entailment well.
Proposition 15 Let F formula V set atoms. following statements
equivalent:
1. F variable-independent V .
2. literals l V V , l prime implicants F .
3. literals l V V , l weakly partially entail F .
42

fiA Logical Study Partial Entailment

4.2 Forms Relevance
Lakemeyer introduced forms relevance well, including strict relevance, explanatory relevance relevance two subject matters (Lakemeyer, 1997).
Definition 8 (Lakemeyer, 1997) formula F strictly relevant set V atoms
iff every prime implicate F contains least one atom V .
following proposition shows strict relevance reformulated prime
implicant weak partial entailment well.
Proposition 16 Let F formula V = {x1 , . . . , xn } set atoms. following
statements equivalent.
1. F strictly relevant V .
2. F weakly partially entails (x1 . . . xn ) (x1 . . . xn ).
Definition 9 (Lakemeyer, 1997) formula F explanatory relevant set V
atoms w.r.t. formula set iff exists minimal abductive explanation F w.r.t.
mentions variable V .
definition explanatory relevance reformulated prime implicant.
is, F explanatory relevant V w.r.t. iff exists l V V l
least one prime implicants F w.r.t. .
4.3 Relevance Formulas
pointed Lakemeyer (1997), interesting consider relevance formulas
respect background theory. Here, propose definition relevance
two formulas respect background theory using prime implicant.
Definition 10 formula P relevant formula Q respect formula set iff
exists prime implicant P w.r.t. prime implicant 0 Q w.r.t.
0 6= .
Definition 10 looks similar definition weak partial entailment (See Definition 4). major difference two definitions weak partial entailment
defined style, whilst relevance defined style. precisely,
former, require prime implicants P w.r.t. , exists prime
implicant Q w.r.t. intersection empty. However, latter,
require exists prime implicant P w.r.t. exists prime
implicant Q w.r.t. satisfying condition.
However, weak partial entailment serve strict notion relevance two
formulas respect background theory. is, formula P strictly relevant
another formula Q respect formula set P weakly partially entails
Q w.r.t. . Clearly, strict version relevance formulas w.r.t. background
theory based weak partial entailment implies normal one defined Definition 10,
converse hold general.
43

4.4 Novelty Novelty-Based Independence
notion novelty (Marquis, 1991) defined two formulas respect
formula set well.
Definition 11 (Marquis, 1991) formula P new positive (new negative) another
formula Q respect formula set iff exists prime implicant Q (Q)
respect {P }, prime implicant Q (Q) respect .
addition, notion independence, namely novelty-based independence (also known
separability, see Levesque, 1998), two formulas defined based novelty (Lang,
Liberatore, & Marquis, 2002).
Definition 12 (Lang et al., 2002) Two formulas P Q (novelty-based) independent iff P new negative Q w.r.t. >.
Intuitively, P new Q w.r.t. means adding new information P
background theory influences Q Q. Although novelty partial
entailments defined using notion prime implicant, essentially
different. instance, (non)novelty-based independence satisfies Symmetry. is,
P (non)novelty-based independent Q, Q (non)novelty-based independent
P . However, (weak, strong) partial entailment satisfy Symmetry. instance,
x (weakly, strongly) partially satisfies x y, converse hold. another
example, x (weakly, strongly) partially entails x y. However, x new positive
(negative) x y. Also, x new positive (negative) x. However, x
(weakly, strongly) partially entail x.
4.5 Probabilistic Positive Relevance
Another approach formalize certain kind usefulness probabilistic positive relevance
(Zhou & Chen, 2006), based probability distributions. basic idea positive relevance is: formula P positive relevant another formula Q respect
background formula set iff probability distributions P r, P r(Q|{P }) P r(Q|).
Although positive relevance looks similar partial entailments, probability distribution highly related prime implicant (Lang et al., 2002), underlying intuition
semantic properties positive relevance partial entailments quite different.
instance, according definition positive relevance Zhou Chen (2006),
x positive relevant x. However, x (weakly, strongly) partially entail
x. Generally speaking, positive relevance (defined based probability distributions),
Symmetry holds. is, P positive relevant Q w.r.t. Q positive
relevant P w.r.t. . However, hold kinds partial entailments.
4.6 Partial Satisfaction CNF
term partial satisfaction used satisfaction subset set clauses
(Lieberherr & Specker, 1981; Kappeli & Scheder, 2007). CNF formula (i.e. conjunction
clauses) said k-satisfiable every subformula containing k clauses
satisfiable.
44

fiA Logical Study Partial Entailment

Although term partial satisfaction used k-satisfaction partial entailments, represents different intuitive meanings. former, part means subset
formula (i.e. set clauses), latter, means subset prime implicant formula. Hence, partial entailments k-satisfaction basically irrelevant.
Moreover, k-satisfaction concerned particular (CNF) formula, partial
entailments concerned relationship two formulas (w.r.t. background
theory).

5. Partial Goal Satisfaction
traditional logic based approach rational agency, agents always try find actions
completely achieve goals. successful, agents would choose wait
nothing. idea usually formalized using classical entailment. However,
always case agents find perfect action (think real world
live in). situation, sometimes useful agents something
towards goals rather waiting, actions partially satisfying
agents goal rational candidates. Here, partial entailments may serve
logic foundation.
Example 6 Let us consider example. Suppose Laura wants milk cereal
breakfast. However, three choices available breakfast menu.
Choice1 milk offered.
Choice2 Milk bread offered.
Choice3 bread offered.
Due current information, none choices completely satisfies Lauras goal.
Then, do? 2
Here, argue that, circumstance, rational agents choose
actions partially achieving goal according belief, action
completely achieving goal.
important allow actions partially achieving agents goal rational
candidates. First all, rationality performing actions solid since
make goal closer agents nothing better do. Hence, choosing
actions useful agents goal reasonable waiting. Also,
environment dynamic nature. cases, agents choose actions
partially achieving goal, might lose chance achieve goal forever.
frequently happens everyday life cannot seize opportunities.
formalize partial achievement actions goals agents belief
using notion partial entailments proposed Section 2. natural since
partial entailments precisely capture partial satisfaction relations two formulas
respect background theory. apply partial entailments formalize partial goal

represent actions consequences. Here, address issue, simply use triples
Hoare logic represent actions.5
Again, restrict discussions within propositional language. goal
belief agents represented propositional formula set propositional formulas
respectively. action triple hP re(), , P ost()i, label called body
action, P re() P ost() two propositional formulas called precondition
postcondition action respectively. Next, show traditional idea
complete goal satisfaction idea partial goal satisfaction formalized
setting.
Definition 13 (Complete goal satisfaction) Let agents belief G agents
goal. Let set candidate actions. action completely achieves agents
goal G according belief iff:
1. |= P re().
2. {P ost()} consistent.
3. |= P ost() G.
Definition 13 means agents belief satisfies precondition action
believes postcondition action entails goal, action completely
achieves goal belief. Partial goal satisfaction formalized similar way
except partial entailments used instead classical entailment.
Definition 14 (Partial goal satisfaction) Let agents belief G agents
goal. Let set candidate actions. action (weakly, strongly) partially
achieves agents goal G according belief iff:
1. |= P re().

2. P ost()(W
, ) G.

Definition 14 means agents belief satisfies precondition action
believes postcondition action partially entails goal, action
partially achieves goal belief.
Example 7 Consider Example 6 proposed previously. formalize example, use x,
z represent milk, cereal bread respectively. Then,
Lauras belief empty since background knowledge; goal represented
x y; preconditions three actions take three choices respectively
empty well represented >, postcondition three cases
represented x, x z z respectively. According Definition 13, none three
actions completely achieves goal x y. However, according Definition 14, take
Choice1 Choice2 (weakly) partially achieve goal. particular, take Choice1
strongly partially achieves goal, whilst take Choice3 partially achieve
goal sense. 2

problem arises kind partial goal satisfaction rational agents. first
glance, seems partial entailment appropriate purpose. Weak partial
entailment may contain side effects acceptable, whilst strong partial entailment
strict powerful actions excluded. However, believe better
leave agent designers. One may choose different kinds partial goal satisfaction
different application domains, e.g., strong partial entailment irrelevancies
side effects crucial issues, partial entailment side effects unacceptable
irrelevancies not, weak partial entailment looser cases.
worth mentioning partial goal satisfaction proposes one possible solution
dealing situations agents cannot find plan completely achieve
goal. neither solution necessarily perfectly rational.
situations, actions achieving parts agents goal may lose chances
achieve parts, might unacceptable agents.
Also, actions partially achieving agents goal rational candidates
compulsory. quite different fact action rational candidate
agents really choose perform it. Partial goal satisfaction explains
rationality actions partially achieving goals. problem particular
action chosen perform among actions partially achieving agents
goal another research topic beyond scope paper.
Another approach handling situations explicitly represent agents full
preferences among combinations goals. instance, Example 6, Laura may
following full preferences among candidate goals:
{M ilk, Cereal} > {M ilk} > {Cereal} > {},
> represents preference relation. Lauras original goal (i.e. ilk Cereal)
cannot achieved, intends achieve second best candidate goal (i.e. ilk)
according preference. observed partial goal satisfaction always
consistent full preference approach, instance, preference Laura
turns {M ilk, Cereal} > {} > {M ilk} > {Cereal}. Although sharing similarities,
two approaches essentially different. First all, full preference requires additional
information, partial goal satisfaction not. Moreover, expensive represent
full preference agents. Since number possible combinations goals exponential respect size goals, represent full preference requires double
exponential number new information. Last least, usually difficult obtain
full preferences agents. Hence, believe full preference approach
partial goal satisfaction approach advantages disadvantages
dealing situations perfect actions achieve agents goal.
idea partial satisfaction goals discussed elsewhere AI literature
(Haddawy & Hanks, 1992; Smith, 2004; Do, Benton, van den Briel, & Kambhampati, 2007).
One approach called partial satisfaction planning (Smith, 2004; et al., 2007).
partial satisfaction planning, agents find plans, instead completely achieving goals,
partially achieve goals. Since agents goals AI planning, particularly
STRIPS-like planning, usually represented conjunctions small pieces subgoals,
formalized finding plans achieve subsets subgoals. fact,

arbitrary propositional formulas. Another approach due Haddawy Hanks (1992).
approach, agents goals represented groups candidate goals
associated real number [0, 1] represent degree chances
satisfying goal. plan satisfying candidate goal number 1 full satisfaction
plan satisfying candidate goal number (0, 1) (e.g., 0.5) partial
satisfaction. several differences approach partial entailments.
Firstly, partial entailments, objective formula represented single formula
instead set candidate variations. Secondly, numerical degree satisfaction
introduced partial entailments. Finally, partial entailments, partial satisfaction
relationships come internal structures formulas.
Finally, would mention application scenario discussed partial
entailments reasoning rational agents classical AI planning, e.g. STRIPS.
main reason agents goal beliefs formalized literal sets rather
arbitrary formulas STRIPS planning, main focus paper introduce
notions partial entailments propositional logic general. Nevertheless, since checking
partial entailments restricted antecedent, consequent background
theory literal sets done linear time, interesting apply partial
entailments AI planning. would leave future investigations.

distinguished three different kinds partial entailments (See Table 1) based

partial entailment strong partial entailment respectively. investigated
semantic properties partial entailments (See Table 2). results demonstrate
properties partial entailments difficult captured since many simple inference
rules hold. investigated computational complexity partial entailments

checking strong partial entailment P3 complete, even background theory
empty. indicates although definitions partial entailments look simple,
easy compute them.
showed notions partial entailments serve foundation formalizing partial goal satisfaction reasoning rational agents. Another potential application scenario, mentioned previous work (Zhou, van der Torre, & Zhang, 2008),
goal weakening using strong partial entailment. agent needs modify
goal, choose weakened one strongly partially entails original goal
respect agents belief. strong partial entailment preserves
important parts original goal. However, sophisticated work needed
develop goal weakening framework. Also, mentioned previously, interesting
apply partial entailments AI planning, formulas syntactically restricted
computation task partial entailment may become easier.
Another direction future work lies computing partial entailments. course,
important task develop algorithm directly purpose. However, alternative
