introduce novel logical notionpartial entailmentto propositional logic contrast classical entailment formula p partially entails another formula q
respect background formula set intuitively means circumstance
p true part q true distinguish three different kinds
partial entailments formalize extended notion prime implicant

many simple inference rules study related computational properties
indicate partial entailments relatively difficult computed finally
consider potential application partial entailments reasoning rational agents

introduction
standard propositional logic classical entailment distinguish among formulas
entail another formula example let x z three atoms
neither x z classically entails x however x seems intuitively closer x
z reason x considered union two parts x
x exactly one hand z completely irrelevant x
example motivates us consider notion partial entailment comparison classical entailment partial entailment intends capture partial satisfaction
relationship two formulas respect background theory standard propositional logic formula p entails another formula q respect formula set
intuitively means circumstance p true q true
contrast formula p partially entails another formula q respect formula set
intuitively means circumstance p true part q
true partial entailment widely used everyday life example suppose
student laura wants get score hd subjects mathematics physics
final examination cannot achieve could satisfied
achieve one least better achieving none
let us consider example suppose background formula set empty
objective formula x consider following four formulas x x z x
z clearly none formulas classically entails x however x x z x
entail x regarded part x contrast z irrelevant x thus
one conclude extent x x z x partially satisfy x z

one may observe exists difference x x z partially
satisfying x x z contains atom z irrelevant x
hand x exactly part x words x z contains irrelevancy
namely z partially satisfying x x another observation
x although entails x part x entails contradicts
part x words x side effect namely besides
partially satisfying x
background theory crucial partial entailment example consider z
x suppose background formula set empty case z
partially satisfy x background formula set turns z x z
partially satisfy x since background theory z holds x holds well
observations intuitions formalize notion partial entailment two formulas respect background theory
propositional language moreover distinguish three different kinds partial entailments namely weak partial entailment partial entailment strong partial entailment

simple case
begin define notions partial entailments two formulas respect
background formula set considering rather simple case two

empty
definition let two consistent sets literals
say weakly partially entails
say partially entails
say strongly partially entails
definition simply follows intuitions presented introduction section see
table simple case consistent set literals thus parts
regarded elements subsets recall intuitive sense partial
satisfaction holds parts hold well means
exists part subset clearly precisely captured
exactly definition weak partial entailment simple case
partial entailment forbid side effects partial satisfaction since
consistent set literals side effects regarded complementary
literal elements subsets hence side effects means
mention complementary literal elements subsets clearly
precisely captured set complementary literals

interesting phenomenon relationships partial entailments
classical entailment simple case easy see classically entails
partially entails weakly partially entails means classical
entailment special case weak partial entailment extent however
hold strong partial entailment instance x classically entails x
strongly partially entail x since irrelevancy respect x
first glance seems strange sense term partial
entailment generalization classical entailment however mean
classical entailment prohibits side effects irrelevancies thus intuitive
sense one conclude classical entailment special case weak
partial entailment may mutually different partial entailment strong partial
entailment interestingly later classical entailment indeed prohibits side
effects means classical entailment special case partial entailment well
however classical entailment may allow irrelevancy e g x classically entails x
irrelevancy x hence roughly speaking classical entailment special case

introduced following
definitions partial entailments

discussed section prime implicants p w r represent cases
make p true prime implicants q w r capture idea
part q hence condition means intuitively cases
p true captured prime implicants p w r exists
way achieve q captured prime implicant q w r
former partially satisfies latter reduced simple case definition addition
condition definition ensures exists least one situation intuitive
senses definitions explained similar way
example let background theory x z consider two formulas p
x r q x z x prime implicants p w r
follows x r r z r x notice r prime
implicant p w r although literal even occur p
hand prime implicants q w r follows x z x z notice
x prime implicant q w r since x subset
satisfies q
according definitions p weakly partially entail q w r
since prime implicant r p w r intersection
prime implicants q w r p strongly partially entail
q w r conversely q weakly partially entails p w r whilst
strongly partially entail p w r
note possible relations two formulas w r background
formula set extended notion prime implicant defining
partial entailments use style definition sense require
literal sets p p exists literal set p q two literal
sets satisfy conditions definition respectively recall intuition partial
entailments requires cases p true context
part q true context naturally suggests style definition
definitions partial entailments e definitions part captures
cases achieving p context part associates possibility
achieving q context case p addition condition
item definitions ensures case p partially achieves q w r via
two literal sets
reason choose style definition partial entailments
explained analogously classical entailment note formula p classically entails
another formula q w r background theory iff p w r
model q w r
certainly possible styles including instance
style definition weakest case exists p p
p q although definitions might interesting useful
elsewhere fail capture basic idea partial satisfaction
example consider two formulas x z x former two prime implicants
namely x z latter unique prime implicant namely x
use style definition x z weakly strongly partially entails x however


fia logical study partial entailment

intuitive z achieves x z true irrelevant x
words assignment x z satisfies x z x hence exists case
x z true none parts x true
consider formula x two prime implicants x take
style definition one formula weakly strongly partially entail
obviously intuitive
another feasible direction definitions switch formulas p q instance
switched style definition weakest case p q exists
p p definition corresponding switched
style definitions fail capture basic idea partial satisfaction
recall intuition partial entailments p true context
part q true well context similar classical entailment
naturally suggests order p q definitions partial entailments
switched switched style definition style definition
shown example suitable defining notions partial entailments
understand switched style switched style definitions fail capturing
partial entailments let us consider following example
example consider two formulas x x former two prime implicants
namely x x latter unique prime implicant namely x
take switched style definition x weakly strongly partially entails
x however intuitive x achieves x achieves x
hence exists case x true x false
consider formula x two prime implicants namely x
intuitively formula weakly strongly partially entail however
case apply switched style definition
one fundamental properties relationships among three notions partial
entailments following proposition shows weak partial entailment weaker

underlying intuition partial entailments require real connections
two formulas w r background theory let us take closer look item
definitions basic idea partial entailments prime implicant p w r
exists prime implicant q w r two literal sets satisfy
instance intersection empty words p partially entails q w r
via two literal sets however item exclude case
prime implicant p w r case item still holds however cannot say
p partially entails q w r via two literal sets two literals sets

exist hence require additional item make sure p p
empty
formulas p inconsistent p weakly strongly partially
entail formula q formulas p entailed p weakly strongly
partially entail formula q however reasons two cases different
former reason p p empty see proposition thus p excluded
item definitions latter reason p p see proposition
thus prime implicant p w r intersections prime
implicants say formula p trivial respect background formula set
p p otherwise say p nontrivial respect following
proposition shows trivial formula neither weakly strongly partially entail
formula weakly strongly partially entailed formulas
proposition non triviality let formula set p q two formulas
p trivial w r p q q p assertion holds weak partial
entailment strong partial entailment well
proposition extension classical entailment let formula set p
q two formulas nontrivial w r p q p q p w
q
proposition shows partial entailment extension classical entailment
considering nontrivial formulas weak partial entailment converses hold
simple example x weakly partially entails x x classically entail x
note strong partial entailment classical entailment mutually different
example x classically entails x x strongly partially entail x conversely
x strongly partially entails xy x classically entail xy demonstrated
section reason strong partial entailment prohibits irrelevancy whilst classical
entailment
addition strong partial entailment captures notion part broader sense
words formula p strongly partially entails formula q respect
background formula set p considered part q w r
sense explains classical entailment necessarily imply strong partial
entailment however explanation seems suggest way around
p strongly partially entails q w r e p part q w r q classically
entails p w r fact case example x strongly partially
entails x z x z classically entails x reason
formula may contain disjunctive information restricted simple case
discussed section indeed case given two consistent literal sets
strongly partially entails classically entails

partial goal satisfaction
traditional logic rational agency agents try actions
completely achieve goals successful agents would choose wait
nothing idea usually formalized classical entailment however
case agents perfect action think real world
live situation sometimes useful agents something
towards goals rather waiting actions partially satisfying
agents goal rational candidates partial entailments may serve
logic foundation
example let us consider example suppose laura wants milk cereal
breakfast however three choices available breakfast menu
choice milk offered
choice milk bread offered
choice bread offered
due current information none choices completely satisfies lauras goal

argue circumstance rational agents choose
actions partially achieving goal according belief action
completely achieving goal
important allow actions partially achieving agents goal rational
candidates first rationality performing actions solid since
make goal closer agents nothing better hence choosing
actions useful agents goal reasonable waiting
environment dynamic nature cases agents choose actions
partially achieving goal might lose chance achieve goal forever
frequently happens everyday life cannot seize opportunities
formalize partial achievement actions goals agents belief
notion partial entailments proposed section natural since
partial entailments precisely capture partial satisfaction relations two formulas
respect background theory apply partial entailments formalize partial goal

agents goal antecedent consequences action one obstacle

partially achieves goal belief
example consider example proposed previously formalize example use x
z represent milk cereal bread respectively
lauras belief empty since background knowledge goal represented
x preconditions three actions take three choices respectively
empty well represented postcondition three cases

strongly partially achieves goal whilst take choice partially achieve
goal sense
use simple action theory demonstrate notion partial entailments

fia logical study partial entailment

arises kind partial goal satisfaction rational agents first
glance seems partial entailment appropriate purpose weak partial
entailment may contain side effects acceptable whilst strong partial entailment
strict powerful actions excluded however believe better
leave agent designers one may choose different kinds partial goal satisfaction
different application domains e g strong partial entailment irrelevancies
side effects crucial issues partial entailment side effects unacceptable
irrelevancies weak partial entailment looser cases
worth mentioning partial goal satisfaction proposes one possible solution
dealing situations agents cannot plan completely achieve
goal neither solution necessarily perfectly rational
situations actions achieving parts agents goal may lose chances
achieve parts might unacceptable agents
actions partially achieving agents goal rational candidates
compulsory quite different fact action rational candidate
agents really choose perform partial goal satisfaction explains
rationality actions partially achieving goals particular
action chosen perform among actions partially achieving agents
goal another topic beyond scope
another handling situations explicitly represent agents full
preferences among combinations goals instance example laura may
following full preferences among candidate goals
ilk cereal ilk cereal
represents preference relation lauras original goal e ilk cereal
cannot achieved intends achieve second best candidate goal e ilk
according preference observed partial goal satisfaction
consistent full preference instance preference laura
turns ilk cereal ilk cereal although sharing similarities
two approaches essentially different first full preference requires additional
information partial goal satisfaction moreover expensive represent
full preference agents since number possible combinations goals exponential respect size goals represent full preference requires double
exponential number information last least usually difficult obtain
full preferences agents hence believe full preference
partial goal satisfaction advantages disadvantages
dealing situations perfect actions achieve agents goal
idea partial satisfaction goals discussed elsewhere ai literature
haddawy hanks smith benton van den briel kambhampati
one called partial satisfaction smith et al
partial satisfaction agents plans instead completely achieving goals
partially achieve goals since agents goals ai particularly
strips usually represented conjunctions small pieces subgoals
formalized finding plans achieve subsets subgoals fact

firstly partial entailments objective formula represented single formula

introduced partial entailments finally partial entailments partial satisfaction

entailments reasoning rational agents classical ai e g strips
main reason agents goal beliefs formalized literal sets rather

concluding remarks
introduced logical notionpartial entailmentto propositional logic
distinguished three different kinds partial entailments see table
notion prime implicant weakest strongest weak partial entailment
partial entailment strong partial entailment respectively investigated
semantic properties partial entailments see table demonstrate
properties partial entailments difficult captured since many simple inference
rules hold investigated computational complexity partial entailments

checking strong partial entailment p complete even background theory
empty indicates although definitions partial entailments look simple
easy compute
showed notions partial entailments serve foundation formalizing partial goal satisfaction reasoning rational agents another potential application scenario mentioned previous work zhou van der torre zhang
goal weakening strong partial entailment agent needs modify
goal choose weakened one strongly partially entails original goal
respect agents belief strong partial entailment preserves
important parts original goal however sophisticated work needed
develop goal weakening framework mentioned previously interesting
apply partial entailments ai formulas syntactically restricted
computation task partial entailment may become easier
another direction future work lies computing partial entailments course
important task develop directly purpose however alternative
