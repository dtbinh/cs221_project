gsat

gsat random greedy hill climbing procedure gsat deals formulae conjunct

ive normal form cnf formula cnf iff conjunction clauses
clause disjunction literals gsat starts randomly generated truth assignment
hill climbs ipping variable assignment gives largest increase
number clauses satisfied called score given choice
several equally good ips gsat picks one random ip increase score
variable ipped change score failing decreases
score least thus gsat starts random part search space searches
global solution local information despite simplicity procedure
shown give good performance hard satisfiability selman et al
procedure gsat
max tries
random truth assignment
j max ips
satisfies return
else poss ips set vars increase satisfiability
v random element poss ips
v truth assignment ipped
end
end
return

able perform experiments need source
run ideally come probability distribution
well defined properties contain simple parameters representative
occur real situations unfortunately often dicult meet
criteria practice one usually forced accept well defined
distribution simple parameters benchmark set real necessarily
unknown distribution experiments adopt former
use cnf formulae randomly generated according random k sat model

levesque larrabee tsuji crawford auton lower l

focus much recent experimental effort

gsat search

gsat first introduced noted search try divided two
phases first phase try ip increases score however phase
relatively short followed second phase ips increase
score instead sideways moves leave number clauses satisfied
phase search plateau occasional ip increase score
one aims improve upon informal observations making
quantitative measurements gsat search measurements make
several experimentally testable predictions
informal observations effect made bart selman presentation selman et al
aaai observations enlarged upon gent walsh

experiments followed three methodological principles mcgeoch
first performed experiments large sizes many repetitions reduce
variance allow emergent properties second sought good views data
looked features performance meaningful predictable
possible third analysed closely suitable analysis data may
features clear simple presentation rest
principles enabled us make detailed conjectures gsat search
many features gsat search space graphically illustrated plotting
vary try obvious feature plot score number satisfied
clauses quest good view gsat search space decided plot poss ips ip number equally good ips gsat randomly
