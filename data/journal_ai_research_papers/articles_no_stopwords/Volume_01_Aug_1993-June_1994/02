1. Introduction

Mathematicians increasingly recognizing usefulness experiments computers
help advance mathematical theory. surprising therefore one area mathematics
benefitted little empirical results theory algorithms, especially
used AI. Since objects theory abstract descriptions computer programs,
principle able reason programs entirely deductively. However,
theoretical analysis often complex current mathematical tools.

procedures fully considerable practical interest since SAT is, many ways,

2. GSAT

GSAT random greedy hill-climbing procedure. GSAT deals formulae conjunct-

ive normal form (CNF); formula, CNF iff conjunction clauses,
clause disjunction literals. GSAT starts randomly generated truth assignment,
hill-climbs \ ipping" variable assignment gives largest increase
number clauses satisfied (called \score" on). Given choice
several equally good ips, GSAT picks one random. ip increase score,
variable ipped change score (failing that) decreases
score least. Thus GSAT starts random part search space searches
global solution using local information. Despite simplicity, procedure
shown give good performance hard satisfiability problems (Selman et al., 1992).

3. Problem Space
able perform experiments algorithm, need source problems
run algorithm. Ideally problems come probability distribution
well-defined properties, contain simple parameters representative
problems occur real situations. Unfortunately, often dicult meet
criteria. practice, one usually forced accept either problems well-defined
distribution simple parameters benchmark set real problems, necessarily
unknown distribution. experiments adopt former approach
use CNF formulae randomly generated according random k-SAT model.
Problems random k-SAT N variables L clauses generated follows:
random subset size k N variables selected clause, variable made positive negative probability 21 . random 3-SAT, phase
transition satisfiable unsatisfiable L approximately 4.3N (Mitchell, Selman,
& Levesque, 1992; Larrabee & Tsuji, 1992; Crawford & Auton, 1993). lower L,
problems generated under-constrained thus satisfiable; higher L, problems generated over-constrained thus unsatisfiable. many NP-complete
problems, problems phase transition typically much dicult solve
problems away transition (Cheeseman, Kanefsky, & Taylor, 1991). region
L=4.3N thus generally considered good source hard SAT problems
focus much recent experimental effort.

4. GSAT's search

GSAT first introduced, noted search try divided two
phases. first phase try, ip increases score. However, phase
relatively short followed second phase ips increase
score, instead sideways moves leave number clauses satisfied.
phase search \plateau" occasional ip increase score.1
One aims paper improve upon informal observations making
quantitative measurements GSAT's search, using measurements make
several experimentally testable predictions.
