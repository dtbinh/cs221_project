given network prices link cheapest cargo movement corresponds
shortest path graph distances equated prices thus given
link shipper would prefer ship entire quota link shortest path

shortest path taking difference shortest path distance networks
link j distance set zero infinity respectively
incrementally changing bids shipper consider outstanding bids
current prices value reserving capacity particular link zero
cannot get service links path similarly already committed
shipping cargo parallel path gain obtaining capacity even
lower price withdraws bids therefore actual demand policy

walras successfully computes competitive equilibrium example
case basic shipper model corresponds user equilibrium ue
transportation network ue example network shipper sends units
cargo shared link remaining cargo direct link
location destination allocation inecient total cost resource
even shipper could simultaneously update bids markets would good idea
competitive shipper would send cargo least costly path neglecting possibility
demand may increase prices longer cheapest outstanding bids provide
sensitivity effect functions price cannot respond changes
many prices thus policy updating bids simultaneously lead perpetual
oscillation example network considered unique competitive equilibrium
shipper splitting cargo two different paths policies allocating cargo one path never
lead hence convergence competitive equilibrium depends incrementality
