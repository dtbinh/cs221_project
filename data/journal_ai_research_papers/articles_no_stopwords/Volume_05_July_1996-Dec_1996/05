associates passing intersection target lane however private goal
recognition techniques suitable discovering agent intentions worth
however harder discern short term external evidence
agents declare phase worths used baseline
utility calculation thus affect negotiation outcome concerned
analyzing worth declaration strategies agents might adopt increase utility
introduce two mechanisms one strict tolerant analyze affects

eciency agents squander resources come agree

ment wasted utility agreement reached example
makes sense agreements satisfy requirement pareto optimality
agent could derive different agreement without agent
deriving less alternate agreement another consideration might global
optimality achieved sum agents benefits maximized
global optimality implies pareto optimality vice versa since speaking self motivated agents care utilities sum
system wide utilities agent general would willing accept lower utility
increase system sum pareto optimality plays primary role eciency
evaluation among pareto optimal solutions however might consider
secondary criterion solutions increase sum system wide utilities
stability agent incentive deviate agreed upon strategies
strategy agents adopt proposed part interaction environment
design strategies proposed however want individual
designers e g companies incentive go back build agents
different manipulative strategies
simplicity desirable overall interaction environment make low
computational demands agents require little communication overhead
related eciency stability interaction mechanism
simple increases eciency system fewer resources used carrying
negotiation similarly stable mechanisms resources need
spent outguessing opponent trying discover optimal choices
optimal behavior publicly revealed nothing better
carry
distribution preferably interaction rules require central decision
maker obvious reasons want distributed system
performance bottleneck collapse due single failure special node
symmetry may want agents play different roles interaction scenario simplifies overall mechanism removes question agent
play role interaction gets way

attributes need universally accepted fact sometimes tradeoffs one attribute another example eciency stability sometimes
con ict one another see section protocols designed specific
classes domains satisfy attributes ultimately
kinds criteria rate acceptability one interaction mechanism another
one example attribute stability assumes particular importance consider open systems agents constantly entering leaving community
interacting machines might want maintain stability face agents
bring goals potentially strategies well mechanism
self perpetuating benefit society whole follow
rules benefit individual member social behavior remains

side effects encounters
kinds encounters among agents types domains possible previous work zlotkin rosenschein b examined task oriented
domains tods encompass certain kinds encounters among agents state
oriented domains sods describe larger class scenarios multiagent encounters
tods fact see set task oriented domains actually
proper subset state oriented domains classical domains artificial intelligence
instances state oriented domains
main attribute general sods agents actions side effects task
oriented domains side effects exist general common resources unrestricted
thus agent achieves set tasks tod positive negative
effects agent whatsoever hinder agent achieving
goal never satisfies agent goals accident enable another agent
carry task example postmen domain zlotkin rosenschein
necessary explicitly declare existence letter hand
delivered absence side effects rules positive negative
interactions among agent goals positive interactions remain
explicitly coordinated agents
general state oriented domains side effects exist agents unintentionally
achieve one another goals thus benefit one another actions ip side
side effects however negative interactions goals exist thus
sod domain unlike tods necessarily cooperative action
side effects sods agents deal goal con ict interference well
possibility unintended cooperation

classic ai notion goal achievement means carry sequence actions
plan transformation environment state goal

imagine example person interested getting work goal
work current state work plan sequence actions
get work driving car calling taxi walking riding bicycle
final goal state may differ depending plan executed e g
car bicycle states work however satisfy goal
let assume optimal plan time point view involves driving car
work

goal may given situation fact true e goal satisfied
acceptable state oriented domain goal described set states

imagine person wife interested place work
states satisfy husband wife goals plans
achieve state e g one takes car calls taxi however
certain plans suitable spouse isolation cannot
coexist example husband taking car perfectly good plan optimal
alone world similarly wife taking car good plan optimal
alone together another plan may suitable husband drives wife
work continues car work case extra work required
husband point view wife present world certain burden
coordination
example agents carry sequence activities suitably synchronized reach goal state satisfying husband wife enter car
husband drives particular location wife exits environment primitive operations agent alone operations
combined coherent sequence actions specifying agents
order done say agents executing joint plan
joint plan general transforms world initial state goal state satisfying
agents possible plan transforms world initial state
husband wife home goal state satisfying agents
wife work car husband place work final state
one many goal states
task oriented domains cost coordinated plan need never worse
stand alone plan worst agent achieves set tasks

assumptions

throughout making number simplifying assumptions enable
us lay foundation theory mechanism design automated agents
present assumptions









expected utility maximizer designers design agents maximize expected utility example assume designer build agent prefer
chance getting rather sure
isolated negotiation agent cannot commit part current negotiation behavior future negotiation expect current
behavior way affect future negotiation similarly agent cannot expect
others behave particular way previous interaction history
act differently past behavior negotiation stands
alone
interagent comparison utility designers means transforming
utilities held different agents common utility units
symmetric abilities agents able perform set operations
world cost operation independent agent carrying
binding commitments designers design agents keep explicit public
commitments assume nothing relationship private preferences
public behavior public commitment followed public performance
commitment monitored necessary enforced
explicit utility transfer although agents compare respective utilities way explicitly transferring utility units one
example money used compensate one agent
disadvantageous agreement utility transfer occur however implicitly
implicit transfer utility forms basis agreement among agents

blocks appropriately first agent put black white block
completing plan agents worths satisfy min sum conditions meaning

equal reach agreement gives positive utility
worth baseline evaluating utility
example let say agent assigned worth achieving goal
agent assigned worth achieving goal since one role best joint plan
costs costs one unit utility shared agents

agents done case one deal negotiation set
gives agents expected utility namely mixed joint plan

interesting phenomenon note deal agents apparently
symmetric situation apart internal attitude towards achieving goals

equilibrium

strategies equilibrium different notions equilibrium
game theory literature
three levels equilibrium commonly used game theory nash equilibrium
perfect equilibrium dominant equilibrium binmore rasmusen level
equilibrium enumerated stronger previous one two strategies
nash equilibrium assuming one agent agent cannot better
strategy vice versa perfect equilibrium means
game multiple steps one player exists state game
player better sticking strategy exist
situations strategies might nash equilibrium perfect equilibrium
case although strategy best start game game unfolds
would better diverge dominant strategy equilibrium means matter
strategy opponent chooses cannot better play strategy strategies
