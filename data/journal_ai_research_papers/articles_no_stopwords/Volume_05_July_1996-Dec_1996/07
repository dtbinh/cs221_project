characterizing decomposable

purpose characterization decomposable equivalently chordal
graphs terms properties independence relationships carried
adding single property set axioms c c characterizing dependency
isomorphic undirected graphs
let us consider following axiom
c strong chordality
jz ju nf g jz jz u z

u n fff g

axiom establishes condition allows us reduce size conditioning
set separating two variables namely two variables set
conditionally independent going demonstrate adding axiom strong
chordality axioms found pearl paz c c associated graph necessarily
becomes chordal graph vice versa therefore shall obtain characterization
decomposable pearl proposed axiom slightly different c
necessary though sucient condition chordality called axiom chordality
c chordality
j jff j j u
observe context e assuming c c hold c implies c
fij jff strong union c guarantees ju n f g
implied jw w u nf g particular w fff g applying
c z obtain j j however set axioms c c
c constitute characterization chordal graphs graph depicted figure
b shows graph chordal satisfies c c c c instead
c shall obtain desired

theorem dependency model isomorphic chordal graph
satisfies axioms c c

proof first let us prove sucient condition pearl paz c

c deduce isomorphic associated graph g therefore independence
equivalent separation g prove g chordal
let us suppose g chordal g cycle tn tn n
without chord e j j n edges ti tj belong em
except edge tn


ficharacterizations decomposable dependency

let us consider nodes tn set nodes z u n ft tn g first
going prove independence statement tn jz tn
true tn jz tn could chain linking tn
containing nodes z tn e chain linking tn containing nodes
ft tn g case would edge linking node tj
j n contradicts assumption cycle chord therefore
tn jz tn
hand nodes tn connected edge
cycle chord separated u nft tn g therefore
tn ju nft tn g c deduce tn jz tn jz
tn case chain linking tn blocked separating
set first case chain tn tn second case tn tn
therefore obtain contradiction hence graph g chordal
let us prove necessary condition pearl paz
isomorphic graph g properties c c hold
let us suppose c hold nodes subset
nodes z jz ju n f g jz jz
jz deduce chain fft tn exists g ti z
e ft tng z however fijz know every chain
linking must contain node z particular previously
found chain ft tn g z therefore node tk
tk let us consider node tk jz transitivity c
obtain tk jz tk jz first independence assertion
cannot true chain fft tk tk contain node z
therefore tk jz tk jz transitivity
would obtain tk jz jz statements false first
one existence chain fft tk tk second one
hypothesis tk jz reasoning allows us assert
fijz tk fijz found node tk adjacent tk
satisfying properties completely analogous reasoning applied node tk
proves tk tk jz tk tk jz tk tk jz
replaced nodes two nodes adjacent satisfying properties note
case one tk tk matter
subsequent argument
tk tk jz tk tk jz deduce
chain tk sm tk g si z node sh sh
simplify notation let us call tk sm tk assume j
j h edge linking si sj case
simply replace subchain si si sj sj single edge si sj e consider
shortest subchain tk sh reason suppose
p q h p q edge linking sp sq
found cycle sh sh sm sm g let sf sg two
nodes satisfying f h g sf sg adjacent adjacent sj
j f j g j h note two nodes starting
f g still cycle sf sh sh sg length four


fide campos

according hypothesis cycle must chord however taking
account cycle constructed possible chords edge
edge linking node si f h node sp h p g first possibility
contradicts hypothesis ju nf g second one implies existence
chain tk sf si sp sg sm tk linking tk tk contain
node z contradiction statement tk tk jz therefore
property c true
establish another interesting characterization chordal graphs adding
one axiom pearl paz axiom following
c clique separability
ju n fff g w u n fff g jw jw j
ju n f g w u
axiom c asserts whenever two nodes adjacent independent
separating set whose nodes adjacent e complete
separating set

theorem dependency model isomorphic chordal graph
satisfies axioms c c c

proof let us prove necessary condition graph g associated chordal

theorem know properties c c c hold
let us suppose c hold ju n
fff fig w u n fff fig fijw jw j w
ju n f g
let w separating set minimal size e jw js
w know least one separating set type exist
fiju n fff fig holds deduce jw j w
ju n f g let us define z w n f g thus jz
ju n f g applying c obtain jz jz e
fijw n fg fijw n f g contradicts minimality w therefore
c true
prove sucient condition let us suppose g chordal
cycle tn tn n without chord nodes tn adjacent
hence separated let w separating set tn e satisfying
tn jw tn w ft tn g w otherwise could chain
linking tn would blocked w thus contradicting tn jw
every separating set w contains tn ti n hence jw j
applying c deduce tn tiju n ftn ti g e tn ti adjacent nodes
contradicts assumption cycle chord conclusion
graph chordal


ficharacterizations decomposable dependency

relationships characterizations decomposable
characterization decomposable lauritzen quite related
undirected graph chordal every subset nodes separates
two nodes minimal complete
order rewrite notation let us consider following axiom
c completeness
jz js z jz j ju n f g z
u z u n fff fig
axiom c says exactly minimal separator complete
equivalent formulation axiom reads separator complete
cannot minimal symbols
c completeness
jz ju nf g w z jw

u z u n fff g

lauritzen reformulated follows dependency model
isomorphic chordal graph satisfies axioms c c c
c
note similarity c c c c taking account
theorems deduce axioms c c c c equivalent
among assuming c c hold however equivalence evident
spite similarities among axioms clear c implies c c implies c
opposite implications obvious fact strong chordality clique separability
seem stronger weaker respectively completeness becomes clearer
express axioms following way assuming two nodes separated

completeness c c separator minimal complete
equivalently separator complete proper subset
still separator
clique separability c exists separator complete
strong chordality c separator complete proper
subset still separator moreover subset
removing initial separator one nodes causing incompleteness

observe c c share antecedent consequent c
says exists separator whereas consequent c gives information
identity separator note c c assert existence
complete separator c requires previous condition minimality c
existence pointed reviewer

concluding remarks
found two characterizations class decomposable dependency
terms properties independence relationships believe
theoretically interesting provide perspective important well
studied class graphical moreover quite concise since one
property added set properties characterizing independence relationships
undirected graphs could useful proving
sort
practical point view axiomatic characterizations create desiderata
could drive automated construction chordal graphs data already
commented practical use graphical particularly bayesian networks requires dag representing model transformed chordal graph
perspective learning data may interesting estimate directly
chordal graph available data instead first learning dag converting chordal graph believe basic independence properties chordal
graphs identified theoretical study c c could guide us design efficient learning chordal graphs known learning
bayesian networks data computationally complex example spirtes glymour scheines start complete undirected graph
try remove edges testing conditional independence linked nodes
conditioning sets small possible thus reducing complexity increasing
reliability context rewrite property c following way

fijz fijz fijz ju n f g
could use rule simultaneously allows us remove edge
current graph fix edge true edge graph
similarly property c could give rise following rule trying remove
edge current graph testing conditional independence statements
fijw discard candidate separating sets sets w whose nodes
adjacent
topic designing ecient learning chordal graphs object
future
