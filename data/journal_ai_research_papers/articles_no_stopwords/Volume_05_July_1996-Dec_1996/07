Abstract

Decomposable dependency models possess number interesting useful properties. paper presents new characterizations decomposable models terms independence relationships, obtained adding single axiom well-known
set characterizing dependency models isomorphic undirected graphs.
brie discuss potential application results problem learning graphical
models data.

1. Introduction

Graphical models knowledge representation tools commonly used increasing number researchers, particularly Artificial Intelligence Statistics communities.

independence relationships, proved crucial ecient management
storage information (Pearl, 1988).
different kinds graphical models, although particularly interested
undirected directed graphs (which, probabilistic context, usually called
Markov networks Bayesian networks, respectively). one merits
shortcomings, neither two representations expressive power
other: independence relationships represented means directed
graphs (using d-separation criterion) cannot represented using undirected ones
(through separation criterion), reciprocally. However, class models
represented means directed undirected graphs, precisely
class decomposable models (Haberman, 1974; Pearl, 1988). Decomposable models
possess important properties, relative factorization parameter estimation,
make quite useful. So, models studied characterized many
different ways (Beeri, Fagin, Maier, & Yannakakis, 1983; Haberman, 1974; Lauritzen, Speed,
& Vijayan, 1984; Pearl, 1988; Wermuth & Lauritzen, 1983; Whittaker, 1991). example,
decomposable models characterized kind dependency models isomorphic
chordal graphs (Lauritzen et al., 1984; Whittaker, 1991).
However, know characterization decomposable models terms

obtain characterization decomposable models.
approach problem based identifying set properties axioms
collection independence relationships must satisfy, order representable

dependency models: Pearl Paz (1985) identified set properties characterizing
models isomorphic undirected graphs, de Campos (1996) determined axioms
characterize models isomorphic undirected directed singly connected graphs
(i.e., trees polytrees, respectively).
rest paper organized follows. Section 2 brie describe several
concepts basic subsequent development. Section 3 introduces decomposable
models representation using chordal graphs. Section 4 prove two characterizations decomposable models. characterizations turn surprisingly
simple: add single property set axioms characterizing dependency
models isomorphic undirected graphs. Section 5 discusses relationships
results Lauritzen's characterization chordal graphs. Finally, Section 6 contains
concluding remarks proposals future work, include application
results developed problem learning graphical models data.

2. Preliminaries

results used throughout paper.
Dependency Model (Pearl, 1988) pair = (U; ), U finite set elements variables, (:; :j:) rule assigns truth values three place predicate
whose arguments disjoint subsets U . Single elements U denoted standard
Greek lowercase letters, whereas subsets U represented capital letters.
interpretation conditional independence assertion (X; jZ ) observed
Z , additional information X could obtained observing . example, probabilistic model (Dawid, 1979; Lauritzen, Dawid, Larsen, & Leimer, 1990),
(X; jZ ) holds

P (xjz; y) = P (xjz) whenever P (z; y) > 0;
every instantiation x, z sets variables X , Z . However, dependency
models applicable many situations far beyond probabilistic models (de Campos, 1995;
Pearl, 1988; Shenoy, 1992).
graphical representation dependency model = (U; ) direct correspondence
elements U set nodes given graph, G, topology
G ects properties . topological property selected represent independence
assertions depends type graph use: separation undirected graphs dseparation (Pearl, 1988; Verma & Pearl, 1990) directed acyclic graphs (dags):

Separation: Given undirected graph G, two subsets nodes, X , said
separated set nodes Z , denoted hX; jZ iG , Z intercepts
chains nodes X .

d-separation: Given dag G, chain C (a chain directed graph sequence

class dependency models isomorphic undirected graphs completely

independence relationships within model:

(C2) Decomposition:
(I (X; [ W jZ ) ) (X; jZ )) 8X; Y; W; Z U:
(C3) Strong Union:

3. Decomposable Models Chordal Graphs

several ways defining decomposable models. appropriate
interests, mainly lie graphical modelling, based graph-theoretic concept:
chordal graphs, called triangulated graphs (Rose, 1970).

Definition 1 undirected graph said chordal every cycle length four

4. Characterizing Decomposable Models

purpose find characterization decomposable models (or equivalently, chordal
graphs) terms properties independence relationships. carried
adding single property set axioms, C1{C5, characterizing dependency models
isomorphic undirected graphs.
Let us consider following axiom:
(C6) Strong Chordality:
(I (ff; jZ [ [ ) ( ; jU nf ; g) ) (ff; jZ [ ) (ff; jZ [ )) 8ff; fi; ; 2 U 8Z

U n fff; fi; ; g:

axiom establishes condition allows us reduce size conditioning
set separating two variables , namely two variables set
conditionally independent. going demonstrate adding axiom strong
chordality axioms found Pearl Paz, C1{C5, associated graph necessarily
becomes chordal graph vice versa. Therefore, shall obtain characterization
decomposable models. Pearl (1988) proposed axiom slightly different C6,
necessary, though sucient condition chordality. called axiom chordality:
(C7) Chordality:
(I (ff; j [ ) ( ; jff [ ) ) (ff; j ) (ff; j )) 8ff; fi; ; 2 U:
Observe context, i.e., assuming C1{C5 hold, C6 implies C7:
(ff; fij [ ) ( ; jff [ ), strong union (C3) guarantees ( ; jU n f ; g)
implied ( ; jW ) W U nf ; g (in particular W = fff; g), applying
C6 Z = ;, obtain (ff; j ) (ff; j ). However, set axioms C1{C5
C7 constitute characterization chordal graphs, graph depicted Figure
1 (b) shows: graph chordal, satisfies C1{C5 C7. using C6 instead
C7 shall obtain desired result.

Theorem 2 dependency model isomorphic chordal graph if, if,
satisfies axioms C1{C6.

Proof: First, let us prove sucient condition. Using Pearl Paz result, C1{

C5 deduce isomorphic associated graph G, therefore independence
equivalent separation G. prove G chordal.
Let us suppose G chordal. Then, G, cycle t1 t2 : : :tn,1 tn t1 , n 4,
without chord, i.e., 8i; j s.t. 1 < + 1 < j n, edges ti {tj belong EM
(except edge t1 {tn ).
294

fiCharacterizations Decomposable Dependency Models

Let us consider nodes t1 tn,1 , set nodes Z = U n ft1 ; : : :; tn g. First,
going prove independence statement (t1; tn,1 jZ [ t2 [ tn )
true: :I (t1 ; tn,1 jZ [ t2 [ tn ) could find chain linking t1 tn,1
containing nodes Z [ t2 [ tn , i.e., chain linking t1 tn,1 containing nodes
ft3 ; : : :; tn,2 g; case would edge linking t1 node tj ,
3 j n , 2, contradicts assumption cycle chord. Therefore,
(t1; tn,1 jZ [ t2 [ tn ).
hand, nodes t2 tn connected edge (once
cycle chord), separated U nft2 ; tn g, therefore
(t2 ; tn jU nft2 ; tn g). Now, using C6, deduce either (t1; tn,1 jZ [ t2 ) (t1; tn,1 jZ [
tn ). either case chain linking t1 tn,1 blocked separating
set: first case chain t1 tn tn,1 , second case t1 t2 : : :tn,2 tn,1 .
Therefore, obtain contradiction, hence graph G chordal.
Now, let us prove necessary condition. using Pearl Paz's result,
isomorphic graph G, properties C1{C5 hold.
Let us suppose C6 hold. Then, find nodes ff; fi; ; subset
nodes Z (ff; jZ [ [ ), ( ; jU n f ; g), :I (ff; jZ [ ) :I (ff; jZ [ ).
:I (ff; jZ [ ) deduce chain fft1 : : :tn exists G, ti 62 Z [
8i, i.e., ft1 : : :tng \ (Z [ ) = ;. However, (ff; fijZ [ [ ) know every chain
linking must contain node Z [ [ . particular, previously
found chain, ft1 : : :tn g \ (Z [ [ ) 6= ;. Therefore, node tk
tk = . Let us consider node tk,1 : (ff; jZ [ [ ) transitivity (C5),
obtain (ff; tk,1jZ [ [ ) (tk,1 ; jZ [ [ ). first independence assertion
cannot true, chain fft1 : : :tk,2 tk,1 contain node Z [ [ .
Therefore, (tk,1 ; jZ [ [ ). (tk,1 ; jZ [ ), then, transitivity,
would obtain (ff; tk,1jZ [ ) (ff; jZ [ ), statements false, first
one existence chain fft1 : : :tk,2 tk,1 second one
hypothesis. So, :I (tk,1 ; jZ [ ). reasoning allows us assert
:I (ff; fijZ [ ) :I (tk,1; fijZ [ ). So, found node tk,1 adjacent = tk
satisfying properties ff. completely analogous reasoning applied node tk+1
proves (tk,1 ; tk+1 jZ [ [ ), :I (tk,1 ; tk+1 jZ [ ), :I (tk,1 ; tk+1 jZ [ ). So,
replaced nodes two nodes adjacent satisfying properties. Note
case one tk,1 tk+1 matter
subsequent argument.
Now, :I (tk,1 ; tk+1 jZ [ ) (tk,1 ; tk+1 jZ [ [ ) deduce
chain tk,1 s1 : : :sm tk+1 G si 62 Z [ 8i node sh , sh = .
simplify notation, let us call s0 = tk,1 , sm+1 = tk+1 . assume 8i; j
0 < + 1 < j h, edge linking si sj (if case,
simply replace subchain si si+1 : : :sj ,1 sj single edge si {sj , i.e., consider
shortest subchain tk,1 sh ). reason, suppose
8p; q h < p + 1 < q + 1, edge linking sp sq .
found cycle s0 s1 : : :sh,1 sh+1 : : :sm sm+1 G. Now, let sf sg two
nodes satisfying f < h < g , sf sg adjacent adjacent sj
j s.t. f < j < g j 6= h (note always find two nodes, starting
f = 0 g = + 1). still cycle sf : : :sh,1 sh+1 : : :sg length four more,

that, according hypothesis, cycle must chord. However, taking
account cycle constructed, possible chords edge {
edge linking node si , f < < h, node sp , h < p < g . first possibility
contradicts hypothesis ( ; jU nf ; g), second one implies existence
chain tk,1 s1 : : :sf : : :si sp : : :sg : : :sm tk+1 linking tk,1 tk+1 , contain
node Z [ [ , contradiction statement (tk,1 ; tk+1 jZ [ [ ). Therefore,
property C6 true.
establish another interesting characterization chordal graphs, adding
one axiom Pearl Paz. new axiom following:
(C8) Clique-separability:
(I (ff; jU n fff; g) ) 9W U n fff; g (ff; jW ) either jW j 1
:I ( ; jU n f ; g) 8 ; 2 W ) 8ff; 2 U .
Axiom C8 asserts whenever two nodes adjacent (are independent),
find separating set whose nodes adjacent other, i.e., complete
separating set.

Theorem 3 dependency model isomorphic chordal graph if, if,
satisfies axioms C1{C5 C8.

Proof: Let us prove necessary condition. graph G associated chordal,

Theorem 2 know properties C1{C5 C6 hold.
Let us suppose C8 hold. Then, , (ff; jU n
fff; fig) W U n fff; fig either :I (ff; fijW ), jW j > 1 9 ; 2 W
( ; jU n f ; g).
Let W0 separating set minimal size , i.e., (ff; jW0) :I (ff; jS )
8S W0 (we know least one separating set type exist,
(ff; fijU n fff; fig) holds). Then, deduce jW0j > 1 9 ; 2 W0
( ; jU n f ; g). Let us define Z = W0 n f ; g. Thus, (ff; jZ [ [ )
( ; jU n f ; g) and, applying C6, obtain either (ff; jZ [ ) (ff; jZ [ ), i.e.,
(ff; fijW0 n fg) (ff; fijW0 n f g), contradicts minimality W0 . Therefore,
C8 true.
prove sucient condition, let us suppose G chordal. Then,
cycle t1 t2 : : :tn,1 tn t1 , n 4, without chord. So, nodes t1 tn,1 adjacent,
hence separated, let W separating set t1 tn,1 , i.e., satisfying
(t1; tn,1 jW ). tn 2 W ft2; : : :; tn,2 g \ W 6= ;, otherwise could find chain
linking t1 tn,1 would blocked W , thus contradicting (t1 ; tn,1 jW ).
So, every separating set W contains tn ti ; 2 n , 2, hence jW j > 1. Now,
applying C8, deduce :I (tn ; tijU n ftn ; ti g), i.e., tn ti adjacent nodes,
contradicts assumption cycle chord. Then, conclusion
graph chordal.

5. Relationships Characterizations Decomposable Models
characterization decomposable models1 (Lauritzen, 1989) quite related
ours: undirected graph chordal if, if, every subset nodes separates
two nodes minimal complete.
order rewrite result using notation, let us consider following axiom:
(C9) Completeness:
(I (ff; jZ ) :I (ff; jS ) 8S Z ) jZ j 1 :I ( ; jU n f ; g) 8 ; 2 Z ) 8ff; 2
U 8Z U n fff; fig.
Axiom C9 says exactly minimal separator complete.
equivalent formulation axiom reads: separator complete
cannot minimal. symbols:
(C9') Completeness:
(I (ff; jZ [ [ ) ( ; jU nf ; g) ) 9W Z [ [ (ff; jW )) 8ff; fi; ; 2

U 8Z U n fff; fi; ; g:

Then, Lauritzen's result reformulated follows: dependency model
isomorphic chordal graph if, if, satisfies axioms C1{C5 either C9
C9'.
Note similarity C9 C8 C9' C6. Taking account
Theorems 2 3, deduce axioms, C6, C8, C9 C9', equivalent
among (assuming C1{C5 hold). However, equivalence evident,
spite similarities among axioms: clear C6 implies C9' C9 implies C8,
opposite implications obvious. fact, strong chordality clique-separability
seem stronger weaker, respectively, completeness. becomes clearer
express axioms following way: Assuming two nodes separated:

Completeness (C9 C9'): separator minimal, complete;
or, equivalently, separator complete, proper subset
still separator .
Clique-separability (C8): exists separator complete.
Strong chordality (C6): separator complete, proper
subset still separator ; moreover, find subset
removing, initial separator, one nodes causing incompleteness.

Observe C6 C9' share antecedent, consequent C9'
says exists separator, whereas consequent C6 gives information
identity separator. Note C8 C9 assert existence
complete separator, C9 requires previous condition (minimality) C8 not.

6. Concluding Remarks
found two new characterizations class decomposable dependency models,
terms properties independence relationships. believe results
theoretically interesting, provide new perspective important well
studied class graphical models. Moreover, results quite concise, since one
property added set properties characterizing independence relationships
undirected graphs. could useful proving results models
sort.
practical point view, axiomatic characterizations create desiderata
could drive automated construction chordal graphs data. already
commented, practical use graphical models and, particularly, bayesian networks, requires dag representing model transformed chordal graph.
perspective learning models data, may interesting estimate directly
chordal graph available data, instead first learning dag converting chordal graph. believe basic independence properties chordal
graphs identified theoretical study, C6 C8, could guide us design efficient algorithms learning chordal graphs. known problem learning
bayesian networks data computationally complex. example, algorithms (Spirtes, Glymour, & Scheines, 1993) start complete undirected graph,
try remove edges testing conditional independence linked nodes,
using conditioning sets small possible (thus reducing complexity increasing
reliability). context, rewrite property C6 following way:

:I (ff; fijZ [ ) :I (ff; fijZ [ ) (ff; fijZ [ [ ) ) :I ( ; jU n f ; g);
could use rule simultaneously allows us remove edge ff{fi
current graph, fix edge { true edge graph.
Similarly, property C8 could give rise following rule: trying remove
edge ff{fi current graph, testing conditional independence statements
(ff; fijW ), discard candidate separating sets sets W whose nodes
adjacent other.
