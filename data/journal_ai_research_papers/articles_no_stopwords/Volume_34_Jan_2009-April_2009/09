machine learning approaches able partly circumvent restrictions imposed

existing approaches fall within area supervised learning e training data need

lead degraded performance unfamiliar circumstances moreover features used

novel pleonastic identification system proposed unlike precursors
system classifies extrapositions submitting queries web analyzing returned

composition makes difficult apply web components
proposed system simple effectiveness independent type text
processed shown generalization tests system maintains precision
recall degrades small margin confronted unfamiliar texts
indication general principles behind system fitted text
derived overall evaluated wsj news articles
considered difficult type nonfiction system capable producing
par slightly inferior casually trained humans
systems success important implications beyond particular
pleonastic identification first shows web used answer linguistic questions upon simplistic semantic relationships second
comparative study effective means get highly accurate web despite fact noisier manually compiled corpora addition success
simple guidelines used identifying clefts may serve evidence speakers
intention heavily reflected surface structures utterance bid
make distinguishable similarly constructed sentences
left unaddressed current study notably handling
complex noun phrases prepositional phrases generally speaking
query instantiation somewhat crude solve noun phrase issue finer grained query
downgrading proposed viz first supply query original noun phrase
head noun finally adjective modifies head noun one
effectiveness determined discussed section special
rule used verb take however may open door exception
processing contradicts principle system provide unified
pleonastic pronoun identification overall much data experiments
needed query instantiation procedures finalized
aside two sets patterns currently use information
used assess validity possible extraposition example extrapositions
matrix verbs much likely remain present tense past tense
noun phrases matrix object position likely indefinite
extraposed clauses generally longer matrix verb phrases fuzzy
decision system multiple input variables could possibly provide significant performance
gains
although system able yield reasonable performances output

another concern syntactic processing component used system limited
limitation caused designers lack exposure large variety different
constructs essentially different imposed limited number
patterns previous systems eventually proposed system limitation
eliminated illustrate current design able correctly process sentences
difference make buy however takes minor effort correct
upgrading subsystem recognizes pre posed objects upgrade
may performed manually even automatically machine learning
approaches solves one syntactic moves system closer able
recognize grammatically valid constructs contrast take considerably
effort patch rigidly defined rules upgrade word lists rule
systems achieve comparable performances
writing article google deprecated soap search api
move makes technically difficult precisely replicate reported study
since search engines lack ability process alternate expressions e worda
wordb embedded within quoted query use different search engine matrix verbs
expanded instead converted respective third person
singular present form stubs simplest form described
earlier sections preliminary experiments seems possible replace
combination alone plus necessary changes maintain
number agreement among constituents queries changes may
negative effects final outcome system unlikely severe
nlp tasks classifying usage inherently difficult even
human annotators already knowledge one thing
speak language another clearly explain rationale behind specific
construct although widely accepted extrapositional expletive line
extrapositional cases referential ones sometimes thin
clearly manifested existence truncated extrapositions gundel et al
obviously valid referential readings similar things said relationship
among three pleonastic categories well idioms example paice husk classify
remains idiom construct classified extraposition
evaluations aside applying syntactic guidelines proposed study
assumed annotation process extraposition valid
non extraposed reading valid cleft reading assumed cleft
generate valid non clefted reading joining clefted constituent directly cleft
clause without leading relative pronoun adverb light subjective nature
