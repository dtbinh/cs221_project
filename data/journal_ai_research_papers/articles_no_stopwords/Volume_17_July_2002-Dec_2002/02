introduction
measures exist attempt quantify uncertainty many trained use
probability theory probability measures obvious choice however probability
cannot easiliy capture certain situations interest consider simple example suppose
bag marbles know red know remaining
blue yellow although know exact proportion blue yellow
modeling situation pick ball bag random need
assign probability three different events picking red ball red event picking
blue ball blue event picking yellow ball yellow event clearly assign
probability red event clear probability assign blue event
yellow event
one way represent uncertainty set probability measures probability measure possible proportion blue yellow
balls instance could use set probabilities p
gives red event probability blue event probability yellow event probability
set probabilities p assign pair functions upper lower
probability measure event x give supremum respectively infimum
probability x according probability measures p measures

probability event defines range probability event example
