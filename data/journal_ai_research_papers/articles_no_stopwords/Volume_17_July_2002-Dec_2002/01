introduction
multidocument summarization poses number challenges single document summarization researchers already investigated issues identifying repetitions
contradictions across input documents determining information salient enough

selected information output summary coherent relevant
pieces information selected across input documents summarizer
decide order present whole text makes sense single
document summarization one possible ordering extracted information provided
input document however jing observed single document summaries written professional summarizers extracted sentences retain
precedence orders summary moreover case multiple input documents
provide useful solution information may drawn different documents
therefore single document provide ordering furthermore order two
pieces information change significantly one document another
provide corpus methodology studying ordering goal

targeted news genre first question addressed importance ordering conducted experiments ordering significantly affects readers
comprehension text experiments although single ideal
ordering information ordering unconstrained number good orderings given text limited second question addressed analysis use
data infer strategy ordering existing corpus methods supervised
learning easily applicable part lack training data
given multiple possible orderings corpus providing one ordering
set information allow us differentiate sentences must together sentences happen together led us develop corpus data
sets contains multiple acceptable orderings single text corpus
expensive construct therefore provide enough data pure statistical
approaches instead used hybrid corpus analysis strategy first automatically identifies commonalities across orderings manual analysis resulting clusters led
identification constraints ordering finally evaluated plausible ordering strategies
asking humans judge
set experiments together suggests ordering integrates constraints approximation temporal sequence underlying events
relatedness content elements evaluation plausible strategies measured
usefulness chronological ordering used previous summarization systems
mckeown et al lin hovy well alternative original strategy
majority ordering evaluation showed two ordering alone
yield satisfactory first majority ordering critically linked level
similarity information ordering across input texts input texts different
orderings however produces unpredictable unacceptable
second chronological ordering produces good information event
therefore temporally sequenced texts refer events describe
states properties falls short
automatic analysis revealed topical relatedness important constraint
groups related sentences tend appear together combines chronological
ordering constraints topical relatedness evaluation shows augmented
significantly outperforms simpler methods alone strategy
characterized bottom since final ordering text emerges data
groups together whether related content chronological sequence contrasts
top strategies rst moore paris hovy schemas mckeown plans dale impose external rhetorically motivated ordering

chronological ordering

multidocument summarization news typically deals articles published different
dates articles cover events occurring wide range time
chronological order summary describe main events helps user understand
happened seems natural appropriate strategy mentioned earlier
framework ordering themes strategy therefore need assign
date themes identify date event occurred requires detailed interpretation
temporal references articles recent developments disambiguating temporal expressions event ordering wiebe ohara ohrstrom sandgren
mckeever mani wilson filatova hovy correlating events
date occurred hard task case approximate theme time

first suspicion approximation deviates much real chronological order events therefore lowers quality sentence ordering verify
hypothesis identified sentences broke original chronological order restored ordering manually interestingly displaced sentences mainly background
information evaluation modified summaries shows visible improvement
comparing good figure poor figure summaries notice two phenomena first many badly placed sentences cannot ordered temporal occurrence instance figure sentence quoting clinton one event
sequence events described rather reaction main events
tool assigning time stamps would assign sentence date clinton made
statement true sentence reporting albrights reaction assigning


fibarzilay elhadad mckeown

date reaction generally sentence conveying background information
placing chronological stream main events produce logical
ordering ordering themes therefore covered co furthermore sentences cannot assigned time stamp instance sentence
vast sparsely inhabited xinjiang region largely desert many chinese military
nuclear installations civilian mining describes state rather event
therefore trying describe temporal terms invalid thus ordering cannot
improved temporal level
second phenomenon observed poor summaries typically contain abrupt
switches topics generally incoherent instance figure quotes
us officials third fifth sentences split sentences mourning first
sixth sentences appear far apart summary grouping together would
increase readability summary point need additional constraints
improve ordering

improving ordering experiments analysis
