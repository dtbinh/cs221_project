Proposition 2 optimal safety-level value player leader election game equals
expected payoff strictly mixed strategy equilibrium game.
Proof: strictly mixed Nash equilibrium probability q choosing a1

(otherwise, deviation rational.) Hence, equality captures fact

Similarly, probability p choosing a1 player 1 satisfy
pU2 (a1 , a1 ) = (1 p)U2 (a2 , a2 )
Hence, strictly mixed strategy Nash equilibrium exists, q =

set theoretic game sets strategies available players identical,
payoff player uniquely determined set strategies selected player.

U2 (t, s) every s, S1 = S2 . Notice set-theoretic games typical voting
contexts. typical voting context care votes, indentity

equilibrium, value optimal safety level strategy player equals expected
payoff equilibrium.
Proof: Let = S1 = S2 = {s1 , s2 , . . . , sl }. Let = (t1 , t2 ) strictly mixed strategy
Nash equilibrium. Denote tuple probabilities associated ti (pi1 , . . . , pil ) (i
{1, 2}, |S1 | = |S2 | = l). strictly mixed Nash equilibrium expected
payoff player 1 is:
lj=1 p2j U1 (se , sj ) ()
every 1 e l. Consider strategy f player 1 assigns probability p2j
strategy sj . Then, every strategy se selected player 2, expected payoff f
given
lj=1 p2j U1 (sj , se ) = lj=1 p2j U1 (se , sj ) = ()
implies safety level strategy player 1 yields expected payoff
identical expected payoff player 1 equilibrium. Similar reasoning

result obtained consider standard first-price auctions, rather
revelation mechanisms associated them; nevertheless, require us allow
player choose action knowing number potential bidders (as corresponding
equilibrium analysis).

previous work AI attempted show potential power decision-theoretic
approaches rely classical game-theoretic analysis. particular, work theoretical computer science competitive analysis extended deal rationality
constraints (Tennenholtz, 2001), order become applicable multi-agent systems.
