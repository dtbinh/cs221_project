Abstract
present propositional logic reason uncertainty events,
uncertainty modeled set probability measures assigning interval probability
event. give sound complete axiomatization logic, show
satisfiability problem NP-complete, harder satisfiability propositional
logic.

1. Introduction
Various measures exist attempt quantify uncertainty. many trained use
probability theory, probability measures obvious choice. However, probability
cannot easiliy capture certain situations interest. Consider simple example: suppose
bag 100 marbles; know 30 red know remaining 70
either blue yellow, although know exact proportion blue yellow.
modeling situation pick ball bag random, need
assign probability three different events: picking red ball (red-event), picking
blue ball (blue-event), picking yellow ball (yellow-event). clearly assign
probability .3 red-event, clear probability assign blue-event
yellow-event.
One way approach problem represent uncertainty using set probability measures, probability measure possible proportion blue yellow
balls. instance, could use set probabilities P = { : [0, .7]},
gives red-event probability .3, blue-event probability , yellow-event probability
.7 . set probabilities P assign pair functions, upper lower
probability measure, event X give supremum (respectively, infimum)
probability X according probability measures P. measures
used deal uncertainty manner described above, lower upper
probability event defines range probability event.1 (This example
viewed giving frequentist interpretation upper probabilities. Upper probabilities
given subjective interpretation, example, considering odds
someone would willing accept reject bet (Smith, 1961; Walley, 1991).)

approach, using inner measures, studied Fagin Halpern (1991).

Given measure uncertainty, one define logic reasoning it. Fagin,
Halpern Megiddo (1990) (FHM on) introduce logic reasoning
probabilities, possible-worlds semantics assigns probability possible
world. provide axiomatization logic, prove sound complete
respect semantics. show satisfiability problem logic,
somewhat surprisingly, NP-complete, hence harder satisfiability problem
propositional logic. moreover show logic extended notions
uncertainty, inner measures (Fagin & Halpern, 1991) Dempster-Shafer belief
functions (Shafer, 1976).
paper, describe logic reasoning upper probability measures, along
lines FHM logic. logic allows reasoning linear inequalities involving
upper probabilities measures. logics considered FHM, logic agnostic
interpretation upper probabilities, whether frequentist subjectivist.
main challenge derive provably complete axiomatization logic; this,
need characterization upper probability measures terms properties
expressed logic. Many semantic characterizations upper probability measures
proposed literature. characterization Anger Lembcke (1985) turns
best suited purposes. Even though reasoning potentially
infinite sets probability measures, satisfiability problem logic remains NPcomplete. Intuitively, need guess small number probability measures satisfy
given formula, polynomially many size formula. Moreover, probability
measures taken defined finite state space, polynomial size
formula. Thus, need basically determine polynomially many valuesa value
probability measure stateto decide satisfiability formula.
rest paper structured follows. Section 2, review required
material probability theory theory upper probabilities. Section 3,

sound complete respect natural semantic models expressed terms upper
probability spaces. Finally, Section 5, prove decision problem logic
NP-complete. proofs new, technical results given Appendix A.

2. Characterizing Upper Probability Measures
start brief review relevant definitions. Recall probability measure
function : [0, 1] algebra subsets (that closed
complements unions), satisfying () = 0, () = 1, (A B) = (A) + (B)
disjoint sets A, B .2 probability space tuple (, , ), set,
algebra subsets (the measurable sets), probability measure defined
. Given set P probability measures, let P upper probability measure defined
2. infinite, could require -algebra (i.e., closed countable unions)
countably additive. Requiring countable additivity would affect results, since show

Since conditions Lemma B.1 satisfied, g upper probability measure.
