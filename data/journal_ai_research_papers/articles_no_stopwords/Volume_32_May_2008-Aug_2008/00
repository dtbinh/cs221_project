cooperative economic search incentive derives principally existence search
costs found mas costs reflect resources necessarily monetary need
invested consumed searching opportunities environment sarne kraus
e g searching opportunity buy product context electronic marketplace
scenario search costs common mas agent needs decision
making process immediate information concerning market opportunities given richness
opportunities dynamic open nature environments central mechanisms usually incapable supplying information level completeness accuracy required
agent certainly without cost thus agent needs spend resources
search related activities despite reduction magnitude search costs electronic commerce era continuous growth number retailers virtual stores
internet followed phenomenal increase number opportunities available makes
overall search cost important parameter affecting buyers search strategy choi liu
kephart greenwald sarne kraus bakos
context cooperative search offers advantage sharing reusing allocating
opportunities among coalition members sarne kraus example cooperative
search agents exploit opportunities would discarded otherwise
agents would conducted alternative separate search nevertheless process forming
maintaining coalition induces overhead derived mainly communication
coordination activities sarne kraus thus coalition set search strategy
cost effective manner
classic example traditional markets procurement management officer
corporation instead individual cooperation spend time resources
locating specific requested supplies task delegated procurement management
officer addition price discounts obtained aggregated demands identical items
procurement management officer becomes highly updated different offers specific
supplies available different merchants markets cost locating
best deal request becomes significantly smaller comparison equivalent search
conducted individuals
basic concepts coalition manage cooperative search including
analysis computational means extracting optimal search strategies given sarne
kraus nevertheless assumption used model constructing coalitions
strategy coalition interacts one seller agent time assumption ignores
inherent strength autonomous agents capability efficiently interact
several agents parallel capability derives primarily improved communication capabilities ability process enormous amount information short time
compared people take advantage capability incorporate
cooperative economic search model supplying comprehensive analysis resulting parallel
cooperative search variant throughout parallel model weakly dominates
existing sequential cooperative search model described sarne kraus potential
significantly improving searchers performance environments guarantees reaching least performance existing cooperative search model particular
parallel interaction preferable whenever agents search cost non linear combines fixed
opposed classical ai search hart nilsson raphael agent seeks sequence actions
