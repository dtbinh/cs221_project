Abstract
derive optimal strategies bidding agent participates multiple, simultaneous
second-price auctions perfect substitutes. prove that, everyone else bids locally
single auction, global bidder always place non-zero bids available
auctions, provided budget constraints. budget, however, optimal
strategy bid locally budget equal less valuation. Furthermore,
wide range valuation distributions, prove problem finding optimal
bids reduces two dimensions auctions identical. Finally, address markets
sequential simultaneous auctions, non-identical auctions, allocative
efficiency market.

e.g. McAfee (1993), Peters Severinov (1997), Gerding et al. (2007b), Leyton-Brown,
Shoham, Tennenholtz (2000). papers, however, assume bidders bid
single auction choose auction randomly. show here, however,

bidding algorithms developed buyers different risk attitudes. However,
setting auctions never close time, forces bids

5. Extensions: Budgets, Non-Identical Sequential Auctions
previous section, considered best response strategy global bidder faces
multiple identical simultaneous auctions financial constraints. section,
generalise results settings. particular, investigate three important
extensions:
1. Section 5.1 investigate setting global bidder limited budget
constrains sum bids exposure.
2. Section 5.2 investigate setting auctions differ probability

local bidders participating.
3. Section 5.3 extend results sequential auctions consider setting
resources interest auctioned simultaneously sequentially.
5.1 Budget-Constrained Bidding
derivation optimal global bid shown optimal strategy
global bidder bid simultaneous auctions. Now, strategy implicitly
assumes bidder face financial constraints (i.e., bidder pay
items won). However, often bidder limited resources may restrict bidding
strategy. section study budget limit space possible strategies
available global bidder affect optimal strategy. particular, consider
case budget constrains exposure, i.e., sum bids.8 occurs,
example, global bidder limited liquidity faces negative consequences
cannot pay items wins (e.g., going bankrupt thrown
system).
Now, importance taking budget constraints account becomes even
pronounced following result shows that, number auctions increases,
required budget exposure unconstrained case exceed given limit:9

Thus, despite low probability bidder pay sum bids (especially,
given auction second-price auction), practice bidder may still want
limit amount.

Furthermore, Figure 5 shows one local bidders replaced global

Furthermore, global bidder generally bid true valuation result

because, global bidder local bidders, high
probability local bidder low valuation win item. global bidder,
hand, likely win auction sufficiently high valuation (even
though global bids true valuation, shown Section 4.3.4 bids
often uniform fairly close true value). effect particularly pronounced
case dynamic local bidders since may occur auction local bidder

Lemma 5 easy see indeed optimal bid full budget.


Corollary 2. Assumption 1, either g(0) > 0 g(x) strictly concave,
global bidder budget C = v, Equation (7) satisfied bidding strictly positive
least two auctions.
Proof proof largely based reverse arguments Lemma 5. Without loss
generality take = 2. Let bL = {C, 0} denote single-auction bid b = {b1 , b2 }
arbitrary bid b 6= bL b1 + b2 = C, b1 , b2 0 before. Since v C = 0
U (bL , v) U (b , v) = X(b1 ), X given Equation (33). Furthermore,
X
b1 = b1 g(C b1 ) (C b1 )g(b1 ) (see Equation (34)). Now, order prove
optimal bid strictly positive auctions, sufficient show exists
C > b1 > 0 X(b1 ) < 0 one two conditions holds.
X
first show holds g(0) > 0. easy see b
(0) = Cg(0) < 0

X(0) thus strictly decreasing. Since X(0) = 0 proves X(b1 ) < 0 b1
slightly larger zero. Since b2 = C b1 follows b2 > 0 long b1 < C,
agent thus better bidding auctions.
consider case g(0) = 0 g(x) strictly concave. replacing
condition convex functions Lemma 5 strictly concave functions follows
b1
1 g(x1 ) > g(x1 ) 12 C > x1 > 0. setting x1 = (C b1 ) = Cb
