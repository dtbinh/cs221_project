making one two assumptions actually decreases complexity eef existence even renders tractable case clauses objects
proposition eef existence agents dichotomous preferences restricted

proof first make two additional assumptions prove complexity
decrease two assumptions suppose first agents preferences

clause giving empty share satisfy without spoiling another agent thus
safely removed suppose agent wants least one object one
