present section two main objectives first aims provide overview
different types approaches available comparison concepts ontologies
identify foundations desired similarity measure may modeled
taking account seven dimensions described previous study calle et al
secondly aims select best way evaluate yielded desired similarity
measure according studies regarding similarity metrics assessment
basically two types methods exist comparison terms graph ontology
edge methods graph edges types data source node methods
graph nodes properties main data source simplest intuitive
similarity measure former method mainly counting number edges
path two terms graph rada mili bicknell blettner within edgebased method two general approaches exist firstly distance selects
shortest path average paths one path exists secondly common

path calculates similarity directly length path lowest common
ancestor two terms root node wu palmer past years
variety edge methods defined resnik leacock chodorow
edge methods grounded two basic assumptions firstly nodes links
uniformly distributed ontology terms depth
specificity budanitsky secondly edges level ontology indicate
semantic distance terms however suppositions rarely true
majority ontologies reason several strategies proposed response
fact one example strategy weighting edges according hierarchical
depth use node density link type richardson smeaton murphy
nevertheless strategies solve aforementioned due fact terms
depth necessarily specificity edges level
necessarily represent semantic distance
second node method relies comparison properties terms

commonly used concept methods information content ic providing measure
specific informative term ic term c quantified negative
log likelihood ic log p c p c probability occurrence c specific
corpus generally estimated annotation frequency another employed
obtain ic number children term ontological structure seco

way two main approaches exist first informative common ancestor mica
technique common ancestor highest ic considered resnik
second disjoint common ancestor dca technique disjoint common

experimental phase four training developed according different
perspectives thus phase included pair oriented feature oriented user oriented
hybrid experiment every case error rate calculated respect human subject
assessments best corresponded pair oriented method achieved error

feature oriented experiment required despite slightly worsening previous
experiment concretely producing error rate however feature oriented
experiment big advantage able applied easily large ontologies
moreover user oriented training aimed adapt weights subject order
confirm assumption every test subject assigns value dimensions
experiment highest error rate demonstrated
error rate follows decreasing trend line training done error rate follows
asymptotic tendency addition experiment shows slightly better
taking account sort dimension average error rate
maximum reason concluded user oriented experiment able
adapt individual judgment although adaptation slow finally hybrid
experiment combines feature oriented user oriented training error rate
nevertheless manages reduce error user oriented training well
balancing error atypical cases common rest experiments



fisemantic similarity measures applied ontology

since hybrid experiment manages balance experiments
currently improved hybrid developed calculation
weights iteration affected depending error produced feature
experiment pair concepts corresponding iteration
performance training methods proposed closely related available extent
knowledge reason authors currently working mechanisms increasing
quality completeness ontological knowledge manual acquisition
knowledge expert requires great deal resources would desirable develop
advanced mechanism learn concepts relations challenge attain
knowledge acquisition human interaction human subjects therefore
lifetime system knowledge bases would enriched interacting users
finally refinement similarities formulation interesting line work especially
semiotic dimension reintroducing influence global similarity calculation
