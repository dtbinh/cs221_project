next wh wj wh wj strategy profile

suppose b players choose distinct facilities one facilities j
since pure strategy equilibrium wl wj every l j therefore since

suppose since n equilibrium wf n wg claim
wf n wg



indeed assume negation wf n wg since n equilibrium
wf n wg wg wf n therefore wf n wg
monotonicity condition wf n wg yields contradiction therefore holds
implies choosing f strictly dominates choosing g therefore lemma
every correlated equilibrium pure strategy profile generates congestion
vector hence mediation value equals
claim rest proof assume w l og
