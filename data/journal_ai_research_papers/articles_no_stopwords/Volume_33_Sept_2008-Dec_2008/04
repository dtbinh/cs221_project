Next prove exist completely mixed-strategy equilibrium, (an equilibrium every player assigns positive probability strategies). Suppose

Extend q 1 mixed strategy r1 player 1 defining r1 (s1 ) = 0. Obviously,
ui (r1 , q 2 ) = ui (q 1 , q 2 ) = 1, 2 therefore (18) implies
u(r1 , q 2 ) > 0.

(19)

Since vN () = 0, (19) implies (r1 , q 2 ) mixed-strategy equilibrium . However, since r1 coincide q 1 1 , r1 (s1 ) = 0, (q 1 , q 2 ) mixed-strategy equilibrium
, player 2 profitable deviation q 2 player 1 uses r1 .
Therefore, player 1 must profitable deviation r1 player 2 uses q 2 .
particular, player 1 must pure-strategy profitable deviation. Since (q 1 , q 2 )

u1 (s1 , q 2 ) > u1 (r1 , q 2 ),

u1 (s1 , q 2 ) > 0.

Next show (s1 , q 2 ) N (). Since (q 1 , q 2 ) mixed strategy equilibrium ,

1, every pure-strategy player 2 best-response s1 hence, every mixedstrategy player 2 best response s1 , particular q 2 . Therefore, (s1 , q 2 )

4.1 Mediation Value
Although congestion games especially interesting number players large,
begin presenting results case two players, extending
upon results previous section. Following that, consider general
n-player case.
4.1.1 two-player case (n = 2)
Theorem 1 provides 43 tight upper bound mediation value class games
G22 . Hence, 43 obviously upper bound mediation value nonnegative simple
congestion games two players two facilities, i.e., games generated congestion
forms Q22 . turns bound tight:
Theorem 6 V ({F |F Q22 }) = 43 .
Proof: Let Fx , x > 1, following simple congestion form: = {a1 , a2 }, wa1 = (x, 0),
wa2 = (1, x 1) . games Fx , x > 1 obtained games, x defined
proof Theorem 1 (See Figure 2) renaming strategies player 2. Hence,
proved Theorem 1, V (Fx ) 34 x . 2
Next consider general case two players choose among
facilities:
Theorem 7 V ({F |F Q2m }) 2 every 2.
Proof: Let F Q2m . Rosenthal (1973) exists pure-strategy equilibrium F .
Let fixed pure-strategy equilibrium largest welfare,
u(A) u(D) every pure-strategy equilibrium D.

(23)

Let j k facilities players 1 2 choose respectively. prove
separation two cases, j = k j 6= k.
Case 1: j = k. prove theorem case separation cases wj (1) > wj (2)
wj (1) wj (2).
Case 1.1: wj (1) > wj (2). case show j strictly dominant strategy,
implies Lemma 1 V (F ) = 1. Indeed, let h 6= j facility. order
prove j strictly dominates h show following three inequalities
hold: wh (1) < wj (2), wh (2) < wj (1), wh (1) < wj (1). However, since wj (1) > wj (2),
first two inequalities proved. first prove wh (1) < wj (2): Since
pure strategy equilibrium players choose j, wh (1) wj (2). Suppose
negation wh (1) = wj (2). Since pure-strategy equilibrium, wj (2) wl (1)
every l 6= j, therefore, wh (1) wl (1) every l 6= j. If, addition, wj (1) wh (2),
strategy profile one player chooses h, player chooses j purestrategy equilibrium obtains larger welfare contradicting (23). Therefore,
wh (2) > wj (1). implies strategy profile players choose h
pure-strategy equilibrium obtains larger welfare A, contradiction
(23). Therefore wh (1) < wj (2).
595

fiAshlagi, Monderer, & Tennenholtz

next show wh (2) < wj (1). wh (2) wj (1) strategy profile
players choose h pure-strategy equilibrium 2wh (2) 2wj (1) > 2wj (2) contradicting
(23). completes proof Case 1.1.
Case 1.2: wj (1) wj (2). Let B pure strategy profile maximum
welfare obtained. is, u(B) = opt(F ). order prove theorem suffices
prove
u(B) 2u(A).
(24)
Suppose B players choose distinct facilities (one facilities j).
Since pure-strategy equilibrium, wl (1) wj (2) every l 6= j. Therefore, since
wj (1) wj (2), u(B) u(A) particular (24) holds. Suppose two players
choose facility B, denote facility s. = j B = (24) holds.
Therefore assume 6= j. ws (2) wj (2), u(B) u(A), implies (24). Therefore
assume ws (2) > wj (2) particular ws (2) > wj (1). Since wj (2) wl (1)
every facility l, l 6= j, B pure-strategy equilibrium u(B) > u(A), contradicting
(23). Hence proof Case 1.2 complete.
Case 2: j 6= k. Let B arbitrary pure strategy profile maximum
welfare obtained. is, u(B) = opt(F ). suffices prove (24) holds.
Recall pure-strategy equilibrium. B player chooses different
facility, u(B) u(A) particular (24) holds. Therefore assume B
players choose facility l (l j k). claim
wl (2) max{wj (1), wk (1)}.

(25)

Indeed, (25) hold, B pure strategy equilibrium, player B
want deviate either j k, want deviate facility
pure strategy equilibrium. Since u(B) > u(A) contradicts (23). Since
u(B) = 2wl (2) max{wj (1), wk (1)} u(A), (25) implies (24). 2
Notice Theorems 6 7 imply correlation help congestion games
two players. next theorem shows correlation cannot help increasing social
welfare facilities non-increasing:
Theorem 8 V (QN 2m ) = 1 every 2.
Proof: Let F QN 2m . Let j wj (1) wl (1) l .
wj (2) > wl (1) l 6= j, j strictly dominant strategy, implies Lemma 1
V (F ) = 1. Suppose exist facility k,k 6= j wj (2) wk (1).
Choose k wk (1) maximal, wl (1) wk (1) every l, l 6= j.
Therefore, strategy profile one player chooses j player chooses
k pure strategy equilibrium obtains maximal welfare. existence
strategy profile implies V (F ) = 1. 2.
4.1.2 Simple congestion games n players

fiAshlagi, Monderer, & Tennenholtz

Proof: Suppose = n. Since (0, n) equilibrium, wg (n) wf (1). Therefore, (31),
wg (n) wg (1). monotonicity condition, every k, u(k ) = (n k)wf (n k) +
kwg (k) (n k)wf (1) + kwg (1). Therefore, u(k ) nwg (n) = u(n ). Hence, maximal
welfare, opt() attained equilibrium n , implies mediation value
equals 1.
Suppose = 0. Since (n, 0) equilibrium, wf (n) wg (1). claim
wf (n) > wg (1).

(33)

Indeed, assume negation wf (n) = wg (1). Since (n 1, 1) equilibrium, either
wf (n 1) < wg (2) wg (1) < wf (n). Therefore, wf (n 1) < wg (2),
monotonicity condition, wf (n) < wg (1), yields contradiction. Therefore (33) holds,
implies choosing f strictly dominates choosing g . Therefore, Lemma 1,
every correlated equilibrium pure strategy profile, generates congestion
vector 0 . Hence, mediation value equals 1.2
Claim 1, rest proof assume w.l.og.

Note wg (1) < wf (n), choosing f strictly dominates choosing g, implies
mediation value equals 1. Therefore assume w.l.o.g. rest proof

(35)

following key claim proof.
Claim 2: u(j ) u( ) every j .
Proof: Let j < . Since facilities linear, wg (j) = wg ( ) + ( j)dg wf (n j) =
wf (n ) ( j)df . Hence,
u( ) u(j ) =
swg ( ) + (n )wf (n ) j(wg ( ) + ( j)dg ) (n j)(wf (n ) ( j)df ) =
wf (n )(j ) + wg ( )( j) j( j)dg + (n j)( j)df =
( j)(wg ( ) wf (n ) + (n j)df jdg )
( j)(wf (n + 1) wf (n ) + (n j)df jdg ),

(36)

last inequality follows since equilibrium. Since facilities linear,
RHS(36) = ( j)((n j 1)df jdg ) =
( j)(wf (1) wf (n j) wg (1) + wg (j + 1)).

(37)

Since j < suffices show (wf (1) wf (n j) wg (1) + wg (j + 1)) 0.

Theorem 16 shows symmetric congestion games, conditions

maximal welfare played positive probability. Therefore mediation value
greater 1, i.e. best mixed-strategy equilibrium less useful best correlated
equilibrium.

5. Conclusion
work introduced studied two measures value correlation
strategic interactions: mediation value enforcement value. measures
complement existing measures appearing price anarchy literature, comparing maximal welfare (when agent behavior dictated) welfare obtained
Nash equilibrium (when agents selfish). Indeed, correlation captures many interesting situations, common computing systems e-commerce applications.
