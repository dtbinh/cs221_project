definition bargaining game pair x x xi
logically consistent set sentences l complete transitive reflexive order
total preorder weak order xi satisfies following logical constraint
lc n k k n k
call pair xi prioritized demand set player xi
denotes denotes
intuitively bargaining game formal representation bargaining situation
player describes demands logical formulae expresses preferences
demands total preorder assume player consistent demands
preference ordering player reflects degree entrenchment player
defends demands logical constraint lc says demand logical
consequence demands n less entrenched
fail defend least one dropped otherwise
would lost easy see ordering similar gadenfors
makinsons epistemic entrenchment gardenfors makinson fact logical
constraint lc introduced zhang foo actually combination
postulates ee ee epistemic entrenchment ordering
observation let total preorder x logical constraint lc equivalent
conjunction following conditions


proof easy verify lc implies two conditions prove
conditions imply lc induction n obviously lc holds n assume lc
holds n l suppose l l l l l l
inductive assumption l l k k l
k l l condition transitivity l
l therefore case k k l k

remark preference ordering represents firmly agent entrenches
demands rather gain payoff instance suppose p represents
demand seller price good less p denotes price
good less obviously seller could get higher payoff p
p however since p implies p entrench p less firmly p e p p
complete transitive reflexive order e total preorder weak order satisfies following properties

another significant difference model bargaining gametheoretic model game theoretic model abstracts bargaining situation numerical
game demands preferences risk posture player represented utility
values model however factors abstracted logical statements
ordering statement e prioritized demand set note endowed
word demand broad meaning model demand player
everything related negotiation player wants keep final
agreement physical item player wants obtain party
piece knowledge belief goal constraint even thread whatever
player wants keep agreement different logics rational agency
bdi logics distinguish knowledge belief goal real demands
instance logical tautology demand player player considers
included final agreement consider example typical demands
player xa xa xa mean player
wants get share cake less player bs demands
opposite say xb xb xb besides real demands
set domain constraints players demand sets xa xb
xa xa z xb xb z whenever z constraints link
demands players together therefore play important rule determination
bargaining outcomes instance cannot xa xb
final agreement inconsistent constraints one may wonder
player include constraints demand set case
player would accept unreasonable xa xb
words idealize bargaining assuming two individuals highly
rational see work nash p assume constraints
background knowledge included demand set player see discussions
example section ordering demand sets reflect gains
player mentioned likely rational agent could give
highest priority mentioned constraints background knowledge since
might never going give fundamental rules
following example shows model suitable discrete domain

example couple making family budget next year husband wants
change car fancy model domestic holiday wife going
implement dream romantic trip europe suggests redecorate kitchen
know cant two holidays one year realize
cannot afford car overseas holiday year without getting
loan bank however wife idea borrowing money
order represent situation logic let c denote buy car stand
domestic holiday overseas holiday k kitchen redecoration l loan
note player may different demands different stages negotiation



fian ordinal bargaining solution fixed point property

means impossible domestic holiday overseas
holiday statement c l says want buy car
overseas holiday get loan bank
symbolization express husbands demands following
set
x c c l
similarly wifes demands represented
x k c l l
let us assume husbands preferences demands
c l c
wifes preferences
c l k l
note agents give common beliefs c l highest
priority reflects couple rational shall see common beliefs
play important role determination bargaining solution
example see differences model osborne
rubinsteins model osborne rubinstein first demand sets x x
model represent players physical demands rather feasible outcomes note
two players share feasible set x osborne rubinsteins model
model feasible set generated demand sets procedure conflict
resolving see definition example secondly representation
disagreements negotiation ends disagreement simply assume agreement empty thirdly osborne rubinsteins model items x independent
model items players demand sets related
logical relations orderings via lc allows us represent bargainers attitude
towards risk

bargaining solution
nashs bargaining model bargaining solution defined function assigns
bargaining game point feasible set game however
simple definition model set possible agreements feasible set
given bargaining game generate feasible set demand sets
involves process conflict resolving
possible deals
whenever demands two agents conflict least one agent make concession
order reach agreement simple way making concession withdraw
number demands sense possible agreement pair subsets two players
original demand sets collection remaining demands consistent obviously
player would keep many original demands possible addition player

fian ordinal bargaining solution fixed point property

therefore g contains single deal see example solution

f g c l c c l k
words couple agree upon commonsense one holiday
get loan want buy car go overseas holiday
husband accepts wifes suggestion holiday europe wife agrees buying

consider following preference orderings
c l c

therefore demand hierarchies become

let g denote game deals original hierarchy shown

final agreement include demands lead conflicting l keeps
demands lead conflicting k words solution excludes
demands lead conflict keeps demands involved conflicts
even though low priorities

logical properties bargaining solution
following two sections discuss properties bargaining solution introduced previous section according zhang bargaining solution satisfies
axioms collective rationality scale invariance symmetry mutually comparable
monotonicity well basic assumptions individual rationality consistency comprehensiveness logical version kalai smorodinsky solution kalai

consistency capture logical properties bargaining solution scale invariance
symmetry mutually comparable monotonicity reflect game theoretic properties

collective rationality

proof proofs properties straightforward definition bargaining solution definition

note logical version individual rationality ir different meaning
game theoretic version logical version ir means player concerns
demands e whether many demands included
final agreement contrast game theoretic version ir concerns whether
player gain less disagreement point negotiation see details
section two properties quite intuitive
following example shows solution satisfy comprehensiveness
requires g implies g see work zhang

example consider bargaining situation player demand set x p q
player demand set x p r p r q propositional variables assume
player ranks demands level e demand sets singleton
partition assumption easy know solution game
q r therefore solution comprehensive instance q p q f g
p f g
since solution satisfy comprehensiveness according zhang
logical version kalai smorodinsky solution however mean
solution less intuitive although comprehensiveness common restriction belief
revision game theory means desirable property bargaining solution
example q r involved conflict underlying bargaining
game thus reasonable players keep irrelevant demands addition
solution syntax dependent represent demand set x p q
x p r solution
fixed point property
besides generic properties solution possesses another extraordinary logical property
fixed point property consider bargaining negotiation mutual persuasion one

ordinal preference much less expressive power cardinal utility unable express risk posture player determines players bargaining power successful
solution ordinal bargaining supply alternative mean express
bargainers attitude towards risk section illustrate two case studies
solved framework
case study bargainers attitude towards risk
let us revisit bargaining game example demand sets x p r
x q r consider following variations preferences reflect difference
players attitude towards risk note different cases lead different games
g x p r x q r
g x p r x q r
g x p r x q r
g x p r x q r
easy calculate solutions games
f g p q
f g p r q
f g p q r

g players risk averse players rank conflicting item r
lowest priority means incentive reach agreement
g player aggressive since conflicting item highly ranked
player game case surprising general risk averse player
would gain disadvantage negotiation comparing risk lover see roths book b
p g symmetrical g g players aggressive therefore game
ends disagreement
example clear see bargainers attitude towards risk specified
model risk averse player would give demands likely conflict
demands player relatively lower priorities agreement likely
reached contrast risk loving player would firmly entrench conflicting
demands notice logic plays crucial role representation simply expressing
bargainers demands physical terms without specifying relation sufficient
lead ordinal solution crucial specify logical relations demands
players example contradiction demands r r play main
role determination solutions main difference model
game theoretic
case study ii discretization numerical games
mentioned introduction section risk posture represented non linearity
utility functions nashs model subsection use example cake division
example non linearity preferences represented model
demand sets represented prioritized partitions corresponding preference orderings
p r q r respectively

represent bargaining logical form need discretize domain
let pn player receives less n percentages cake player b gets
remain n natural number addition following

solutions indicates risk posture players embedded
model fact easily see player b aggressive ranks higher
conflicting items relatively higher player instance player b ranks
equal share th level player ranks th level
seen example ordering demands reflect
players gains demands represents players preference retaining abandoning demands another significant difference bargaining model
game theoretic
one may ask whether player could get advantages cheating sense
agent knows demands ranking party agent adjust
demand hierarchy order obtain better outcome yes possible tell
opposite want demands release ranking
demands otherwise lose bargaining power reason attitude
towards risk encoded ranking demands
indicates player ignores small differences divisions instance may consider
share means real negotiation player may request
sequence giving round bargaining
player b claims share sequence dropping demand scale
square
note communication players therefore player may give

fian ordinal bargaining solution fixed point property

risk cardinal utility specifies two sorts information preference possible agreements via ordering utility values risk attitudes via non linearity
utility function however second sort information determines players
bargaining power may lost ordinal transformation meanwhile bargaining
model purely ordinal information preferences automatically solve
bargainers risk attitude even inexpressible model therefore ordinal bargaining theory must supply facility describe information
ordinal preferences including risk attitudes specify bargaining
situation logical structure bargainers demands goals beliefs described logical
statements conflicts demands two players identified
consistency checking importantly bargainers attitudes towards risk expressible
model natural way risk averse player tends give conflicting demand
relatively lower priority agreement could likely reached risk lover
would firmly entrench demands less care whether demands contradict
opponents
issues worth investigation firstly shown solution
satisfies set logical properties game theoretic properties interesting know
whether axiomatic system exactly characterizes solution main
challenge construction solution syntax dependent simply
impose logical closedness demand sets lose desirable properties
inclusion irrelevant items computational apply
assumption shall need axioms specify way logical representation
words axioms specify demand set represented syntactically
secondly present work offers solution bilateral bargaining situations
supply model bargaining agents therefore current framework
deal issues demand formed demand ranked
higher another bargain effectively interesting logic
agency used developed model bargaining agents logic interacts
logic bargaining
finally issues computational complexity proposed solution remain
