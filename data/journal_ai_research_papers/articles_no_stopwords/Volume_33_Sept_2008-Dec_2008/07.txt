1. Introduction
Bargaining central research topic economics five decades
become interesting issue computer science recent years (Osborne & Rubinstein,
1990; Rosenschein & Zlotkin, 1994; Muthoo, 1999). ground-breaking paper, Nash
(1950) models bargaining problem pair (S, d), <2 subset twodimensional Euclidean space (feasible set), representing set utility pairs
derived bargainers preferences feasible outcomes, point designated
disagreement point. bargaining solution function assigns
bargaining problem (S, d) point (Thomson, 1994).
Nash bargaining model presumes bargainers preferences represented
von Neumann-Morgenstern utility, referred cardinal utility (Myerson, 1991).
assumption, two utility functions viewed one derived
affine positive transformation. Thus bargaining solution based
Nashs bargaining model invariant affine positive transformations.
However, traditional economic theory considers bargaining problems players preferences represented ordinal (Calvo & Peters, 2005). Therefore, ideally, bargaining

property referred ordinal invariance game-theoretic literature (Thomson,
1994). bargaining solution possesses property called ordinal solution.
Obviously, ordinal bargaining solutions desirable cardinal solutions
ordinal information players preferences easier elicit cardinal preferences
corresponding solutions robust (Sakovics, 2004; Calvo & Peters, 2005).
However, none well known bargaining solutions (Nash, 1950; Kalai & Smorodinsky,
1975; Kalai, 1977; Perles & Maschler, 1981) ordinal. fact, Shapley (1969) showed
two-person bargaining problem (bilateral bargaining) non-trivial
(i.e., strongly individual rational) ordinal solution1 . result generally referred
Shapleys impossibility result game-theoretic literature.
Shapleys negative result obviously discouraged investigation ordinal bargaining,
notwithstanding Shapley demonstrated ten years later ordinal solutions exist

theory regain focus game theory recently. Kibris (2001) provided
axiomatic characterization ordinal solution three-person bargaining problem
based Nashs bargaining model2 . Safra Samet (2004) extended result
bargaining problems three players. Rubinstein et al. (1992) ONeill et
al. (2004) investigated ordinal bargaining problem varying Nashs bargaining model.
Calvo Perers (2005) explored problem ordinal bargaining least one
player cardinal. Nevertheless, problem ordinal bargaining still considered
unsolved problem. pierces work focus existence ordinal solutions.
None proposed solutions gains strong intuitive support. Looking meaningful
ordinal bargaining solutions still outstanding problem game theory (Sakovics, 2004).
show difficulty ordinal bargaining, let us consider simple typical bargaining
scenario:
Example 1 (Muthoo, 1999) Two players, B, bargain partition cake.
Let xi share cake percentage player (i = A, B). set possible
agreements represented = {(xA , xB ) : 0 xA 100 xB = 100 xA }.
xi [0, 100], ui (xi ) player utility obtaining share xi cake.
Assume player linear utility scale share, uA (xA ) = xA , player
B utility scale proportional square share, uB (xB ) = x2B . Failure agree rated 0 B. Consider two influential bargaining solutions: Nashs solution (Nash, 1950) Kalai-Smorodinskys solution (Kalai & Smorodinsky, 1975). easy calculate Nashs bargaining solution problem gives
outcome (33.3, 66.7) Kalai-Smorodinskys solution gives (38.2, 61.8). solutions
favor player B. player B less risk-averse (has concave utility)
player (has linear utility). Nashs solution Kalai-Smorodinskys solution,
risk-loving players advantage bargaining comparing risk-neutral risk-averse
players (see Roths book, 1979a, p.35-60). consider order-preserving transformation

(x) = x player Bs utility. transformed utility player B becomes linear.

2. Representation Bargaining Problems
seen Example 1, ordinal solution bilateral bargaining problem
requires information addition ordinal preferences. order express extra information, model bargaining situation two aspects: physical bargaining terms,
described propositional logic, ordering bargainers preferences
bargaining terms, described total preorder. Since bilateral bargaining
challenging problem bargaining theory, shall restrict bargaining problem two players.
2.1 Preliminaries
assume party set negotiation items, referred demand set,
described finite propositional language L. language consists finite set
propositional variables propositional connectives , ,, standard
syntax semantics. logical closure operator Cn defined Cn(X) = { : X ` },
X set sentences. say X logically closed belief set X = Cn(X).
X two sets sentences, X + denotes Cn(X ).
Suppose X1 X2 two sets sentences. simplify exploration, use Xi
represent set among X1 X2 Xi one them. vector two
components, D1 D2 represent component D.
2.2 Bargaining Games
shown previous section, cardinal utility encodes two types information: bargainers attitude towards risk (via non-linearity utility functions) bargainers preferences
possible outcomes (via ordering utility values). One may ask whether theory
bargaining based purely ordinal information preferences. order investigate possibility, Osborne Rubinstein introduced different way represent
bargaining situation, preference information separated physical
bargaining terms (Osborne & Rubinstein, 1990). Precisely, define bargaining problem four-tuple (X, D, 1 , 2 ), X set feasible outcomes (in physical terms),
disagreement event, complete transitive reflexive ordering set
X D, representing bargainer preferences. shown Example 1, however, simply
describing physical bargaining terms without specifying relations suffice
lead ordinal solution (see Osborne & Rubinsteins book, 1990, p.32).
paper, extend Osborne & Rubinsteins model way physical
negotiation items represented logical formulae.

remark preference ordering represents firmly agent entrenches
demands rather gain payoff4 . instance, suppose p1 represents

another significant difference model bargaining gametheoretic model. game-theoretic model abstracts bargaining situation numerical
game. demands, preferences risk posture player represented utility
values. model, however, factors abstracted logical statements
ordering statement, i.e., prioritized demand set. Note endowed
word demand broad meaning. model, demand player
everything related negotiation player wants keep final
agreement. physical item player wants obtain party.
piece knowledge, belief, goal, constraint even thread, whatever,
player wants keep agreement. Different logics rational agency,
BDI logics, distinguish knowledge, belief, goal real demands.
instance, logical tautology demand player player considers
included final agreement. Consider Example 1 again. Typical demands
player xA 40, xA 50, xA 60, on5 , mean player
wants get share cake less 40%, 50%, 60%, . Player Bs demands
opposite, say xB 40, xB 50, xB 60, . Besides real demands,
set domain constraints players demand sets, xA + xB 100,
xA xA z xB xB z whenever z. constraints link
demands players together, therefore, play important rule determination
bargaining outcomes. instance, cannot xA 55 xB 55
final agreement inconsistent constraints. One may wonder
player include constraints demand set. case,
player would accept unreasonable results, xA 55 xB 55.
words, idealize bargaining problem assuming two individuals highly
rational (see work Nash, 1950, p.155), assume constraints
background knowledge included demand set player (see discussions
example Section 6). Again, ordering demand sets reflect gains
player mentioned above. likely rational agent could give
highest priority mentioned constraints background knowledge since
might never going give fundamental rules.
following example shows model suitable discrete domain
problems.
Example 2 couple making family budget next year. husband wants
change car new fancy model domestic holiday. wife going
implement dream romantic trip Europe suggests redecorate kitchen.
know cant two holidays one year. realize
cannot afford new car overseas holiday year without getting
loan bank. However, wife idea borrowing money.
order represent situation logic, let c denote buy new car, stand

overseas holiday, get loan bank.
symbolization, express husbands demands following
set:
X1 = {c, d, (d o), (c o) l}
Similarly, wifes demands represented by:
X2 = {o, k, (d o), (c o) l, l}
Let us assume husbands preferences demands are:
(d o) 1 (c o) l 1 c 1
wifes preferences are:
(d o) 2 (c o) l 2 2 k 2 l
Note agents give common beliefs: (d o) (c o) l highest
priority. reflects couple rational. shall see common beliefs
play important role determination bargaining solution.
example, see differences model Osborne

model represent players physical demands rather feasible outcomes (note
two players share feasible set X Osborne & Rubinsteins model).
model, feasible set generated demand sets procedure conflict

disagreements. negotiation ends disagreement, simply assume agreement empty. Thirdly, Osborne & Rubinsteins model, items X independent,
model, items players demand sets related

towards risk.
2.3 Hierarchy Demands

demand sets. Consider prioritized demand set (X, ) single agent. define
recursively hierarchy, {X j }+
j=1 , X respect ordering follows:
1. X 1 = { X : X( )}; 1 = X\X 1 .
2. X j+1 = { j : j ( )}; j+1 = j \X j+1 .

Since assumed X1 X2 consistent, (G) non-empty. Specifically, X1 X2 consistent, (G) = {(X1 , X2 )}.
Example 3 Consider bargaining game Example 2. According preference orderings couple, game three possible deals:
D1 = ({(d o), (c o) l, c, d}, {(d o), (c o) l, k, l}).
D2 = ({(d o), (c o) l, c}, {(d o), (c o) l, o, k}).
D3 = ({(d o), (c o) l}, {(d o), (c o) l, o, k, l}).
Therefore (G) = {D1 , D2 , D3 }.

3.3 Solution
first sight, bargaining solution easily defined function assigns
bargaining game G possible deal (G). likely, solution could select one
best deals (G). However, due multiplicity (G) (see Figure 3),
selection always feasible want solution symmetric player.
show difficulty, let us consider following example.
Example 4 Consider bargaining game G = ((X1 , 1 ), (X2 , 2 )), described three propositional variables p, q r, X1 = {{p}, {r}} X2 = {{q}, {r}} (note
demand sets represented form hierarchy p 1 r q 2 r (see Section
2.3)). easy know game two possible deals, ({p, r}, {q}) ({p}, {q, r}),

Therefore final agreement bargaining defined F1 (G) F2 (G)9 .
2. Note (G) Xi = 1, 2. Therefore solution means compromise

Example 2, core game is:

fiAn Ordinal Bargaining Solution Fixed-Point Property

Therefore (G) contains single deal, D2 (see Example 3). solution

F (G) = D2 = ({(d o), (c o) l, c}, {(d o), (c o) l, o, k})
words, couple agree upon commonsense one holiday

husband accepts wifes suggestion holiday Europe wife agrees buying
new car.
consider following preference orderings:
(d o) 1 (c o) l 1 1 c
(d o) 2 (c o) l 2 2 k 2 l
Therefore demand hierarchies become:
X1 = {{(d o), (c o) l}, {d}, {c}}.
X2 = {{(d o), (c o) l}, {o}, {k}, {l}}.
Let G0 denote game. deals original hierarchy shown

even though low priorities.

4. Logical Properties Bargaining Solution
following two sections, discuss properties bargaining solution introduced previous section. According Zhang (2007), bargaining solution satisfies
axioms Collective Rationality, Scale Invariance, Symmetry Mutually Comparable
Monotonicity well basic assumptions Individual Rationality, Consistency Comprehensiveness logical version Kalai-Smorodinsky solution (Kalai &
Smorodinsky, 1975). Among properties, Collective Rationality, Individual Rationality
Consistency capture logical properties bargaining solution. Scale Invariance,
Symmetry Mutually Comparable Monotonicity reflect game-theoretic properties
bargaining solution. Comprehensiveness idealized assumption logic-based bargaining solution. Although significant difference bargaining solution
defined paper one work, two solutions share desirable
properties bargaining solutions.
4.1 Generic Properties Logic-Based Bargaining Solutions
easy see solution constructed previous section satisfies following
generic properties logic-based bargaining solution.
Theorem 1 bargaining game G = ((X1 , 1 ), (X2 , 2 )), let F (G) = (F1 (G), F2 (G)).

(Individual Rationality)

2. F1 (G) F2 (G) consistent.

(Consistency)

3. X1 X2 consistent, (G) = Xi i.

(Collective Rationality)

Proof: proofs properties straightforward definition bargaining solution (Definition 3).

Note logical version Individual Rationality (IR) different meaning
game-theoretic version. logical version IR means player concerns
demands, i.e., whether many demands included
final agreement. contrast, game-theoretic version IR concerns whether
player gain less disagreement point negotiation (see details
Section 5.1). two properties quite intuitive.
following example shows solution satisfy comprehensiveness,
requires (G) implies (G) (see work Zhang,
2007).
Example 6 Consider bargaining situation player 1s demand set X1 = {p, q}
player 2s demand set X2 = {p, r}, p, r, q propositional variables. Assume
player ranks demands level (i.e., demand sets singleton
partition). Based assumption, easy know solution game
({q}, {r}). Therefore, solution comprehensive (for instance, q p q F1 (G)
p 6 F1 (G)).
Since solution satisfy comprehensiveness, according Zhang (2007),
logical version Kalai-Smorodinsky solution. However, mean
solution less intuitive. Although comprehensiveness common restriction belief
revision game theory, means desirable property bargaining solution.
example, q r involved conflict underlying bargaining
game. Thus reasonable players keep irrelevant demands. addition,
solution syntax-dependent. represent demand set X1 = {p q}
X2 = {p r}, solution (, ).
4.2 Fixed-Point Property
Besides generic properties, solution possesses another extraordinary logical property:
fixed-point property. consider bargaining negotiation mutual persuasion: one
persuades accept demands. outcome negotiation result
mutual belief revision (Zhang et al., 2004). case, negotiation outcome
satisfy following fixed-point property.
Theorem 2 bargaining game G = ((X1 , 1 ), (X2 , 2 )), X1 X2 logically
closed, bargaining solution F (G) satisfies following fixed-point condition:
F1 (G) + F2 (G) = (X1 1 F2 (G)) (X2 2 F1 (G))

Assume X1 X2 two belief sets (so logically closed), representing belief
states two agents. Mutual belief revision agents means agent takes

Therefore X1 2 F2 (G) = X1 1 (1 + 2 + (X1 X2 )). addition, easy

5. Game-theoretic Properties Bargaining Solution
game theory, properties considered important bargaining solution
include individual rationality, Pareto optimality, ordinal invariance (or scale invariance),
symmetry contraction independence. bargaining model, bargainers preferences
represented total preorder, order-preserving transformation preferences
change order preferences. Therefore solution satisfies ordinal invariance
trivially. section, examine properties list
bargaining solution. presenting results, first introduce concepts
necessary game-theoretic analysis bargaining.
5.1 Strategies Utilities
Two concepts play essential roles game-theoretic analysis bargaining: strategy
utility. Given bargaining game G = ((X1 , 1 ), (X2 , 2 )), strategy profile game
pair (S1 , S2 ) S1 X1 S2 X2 . strategy profile interpreted
pair proposals demands players course bargaining.
say strategy profile = (S1 , S2 ) compatible
1. X1 X2 S1 X1 X2 S2
2. S1 S2 consistent
Obviously deal game compatible strategy profile. bargaining solution
F (G) compatible strategy profile G.
consider gains player strategy profile. Assume
strategy profile (S1 , S2 ) leads agreement, player payoff utility defined as:

otherwise.

words, ui (S) counts number top block demands covered Si .
Note payoff count individual demands. Specifically define utility
default disagreement point (, ) (0, 0).
5.2 Pareto Optimality
Based definition, easy see solution satisfies individual rationality (in sense game theory) game G, ui (Fi (G)) 0 = 1, 2.
consider Pareto efficiency.
Pareto optimality one important properties bargaining solution.
call compatible strategy profile (S1 , S2 ) game (strictly) Pareto optimal
exist compatible strategy profile (S10 , S20 ) game either u1 (S10 )
u1 (S1 ) & u2 (S20 ) > u2 (S2 ) u1 (S10 ) > u1 (S1 ) & u2 (S20 ) u2 (S2 ).
compatible strategy profile (S1 , S2 ) game weakly Pareto optimal
exist another compatible strategy profile (S10 , S20 ) game u1 (S10 ) > u1 (S1 )
u2 (S20 ) > u2 (S2 ).
Theorem 3 bargaining game G, F (G) weakly Pareto optimal.
Proof: Suppose compatible strategy profile (S1 , S2 ) G u1 (S1 ) >

u1 (F1 (G)) u2 (S2 ) > u2 (F2 (G)). u1 (S1 ) > max

Obviously, solution F satisfy strict Pareto optimality. instance,

need trade-off uniqueness solutions strict Pareto optimality (Conley

introduced Zhang (2007), map logically represented bargaining game
numerically represented bargaining game. mapping, feasible set
corresponds logically represented bargaining game non-convex unless demand
sets logical bargaining game consistent. Since solution unique solution,
cannot expect strictly Pareto optimal.
5.3 Restricted Symmetry

bargainers attitude towards risk. section, illustrate two case studies
problem solved using framework.
6.1 Case Study I: Bargainers Attitude towards Risk
Let us revisit bargaining game Example 4, demand sets X1 = {p, r}
X2 = {q, r}. Consider following variations preferences, reflect difference
players attitude towards risk (note different cases lead different games).
G1 : X1 = {{p}, {r}} X2 = {{q}, {r}}10
G2 : X2 = {{p, r}, {}} X2 = {{q}, {r}}
G3 : X3 = {{p}, {r}} X2 = {{q, r}, {}}
G4 : X4 = {{p, r}} X2 = {{q, r}}
easy calculate solutions games:
F (G1 ) = ({p}, {q})
F (G2 ) = ({p, r}, {q})
F (G3 ) = ({p}, {q, r})
F (G4 ) = (, )
G1 , players risk-averse, players rank conflicting item r

would gain disadvantage negotiation comparing risk-lover (see Roths book, 1979b,
p.35-60). G3 symmetrical G2 . G4 , players aggressive, therefore game
ends disagreement.
example, clear see bargainers attitude towards risk specified
model. risk-averse player would give demands likely conflict
demands player relatively lower priorities agreement likely

demands. Notice logic plays crucial role representation. Simply expressing
bargainers demands physical terms without specifying relation sufficient

According setting, solution bargaining game is:

solutions. indicates risk posture players embedded
model. fact, easily see player B aggressive ranks higher
conflicting items relatively higher player does. instance, player B ranks
equal share (50/50) 7th level player ranks 11th level.
seen example, ordering demands reflect
players gains demands represents players preference retaining abandoning demands. another significant difference bargaining model

One may ask whether player could get advantages cheating sense

opposite want (your demands) release ranking
