theorem team k mobile robots engaged patrol mission maximizes minimal ppd
following conditions satisfied time distance every two consecutive
robots equal b robots move direction speed
note condition b means robots move together direction e
change direction k robots change direction simultaneously
proof following lemma sucient combination conditions
b yield minimal distance two consecutive
robots along cyclic path
n
since n segments k robots k possibilities initial placement
robots along cycle robots homogenous regardless order
robots positioned uniformly along cycle time distance pair
consecutive robots n k minimal value reached therefore
clearly condition guarantees minimality
robots coordinated possible two consecutive robots along

nk ppd segments become higher
hand pair rj rj exists distance increases
total sum distances consecutive robots remains n hence minimal ppd

therefore way achieving minimal distance maximal ppd assuring
condition satised maintaining achieved satisfying condition b
since facing full knowledge adversary goal robots maximize

multi robot adversarial patrolling along fences
general work specically previous sections assumed robots travel
around closed circular area section discuss patrolling along open polyline
known fence patrol first discuss patrol dierent perimeter
patrol describe determining ppdi fence patrol assuming
robots perfect sensing capabilities nally provide
robots imperfect sensing
patrolling along closed polyline vs open polyline
following describe patrolling along open polyline challenging
patrolling cyclic environments closed polyline
rst reason lies fact robots required go back forth along
part parts open polyline elapsed time two visits
robot point along line almost twice long elapsed time
circular setting figure given two environments closed polyline circle
open polyline b note open polylines b c equivalent sense
robot travels one segment per time step regardless shape
section lines b total length l number
robots circular environment takes adversary l time units
penetrate never able penetrate even robots simply continuously travel
uniform distance however robots travel along open polyline
b maximal time duration two visits roboteven best case
l elmaliach shiloni kaminka therefore weaker adversary

figure illustration dierence patrolling along line patrolling along circle
dierent polylines

another reason added complication analyzing probability penetration
detection open polyline environments lies asymmetric nature traveling
segments along time circular environment robots coordinated switch
directions unison placement robots symmetric time unit therefore segments distance robot respect direction
probability penetration detection hence order calculate optimal way
movement case probability p turning around sucient consider
one section segments resulted p equivalent throughout execution
open polyline environment case probability penetration detection diers respect current location direction robot therefore
nds ppd segment needs calculate ppd function
p segment si possible initial location robot inside section
therefore matrix size ppd functions opposed vector
functions circular fence
determining ppdi open polyline fence
following framework multi robot patrol along open line proposed elmaliach
et al assume robot assigned patrol back forth along one section
segments given framework would compute optimal patrol
robots along section similar perimeter patrol case section describe
system markov chain see figure relative stochastic matrix since
robots directionality associated movement create two states
segment rst traveling segment clockwise direction second
traveling counterclockwise direction probability turning around end
section otherwise robot continue straight probability p
turn around probability p
note main dierence perimeter patrol calculation ppdi lies
number resulting ppdi functions perimeter patrol due symmetric nature
one ppdi function segment current location robot representing
probability robot arriving time units however ppdi depends
current location robot hence location robot functions
probability penetration detection therefore total functions compared

summary
presents multi robot patrolling strong full knowledge adversarial environments team robots required repeatedly visit
path basic case perimeter detect penetrations controlled
adversary assume robots act strong adversarial model adversary
full knowledge patrolling robots uses knowledge order penetrate
weakest spot patrol describe framework basic case multirobot patrol around closed polygon use framework developing polynomial
time optimal patrol e strengthens weakest spot
patrol framework extended order solve open
fence environment movement sensing robots
makes several assumptions allowing computation optimal strategy
patrolling robots one assumption rst order markovian strategy
patrolling robots although proving disproving optimality rst order markovian strategy hard could interesting examine case higher order markovian
strategies compare time complexity performance solution discussed
another direction future work involves non uniform environments
utility obtained detecting penetrations one hand succeeding penetration
uniform throughout environment challenges left future work
include handling heterogenous robots non linear environments
