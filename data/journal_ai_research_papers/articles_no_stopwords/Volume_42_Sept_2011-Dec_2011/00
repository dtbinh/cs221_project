manipulators complete knowledge votes appropriate complete

assume complete knowledge votes several reasons case
interesting consider first complete information likely special case uncertainty
model hence computational hardness complete information directly imply hardness
corresponding uncertainty model second hardness manipulation
coalition weighted votes complete information imply hardness manipulation
individual agent unweighted votes incomplete information conitzer et al third
assuming complete information factor complexity coming uncertainty model
focus instead computing manipulation
addition standard uniform random votes consider
two restricted types votes single peaked single troughed votes single peaked votes
candidates placed line agents preference candidate decreases distance
single preferred candidate single peaked preferences interesting several
perspectives first single peaked preferences likely occur number domains
example buying house might optimal price mind preference
house decreases distance price increases second single peaked preferences
easy elicit conitzer gives strategy eliciting single peaked preference
ordering linear number pairwise ranking questions third single peaked preferences prevent
certain problematic situations arising aggregating preferences particular prevent
existence condorcet cycles fact median candidate single peaked profile beats

looked manipulation single unweighted agent case stv coalition
weighted agents case veto voting many elections experiments easy
compute manipulation prove manipulation possible situations identified
manipulations computationally difficult depended election
hundreds candidates election tightly hung increase concern
computational complexity may significant barrier manipulation practice
lessons learnt study first whilst focused stv
veto rules similar behavior likely voting rules would instance interesting
