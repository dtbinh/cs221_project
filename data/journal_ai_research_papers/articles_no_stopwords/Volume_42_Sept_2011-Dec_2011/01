3. Belief Set Contraction
commence discussion belief set contraction, aim describe
contraction knowledge level (Gardenfors, 1988), i.e., independently beliefs
represented syntactically. Thus, contraction defined belief sets.

easy verify K = |= (Gardenfors, 1988).
Since unique method choosing possibly different remainder sets,
presupposition existence suitable selection function so:
Definition 3 (Selection Functions) selection function set K (partial)
function P(P(LP )) P(P(LP ))
(K) = {K} K = ;
(K) K otherwise.

Selection functions provide mechanism identifying remainder sets judged
appropriate. resulting contraction obtained taking intersection

Theorem 1 (Alchourron et al., 1985) Every belief set partial meet contraction satisfies Postulates (K 1)(K 6). Conversely, every belief set contraction satisfies
Postulates (K 1)(K 6) belief set partial meet contraction.
Hansson (1994) shown Postulates (K 1)(K 6) characterize kernel

Clearly, Core-retainment slightly weaker Relevance. indeed, thus follows
base partial meet contractions base kernel contractions, following
example Hansson (1999) shows, base kernel contractions base partial

Example 3 Let B = {p, p q, p q}. B (p q) = {{p, p q}, {p q, p q}}.
incision function B (B (p q)) = {p q, p q},
B (p q) = {p}. hand, B(p q) = {{p, p q}, {p q}},
follows base partial meet contraction B (p q) yields either {p, p q}, {p q},
{p, p q} {p q} = , none equal B (p q) = {p}.

Delgrande (2008) investigated two distinct classes contraction functions Horn

Recent work Delgrande Wassermann (2010) draws inspiration semantic
representation remainder sets. classical AGM approach, remainder set
obtained semantically adding models belief set H counter-model
formula contraction. Horn clauses, construction necessarily lead
sets correspond remainder sets. because, known Horn logic, given
two models m1 , m2 Horn belief set H, model m1 u m2 model H,
m1 u m2 denotes model atoms true precisely atoms
true m1 m2 . illustrate this, consider following example:
Example 5 (Delgrande & Wassermann, 2010) Let P = {p, q, r} let Horn belief set H = CnHL (p q). Consider candidates H (p q). three e-remainder
sets, given Horn closures p (r q), q (r p), (p q) (q p) (r
p) (r q). infra e-remainder set contains closure (r p) (r q).
Example 5, unique model set {p, q, r} countermodel p q. add
models H close u result represents Horn belief set,
obtain set models formula p, cannot e-remainder set,
e-remainder set (CnHL (p (r q))) containing it. means approach
based e-remainder sets cannot contraction operators behaviour

Delgrande Wassermann propose mimic semantic construction classical
