two observations interval say admits feasible b matching
corresponding graph h feasible b matching
first admits feasible b matching every

reduced upper bounds gives feasible b matching
second size corresponding maximum feasible bmatching cannot size maximum
feasible b matching smaller exists
since lower bounds met ii exists size least
see latter note decrease size maximum feasible matching cannot
caused upper bounds bs v bs v v vh remains shown
increase v v x smaller maximum b matching since
