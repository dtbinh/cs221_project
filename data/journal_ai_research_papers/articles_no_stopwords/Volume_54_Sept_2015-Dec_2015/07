introduction
recently samantha leung halpern leung suggested representing uncertainty set weighted probability measures suggested way making decisions
representation uncertainty maximizing weighted regret however
answer apparently simpler question given representation uncertainty
mean event e likely event e
explain issues start reviewing halpern leung
frequently observed many situations agents uncertainty adequately described single probability measure specifically single
measure may adequate representing agents ignorance example
seems big difference coin known fair coin whose bias agent
know yet agent use single measure represent uncertainty
cases would seem measure assigns heads probability
would used
one suggested representing ignorance use set p
probability measures idea old one apparently going back work boole
ch ostrogradsky authors e g campos moral
couso moral walley gilboa schmeidler levi walley
additionally required set p convex p
b b b benefit representing
uncertainty general single number range numbers allows us
distinguish certainty coin fair case uncertainty heads
represented single number knowing probability heads could
anywhere say

example consider agent believes
coin may slight bias thus although unlikely completely fair
close fair represent set probability measures suppose
agent quite sure bias could course take
p consist measures give heads probability
agent know possible biases exactly
consider possible small even confident bias
representation cannot take account possibility
views biases closer likely biases
second well known concern learning suppose agent initially
considers possible measures gives heads probability
starts tossing coin sees first tosses heads seems
agent consider bias greater likely bias less
use standard updating sets probability measures
halpern condition measures observation since coin
tosses viewed independent agent continue believe probability
next coin toss observation impact far learning
predict better set p stays matter observation made
well known solution putting measure uncertainty
probability measures p idea long history one special case put
second order probability probability measures see good discussion
references example agent express fact
bias coin likely close far addition
learning dealt straightforward conditioning
leads essentially seems ambiguity agent might feel
outcome coin toss seems disappeared example suppose
agent idea bias obvious second order probability use
uniform probability possible biases cannot talk probability
coin heads set probabilities single probability expected
probability heads agent idea bias coin
know believe expected probability heads course one use
single probability measure describe uncertainty symmetry considerations dictate
one ascribes equal likelihood heads tails similarly one
put single second order probability set possible biases uniform probability
seems obvious choice moreover interest making decisions
maximizing expected utility expected probability take
agents ignorance account kyburg pearl even argued
need second order probability probabilities whatever done
second order probability already done basic probability
nevertheless comes decision making seem useful use
represents ambiguity still maintaining features secondorder probability probabilities idea goes back least gardenfors sahlin
walley suggested putting possibility measure dubois prade
zadeh probability measures essentially done cattaneo
chateauneuf faro de cooman authors others


fiweighted regret likelihood

klibanoff et al maccheroni et al nau proposed approaches
decision making representations uncertainty
leung similarly suggested putting weights probability measure p since
assumed weights normalized supremum weights
weights viewed possibility measure set p finite
normalize view weights second order probabilities secondorder probabilities weights vary time information acquired
example start state complete ignorance modeled assuming
probability measures weight update weights making observation
ob take weight measure pr relative likelihood ob pr
true measure see section details called likelihood updating
halpern leung true underlying measure generating data
time weight true measure approaches weight measures
approaches thus allows learning natural way example
actual bias coin example matter initial weights
long positive weight weight would almost surely converge
observations made weight measures would
course exactly would happen second order probability p
weights used represent fact probabilities set p
likely others
essentially others considered representation uncertainty set
probability weights leung suggested way representation
make decisions however different suggested earlier
regret standard decision making introduced
independently niehans savage uncertainty represented
set p probability measures regret works follows act
measure pr p compute expected regret respect pr
difference expected utility expected utility act
gives highest expected utility respect pr associate act
worst case expected regret measures pr p compare acts
respect worst case expected regret weights picture modify
procedure multiplying expected regret associated measure pr weight
pr compare acts according worst case weighted expected regret
making decisions different others mentioned incorporate
likelihood probabilities moreover weights way means cannot
simply replace set weighted probability measures single probability measure
objections kyburg pearl apply
leung halpern leung seems reasonable
things number examples interest provide axiomatization decision making
since sets weighted probabilities certainly intended way
representing uncertainty seems natural ask whether used represent
relative likelihood direct way surprisingly something largely considered
earlier papers sets weighted probabilities since focus decision making
although work nau discussed section exception


fihalpern

representing relative likelihood straightforward uncertainty represented
single probability measure e likely e exactly probability e greater
probability e sets probability measures approaches
considered literature common takes e likely
e lower probability e greater lower probability e lower
probability e worst case probability taken measures p see section
could compare e e respect upper probabilities best case
probability respect measures p another possibility take e
likely e pr e pr e measures pr p gives partial order
likelihood uncertainty represented set weighted
probability measures
define notion relative likelihood uncertainty represented
set weighted probability measures generalizes ordering defined lower
probability natural way define generalization upper probability
associate event e two numbers analogues lower upper probability
uncertainty represented single measure two numbers coincide general
interval thought representing degree ambiguity
likelihood e indeed special case weights numbers
essentially lower upper probability technically minus lower
upper probability respectively interestingly assigning likelihood
decision making essentially analogue
defining probability terms expected utility rather way around
viewed generalizing probability lower probability
time allowing natural updating
interested representation ever probability use make decisions arguably wouldnt much interest
work leung already shows sets weighted probabilities used decisionmaking add nothing question however often
talk likelihood events quite independent use decision making
clearly many examples physics issue arises ai applications well typical
explanation rather b thought event e
likely f computations expectation clearly involve representation
uncertainty arise many ai applications thus analogue probability seems
important useful right
rest organized follows reviewing relevant material

idea putting possibility probabilities p determined likelihood appears
work moral although consider general dealing sets weighted
probability measures
almost surely due fact probability approaching observations made possible agent make misleading observations representative
true measure depends set possible observations rich enough allow
agent ultimately discover true measure generating observations example agent
never learn distributions outcomes die never gets observe die lands
since learning focus make notion rich enough precise
