Abstract
Linguistic borrowing phenomenon transferring linguistic constructions (lexical,
phonological, morphological, syntactic) donor language recipient language result contacts communities speaking different languages. Borrowed
words found languages, andin contrast cognate relationshipsborrowing

vocabulary borrowed unrelated language Arabic). work, develop

NLP.
advocate novel approach automatically constructing language-specific resources,
even languages resources raw text corpora. main motivation
research linguistic borrowingthe phenomenon transferring linguistic constructions
(lexical, phonological, morphological, syntactic) donor language recipient
language result contacts communities speaking different languages (Thomason
& Kaufman, 2001). Borrowed words (also called loanwords, e.g., Figure 1) lexical
items adopted another language integrated (nativized) recipient language.
Borrowing occurs typically part minority language speakers, language
wider communication minority language (Sankoff, 2002); one reason
donor languages often bridge resource-rich resource-limited languages.
Borrowing distinctive pervasive phenomenon: languages borrowed
languages point lifetime, borrowed words constitute large fraction
(1070%) language lexicons (Haspelmath, 2009).
Loanword nativization primarily phonological process. Donor words undergo phonological repairs adapt foreign word segmental, phonotactic, suprasegmental
morpho-phonological constraints recipient language (Holden, 1976; Van Coetsem, 1988;
Ahn & Iverson, 2004; Kawahara, 2008; Hock & Joseph, 2009; Calabrese & Wetzels, 2009;
Kang, 2011, inter alia). Common phonological repair strategies include feature/phoneme
epenthesis, elision, degemination, assimilation. speakers encounter foreign
word (either lemma inflected form), analyze morphologically stem,
morphological loanword integration thus amounts selecting appropriate donor
surface form (out existing inflections lemma), applying recipient
language morphology (Repetti, 2006). Adapted loanwords freely undergo recipient
language inflectional derivational processes. Nouns borrowed preferentially,
parts speech, affixes, inflections, phonemes (Whitney, 1881; Moravcsik,
1978; Myers-Scotton, 2002, p. 240).

2. Motivation
task modeling borrowing under-explored computational linguistics, although
important practical applications lends modeling variety
established computational techniques. section first situate task respect
two closely related research directions: modeling transliteration modeling cognate
forms. motivate new line research proposed work: modeling borrowing.
2.1 Borrowing vs. Transliteration
Borrowing transliteration. Transliteration refers writing different orthography,
whereas borrowing refers expanding language include words adapted another
language. Unlike borrowing, transliteration amenable orthographicrather
morpho-phonologicalfeatures, although transliteration prone phonetic
adaptation (Knight & Graehl, 1998). Borrowed words might begun transliterations,
characteristic borrowed words become assimilated linguistic system
recipient language, became regular content words, example, orange

sugar English words borrowed Arabic l. ' PAK (nArnj) Q@ (Alskr), respectively.
Whatever historical origins, synchronically, words indistinguishable
speakers words native ancestral forms language. Thus, morphophonological processes must accounted borrowing models complex
required transliteration models.
2.2 Borrowing vs. Inheritance
Cognates words related languages inherited single word common
ancestral language (the proto-language). Loanwords, hand, occur
languages, either related not, historically came contact. modeling
perspective, cognates borrowed words require separate investigation loanwords
likely display marginal phonotactic (and phonological) patterns inherited
lexical items. Theoretical analysis cognates tended concerned diachronic
point view, modeling word changes across time. immense scientific
interest, language processing applications arguably better served models synchronic
processes, peculiar loanword analysis.

intersecting candidate set recipient pronunciation lexicon; (3) assuming
