motivation
task modeling borrowing explored computational linguistics although
important practical applications lends modeling variety
established computational techniques section first situate task respect
two closely related directions modeling transliteration modeling cognate
forms motivate line proposed work modeling borrowing
borrowing vs transliteration
borrowing transliteration transliteration refers writing different orthography
whereas borrowing refers expanding language include words adapted another
language unlike borrowing transliteration amenable orthographicrather
morpho phonologicalfeatures although transliteration prone phonetic
adaptation knight graehl borrowed words might begun transliterations
characteristic borrowed words become assimilated linguistic system
recipient language became regular content words example orange

sugar english words borrowed arabic l pak narnj q alskr respectively
whatever historical origins synchronically words indistinguishable
speakers words native ancestral forms language thus morphophonological processes must accounted borrowing complex
required transliteration
borrowing vs inheritance
cognates words related languages inherited single word common
ancestral language proto language loanwords hand occur
languages related historically came contact modeling
perspective cognates borrowed words require separate investigation loanwords
likely display marginal phonotactic phonological patterns inherited
lexical items theoretical analysis cognates tended concerned diachronic
point view modeling word changes across time immense scientific
interest language processing applications arguably better served synchronic
processes peculiar loanword analysis
