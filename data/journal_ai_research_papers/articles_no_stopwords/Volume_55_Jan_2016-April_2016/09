introduction
crowdsourcing harnesses human intelligence common sense complete tasks
difficult accomplish computers alone crowdsourcing markets amazon mechanical turk crowdflower platforms designed match available human workers
tasks complete platforms requesters may post tasks would
completed along amount money willing pay workers
choose whether accept available tasks complete work
course human workers equal human produced work tasks
proofreading english text easier workers others requiring less
effort produce high quality additionally workers dedicated
others willing spend extra time make sure task completed properly encourage
high quality requesters may set quality contingent bonus payments top
