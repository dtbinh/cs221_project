abstract
large scale annotated corpora prerequisite developing high performance nlp
systems corpora expensive produce limited size often demanding linguistic
expertise use text rewriting means increasing amount labeled
data available model training method uses automatically extracted rewrite rules
comparable corpora bitexts generate multiple versions sentences annotated
gold standard labels apply idea semantic role labeling
model trained rewritten data outperforms state art conll
benchmark dataset

multiple versions role annotated sentences whilst preserving original semantic roles
therefore expand training data wide range syntactic variations

rewrites e rewrites preserve labels gold standard intuition
given large number possible rewrites srl model general label
accurate rewrites correctly mis label erroneous sentences due finding
confusing thus compare semantic role labels produced model
labels corresponding predicate argument pairs gold corpus provide
samples train binary classifier svm learns predict rewrites

rewritten sentence classed positive sample srl model able label

statement extraction constituents sub tree parse tree identified extracted context rewritten complete sentence typically shorter
simpler although necessarily
compression original sentence rewritten compressing constituents
parse tree typically deleting nodes
insertion elements added parse tree significant chunks
text would semantic role information practice insertions
often additional punctuation clarify scope phrases simple structure

target sentences truly related expected source sentence

fully generate target sentence practice means addition requiring
strictly synchronous structure source target sentences cannot assume
alignment source target root nodes require surjective alignment
target nodes nodes source parse tree able describe structural mismatches
non isomorphic tree pairs grammar rules comprise trees arbitrary depth
fragments mapped represent transformation functions synchronous
tree substitution grammar formalism eisner
synchronous tree substitution grammar stsg defines space valid pairs
source target parse trees rules specify map tree fragments source parse
tree fragments target tree recursively free context following cohn

synchronous context free grammar would limited one level elementary

synchronously deriving original aligned tree pairs removing identity rules
