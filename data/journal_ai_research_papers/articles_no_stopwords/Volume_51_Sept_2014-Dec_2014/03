qualitative usually represents spatial information introducing relation model
domain spatial entities could points line segments rectangles arbitrary
regions literature relation model often called qualitative calculus ligozat
renz contains finite set jointly exhaustive pairwise disjoint jepd relations
defined domain past three decades dozens spatial relation
proposed literature cohn renz chen cohn liu wang ouyang yu
many qualitative calculi approximate spatial entities points convenient
representing spatial direction distance positions providing extent objects
small compared distance apart inappropriate far shapes topology
spatial objects concerned represent spatial entities dimensional
bounded regions real plane may holes multiple connected components
literature spatial calculi focus one single aspect space e g topology direction distance position shape topological relations relations invariant
homeomorphisms scale rotation translation widely acknowledged topological relations crucial importance one influential formalism topological relations
region connection calculus rcc randell cui cohn one primitive binary
connectedness relation set eight jepd topological relations defined rcc
calculus known rcc algebra according different interpretations connectedness
calculus may different variants say two closed regions weakly connected share least common point say strongly connected intersection
least one dimensional accordingly address two resulting rcc algebras weak
strong rcc algebras respectively convenience denote weak rcc algebra
rcc strong one rcc
importance distinction strong weak rcc becomes clear analysing
different ways defining neighbourhood pixels commonly used computer vision connectedness refers pixels horizontally vertically connected pixel
connectedness includes diagonally neighbouring pixels well distinction corresponds
nicely distinction strong weak rcc connectedness considers connections point connectedness considers connections along line onedimensional therefore use strong weak rcc similar way use connectedness depending requirements application hand
rcc algebra represents topological information spatial objects many
practical applications however kinds relations often used together topological
