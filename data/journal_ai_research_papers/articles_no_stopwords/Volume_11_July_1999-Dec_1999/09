abstract

recent literature artificial intelligence intensive effort
spent algebras qualitative relations used representation temporal
spatial knowledge classifying computational complexity reasoning
subsets algebras main purpose researches describe
restricted set maximal tractable subalgebras ideally exhaustive fashion
respect hosting algebras
introduce novel algebra reasoning spatial congruence
satisfiability spatial algebra mc np complete present
complete classification tractability algebra individuation three
maximal tractable subclasses one containing basic relations three algebras
formed relations form full algebra

introduction
qualitative spatial reasoning received increasing amount interest recent
literature main reason already observed jonsson drakengren
probably spatial reasoning proved applicable real world
geographical information systems egenhofer grigni papadias papadimitriou
molecular biology cui
specific stress qualitative reasoning space observed zimmermann
justified fact qualitative spatial relations treated eciently
quantitative counterparts seem closer model relations
humans adopt spatial reasoning
even though qualitative spatial reasoning extended literature spite
relatively short history certain aspects discipline neglected particular
exhaustive computational perspective developed qualitative morphological
reasoning space term morphological reasoning intended suggest reasoning
internal structure objects case spatial reasoning includes
reasoning size shape internal topology spatial regions
purpose present work analyse complexity reasoning relations
congruence actual partial spatial regions spatial algebra
mc preliminarly analysed cristani
algebra mc constraint algebra ladkin maddux qualitative
reasoning morphological relation congruence two spatial regions

relation eq defined randell cui cohn analogously egenhofer
franzosa becomes identity unique name assumption geometry
topology conversely allow kinds equivalence relations relations weaker
identity namely equivalence classes induce larger singletons
simplest weakening define congruence relation even though
relation studied borgo guarino masolo cristani mutinelli
complexity reasoning subalgebras yet deeply investigated
reason introduce relation provide algebraic structure host
relations particular relations compare regions even
congruent overlapped roto translating one interior
many cases knowledge represent systems necessarily
includes internal structures consider following example

example
gis dedicated representation geographical data industrial sites
system structure factories described means attributes
including size shape one users wants query system opportunity
moving factory works present site one site
prefabricated facilities already exist consists deciding preserve
topological layout factory minimise costs buying engines substitute
cannot fit facilities
order reason system made able represent
qualitative relations old site parts establishing particular whether
spatial regions occupied engines congruent even congruent part
ones chosen hosting factory site
clearly cannot use topological information since spatial region presently occupied
engine surely disjoint region engine going occupy
site information insucient deciding whether site able host
engine
though metric information involved final decision moving factory
qualitative reasoning used initial design phase
figure give pictorial representation one possible situation make
decisions need represent spatial information topological


algebra mc used represent four basic relations built
equivalence relation congruence consider roto translation region x
respect region four possible situations arise
least one roto translation x coincides two regions
congruent
least one roto translation x coincides proper part
region x congruent proper part


fithe complexity reasoning spatial congruence

figure pictorial representation relations analysed gis moving
factory old site note production lines
facility may suitable hosting certain engines

least one roto translation coincides proper part x
region x proper part congruent
none region x cannot perfectly overlapped
would stress three main aspects relations
relations established two spatial regions position space
specific need regions close particular topological relation provided relation compatible congruence relations
purely morphological
equality two regions implies congruence relation proper part excludes
morphological relations congruent part case
morphological side region congruent part another region even
disjoint happen congruence already stated point

even two regions size may case regions
congruent holds partial congruence possible region
smaller another one cannot overlapped
practical relevance algebra proved exhibiting many examples
especially coming gis deal reasoning
congruence two dimensional space domain kind congruence assume
weakest one roto translability three dimensional congruence type
natural notion three dimensional congruence isometry much general
roto translability example left right hands congruent simplified
assumption shape size cannot roto translated
