Cox's argument.
Suppose U1 U2 U3 U4 . Let x = Bel(U4jU3), = Bel(U3jU2), z = Bel(U2jU1 ),
u1 = Bel(U4 jU2), u2 = Bel(U3 jU1), u3 = Bel(U4 jU1). A2, u1 = F (x; ),
u2 = F (y; z ), u3 = F (x; u2) = F (u1 ; z ). follows F (x; F (y; z )) = F (F (x; ); z ).
Note argument show F (x; F (y; z )) = F (F (x; ); z ) x; y; z .

Unfortunately, seem to.
Later argument, Cox shows must satisfy following two functional
equations sets U1 U2 U3 :
[S (Bel(U2jU1 ))] = Bel(U2 jU1)

problem approach requires us extend Bel events never

second variant assumes Bel defined one domain W ,
domains (or least, large family domains); functions F
uniform across domains. precisely, would get following.

Theorem 5: Suppose function Bel defined domains W set W

domains, exist functions F F satisfy A1 A2
domains W 2 W , Par1{4 hold F , following variant Par5 holds:

Par50 . 0 ff; fi; 1 > 0, exists W 2 W sets U1 ; U2; U3; U4 W

Bel uniformly isomorphic probability measure, exists function
g : IR ! IR W 2 W , g Bel probability measure
W U; V W ,
g (Bel(V jU )) g (Bel(U )) = g (Bel(V

\ U )) U 6= ;.

advantage formulation W consist finite domains; never
venture infinite (although W would include infinitely many
finite domains). conception one function Bel defined uniformly family
domains seems consistent philosophy Cox Jaynes (see, particular,
(Jaynes, 1996)).
hypotheses Theorems 4 5 may seem reasonable others
(at least, readers!), note still essentially require Par5 and,
variants Cox's Theorem aware of, disallow notion belief
finitely many gradations. One justify notion belief takes values
[0; 1] continuity considerations (again, assuming one accepts linearly-ordered
notion belief), still nontrivial requirement.4
stop point leave reader form beliefs.
