abstract

assumptions needed prove cox theorem discussed examined
sets assumptions cox style theorem proved provided although
rather strong arguably natural

recently wrote halpern casting doubt compelling justification
probability provided cox celebrated theorem cox received
seems least surprising amount response article attempt
clarify degree think cox theorem salvaged respond glaring
inaccuracy part pointed snow fortunately inaccuracy
affect correctness interpretation
tried write note enough detail read independently
earlier encourage reader consult earlier well two
major sources cox paris details discussion
basic situation cox goal try possible derive
rules probability two quite primitive notions independent notion
ensemble appeal rather immediately common sense cox
end starts function bel associates real number pair u v
subsets domain w u write bel v ju rather bel u v since
think bel v ju belief credibility likelihood v given u cox theorem
informally understood states bel satisfies two reasonable restrictions
bel must isomorphic probability measure first one says belief v
complement denoted v given u function belief v given u second says
belief v v given u function belief v given v u belief
v given u formally assume functions ir ir f ir ir

bel v ju bel v ju u u v w
bel v v ju f bel v jv u bel v ju v u u v v w
bel probability measure take x x f x xy
going notice cox claim bel probability measure
isomorphic probability measure formally means
continuous one one onto function g ir ir g bel probability measure
w
g bel v ju g bel u g bel v u u

reasonable took prove cox theorem
indeed would compelling argument use probability
unfortunately well known suce prove
cox theorem dubois prade give example function bel defined
finite domain satisfies f x min x x x
isomorphic probability measure thus prove cox theorem need
additional assumptions
hard dig cox papers exactly additional assumptions
proofs need false quite strong
assumptions see suggests proofs given
cox style theorems best incomplete require additional assumptions
beyond stated authors see previous discussion goal
note clarify takes prove cox style theorem giving number
hypotheses proved positive versions theorem
state proved straightforward way adapting proof given paris
one correct rigorous proof aware
hypotheses stated clearly nevertheless believe worth identifying
variants since philosophically quite different
paris proves cox theorem following additional assumptions

par w must infinite par cannot satisfied finite domains natural
reasonable course eye beholder strike natural


ficox theorem revisited

reasonable assumption obvious sense words particularly true since
many domains interest ai application areas finite version cox
theorem uses par simply applicable domains weaken par
cox require anything par require times
f twice differentiable continuous second derivative twice
differentiable differentiability assumptions perhaps compelling continuity assumptions seem reasonable technical restrictions unfortunately
counterexample give earlier shows assumptions suce
prove cox theorem following

theorem halpern function bel finite domain w functions

f satisfying respectively

bel v ju u
x x strictly decreasing infinitely differentiable
f infinitely differentiable nondecreasing argument strictly increasing argument moreover f commutative f x f x
f x f x x

however bel isomorphic probability measure

understand makes counterexample tick role par useful
review part cox argument course proof cox shows forces f
associative function
f x f z f f x z



cox argument
suppose u u u u let x bel u ju bel u ju z bel u ju
u bel u ju u bel u ju u bel u ju u f x
u f z u f x u f u z follows f x f z f f x z
note argument f x f z f f x z x z
shows equality holds x z exist u u u
u x bel u ju bel u ju z bel u ju par guarantees
set x z dense combined continuity f assumed
par tells us holds x z
claimed earlier none authors proved variants
cox theorem including cox aczel reichenbach seemed aware
need make hold x z wrong including cox list
glaring inaccuracy referred snow points cox actually
realize f must satisfy x z explicitly makes assumption
cox never collects assumptions one place somewhat dicult tell exactly
thinks needs proof later
pointed earlier aczel recognized later work aczel daroczy




fihalpern

certain point first cox although make assumption
explicitly informal later cox
unfortunately although cox escapes criticism recognizing need make
assumption make theorem less palatable indeed anything
makes matters worse associativity rather strong assumption cox shows
fact cox shows f associative continuous second derivatives
f isomorphic multiplication exists function f constant c
cf f x f x f let stress conclusion f isomorphic
multiplication follows fact associative continuous second
derivatives nothing course time willing assume
function f isomorphic multiplication satisfies
well way showing bel isomorphic probability measure future
reference remark paris shows lemma par par par par
suce f isomorphic multiplication take c
case suppose willing strengthen par require f associative
well continuous strictly increasing suce get rid par altogether
unfortunately seem
later argument cox shows must satisfy following two functional
equations sets u u u
bel u ju bel u ju




bel u ju bel u ju bel u ju bel u ju bel u ju bel u ju

means x exist sets u u u
x bel u ju bel u ju






ys x x x

cox actually wants equations hold x paris shows follows
par paris argument par shown continuous see

paris lemma combined par easily gives us holds
follows par fact f must isomorphic multiplication
mentioned latter fact shown paris follow par par par
par without par need assume hold x
cox
proof given paris theorem use made par deriving
associativity f fact satisfies thus immediately get
following variant cox theorem
actually cox starts derives symmetric functional equation ys x
xs x rather latter functional equation assumes holds x
replace x x everywhere use get



ficox theorem revisited

theorem par hold addition f associative
satisfies x bel isomorphic probability measure
stress place constraints f act range
bel elements x form bel u subset u w associativity
place constraints global behavior f f
act even arguments range bel example give earlier
viewed giving bel possible f satisfying
f satisfying associative
get variant even closer cox shows replacing par
assumption f twice differentiable note need make continuity
monotonicity differentiability assumptions f mentioned earlier dubois
prade bel isomorphic probability function x
x f x min x min function differentiable fortiori continuous
twice differentiable strictly increasing coordinate
although nondecreasing
advantage replacing par requirement f associative
satisfy variant cox theorem applies even w finite
hand hard least view natural requirement
assumptions associativity f idempotency e certainly natural
mathematical assumptions justification requiring seems
provably follow assumptions certain tuples range
bel reasonable compelling course reader judge
case assumptions needed highlighted anyone cox theorem
justification probability rather swept carpet requirement
must satisfy even mentioned snow let alone discussed snow
alone seem mentioned discussion cox
paris course avoid mentioning requiring
x x cox however makes less compelling
number variants cox theorem correct discussed halpern
section let conclude formalizing two apply finite domains
use par slight variants rather assuming f must associative
must satisfy pairs x
first essentially assumes extend finite domain infinite domain
adding suciently many irrelevant propositions tosses fair coin
observed earlier type extendability argument fairly standard
example made savage course justifying one axioms
preference snow essentially uses well formally gives us following
variant cox theorem whose proof trivial variant theorem

theorem given function bel domain w suppose exists domain w w
function bel extending bel defined subsets w hold
bel subsets u v v w par hold bel bel hence
bel isomorphic probability measure



fihalpern

requires us extend bel events never
interested considering first place way guaranteed
continue satisfy par
second variant assumes bel defined one domain w
domains least large family domains functions f
uniform across domains precisely would get following

theorem suppose function bel defined domains w set w

domains exist functions f f satisfy
domains w w par hold f following variant par holds

par exists w w sets u u u u w
u u u u u jbel u ju ffj jbel u ju j
jbel u ju j less
bel uniformly isomorphic probability measure exists function
g ir ir w w g bel probability measure
w u v w
g bel v ju g bel u g bel v

u u

advantage formulation w consist finite domains never
venture infinite although w would include infinitely many
finite domains conception one function bel defined uniformly family
domains seems consistent philosophy cox jaynes see particular
jaynes
hypotheses theorems may seem reasonable others
least readers note still essentially require par
variants cox theorem aware disallow notion belief
finitely many gradations one justify notion belief takes values
continuity considerations assuming one accepts linearly ordered
notion belief still nontrivial requirement
stop point leave reader form beliefs
