sub taxonomies e g biological categories much denser others example
wordnet miller fellbaum widely used broad coverage semantic network

similarity information content

let c set concepts taxonomy permitting multiple inheritance intuitively
one key similarity two concepts extent share information indicated taxonomy highly specific concept subsumes
edge counting method captures indirectly since minimal path links two nodes long means necessary go high taxonomy
abstract concepts order least upper bound example wordnet nickel
dime subsumed coin whereas specific superclass nickel
credit card share medium exchange see figure feature setting
e g tversky would ected explicit shared features nickels dimes

table similarity tobacco computed maximizing information content

discussion

experimental previous section suggest measuring semantic similarity
information content provides better traditional method
simply counting number intervening links
measure without however simple edge counting
measure sometimes produces spuriously high similarity measures words basis
inappropriate word senses example table shows word similarity several words
tobacco tobacco alcohol similar drugs tobacco sugar
less similar though entirely dissimilar since classified substances
arises however similarity rating tobacco horse word horse
used slang term heroin information similarity maximized
path length minimized two words categorized narcotics
contrary intuition
cases probably relatively rare however example illustrates
general concern measuring similarity words really relationship among
word senses matters similarity measure able take account
absence reliable choosing appropriate word senses
straightforward way information setting consider concepts
nouns belong rather taking single maximally informative class
suggests defining measure weighted word similarity follows
wsimff w w

x



ci log p ci



fcig set concepts dominating w w sense word
weighting function concepts pi ci measure similarity

takes information account previous one rather relying
single concept maximum information content allows class representing shared
properties contribute information content according value ci intuitively
values measure relevance example computing wsimff tobacco horse
ci would range concepts tobacco horse instances including
narcotic drug artifact life form etc everyday context one might expect low
values narcotic drug context say newspaper article
drug dealers weights concepts might quite high although possible
include weighted word similarity comparison section since noun pairs
judged without context section provides discussion weighting function
