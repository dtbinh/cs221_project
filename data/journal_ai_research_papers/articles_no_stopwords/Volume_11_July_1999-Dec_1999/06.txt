1. Introduction
Research formalization commonsense reasoning pointed need formalizing agents able reason introspectively knowledge ignorance
(Moore, 1985; Levesque, 1990). Modal epistemic logics thus proposed,
modalities interpreted terms knowledge belief. Generally speaking, conclusions introspective agent able draw depend knows
know. Hence, conclusion may retracted new facts added
agent's knowledge. reason, many nonmonotonic modal formalisms
proposed order characterize reasoning abilities introspective agent.
Among nonmonotonic modal logics proposed literature, logic minimal
belief negation failure MBNF (Lifschitz, 1991, 1994) one studied formalisms (Chen, 1994; Bochman, 1995; Beringer & Schaub, 1993). Roughly speaking,
logic built adding first-order logic two distinct modalities, \minimal belief"
modality B \negation failure" modality . logic thus obtained characterized terms nice model-theoretic semantics. MBNF used order
give declarative semantics general classes logic programs (Lifschitz & Woo,
1992; Schwarz & Lifschitz, 1993; Inoue & Sakama, 1994), generalize stable model
semantics negation failure logic programming (Gelfond & Lifschitz, 1988, 1990,
1991). Also, MBNF viewed extension theory epistemic queries
databases (Reiter, 1990), deals problem querying first-order database
knowledge. Due ability expressing many features nonmonotonic
logics (Lifschitz, 1994; Schwarz & Lifschitz, 1993), MBNF generally considered unifying framework several nonmonotonic formalisms, including default logic, autoepistemic
logic, circumscription, epistemic queries, logic programming.

Although several aspects logic MBNF thoroughly investigated (Schwarz

programming (Eiter & Gottlob, 1995), several McDermott Doyle's logics (Marek
& Truszczynski, 1993). shown following, result implies minimal
knowledge computationally harder negation failure.
Moreover, study subclass MBNF theories, i.e. MBNF theories without nested occurrences modalities, showing case logical implication p2 complete. case interesting one logic programming viewpoint.
Indeed, implies that, stable model semantics, increasing syntax program

Furthermore, provide algorithms reasoning MBNF fragment,

2. Logic MBNF

section brie recall logic MBNF (Lifschitz, 1994), modal logic
two epistemic operators: \minimal belief" modality B \negation failure"
(also called \negation default") modality . use L denote fixed propositional
language built usual way from: (i) alphabet propositional symbols; (ii)
symbols true, false; (iii) propositional connectives _; ^; :; . denote LM

modalities, exists subformula ' lies within scope exactly
modalities.
denote LSM set subjective MBNF formulas, i.e. subset formulas
LM occurrence propositional symbol lies within scope least one
modality, L1M set MBNF formulas, set formulas LM
propositional symbol lies within scope exactly one modality. call

positive formulas LSM .
recall notion MBNF model. interpretation set propositional
symbols. MBNF structure triple (I; Mb ; Mn ), interpretation (also called
initial world) Mb ; Mn non-empty sets interpretations (worlds). Satisfiability
formula MBNF structure defined inductively follows:
1. ' propositional symbol, ' satisfied (I; Mb ; Mn ) iff ' 2 ;
2. :' satisfied (I; Mb ; Mn ) iff ' satisfied (I; Mb ; Mn );

3. '1 ^ '2 satisfied (I; Mb ; Mn ) iff '1 satisfied (I; Mb ; Mn ) '2 satisfied
(I; Mb ; Mn );

4. '1 _ '2 satisfied (I; Mb ; Mn ) iff either '1 satisfied (I; Mb ; Mn ) '2
satisfied (I; Mb ; Mn );
5. '1 '2 satisfied (I; Mb ; Mn ) iff either '1 satisfied (I; Mb ; Mn ) '2
satisfied (I; Mb ; Mn );
6. B' satisfied (I; Mb ; Mn ) iff, every J 2 Mb , ' satisfied (J; Mb ; Mn );

7. ' satisfied (I; Mb ; Mn ) iff exists J 2 Mn ' satisfied
(J; Mb ; Mn ).
write (I; Mb ; Mn ) j= ' indicate ' satisfied (I; Mb ; Mn ). say
theory LM satisfied (I; Mb ; Mn ) (and write (I; Mb ; Mn ) j= ) iff formula

order relate MBNF structures standard interpretation structures modal
logic (i.e. Kripke structures), remark that, due notion satisfiability,
consider sets Mb , Mn MBNF interpretation structure two distinct
universal Kripke structures, i.e. possible-world structures world connected
worlds structure. fact, since accessibility relation structure

set interpretations contained it. recall class universal Kripke
structures characterizes logic S5 (Marek & Truszczynski, 1993, Theorem 7.52).
nonmonotonic character MBNF obtained imposing following preference
semantics interpretation structures satisfying given theory.

Definition 2.1 structure (I; M; ), 6= ;, MBNF model theory
LM iff (I; M; ) j= and, interpretation J set interpretations
0, 0 (J; 0 ; ) 6j= .
say formula ' entailed (or logically implied ) MBNF (and write
j=MBNF ') iff ' satisfied every MBNF model . order simplify notation,
denote MBNF model (I; M; ) pair (I; ), and, 2 LSM , denote
(I; M; ) , since case evaluation insensitive initial world ,
namely, (I; ) model , then, interpretation J , (J; ) model .

Example 2.2 Let = fBpg. MBNF models form (I; ),
= : j= pg. Hence, j=MBNF Bp, j=MBNF :B 2 L
propositional formula p valid. Therefore, agent modeled minimal
belief, sense believes p objective facts logically implied p.

Example 2.3 Let = fnot married B hasNoChildren g. easy see
models form (I; ) = : j= hasNoChildren g, since married
assumed hold agent modeled , able conclude
::married
B hasNoChildren . Notably, meaning analogous default rule hasNoChildren
Reiter's default logic (Lifschitz, 1994). Also, let = fB bird ^ : ies B ies ; B bird g.

way analogous previous case, shown MBNF models

Given set interpretations , Th(M ) denotes set formulas B'

turns that, restricting theories composed subjective positive formulas,
MBNF corresponds modal logic minimal knowledge due Halpern Moses
(1985), known ground nonmonotonic modal logic S5G (Kaminski, 1991; Donini,
Nardi, & Rosati, 1997b). fact, S5G obtained modal logic S5 imposing
following preference order universal Kripke structures satisfying theory 2 LB :
model iff j= and, 0 , 0 j= 0 6 (Shoham,
1987). fact, immediate see MBNF semantics theories composed
subjective positive formulas corresponds semantics according S5G . Hence,
following property holds.

Proposition 2.5 Let LB . Then, S5G model iff, , (I; )
MBNF model fB' : ' 2 g.
previous proposition implies that, LSB , set interpretations satisfying compared sets interpretations satisfying , while, case
LM , compared sets 0 (M 0 ; ) satisfies .

Hence, main difference MBNF S5G lies fact S5G models
maximal respect set containment (or minimal respect objective
knowledge holds model), MBNF property generally true.
E.g., theory = fnot married _ B married g two types models, possible
choice initial world J : (J; M1 ), M1 corresponds set interpretations
(which represents case married assumed hold); (J; M2 ),
M2 = : j= married g. Namely, married assumed hold, forces one
conclude B married : is, initial assumption justified knowledge derived
basis assumption (Lin & Shoham, 1992). remark that, Proposition 2.5,
interpretation MBNF operator B exactly corresponds interpretation
modality B S5G .

3. Relating MBNF Autoepistemic Logic

term AEL model thus refer set interpretations whose set theorems
Th(M ) corresponds stable expansion AEL.
Finally, notice adopted notion consistent autoepistemic logic (Marek
& Truszczynski, 1993), i.e. (1) allow inconsistent theory = LB composed
modal formulas (possible) stable expansion. results presented

however, requires slightly change semantics MBNF, allowing Definition 2.1
empty set interpretations possible component MBNF structures.
following, use term embedding (or translation) indicate transformation

1995; Schwarz, 1996; Janhunen, 1998), following sense: () faithful embedding

already known AEL theories embedded MBNF theories. particular, proven (Lin & Shoham, 1992; Schwarz & Truszczynski, 1994) AEL
theories nested occurrences B (called theories) embedded MBNF;
now, since AEL theory transformed equivalent theory (which
general size exponential size initial theory), follows AEL theory
embedded MBNF.
However, prove much stronger result: negation failure MBNF exactly
corresponds negative introspection AEL, i.e. AEL's modality :B MBNF's modality semantically equivalent. Hence, correspondence limited
modal theories without nested modalities, induces polynomial-time embedding
AEL theory MBNF.
first define translation () modal theories AEL MBNF theories.

4.1 Characterizing MBNF Models

present finite characterization MBNF models formula 2 LM .
several methods reasoning nonmonotonic modal logics (Gottlob, 1992; Marek

provide method rely modal logic theorem prover, reduces

First, introduce preliminary definitions. call formula form B'

Definition 4.1 Let 2 LM . call set modal atoms occurring modal
atoms (and denote set MA()).

Definition 4.2 Let 2 LM let (P; N ) partition set modal atoms.
denote (P; N ) formula obtained substituting strict occurrence
formula P true, strict occurrence formula N false.

Observe occurrences modal subformulas within
scope another modality replaced; notice that, P [ N contains MA(),
(P; N ) propositional formula. case, pair (P; N ) identifies guess
modal subformulas , i.e. P contains modal subformulas assumed hold,
N contains modal subformulas assumed hold.

Definition 4.3 Let 2 LM let (P; N ) partition MA(). denote ob (P; N )
propositional formula

Roughly speaking, propositional formula ob (P; N ) represents \objective knowledge" implied guess (P; N ) formulas form B' belonging P .

semantic viewpoint, structure (I; M; 0 ) satisfying guess modal atoms
given (P; N ), propositional formula ob (P; N ) constrains interpretations ,
since structure propositional formula ob (P; N ) must satisfied
interpretation J 2 , i.e. J j= ob (P; N ).

Example 4.4 Let

= (Ba _ (b ^ c)) ^ ^ :B (:f _ g)
Then, MA() = fBa; (b ^ c); B (:f _ g)g. suppose
P = fBa; (b ^ c)g
N = fB (:f _ g)g
Then, (P; N ) = (true _ true) ^ ^ :false (which equivalent d), ob (P; N ) = a.

Definition 4.5 say pair sets interpretations (M; 0 ) induces partition
(P; N ) MA() if, modal atom 2 MA(), 2 P iff (M; 0 ) j= .
Lemma 4.6 Let ' 2 LM , let interpretation, let M; 0 sets interpretations,
let (P; N ) partition induced (M; 0 ) set modal atoms . Then,
(I; M; 0 ) j= ' iff (I; M; 0 ) j= '(P; N ).

Proof.

Theorem 4.7 Let 2 LM , let (I; ) MBNF model , let (P; N )
partition MA() induced (M; ). Then, = fJ : J j= ob (P; N )g.
Let 0 = fJ : J j= ob (P; N )g. Since (M; ) induces partition (P; N ),
Definition 4.5 follows interpretation must satisfy ob (P; N ), hence 0 .

Proof.

formulas MA().
First, consider modal atom 2 L: definition satisfiability
formula MBNF structure, follows immediately 2 P iff (I; 0 ; ) j=
. Then, consider modal atom B 2 L: B 2 P , then, definition
ob (P; N ), propositional formula ob (P; N ) valid, therefore (I; 0 ; ) j= B .
B 2 N , exists interpretation J J 6j= , since 0 ,
follows (I; 0 ; ) 6j= B . Hence, modal atom 2 MA() depth 1 belongs
P iff (I; 0 ; ) j= .
Suppose 2 P iff (I; 0 ; ) j= modal atom MA() depth
less equal i. Consider modal atom B MA() depth + 1: induction
hypothesis, Lemma 4.6, (I; 0 ; ) j= B iff 0 j= B ( (P; N )). Now, B 2 P ,
285

then, definition ob (P; N ), propositional formula ob (P; N ) (P; N ) valid,
since 0 = fJ : J j= ob (P; N )g, follows 0 j= B ( (P; N )), turn implies
(I; 0 ; ) j= B ; hand, B 2 N , exists interpretation J
(J; M; ) 6j= , hence, induction hypothesis Lemma 4.6, J 6j= (P; N ).
Now, since 0 , follows 0 6j= B ( (P; N )), hence (I; 0 ; ) 6j= B .
way possible show modal atom form depth + 1 belongs
P iff (I; 0 ; ) j= .
thus proved modal atom 2 MA() belongs P iff (I; 0 ; ) j= :
turn implies (I; 0 ; ) j= iff j= (P; N ), since hypothesis (I; M; )
satisfies (P; N ) partition MA() induced (M; ), Lemma 4.6
follows j= (P; N ). Therefore, (I; 0 ; ) j= , contradicts hypothesis
(I; ) MBNF model . Consequently, 0 = , proves thesis.
Informally, theorem states MBNF model associated
partition (P; N ) modal atoms ; moreover, propositional formula ob (P; N )
exactly characterizes set interpretations MBNF model (I; ), sense
set interpretations satisfying ob (P; N ). provides finite way
describe MBNF models .
define notion partition set modal atoms induced pair
propositional formulas.

Definition 4.8 Let 2 LM , '1 ; '2 2 L. denote Prt (; '1 ; '2 ) partition
MA() induced (M1 ; M2 ), M1 = : j= '1 g, M2 = : j= '2 g.
order simplify notation, denote Prt (; ') partition Prt (; '; ').
following theorem provides constructive way build partition Prt (; '; ).

Theorem 4.9 Let 2 LM , '; 2 L. Let (P; N ) partition MA() built follows:
1. start P = N = ;;
2. modal atom B MA() (P; N ) 2 L, propositional formula
' (P; N ) valid, add B P , otherwise add B N ;
3. modal atom MA() (P; N ) 2 L, propositional
formula (P; N ) valid, add P , otherwise add N ;
4. iteratively apply rules P [ N = MA().
Then, (P; N ) = Prt (; '; ).

proof induction structure formulas MA(). First,
fact Prt (; '; ) partition induced (M; 0 ), = : j=
'g, 0 = : j= g, definition satisfiability MBNF structures,
follows that, 2 L, (M; 0 ) j= B ' valid propositional
formula, (M; 0 ) j= valid propositional formula.
Therefore, (P; N ) agrees Prt (; '; ) modal atoms modal depth 1. Suppose
(P; N ) Prt (; '; ) agree modal atoms modal depth less equal
Proof.

fiReasoning minimal belief negation failure

i. Consider modal atom B MA() modal depth + 1. Lemma 4.6
definition satisfiability MBNF structures, follows (M; 0 ) j= B
' (Prt (; '; )) valid propositional formula, since Definition 4.2
value formula (Prt (; '; )) depends guess modal atoms
modal depth less equal Prt (; '; ), induction hypothesis follows
(Prt (; '; )) = (P; N ), hence B belongs P (M; 0 ) j= B. Analogously,
proven modal atom depth + 1 form belongs P
(M; 0 ) j= . Therefore, (P; N ) Prt (; '; ) agree modal atoms
modal depth + 1.

since '(ob (P; N )) = '(Prt ('; ob (P; N ))), formula :'(ob (P; N )) computed

given (P; N ), (P; N ) computed polynomial time respect

given partition (P 0 ; N 0), conditions (c1), (c2) (c3) (analogous

Since guess partition (P; N ) MA() requires nondeterministic choice,

Therefore, following property holds.

Proposition 5.4p Let 2 L1M let ' 2 LSB . Then, problem deciding whether
