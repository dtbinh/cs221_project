overview backtrack
backtrack comes vandegriend upon prior work
backtrack hamiltonian cycle kocay martello shufelt berliner
three significant features discuss first employs variety
pruning techniques search delete edges cannot hamiltonian
cycle pruning usually upon local degree information second
start search performs initial pruning identifies easily detectable
non hamiltonian graphs third feature use iterated restart technique
additionally program provides opportunity order selection next vertex
path extension low degree first ordering high degree first ordering
random ordering normally use low degree first ordering
level search adding vertex current path search pruning
used pruning identifies edges cannot hamiltonian cycle removes
graph note backtracks adds edges deleted
current level search back graph first graph configuration
pruning looks vertex x neighbours b degree since edges
incident b must used hamiltonian cycle edges incident


fivandegriend culberson

x deleted second graph configuration pruning looks path
p v vk forced edges v vk degree k n edge v vk

cannot hamiltonian cycle deleted pruning degree
vertex drops hamiltonian cycle possible must
backtrack use operators may yield vertices degree therefore
pruning iterated changes occur
pruning iteration takes n time scan vertices check vertices two
degree neighbors n time extend forced degree two paths since iterations
terminate unless vertex degree two created n iterations occur
edges deleted backing descendant edges replaced
next branch taken thus easy upper bound pruning time
node searching vertex degree n overly pessimistic
note along branch root search tree leaf n vertices
converted degree note along branch edge deleted
degree high seldom take branches success
implementation several vertices two neighbors degree two
beginning iteration redundant edges removed single pass taking time
proportional n plus number edges removed checked practice gn
graphs typically takes n time per search node easy hamiltonian instances
evidenced cpu measurements harder instances taking twice long
per search node
start recursive search prunes graph described
checks see graph minimum degree connected
cut points conditions true graph nonhamiltonian finished
non hamiltonian instances may easy hard detect depending
vertex chooses starting point cases local features
exist could detected starts near otherwise
may backtrack many times feature without recognizing feature
matters seemingly hard instance gn n discussed section
case one type thrashing common backtracking
example hogg williams noticed sparse set hard coloring
phase transition baker showed instances
often hard thrashing could made easy backjumping
dependency directed backtracking
improve average performance use iterated restart technique
idea maximum limit number nodes searched
maximum reached search terminated one started maximum
increased multiple k mi kmi initially kn experiments
used k incrementing search interval way eventually
obtain search size large enough exhaustive search thus guarantee eventual
completion total search never double largest size allocated
although random restarts sometimes effective non hamiltonian graphs
frequently effective hamiltonian instances search edges added
set hamiltonian edges net effect prune edges graph
