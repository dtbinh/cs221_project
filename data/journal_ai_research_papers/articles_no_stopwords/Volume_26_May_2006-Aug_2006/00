introduce logic reasoning evidence essentially views evidence
function prior beliefs making observation posterior beliefs
making observation provide sound complete axiomatization logic
consider complexity decision although reasoning logic
mainly propositional allow variables representing numbers quantification
expressive power seems necessary capture important properties evidence

introduction
consider following situation essentially taken halpern tuttle
fagin halpern coin tossed fair double headed coin
lands heads likely coin double headed coin tossed
times lands heads time intuitively much likely coin
double headed latter case former likelihood
measured cannot simply compute probability coin double headed
assigning probability event requires prior probability coin
double headed example coin chosen random barrel
one billion fair coins one double headed coin still overwhelmingly likely
coin fair sequence heads unlucky however
statement prior probability given given prior probability
coin double headed increases significantly seeing heads
intuitively seems able say seeing heads row provides
great deal evidence favor coin double headed without invoking prior
great deal work trying make intuition precise
review
main feature coin example involves combination probabilistic outcomes e g coin tosses nonprobabilistic outcomes e g choice
coin great deal work reasoning systems combine
probabilistic nondeterministic choices see example vardi fischer zuck
halpern moses tuttle halpern tuttle de alfaro
seidel mciver however observations suggest attempt
formally analyze situation one frameworks essentially permit
modeling probabilities able directly capture intuition
increasing likelihood see plays consider formal analysis situation

fair coin chosen probability kth coin toss lands heads according
bob double headed coin chosen probability since bob

suppose st coin toss bob learns first
tosses suppose moreover landed heads probability
st coin toss lands heads analysis still depending
coin used

witnesses probability next toss lands heads remains unchanged
answer misses important information fact first coin
tosses heads strong evidence coin fact double headed indeed
straightforward computation bayes rule shows prior probability

however note possible determine posterior probability coin

prior probability set hypotheses condition
observations made obtain probability hypotheses reflects effect
observations presented logic evidence lets us reason
weight evidence observations independently prior probability
hypotheses logic expressive enough capture logical form relationship
prior probability hypotheses weight evidence observations
posterior probability hypotheses capture reasoning
