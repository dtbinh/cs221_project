incorporated enriched version complex epistemic states revision
seen operators enriched entities let us refer enriched epistemic
states enriched epistemic states enable us determine uniquely complex epistemic
state resulting revision thereby solving question started
determining revision complex epistemic states use every particular point
process iterated revision shall briefly discuss possible way
enriching complex epistemic states note recent proposal
booth et al instructive observe disj disj hold
framework
proposed outline without pitfalls obvious
leaves us meta version dilemma started
enriched epistemic states able uniquely determine complex
epistemic states resulting revision resulting enriched epistemic state
lessen constraining permissible resulting enriched epistemic states
way admissible revision constrains permissible complex epistemic states
chances whittling produce single permissible enriched
epistemic state course bound occur
whenever solve uniquely determining epistemic state certain
structure process enrichment saddled question
uniquely determine enriched epistemic state resulting revision
conjecture level point reached constraining enriched
epistemic states la admissible revision eventually lead unique enriched
epistemic state associated every revision determine whether
conjecture holds water
conclusion shown darwiche pearl arguments lead acceptance
admissible revision operators class worthy study restrained revision
operator particular exhibits quite desirable properties besides taking place
natural revision operator adhering closely principle minimal change
satisfaction properties q u shows unnecessarily
remove previously obtained information
future work would explore thoroughly class admissible
revision operators saw restrained revision lexicographic revision
lie opposite ends spectrum admissible operators represent respectively
conservative least conservative admissible operators sense
effect changes least changes respectively relative ordering
valuations permitted admissible revision natural question whether exists
axiomatisable class admissible operators represents middle ground one
clue finding class found counteracts relation e
derived epistemic state e said relation depends preorder
e associated e fact given total preorder v define relation

iff min min
clearly e e furthermore full relation v v reduces
logical inconsistency counteracts relation stronger e still weaker logical
inconsistency found setting lies somewhere e

v v hence one avenue worth exploring might assume epistemic
state e extract one two preorders e e e e
instead requiring e deduce b e done restrained
revision postulate could require stronger condition e
hold currently experimenting strategies second preorder
guide manipulation e enable property satisfied use second
preorder seen way enriching epistemic state might thus contribute
solution choice revision operators discussed section
future work relates two extreme cases revision looked
different angle mentioned earlier lexicographic revision formalisation
recent best revision taken logical extreme
exemplified e postulate known success requires revision
successful sense epistemic input provided contained
resulting knowledge base given e one postulates admissible
revision requirement carries even restrained revision opposite
end spectrum admissible revision means admissible revision
operator differs lexicographic revision still adheres dictum
recent best raises question recent input given
prominence relaxation requirement would imply giving e
venturing area known non prioritised revision booth chopra ghose
meyer hansson speculate appropriate relaxation admissible
revision e removed requirement lead class non prioritised
revision operators strictly containing admissible revision lexicographic revision
