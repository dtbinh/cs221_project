v [i ] w [i ] follows (PR) v Ei w. finally, suppose
v [i ] w [i ]. -compatibility x [B(E)] [i ],

Although restrained revision preserves information directly contradicted,
dogmatically wedded older information. neither two successive, incompatible, epistemic states conflict inputs sequence = 1 , . . . , n ,
prefers latter epistemic state revising .
Proposition 7 Restrained revision satisfies following property:
(Q) E E -compatible B(E)B(E) , B(E) B(E)
B(E) * B(E )
Proof: follows immediately Proposition 6 B(E ) B(E ).
B(E) * B(E ) follows consistency B(E ).

Next consider another preservation property, time, unlike case (O)
(Q), look circumstances B(E) incompatible inputs

(S) B(E ) B(E ) B(E ) = B(E )
Note that, given RAGM, antecedent (S) implies B(E). Thus (S) states

would change fact, sequence inputs preceded

Proposition 8 Restrained revision satisfies (S).
Proof: Suppose antecedent holds. !E consequent holds. fact
seen property (T) Proposition 10 below. suppose 6!E .
either 6 B(E ) 6 B(E ). latter doesnt hold one
assumptions together (C2), former must hold. implies B(E )
(P). Combining assumption get !E . case get
B(E ) = B(E ) (again using (T)), (since 6!E ) B(E ) =
B(E ( )) ((T) more), turn equals B(E ( )) (C2). Since
B(E ) turn equal B(E ) RAGM required.

provide compact syntactic representation restrained revision. First
show (C1) (P) combined single property, (C2) (D).
Proposition 9 Given RAGM,
1. (C1) (P) together equivalent single rule
(C1P) 6 B(E ) B(E ) = B(E ( ))
2. (C2) (D) together equivalent single rule
(C2D) !E B(E ) = B(E ).
Proof: (C1),(P)(C1P), suppose 6 B(E). (P) follows B(E)
means, RAGM, B(E ) = B(E ( )). (C1) follows
B(E()) = B(E()), thus B(E) = B(E()). (C1)(C1P),
suppose . 6 B(E ) RAGM, B(E ) = B(E ( ))
(C1P). since follows B(E ) = B(E ). (P)(C1P),
suppose 6 B(E ). B(E ) = B(E ( )) (C1P) means,
RAGM, B(E ).
(C2),(D)(C2D), suppose !E . (D), B(E ).
RAGM means B(E ) = B(E ( )). Now, (C2) follows
B(E ( )) = B(E ( )). B(E ) = B(E ( )). since
B(E), get RAGM B(E( )) = B(E), follows
B(E ) = B(E ). (C2)(C2D), suppose . !E E
B(E ) = B(E ) (C2D). (D)(C2D), suppose !E .
B(E) = B(E) (C2D) since B(E), follows B(E).
(C1P) (C2D) provide conditions reduction two-step revision sequence

reduces ( )-revision consistent -revision. (C2D) reduces
-revision, ignoring completely, counteract respect E. Now,
follows RAGM consequent (C1P) obtains 6 B(E ).
Putting together get succinct characterisation restrained revision.
Proposition 10 restrained revision satisfies RAGM and:

B(E )
!E
(T) B(E ) =
B(E ( )) otherwise.
Proof: Theorem 2 Proposition 9 sufficient show RAGM, (C1P)
(C2D) hold iff RAGM (T) hold. So, suppose satisfies RAGM (T). (C1P)
follows bottom part (T), (C2D) follows top part. Conversely,
suppose satisfies RAGM, (C1P) (C2D). !E follows (C2D)
B(E ) = B(E ). not, consider two cases.
/ B(E ) follows
(C1P) B(E) = B(E()). Otherwise case
/ B(E).
follows RAGM B(E ) = B(E ( )).

replace !E first clause (T) stronger
logically inconsistent, would obtain instead characterisation lexicographic
revision given Nayak et al. (2003).
Proposition 10 allows us see clearly another significant property restrained revision.
!E know B(E ) directly (D), 6!E
Proposition 10 tells us B(E ) = B(E ( )) B(E ) RAGM.
Thus see state E epistemic status (either accepted rejected)
always completely determined, i.e., proved:
Proposition 11 Restrained revision satisfies following property:
(U) 6 B(E ) B(E )
(Given similar characterisation mentioned above, easy see lexicographic
revision satisfies (U) too.) (P), property (U) read providing conditions
penultimate revision input believed. antecedent simply
saying B(E ) consistent . Thus (U) saying penultimate input
believed long consistent so. chaining (U) together (C4), easily
see (U) actually implies (P) presence (C4). consequence, obtain
following alternative axiomatic characterisation restrained revision.
Theorem 3 RAGM, (C1), (C2), (C4), (U) (D) provide exact characterisation
restrained revision.
(U), able provide simple semantic counterpart property. corresponds
separating -worlds -worlds total preorder E following

Proposition 12 Whenever revision operator satisfies RAGM, satisfies (U) iff

(UR) v [] w [], either v E w w E v
Proof: (U)(UR) suppose (UR) doesnt hold, i.e., exist , v [] w []
v E w w E v. Letting [] = {v, w} get
[B(E )] = {v, w} RAGM thus , 6 B(E ) (because
v, w [B(E )] respectively). Hence (U) doesnt hold.
(U)(UR) suppose (U) doesnt hold, i.e., exist , , 6
B(E ). exist v [] w [] v, w [B(E )] =
(by RAGM) min(, E ). Since v w (E )-minimal -worlds must
v E w w E v. Hence , v, w give counterexample (UR).

Finally section turn two properties first mentioned (as far know)
Schlecta et al. (1996) (see work Lehmann et al. (2001)):
(Disj1) B(E ) B(E ) B(E ( ) )
(Disj2) B(E ( ) ) B(E ) B(E )
(Disj1) says sentence believed one two sequences revisions
differ step (step one case other), sentence
believed sequence differs step
revision disjunction . Similarly, (Disj2) says every sentence believed
( )--revision believed least one (-) (-).
conditions reasonable properties expect revision operators.
Proposition 13 Restrained revision satisfies (Disj1) (Disj2).
prove result make use properties counteracts relation given
Proposition 4, along following lemma.
Lemma 4 !E ( ) 6!E B(E (( ) )) = B(E ( ))
Proof: Suppose !E ( ) 6!E . first show implies
B(E(())). able conclude required B(E(())) =
B(E ( )) using RAGM. suppose contrary 6 B(E (( ) )).
exists -world w min(( ) , E ). w min( , E ). Since
!E know Proposition 3 exist -world w1 -world w2
wi E w = 1, 2. Clearly w1 ( )-world, infer ( ) 6!E
contradiction. Hence B(E (( ) )) required.

Proof:[of Proposition 13] prove properties simultaneously looking two cases:
Case (i): ( ) !E . case B(E ( ) ) = B(E ) property (T)
Proposition 10. Meanwhile know Proposition 4(ii) either !E !E ,
using (T) know least one B(E ) B(E ) must
equal B(E ). Hence see (Disj1) (Disj2) hold case.
Case (ii): ( ) 6!E . case (T) tells us B(E ( ) ) = B(E (( ) )) =
B(E (( ) ( )). Meanwhile Proposition 4(i) tells us least one 6!E
6!E holds. consider two subcases according either
143

fiBooth & Meyer

hold, one holds. hold B(E ) = B(E ( ))
B(E ) = B(E ( )), (Disj1) (Disj2) reduce
(Disj10 ) B(E ( )) B(E ( )) B(E (( ) ( )))
(Disj20 ) B(E (( ) ( ))) B(E ( )) B(E ( ))
respectively. consequence RAGM sentences ,
(1) B(E ) B(E ) B(E ( )) (2) B(E ( )) B(E ) B(E ).
Substituting gives us required (Disj10 ) (from (1))
(Disj20 ) (from (2)).
lets consider subcase !E 6!E . (A symmetric argument
work subcase 6!E !E .) 6!E get
B(E ) = B(E ( )), !E together ( ) 6!E get
B(E()) = B(E()) using Lemma 4. case B(E()) = B(E),
(Disj1) (Disj2) follow immediately.

end section remarking shown lexicographic revision
satisfies (Disj1) (Disj2).

expert combined statement creature initially seemed red,
reasonable adopt lexicographic approach recent best conclude
bird red. Formally, red B (E red bird bird), B(E) = Cn(red).
case source information dramatically affects outcome, consider
following example.
Example 6 Consider sequence inputs p followed finite number, say n,
instances pair p q, q. (To make concrete, reader might wish
substitute p red q bird.) Since p direct conflict sentences
sequence succeeding it, revision operator satisfying property (and includes
restrained revision) require p contained knowledge base obtained
revision sequence. Now, pair p q q obtained different source,
conclusion clearly unreasonable. all, sequence amounts told
p case, followed n different sources essentially telling p case.
hand, pairs p q q come source, case
clear cut anymore. fact, case one would expect result

Another example restrained revision fares less well following:4
