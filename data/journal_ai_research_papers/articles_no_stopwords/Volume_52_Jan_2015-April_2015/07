motivation studying control weighted elections
introduction noted importance weights many electoral settings
described natural importance ofand gave pointers extensive line work
studyingcontrol attacks many unweighted settings stated control attacks naturally expected occur even many weighted election settings
present section give examples motivating study weighted electoral
control
let us consider academic department salient issue particular
term question course add b majors requirements suppose
department highly polarized issue area e faculty given
area vote block agree tradition
meet actual faculty meetings within group reach group position
support suppose group days times
entire group would unlikely attend e g time time
major yearly conference area department chair knowing
power schedule faculty meetings held agenda
meeting might well model task weighted control deleting voters
voters groups groups weight number faculty
members groups deletion limit one
fact generally individual voters may blur collection weighted votes
settings voter set partitions groups express identical preferences
another example sort one authors schools members faculty senate
chosen election system known single transferable vote however
unheard departmental leaders send friendly suggestion departments
members regarding vote one assumes departments vote blocks
one trying decide candidates add election convince


fifaliszewski hemaspaandra hemaspaandra

run election order make given candidate win win one effect
studying weighted constructive control adding candidates weighted constructive control
deleting candidates weighted destructive control adding candidates weighted
destructive control deleting candidates
examples given ones weightings created individuals
forming blocks occur even highly political contexts
example us house representatives issues example water rights farm
subsidies states delegation tends vote block parochial interests
states constituents companies pressure lobbyists state delegations abstain
given vote effect give take issues failing quorum control
deleting voters attack
however many voting cases weights inherent standalone individual voters many cases control attacks may well occur
example consider us corporate elections vote stockholder weighted
number shares natural way frame control
setting case adding deleting candidates example regarding running
spot company officer director even voter control come play
example actor sending mailings toor phoning speaking tovoters
convince abstain voting encourage voters vote election
bound additions deletions model counts number voters rather
weights quite reasonable setting regardless weight given
targeted voter addressed example mailing visit phone call although
reality one admittedly might focus resources biggest stockholders
many weighted control examples presented let us finish
extremely high stakes example us electoral college works
majority rule among electors electors state usually vote block
since system lets whoever greatest popular vote given state select every
elector state note two fifty states different policies thus issue
example whether someone ralph nader run
withdraw name consideration particular time sweeping
effect nation effect weighted control adding deleting candidates
scenario
given number examples voter control candidate
control settings weighted control may occur examples given vary
naturalness weighted unweighted control certainly
points dont capture nuances real world example
electoral partitioning geographic contiguity constraints groups
modeled voting blocks may fact defectors internet denial service
attacks may freedom suppress vote independently rather may
suppress none votes coming given line provider see e g chen
faliszewski niedermeier talmon nonetheless belief importance
weighted elections importance control attacks remain forever separate
feel control attacks sufficiently natural many weighted settingsvarying

added heaviest voters approving p c ct

since constantdifferent sets approvals consider
suffices try sequences nonnegative integers k k whose sum

k sequence check whether adding heaviest ki voters ith
approval collection makes p winner
fixed clear although brute force nature
runs time polynomial input size actions uses relatively
innocuous fact example use sorting group together votes within w

weight voter b p w consists weight weight voter preference
order p b adding weight voter makes p winner adding weight
voter fact following
theorem wccav wccdv borda np complete holds even
restricted fixed number candidates
proof start considering case adding voters reduce partition given
sequence k kt positive integers sum k construct election one
registered voter weight k voting b p unregistered voters weights
k kt voting p b set addition limit candidates
initial score b k score p k score k
thus p become winner bs score relative p needs go least k
score relative p go k follows k kt
partition p made winner
use construction deleting voters case voters registered
deletion limit since cant delete voters since goal make p
winner cannot delete one voter voting b p since would
unique winner rest argument identical case adding voters

gap p define id minimum number unregistered voters one add
remove ds gap one went heaviest lightest among unregistered voters
adding turn disapproved id number voters one would add
longer gap candidate holds integer realizes id control
impossible unregistered voter set clearly successful addition voters must
add least maxd id voters max throughout proof candidates initially
gap
let us henceforth assume control possible input case
added maxd id voters gbw made p winner gbw
approximation
giving detailed proof let us informally give sense proofs idea
let z candidate allegedly gap gbw added maxd id voters
freeze action gbw point proof argues relatively many
maxd id voters added gbw e least maxd id approve z z
clearly gap point time gbw frozen assumed
gap cant exist case proof argues relatively maxd id
voters added gbw e maxd id approve z equivalently
least maxd id approve z arrive contradiction
latter argument subtle one involving asking candidates call gap
caused last added vote added needed drilling extra level
related many argument focused gbw must point
acted way violates definition thus yielding contradiction since
many cases cover possible cases proof achieved
goal provide formal analysis carries argument line
suppose maxd id additions candidate z still gap
discussed perform case analysis case arrive contradiction
case least maxd id first maxd id votes added gbw z approved
since last one added z must still gap addition
earlier vote considered disapproved z gap z considered
would added reached keeping mind iz maxd id
fact must added iz heaviest voters disapproving z contrary
assumption z longer gap additions
case case hold z approved least maxd id added
votes made final one added votes call v eligible addition must
candidate say still gap v added
case disapproved least maxd id maxd id votes added v
approved z since ys gap removed unregistered voters disapproving
would excluded gbw ys iy heaviest voters added contrary
case assumption gap get adding vote v
case b case holds case approved least maxd id
maxd id votes v gbw added approve z maxd id
votes added approving exactly z made last maxd id
votes call v eligible added must hold candidate w gap
v moment adding v would added maxd id iw votes
approving exactly z disapproving w since w allegedly still gap

gbw would fact added iw heaviest voters disapproving
w ws gap would removed v contrary assumption w
gap made v eligible
one might naturally wonder gbw performs veto wccav approvalwccdv argument far easier used proof lemma
cases gbw provides approximation
theorem gbw approximation veto wccav gbw tapproximation approval wccdv
proof consider veto wccav let p preferred candidate candidate
initial positive gap relative preferred candidate p e surplus p
total weight approvals let id defined proof lemma recall id
number votes would need add remove surplus p took
unregistered votes discarded didnt simultaneously approve p disapprove

p added one time heaviest lightest gap removed
clearly
id sum taken candidates initial surplus relative
p upper bound number votes added gbw true since gbw
works adding extra votes heaviest lightest restricted vetoing candidate
point positive gap relative p gbw gap closed
largest weight votes address hand overall optimal solution
id lower bound smallest number votes solutions added vote set
would suffice remove ds positive gap since takes id even use heaviest
votes addressing gap overall optimal solution added vote narrows
gaps gbws solution uses worst times many added votes optimal

namely veto wccav approval wccdv wildly exciting since

heuristics especially attractive approaches greedy
