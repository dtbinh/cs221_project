abstract
discourse typically involves numerous entities mentioned distinguishing die one mention singleton lead longer lives
coreferent would dramatically simplify hypothesis space coreference resolution
leading increased performance realize gains build classifier predicting
singleton coreferent distinction feature representations synthesize linguistic insights
factors affecting discourse entity lifespans especially negation modality attitude
predication existing benefits surface part speech n gram
features coreference resolution model effective right feature representations help identify anchor phrases bridging anaphora well furthermore incorporating
model two different state art coreference resolution systems one rule
learning yields significant performance improvements

introduction
karttunen imagined text interpreting system designed keep track individuals
events objects etc mentioned text individual record whatever said
karttunen p used term discourse referent describe abstract individuals
discourse referents easily mapped specific entities world proper
names others indeterminate sense compatible many different real world
entities indefinites train case discourse referents enter anaphoric
relations discourse even know exactly real world object train picks
heard train distance nonetheless refer subsequent pronouns
ascribe properties loud horn
discourse referents enjoy repeat appearances discourse lead long lives
appear wide variety discourse contexts whereas others never escape birthplaces
dying one mention central question factors influence
lifespan discourse referent focus noun phrases direct identifiers
discourse referents english specifically seek predict whether given discourse

insights previous engineering efforts similar direction section
linguistically motivated features bring improvement top surface features section demonstrating automatic language processing rely machine learning big data
lifespan model performs well right achieving accuracy predicting whether

different coreference resolution systems showed yields improvements practical
statistical significance cases section
stepping back hope provided compelling illustration efforts theoretical
