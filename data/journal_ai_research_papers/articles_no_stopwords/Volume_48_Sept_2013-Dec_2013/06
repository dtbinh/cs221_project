abstract
present naturalowl natural language generation system produces texts
describing individuals classes owl ontologies unlike simpler owl verbalizers
typically express single axiom time controlled often entirely fluent natural
language primarily benefit domain experts aim generate fluent coherent multi sentence texts end users system naturalowl one
information owl web along automatically produced corresponding texts
multiple languages making information accessible computer programs
domain experts end users discuss processing stages naturalowl
optional domain dependent linguistic resources system use stage
useful present trials showing domain dependent
linguistic resources available naturalowl produces significantly better texts compared
simpler verbalizer resources created relatively light effort

actually use term ontology refer jointly terminological knowledge tbox
establishes conceptualization knowledge domain assertional knowledge abox

make ontologies easier understand several ontology verbalizers developed
schwitter verbalizers usually translate axioms case owl statements
ontology one one controlled often entirely fluent english statements typically
without considering coherence resulting texts mostly benefit domain
experts contrast article present system aims produce fluent
coherent multi sentence texts describing classes individuals owl ontologies

system generate following text owl statement ontology
annotated domain dependent linguistic resources discussed
st emilion kind bordeaux st emilion region red color strong flavor
made exactly one grape variety cabernet sauvignon grapes

system called naturalowl open source supports english greek
hence greek texts generated owl statements following

examples illustrate system naturalowl help information web owl statements texts generated owl statements

fluent coherent multi sentence texts naturalowl relies natural language generation
nlg methods mckeown reiter dale larger extent compared existing owl verbalizers example includes mechanisms avoid repeating information
order facts expressed aggregate smaller sentences longer ones generate
referring expressions etc although nlg established area first article
discuss detail nlg system owl ontologies excluding simpler verbalizers
propose novel theoretical nlg perspective
several particular issues need considered generating owl ontologies
example owl statements lead overly complicated sentences unless
converted simpler intermediate representations first several owl specific
opportunities aggregate sentences e g expressing axioms cardinalities
properties referring expression generation exploit class hierarchy
naturalowl used owl ontology obtain texts high quality
domain dependent generation resources required example classes ontology
mapped natural language names properties sentence plans etc similar
linguistic resources used nlg systems though different systems adopt different
linguistic theories requiring different resources little consensus
exactly information nlg resources capture apart abstract specifications
mellish domain dependent generation resources naturalowl created
domain author person familiar owl system configured
ontology domain author uses protege ontology editor protege plug
allows editing domain dependent generation resources invoking naturalowl view
resulting texts discuss plug article since similar
authoring tool piro androutsopoulos oberlander karkaletsis
owl ontologies often use english words concatenations words e g manufacturedby
identifiers classes properties individuals hence domain dependent
generation resources often extracted ontology guessing example
class identifier laptop earlier example noun used refer
class statement form objectpropertyassertion manufacturedby x
expressed english sentence form x manufactured
owl verbalizers follow strategy similarly domain dependent generation resources provided naturalowl attempts extract ontology uses

biased towards lower scores criteria
conclude sections ordering information domain dependent generation resources along sentece plans particularly important note however
best scores obtained enabling components available
domain dependent generation resources

conclusions future work
provided detailed description naturalowl open source nlg system produces english greek texts describing individuals classes owl ontologies unlike
simpler verbalizers typically express single axiom time controlled often
entirely fluent english primarily benefit domain experts naturalowl aims
generate fluent coherent multi sentence texts end users one languages
discussed processing stages naturalowl optional domain dependent generation resources stage well particular nlg issues arise generating
owl ontologies presented trials performed measure effort required
construct domain dependent generation resources extent improve resulting texts comparing simpler owl verbalizer requires
domain dependent generation resources employs nlg methods lesser extent
trials showed domain dependent generation resources help naturalowl produce
significantly better texts resources constructed relatively light
effort compared effort typically needed develop owl ontology
future work could compare effort needed construct domain dependent generation resources effort needed manually edit lower quality texts produced
without domain dependent generation resources experience manually editing
texts generated verbalizer naturalowl tedious large
number individuals e g products types described editor
repeat similar fixes may however particular applications
post editing texts simpler verbalizer may preferable
aim replace future work pipeline architecture naturalowl global
optimization architecture consider nlg processing stages parallel avoid
greedy stage specific decisions marciniak strube lampouras androutsopoulos
b finally hope test naturalowl biomedical ontologies
