abstract
presents multilayered architecture enhances capabilities current
qa systems allows different types complex questions queries processed
answers questions need gathered factual information scattered
throughout different documents specifically designed specialized layer process
different types temporal questions complex temporal questions first decomposed
simple questions according temporal relations expressed original question
way answers resulting simple questions recomposed fulfilling
temporal restrictions original complex question novel aspect
resides decomposition uses minimal quantity resources final
aim obtaining portable platform easily extensible languages
present methodology evaluation decomposition questions
well ability implemented temporal layer perform multilingual level
temporal layer first performed english evaluated compared
general purpose qa system f measure qa plus english temporal layer
vs general qa system b well known qa system much better
obtained temporal questions multilayered system system
therefore extended spanish good obtained evaluation
f measure qa plus spanish temporal layer vs general qa
system

introduction
nowadays fact huge amount digital information available mainly
textual form large number users want easiest possible access
information situation continuously fosters development
information systems make possible analyze locate manage access process
information automatically commonly systems referred search
engines
search engine especially useful obtain specific piece information without
need manually go available documentation related search
topic search engines currently evolving towards generation engines capable

understanding user needs better necessity behind every query offering specific
services interfaces depending domain context generation search
engines able offer list ordered web discover pieces
information scattered throughout different information sources even summaries barzilay

long road towards next generation systems work presented takes

temporal questions
specific case temporal qa trivial task due potential complexity
temporal questions current search engines operational qa systems deal
simple factual temporal questions questions requiring date answer
bob marley die questions involve simple temporal expressions

usually accomplished identifying explicit temporal expressions questions
relevant documents contain temporal expressions order answer questions
however system described processes complex temporal questions
questions whose complexity related temporal properties entities
enquired relative ordering events mentioned question following
examples complex temporal questions
spokesman soviet embassy baghdad invasion
kuwait
bill clinton currently president united states
present work tries imitate temporal reasoning human
solving types questions example person trying answer question
spokesman soviet embassy baghdad invasion kuwait
would proceed follows
first complex question would decomposed two simple ones
spokesman soviet embassy baghdad invasion
kuwait occur


fienhancing qa systems complex temporal question processing capabilities

would look possible answers first simple question
spokesman soviet embassy baghdad
would look answer second question
invasion kuwait occur
finally would give final answer one answers first question
temporal compatibility answer second question

therefore logical treatment complex questions
decomposition questions simple ones resolved conventional
qa systems finally answers simple questions fulfilling temporal constraints would

background
explained introduction one aims process complex questions complex questions general dealt previous studies different
approaches decompose harabagiu lacatusu hickl presented procedure question produces lots queries semantically related original
question main aim obtaining information answers requires significant amount semantic information question decomposition
presented katz borchardt felshin involves three decomposition techniques
syntactic decomposition linguistic knowledge language descriptions
resource content b semantic decomposition domain motivated explanation patterns language annotations resource content c semantic decomposition
questions resource content lower level assertions makes use
considerable amount linguistic knowledge order move domains
sets parameterized language annotations need composed addition
studies dealing single focus complex questions lin lui propose processing
complex questions multiple foci obtaining one subquestion focus
original question determines four possible relations subquestions derived original question however temporal relation considered

apart complex questions treatment motivation temporal aspect
work due great importance question answering field relating questions
information temporal dimension order correct answer take
example following two similar questions
president usa
president usa
obvious dependency answers time order obtain right answer
two questions temporal information needs extracted processed
first question refers current president usa exact point time
question formulated whereas second one refers president
temporal information explicit questions considered complex temporal

categories since way solve differ depending type question involved
temporality question depends two levels complexity number events
question questions formed single event whose answers found

temporally related whose answers could found multiple documents complex
questions b temporal information appearing question implicit
explicit temporal expressions needs recognized normalized combination
two features four different types temporal questions
simple temporal questions

answers spanish well thus proving system usually obtains exact answers
languages
conclude second evaluation analysis extension evaluation spanish
corroborates conclusions obtained english evaluation demonstrates
temporal layer improves system way regardless language

conclusions work
study presents multilayered temporal qa architecture performs multilingual level case english spanish system processes complex temporal
questions splitting simple questions answered different types
general purpose qa systems addition system performs temporal reasoning
questions temporal information
proposal consists adding layer top current qa system
two main features
complex question decomposition questions decomposed simple events
generate simple questions sub questions temporal signal relates
events first sub question q focus specifies type information user
needs answer second sub question q restriction establishes
temporal restrictions list answers q focus q focus
q restriction input qa system type qa system could used

question recomposition answers q focus q restriction obtained
qa system filtered compared order determine temporal compatibility construct final complex answer
since layer processes complex questions uses lexical syntactic rules
grammar task language dependent initially decomposition unit prepared
english general way extension system spanish therefore
simple small changes required applies languages
addition temporal reasoning system performed terseo
multilingual system working spanish english catalan italian easily
extensible european language
evaluation purposes two aims determine decomposition unit
processes type question properly order obtain appropriate simple factual
questions b techniques enhance general purpose qa system order
accomplish aims test bed english spanish constructed annotating
question corpus correct decomposition qa tasks
determining criteria establishing question properly decomposed
answered
decomposition unit evaluation english spanish good
complex questions f measure english spanish evaluating
performance whole multilayered architecture compared
obtained base qa system without temporal layer great improvement


fienhancing qa systems complex temporal question processing capabilities

found especially case complex questions type base
system able answer average f measure english
spanish multilayered qa system obtained overall f measure approximately
english spanish types questions besides temporal layer
qa system compared online general purpose qa system called start
demonstrating difficulty encountered general purpose qa systems answering
questions complex temporal information temporal relations
work done along three main lines resolving
detected temporal layer evaluation process adding module resolve
anaphoric co reference questions integrating event link information
timeml schema timeml system order extract deeper understanding
complex questions taking consideration techniques determine event durations
case open ended questions happened world oil prices iraqi
annexation kuwait task previous work field considered pan
et al b applying layer procedure types complex questions
well studying features need added system enable
