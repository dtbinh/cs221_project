2.1 Structured Technology Functions
order concrete, next present technology functions whose structure

technology functions. subclass gives us natural examples technology functions,
provides succinct natural way represent technology success functions.
structured technology function, individual succeeds fails task

structured technology function dened t(a1 , . . . , ) probability
f (x1 , . . . , xn ) = 1 bits x1 , . . . , xn chosen according following
distribution: ai = 0 xi = 1 probability [0, 1) (and xi = 0 probability
1 ); otherwise, i.e. ai = 1, xi = 1 probability > (and xi = 0
probability 1 ). Thus, structured technology dened n, f parameters
{i , }iN .
Let us consider two simple structured technology functions, OR. First
consider

minimal payments induce q 1 q 2 Nash equilibria, respectively. utility

v1 > v2 , u(q 2 , v1 ) u(q 2 , v2 ). conclude u(q 1 , v1 ) u(q 2 , v2 ), thus utility

Next show success probability monotonic non-decreasing value. q 1
optimal v1 , thus:
t(q 1 ) (v1 P 1 ) t(q 2 ) (v1 P 2 )
q 2 optimal v2 , thus:
t(q 2 ) (v2 P 2 ) t(q 1 ) (v2 P 1 )
Summing two equations, get (t(q 1 ) t(q 2 )) (v1 v2 ) 0, implies
v1 > v2 t(q 1 ) t(q 2 ).
Finally show expected payment monotonic non-decreasing value.
q 2 optimal v2 t(q 1 ) t(q 2 ), observe that:
t(q 2 ) (v2 P 2 ) t(q 1 ) (v2 P 1 ) t(q 2 ) (v2 P 1 )

therefore, utility q is:
