given objective function feasible region lc defined terms set linear
equalities lc course differs setting constrained games

perspective moreover differently classical ntu formalizations constrained games
allow define non convex non comprehensive sets worth distributions
appealing modeling capability emerged useful several application domains
finally resulting game framework analyzed respect preservation

light approaches interesting avenue may consider
expressive kinds constraints formulated instance via logic languages
preference criteria adopted place hard constraints
avenues related technical questions explored
first complexity analysis focused notions core
bargaining set founded concepts objections counterobjections
course would interesting complement analysis kernel
nucleolus shapely value actually hardness kernel nucleolus
tu graphical games recently illustrated greco et al b indeed
trivially provide lower bounds complexity solution concepts
setting constrained games however providing tighter computational bounds requires
deeper understanding computational aspects underlying kalais axiomatization
outside scope furthermore shapley value interest
study extensions provided literature ntu games
assess behavior applied constrained games
moreover hardness shown hold even restricting underlying tu games use cohesive worth functions might interest study
complexity different specific kinds functions considered instance monotone
superadditive weakly superadditive convex ones similarly assessing extent
considering specific kinds worth functions affects analytical properties studied
section interesting question leave
finally modeling viewpoint recall framework proposed
exploits one set linear equalities constrain outcomes coalitions thus
light adding modeling power framework might interest study natural generalization coalition equipped specific set linear equalities
particular setting would call conceiving suitable mechanisms compactly represent exponentially many different sets constraints defining formal measures
expressivity compact representations constraint ntu games
