basic concepts argumentation frameworks
present work lies frame general theory abstract argumentation frameworks proposed dung abstract framework assumes set arguments given well different conflicts focuses definition
status arguments
definition argumentation framework argumentation framework ha ri
pair non empty set r binary relation called attack relation
let b b r equivalently arb means attacks b b attacked

following ha ri argumentation framework assume set
arguments finite first easy extend concept attack sets arguments
definition attack set let
attacks iff x xra
attacks iff x arx
main issue argumentation system selection acceptable sets arguments intuitively acceptable set arguments must sense coherent
strong enough e g able defend every attacking argument argumentation semantics defines properties required set arguments acceptable
collective acceptability selected sets arguments given semantics
called extensions semantics set extensions characterizes outcome
argumentation system recall basic concepts used defining usual semantics
definition conflict free defense let
conflict free iff b arb
defends iff attacks argument attacks set arguments
defends denoted f f called characteristic function ha ri
