introduction

monotonicity

means whenever learn information add already
know old theorems still derivable clearly undesirable
describing defeasible reasoning therefore monotonicity satisfied many logics
artificial intelligence
hand monotonicity attractive feature practical point
view learning information start
retain old conclusions focus deriving possible ones furthermore
lot information allowed focus part conclusions derived
part automatically valid considering information
sometimes called local reasoning
even though clear want monotonicity hold general might
worthwhile investigate restricted variants monotonicity past variants
defined allow us keep old theorems information follows old premise variant called cautious monotonicity kraus
lehmann magidor negation derived old premise
called rational monotonicity kraus et al

information given us premises stated give us whole truth
matter van benthem leads least two kinds minimality predicateminimality domain minimality intuition behind predicate minimality
relevant property predicate objects property explicitly said
property premise allows us formulate defaults stating
normal objects property minimizing abnormality allow us conclude
object property unless deduce premise object abnormal
intuition behind domain minimality domain discourse contains
objects deduced exist premise intuition strongly
tied domain closure assumption reiter two kinds minimality
formalized two variants circumscription treated
classical logic underlying circumscription first order predicate logic assume
standard first order language l finite number predicate symbols including
equality assume language contains function constant symbols
severe limitation since eliminate function constant symbols
introducing predicate symbols davis first give definition

proposition predicate domain circumscription upward persistent formulae conservative

proof first consider predicate circumscription let language consist three predicates besides equality namely p succ p circumscribed define formulae

intuitive meaning succ chains elements extending indefinitely
directions p occurs somewhere chain must true successors
well model made smaller preferred making p false point

fimonotonicity persistence preferential logics

given preferential logic designer theorem prover could proceed follows

conclusions
