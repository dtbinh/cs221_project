table summary evaluation ka techniques nlg
directly asking experts knowledge
simplest perhaps obvious ka technique nlg simply ask experts
write texts question stop sumtime mousam experts initially
gave us spreadsheets flowcharts describing thought texts generated
projects turned experts description texts
generated fact match people actually wrote texts question
common finding ka partially due fact difficult experts
introspectively examine knowledge use practice anderson
proponents expert oriented ka prefer structured ka techniques
example beginning sumtime mousam one meteorologists gave
us spreadsheet designed essentially encoded thought
parts weather forecasts generated spreadsheet generate complete
weather forecast analysed logic used spreadsheet largely first
version sumtime mousam logic
one goal analysis create could decide change
parameter value significant enough mentioned weather
report spreadsheet used context dependent change thresholds make decision
example change wind speed would mentioned
change knots final wind speed knots less
change knots final wind speed
knots
change knots final wind speed knots
context dependent thresholds reflect usage weather reports users
case oil company staff making decisions related north sea offshore oil rigs
example user deciding unload supply boat moderate changes wind
speed dont matter low speeds light winds minimal impact supply
boat operations high speeds boat wont even attempt unload
heavy winds may affect decisions speeds context dependent


fireiter sripada robertson

thresholds would expected vary according specific forecast recipient
set consultation recipient
perspective two main pieces knowledge encoded
absolute size change determines whether mentioned
threshold significance depends context ultimately user
use information
validation direct expert knowledge
checked rules comparing observed corpus analysis
manually written forecasts section suggested probably
correct may incorrect particular linear segmentation model sripada et al
basically looks changes slope rather changes absolute value
parameter better matches corpus texts expert designed spreadsheet model
agreed segmentation probably better essentially commented
one reason use absolute size model something
easily comprehensible someone neither programmer expert numerical
data analysis techniques
words addition introspecting knowledge perhaps
reasonable expect domain expert able write sophisticated data analysis
expertise issue knowledge needed purely
declarative many ai applications need procedural algorithmic
knowledge must bear mind domain experts may sufficient computational
expertise express knowledge computer
role directly asking experts knowledge
although experts spreadsheet sumtime mousam far ideal extremely useful starting point specified initial system could build fairly
easily produced least vaguely plausible output much fact happened stop one doctors gave us flowchart certainly many
weaknesses useful initial specification relatively easy build
somewhat plausible system stop sumtime mousam indeed nlg
projects involved initial prototype system working soon
possible useful developing ideas explaining domain experts
interested parties trying
terms types knowledge mentioned section stop flowchart
sumtime mousam spreadsheet specified domain knowledge example
smokers categorised domain communication knowledge example use
ranges instead single numbers communicate wind speed stop flowchart
specify generic communication knowledge english grammar morphology
author probably believed knew things sumtimemousam spreadsheet effect include english grammar rules
get spreadsheet work author much confidence


fiacquiring correct knowledge nlg

summary think directly asking experts knowledge excellent way
quickly build initial system especially nlg developers supply communication
knowledge domain expert may possess initial system place
probably best use ka techniques least poorly understood areas
nlg however applications solid theoretical basis expert
simply say build system according theory x experts direct knowledge may
perhaps needed
structured expert oriented ka think aloud protocols
numerous types structured expert oriented ka techniques including thinkaloud protocols sorting structured interviews scott et al focus
think aloud protocols technique used tried
structured ka techniques well sorting reiter et al
describe broad conclusions structured ka techniques
similar conclusions think aloud protocols
think aloud protocol expert carries task question case writing
text thinking aloud audio video recorder used think aloud
protocols stop sumtime mousam especially important stop
provided basis content phrasing rules
simple example think aloud process follows one doctors wrote
letter smoker tried stop managed stop several weeks
starting doctor made following comments think aloud transcript
tried stop smoking yes longest managed
stop ticked one week right three months thats
encouraging managed stop least
said people one two goes likely
succeed future
included following paragraph letter wrote smoker
see managed stop smoking one two occasions
gone back smoking glad know common
people finally stop smoking one two attempts
past finally succeed capable
stopping even short period means much likely
able stop permanently somebody never ever stopped smoking

analysing session proposed two rules
previous attempt stop message likely succeed
previous attempt stop message people stop
unsuccessful attempts first



fireiter sripada robertson

final system incorporated rule several ka sessions
one stated smoker tried stop letter included
section confidence building confidence building section include short
message previous attempts stop smoker managed quit
one week mentioned message otherwise message mention
recency smokers previous cessation attempt within past months
actual text generated rule example letter figure
although dont feel confident would able stop
try several things favour
stopped month
note text produced actual stop code considerably simpler
text originally written expert fairly common simplifications
logic used decide whether include message letter many cases
due expert much knowledge expertise computer system
reiter dale pp general process deriving implementable rules
nlg systems think aloud protocols perhaps art science
least different experts often write texts different ways
validation structured ka knowledge
attempted verify rules acquired stop think aloud sessions performing series small experiments asked smokers comment letter
compare two versions letter many rules supported experiments example people general liked recap smoking likes dislikes see
good reasons stop section figure however one general negative finding
experiments tailoring rules insufficiently sensitive unusual
atypical aspects individual smokers smokers probably unusual atypical
way example stop letters go medical details smoking
none think aloud expert written letters contained information
seemed right choice many smokers smokers say would
liked see medical information smoking another example
think aloud sessions adopted positive tone try scare smokers
seemed right smokers smokers said brutal
would effective
fact experts tailor letters ways may possibly reflect
fact tailoring would appropriate relatively small number
specific cases considered think aloud sessions think aloud sessions
experts looked different smoker questionnaires questionnaires considered two experts may sound lot drop ocean
consider tremendously variable people
comments made smokers stop clinical trial reiter robertson osman revealed think aloud derived rules example
decided include practical stop information letters people currently intending stop smoking smoker comments suggest mistake


fiacquiring correct knowledge nlg

fact experts include information think aloud letters people
decision include information influenced stages
change theoretical model prochaska diclemente behaviour change
states stop advice inappropriate people currently intending stop
retrospect decision probably mistake
repeated two think aloud exercises months originally performed
went back one experts gave two questionnaires
analysed months earlier asked think aloud writing letters
questionnaires letters expert wrote second session
somewhat different ones originally written preferred smokers
letters originally written reiter et al suggests experts
static knowledge sources learning task writing
tailored smoking cessation letters course project perhaps
surprise given none experts ever attempted write letters
getting involved project
role structured expert oriented ka
structured expert oriented ka certainly useful way expand refine generally
improve initial prototypes constructed basis experts direct knowledge focusing
actual cases structuring ka process learned many things
experts mention directly obtained types knowledge mentioned
section working experts relevant expertise example stop
acquired domain knowledge medical effects smoking doctors domain
communication knowledge words use psychologist expertise
writing patient information leaflets communication knowledge graphic design
layout graphic designer
however structured expert oriented ka including particular coverage variability mentioned sessions examined smoker
questionnaires could possibly give good coverage population smokers given
complex variable people variation fact different experts wrote
texts different ways made difficult extract rules think aloud protocols
undoubtably made mistakes regard giving stop information people currently intending stop smoking perhaps focused
single expert order reduce variation however experiences suggested
different experts better different types information experts changed
time might see substantial variation even texts single author
observations raise doubts wisdom usefulness single expert strategy
short complexity nlg tasks means large number structured ka
sessions may needed get good coverage fact numerous ways
write texts fulfill communicative goal means different experts tend write
differently makes analysis structured ka sessions difficult

corpus analysis
recent years great interest natural language processing areas
ai machine learning techniques acquire knowledge relevant data sets
example instead building medical diagnosis system trying understand expert
doctors diagnose diseases instead analyse data sets observed symptoms actual
diseases use statistical machine learning techniques determine symptoms
predict disease similarly instead building english grammar working
expert linguists instead analyse large collections grammatical english texts
order learn allowable structures grammar texts collections texts
called corpora natural language processing
growing interest applying techniques learn knowledge
needed nlg example barzilay mckeown used corpus machine
learning learn paraphrase possibilities duboue mckeown used corpus
machine learning learn np constituents ordered hardt rambow
used corpus machine learning learn rules vp ellipsis
nlg researchers mckeown et al used term corpus
analysis refer manual analysis without machine learning techniques
small set texts written explicitly nlg project domain experts
hence naturally occurring certainly valid valuable ka technique
regard form structured expert oriented ka ways similar thinkaloud protocols corpus analysis refers use machine learning
statistical techniques analyse collections naturally occurring texts
corpus analysis sense word possible stop
collection naturally occurring texts since doctors currently write personalised
smoking cessation letters briefly considered analysing example letters produced
think aloud sessions machine learning techniques
texts believed would successful learning especially given
high variability experts words perhaps primary strength corpus
analysis ability extract information large data sets large
data sets extract information corpus analysis loses much value
sumtime mousam able acquire analyse substantial corpus
human written weather forecasts along data files forecasters looked

conclusion
acquiring correct knowledge nlg difficult knowledge needed
largely knowledge people language communication knowledge complex poorly understood furthermore perhaps writing art
science different people write differently complicates knowledge acquisition process many nlg systems attempt novel tasks currently done manually
makes hard knowledgeable experts good quality corpora perhaps
every single ka technique tried stop sumtimemousam major limitations
easy solution short term believe useful
use mixture different ka techniques since techniques different strengths
weaknesses validate knowledge whenever possible preferably different tech

nique one used acquire knowledge helps developers understand
weaknesses different techniques fact structured expert oriented ka
may give good coverage complexities people language fact
corpus ka distinguish behaviour intended help reader
behaviour intended help writer
longer term need better ka techniques nlg cannot
reliably acquire knowledge needed ai approaches text generation
point approaches regardless clever
first step towards developing better ka techniques acknowledge current ka
techniques working well understand case hope
constitutes useful step direction
