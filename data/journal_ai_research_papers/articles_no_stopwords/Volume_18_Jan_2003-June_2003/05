conclusions
presented multi objective evolutionary moea
goal sequence domination scheme allow advanced specifications hard soft priorities
constraints incorporated better decision support multi objective optimization
addition dynamic fitness sharing scheme simple computation adaptively upon
line population distribution generation proposed dynamic sharing
avoids need priori parameter settings user knowledge usually unknown
trade surface often required existing methods effectiveness proposed features
moea demonstrated showing features contains specific merits
usage benefit performance moea comparison existing evolutionary
approaches simulation moea performed well diversity
evolutionary search uniform distribution non dominated individuals along final
trade offs without significant computational effort moea applied practical
engineering design hdd servo control system simulation real time
implementation evolutionary designed servo system provides excellent
closed loop transient tracking performance
