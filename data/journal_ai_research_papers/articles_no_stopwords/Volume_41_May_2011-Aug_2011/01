abstract
usually voting rule requires agents give preferences linear orders however
cases impractical agent give linear order alternatives
suggested let agents submit partial orders instead given voting rule
profile partial orders alternative candidate c two important questions arise
first still possible c win second c guaranteed win
possible winner necessary winner respectively two
divided two sub determining whether c unique winner
c winner determining whether c co winner c set
winners
consider setting number alternatives unbounded votes
unweighted completely characterize complexity possible necessary winner
following common voting rules class positional scoring rules including
borda copeland maximin bucklin ranked pairs voting trees plurality runoff

introduction
multiagent systems often agents must make joint decision spite fact
different preferences alternatives example agents may
decide joint plan allocation tasks resources general solution
agents vote alternatives agent gives
ranking linear order alternatives voting rule takes submitted
rankings input produces chosen alternative winner set
chosen alternatives design good voting rules studied centuries
social choice community recently computer scientists become interested
social choicemotivated part applications multiagent systems
applications hence community interested computational social choice emerged
traditional social choice agents usually required give linear order
alternatives however especially multiagent systems applications
practical one sometimes set alternatives large example
generally many possible joint plans allocations tasks resources agent
give linear order settings agents must use different voting language
represent preferences example use cp nets boutilier brafman
domshlak hoos poole lang xia lang ying b lang
xia however agent uses cp net similar language represent
preferences generally gives us partial order alternatives another
