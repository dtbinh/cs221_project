Abstract
significant recent interest game-theoretic approaches security, much
recent research focused utilizing leader-follower Stackelberg game model. Among
major applications ARMOR program deployed LAX Airport IRIS program
use US Federal Air Marshals (FAMS). foundational assumption using Stackelberg
games security forces (leaders), acting first, commit randomized strategy;
adversaries (followers) choose best response surveillance randomized strategy.
Yet, many situations, leader may face uncertainty followers surveillance capability.
Previous work fails address leader compute strategy given uncertainty.
provide five contributions context general class security games. First,
show Nash equilibria security games interchangeable, thus alleviating equilibrium
selection problem. Second, natural restriction security games, Stackelberg strategy
Nash equilibrium strategy; furthermore, solution unique class security
games ARMOR key exemplar. Third, faced follower attack
multiple targets, many properties longer hold. Fourth, show experimentally
(but all) games restriction hold, Stackelberg strategy still Nash
equilibrium strategy, longer true attacker attack multiple targets. Finally,
possible direction future research, propose extensive-form game model makes
defenders uncertainty attackers ability observe explicit.

security forces (Conitzer & Sandholm, 2006; Paruchuri et al., 2008; Kiekintveld et al., 2009;
Basilico, Gatti, & Amigoni, 2009; Letchford, Conitzer, & Munagala, 2009; Korzhyk, Conitzer,
& Parr, 2010). framework, defender (i.e., security forces) acts first committing
patrolling inspection strategy, attacker chooses attack observing
defenders choice. typical solution concept applied games Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE), assumes defender choose optimal mixed (randomized) strategy
based assumption attacker observe strategy choose optimal response.
leader-follower paradigm appears fit many real-world security situations.
Indeed, Stackelberg games heart two major deployed decision-support applications. first ARMOR security system, deployed Los Angeles International Airport
(LAX) (Pita et al., 2008; Jain et al., 2010). domain police able set checkpoints
roads leading particular terminals, assign canine units (bomb-sniffing dogs) patrol
terminals. Police resources domain homogeneous, significant scheduling constraints. second IRIS, similar application deployed Federal Air Marshals
Service (FAMS) (Tsai, Rathi, Kiekintveld, Ordonez, & Tambe, 2009; Jain et al., 2010). Armed
marshals assigned commercial flights deter defeat terrorist attacks. domain
complex constraints. particular, marshals assigned tours flights return
destination, tours given marshal available fly limited
marshals current location timing constraints. types scheduling resource constraints
consider work paper motivated necessary represent domain.
Additionally, security applications currently evaluation even
pipeline. example, Transportation Security Administration (TSA) testing evaluating GUARDS system potential national deployment (at 400 airports) GUARDS
uses Stackelberg games TSA security resource allocation conducting security activities
aimed protection airport infrastructure (Pita, Bellamane et al., 2009). Another example
application development United States Coast Guard suggesting patrolling strategies protect ports ensure safety security passenger, cargo, vessel operations.
potential examples include protecting electric power grids, oil pipelines, subway systems
infrastructure (Brown, Carlyle, Salmeron, & Wood, 2005); well border security computer
network security.
However, legitimate concerns whether Stackelberg model appropriate
cases. situations attackers may choose act without acquiring costly information
security strategy, especially security measures difficult observe (e.g., undercover officers)
insiders unavailable. cases, simultaneous-move game model may better
reflection real situation. defender faces unclear choice strategy adopt:
recommendation Stackelberg model, simultaneous-move model, something
else entirely? general settings, equilibrium strategy fact differ models.

course, practice, defender generally know attackers utility function exactly. One way address make uncertainty explicit model game Bayesian
game (Harsanyi, 1968), known algorithms solving SSE strategies Bayesian games
(e.g., Paruchuri et al., 2008) practical small security games, depend
writing complete action space player, exponential size security games.
addition, even complete action space written out, problem NP-hard (Conitzer &
Sandholm, 2006) good approximation guarantee possible unless P=NP (Letchford et al.,
2009). recent paper Kiekintveld, Marecki, Tambe (2011) discusses approximation methods models. Another issue attacker assumed respond optimally,
may true practice; several models Stackelberg games imperfect follower
proposed Pita, Jain, Ordonez, Tambe et al. (2009). solution concepts make
solution robust errors estimation attackers utility function. consider
Bayesian games imperfect attackers paper.

3. Equilibria Security Games
challenge us understand fundamental relationships SSE NE strategies security games. special case zero-sum security games, defenders utility
exact opposite attackers utility. finite two-person zero-sum games, known
different game theoretic solution concepts NE, minimax, maximin SSE give
answer. addition, Nash equilibrium strategies zero-sum games useful property
interchangeable: equilibrium strategy one player paired
players strategy equilibrium profile, result equilibrium, payoffs
players remain same.
Unfortunately, security games necessarily zero-sum (and zero-sum deployed
applications). Many properties zero-sum games hold security games. instance,
minimax strategy security game may maximin strategy. Consider example
Table 2, 3 targets one defender resource. defender three actions;
defenders actions cover one target time, leaving targets uncovered.
3. Technically, exactly true attacker needs break ties defenders favor. However,
attacker indifferent among multiple actions, defender generally modify strategy slightly make
attacker strictly prefer action optimal defender; point tiebreaking assumption merely
make optimal solution well defined. See work von Stengel Zamir (2010) discussion

Table 2: Security game strategically zero-sum.
Strategically zero-sum games (Moulin & Vial, 1978) natural strict superset zerosum games desirable properties zero-sum games still hold. exactly

x = = z = b = c. know + x = u, b + = 2u, c + z = 3u. However since
+ x = b + = c + z, u must 0, contradicts assumption u > 0.
Another concept worth mentioning unilaterally competitive games (Kats &
Thisse, 1992). game unilaterally competitive (or weakly unilaterally competitive), implies
player unilaterally changes action way increases utility, must
result (weak) decrease utility every players utility. hold security
games: example, attacker switches heavily defended sensitive target
undefended target little value defender, change may make players strictly
better off. example shown Table 3. attacker switches attacking t1 attacking
t2 , players utility increases.
Nevertheless, show rest section security games still important
properties. start establishing equivalence set defenders minimax strategies
set defenders NE strategies. Second, show Nash equilibria security games
interchangeable, resolving defenders equilibrium strategy selection problem simultaneousmove games. Third, show natural restriction schedules, SSE strategy

3.1 Equivalence NE Minimax
first prove defenders NE strategy minimax strategy. every defenders

Definition 3. defenders mixed strategy C, define attackers best response utility
E(C) = maxni=1 Ua (C, ti ). Denote minimum attackers best response utilities

Proof. Suppose hC, ai NE profile security game G. According Lemma 3.1, hC, f (a)i

3.2 Interchangeability Nash Equilibria
show Nash equilibria security games interchangeable. result indicates that,
case attacker cannot observe defenders mixed strategy, effectively
equilibrium selection problem: long player plays strategy equilibrium,
result guaranteed equilibrium. course, still resolve issue
clear whether attacker observe mixed strategy; return issue
Subsection 3.3.
Theorem 3.5. Suppose hC, ai hC0 , a0 two NE profiles security game G. hC, a0
hC0 , ai NE profiles G.
Proof. Consider corresponding zero-sum game G. Lemma 3.1, hC, f (a)i hC0 , f (a0 )i
must NE profiles G. interchange property NE zero-sum games (Fudenberg & Tirole, 1991), hC, f (a0 )i hC0 , f (a)i must NE profiles G. Applying Lemma 3.1
direction, get hC, a0 hC0 , ai must NE profiles G.
Theorem 3.5, defenders equilibrium selection problem simultaneous-move security
game resolved. reason given attackers NE strategy a, defender must get
utility responding NE strategy. Next, give insights expected utilities
NE profiles. first show attackers expected utility NE profiles, followed
example demonstrating defender may varying expected utilities corresponding
different attackers strategies.
Theorem 3.6. Suppose hC, ai NE profile security game. Then, Ua (C, a) = E .

Ua (C, a) Ua (C, ) = E(C) = E .
Therefore know Ua (C, a) = E .
Unlike attacker gets utility NE profiles, defender may get varying
expected utilities depending attackers strategy selection. Consider game shown Table 4. defender choose cover one two targets time. defender NE

target ti defender strongly hopes attacked (even Udc (ti ) negative),
given ti fact attacked, defending help defender much (Ud (ti ) =
Udc (ti ) Udu (ti ) small). SSE model, defender likely want devote defensive
resources ti , attacker observe want attack ti . However,
NE model, defenders strategy cannot influence attacker does, marginal utility
assigning defensive resources ti small; and, attacker multiple resources,
may well another target attacker attack valuable defend,
defender send defensive resources instead. provide detailed descriptions games

Since condition Proposition 4.2 implies defenders SSE NE strategies
change number attacker resources varies, provide exhaustive set example games

(Examples 2, 3, 4, 5). set examples rules number ways Proposition 4.2
might generalized larger set games.
4.3 Detailed Proofs Examples
certain assumptions, SSE defender strategies still NE defender strategies model
multiple attacker resources. give simple sufficient condition hold. First,
need following lemma.
Lemma 4.1. Given security game G L L attacker resources, let G 1 game except
one attacker resource. Let hc, ai Nash equilibrium G 1 . Suppose target

Proof. Lai 1 ti , La fact feasible attacker strategy G L . left
prove hd, Lai fact equilibrium. attacker best-responding utility

G 1 , still optimal defender defend schedules support c.
lemma immediately gives us following proposition:
Proposition 4.2. Given game G L L attacker resources SSAS holds, let G 1
game except one attacker resource. Suppose SSE strategy G L
G 1 . Let strategy attacker hd, ai Nash equilibrium G 1 (we know
exists Corollary 3.9). Lai 1 target ti , hd, Lai NE profile G L ,
means SSE NE strategy G L .
simple example Proposition 4.2 applies constructed follows.
Example 1. Suppose 3 targets, completely interchangeable players.
Suppose defender 1 resource. attacker 1 resource, defenders SSE strategy
= (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) attackers NE best-response = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3). attacker
2 resources, defenders SSE strategy still d. Since ti , 2ai 1, Proposition 4.2
applies, profile hd, 2ai NE profile.
denote defenders SSE strategy game L attacker resources cS,L denote
defenders NE strategy game cN ,L . Example 1, cN ,1 = cS,1 =
cS,2 = cN ,2 . Hence, conditions, defenders strategy always sameregardless
whether use SSE NE regardless whether attacker 1 2 resources.
show several examples games true, even though SSAS holds.
following cases, show example game SSAS holds relation
defenders equilibrium strategies specified case description. first case,
SSE strategy equal NE strategy L = 2, condition Proposition 4.2 met
SSE strategy L = 1 different SSE strategy L = 2,
multiplying attackers NE strategy game L = 1 attacker resource 2 result
feasible attackers strategy (in game L = 2 attacker resources otherwise
same). last three cases, SSE strategy equal NE strategy L = 2.
cS,2 = cN ,2 6= cN ,1 = cS,1 (SSE vs. NE makes difference, L makes difference);
cN ,2 6= cS,2 = cS,1 = cN ,1 (NE L = 2 different cases);
cS,2 6= cN ,2 = cN ,1 = cS,1 (SSE L = 2 different cases);
cS,2 6= cN ,2 ; cS,2 6= cS,1 = cN ,1 ; cN ,2 6= cN ,1 = cS,1 (all cases different, except SSE
NE L = 1 implied Corollary 3.9).
easy see cases exhaustive, following. Corollary 3.9 necessitates cS,1 = cN ,1 (because want SSAS hold cS,L cN ,L strategy unique),
effectively three potentially different strategies, cN ,2 , cS,2 , cS,1 = cN ,1 .

Tennenholtz (2002) studies safety-level strategies. two players, safety-level (or maximin)
strategy player 1 mixed strategy maximizes expected utility player 1,
assumption player 2 acts minimize player 1s expected utility (rather maximize
utility). Tennenholtz shows conditions, utility guaranteed safety-level
strategy equal close utility obtained player 1 Nash equilibrium. may sound

quite different: particular, non-zero-sum games, maximin minimax strategies

8. Summary
paper focused general class defender-attacker Stackelberg games directly
inspired real-world security applications. paper confronts fundamental questions
defender compute mixed strategy. context, paper provides four key contributions. First, exploiting structure security games, paper shows Nash equilibria security games interchangeable, thus alleviating defenders equilibrium selection
problem simultaneous-move games. Second, resolving defenders dilemma, shows
SSAS restriction security games, Stackelberg strategy Nash equilibrium
strategy; furthermore, strategy unique class security games ARMOR
key exemplar. Third, faced follower attack multiple targets, many
properties longer hold, providing key direction future research. Fourth, experimental
results emphasize positive properties security games fit SSAS property. practical
terms, contributions imply defenders applications ARMOR (Pita et al., 2008)
IRIS (Tsai et al., 2009) simply commit SSE strategies, thus helping resolve major
dilemma real-world security applications.
