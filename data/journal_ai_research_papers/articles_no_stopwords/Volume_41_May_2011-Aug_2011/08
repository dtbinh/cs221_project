leader follower paradigm appears fit many real world security situations
indeed stackelberg games heart two major deployed decision support applications first armor security system deployed los angeles international airport

marshals assigned commercial flights deter defeat terrorist attacks domain
complex constraints particular marshals assigned tours flights return
destination tours given marshal available fly limited
marshals current location timing constraints types scheduling resource constraints
consider work motivated necessary represent domain
additionally security applications currently evaluation even
pipeline example transportation security administration tsa testing evaluating guards system potential national deployment airports guards
uses stackelberg games tsa security resource allocation conducting security activities
aimed protection airport infrastructure pita bellamane et al another example
application development united states coast guard suggesting patrolling strategies protect ports ensure safety security passenger cargo vessel operations
potential examples include protecting electric power grids oil pipelines subway systems

network security
however legitimate concerns whether stackelberg model appropriate
cases situations attackers may choose act without acquiring costly information
security strategy especially security measures difficult observe e g undercover officers

reflection real situation defender faces unclear choice strategy adopt
recommendation stackelberg model simultaneous move model something
