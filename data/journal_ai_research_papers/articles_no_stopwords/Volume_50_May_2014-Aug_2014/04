conclusion future work
techniques scaling automated alignment large ontologies previously proposed presented novel bcd speed alignment process
important class iterative anytime demonstrating high quality alignments often consuming time non iterative demonstrated
technique context four different iterative evaluated impact
total time execution final alignments precision recall reported significant
reductions total execution times enhanced bcd reductions
noticeable larger ontology pairs often converged lesser number
iterations simultaneously utilizing default scheme grouping alignment variables
participating entities one ontology block height optimizing blocks order increasing height observe improvement precision
alignments generated significant change recall
possible improve run time performance default partitioning
ordering scheme utilizing schemes note may negatively impact
alignment quality subsequently default scheme generally recommended existing
iterative alignment techniques seek utilize bcd
ability improve quickly allows iterative alignment run convergence
possible contrast common practice terminating alignment process arbitrary
number iterations predefining common bound number iterations difficult
speeding convergence becomes vital observe bcd promote scalability
large ontologies
finally demonstrated benefits bcd toward aligning pairs biomedical ontology testbed due large number ontologies biomedicine critical need
ontology alignment vast domain future work continue focus methods
would allow general principled alignment approaches falcon ao optima perform better testbed producing better quality alignment pairs less time
aligning large biomedical ontologies popular use snomed ct nci
consequently believe community benchmark could potentially drive future
toward pragmatic ontology alignment
