qualitative spatial reasoning received constantly increasing amount interest literature
main reason probably spatial reasoning proved applicable realworld example geographical database systems egenhofer grigni papadias

instances huge complexity highly relevant
area study however questions computational complexity received much attention
literature two notable exceptions reported nebel renz
nebel article take small step towards better understanding complexity
issues qualitative spatial reasoning
well known framework qualitative spatial reasoning called rcc randell

definition rcc relation r said acyclic relation iff cycle g r
every arc never satisfiable
relation pp example acyclic relation fpp eqg acyclic continue
showing properties acyclic relations
proposition let r acyclic relation every relation r r acyclic
proof since taking subsets r constrains satisfiability follows

proposition let r acyclic relation choose fr j r rg
cycle g every arc labelled relation unsatisfiable
proof argument previous proposition

following definition needed following proofs
definition let instance r satisfiability model r r

relation r r xr satisfied

definition may seem bit cumbersome essence clear example let x
region variables related x fpo ppgy model x interpreted f g
f g fpo ppg satisfied fppg fpo ppg
lemma let r acyclic relation sets fr j r rg
fa feqg j ag every cycle c labelled relations satisfiable iff contains
relations furthermore relations cycle satisfied eq
proof suppose cycle c satisfiable contains relation
apply induction number n arcs cycle n get contradiction
proposition suppose induction c contains n arcs let r model
relations c cannot case every relation c satisfied
relation proposition thus relation r c satisfied eq
collapse two variables connected r one variable cycle n nodes
containing relation contradicts induction hypothesis
suppose cycle c contains relations c satisfied choosing eq
every arc notice part implies c must satisfied choosing eq every arc



hence variables forced equal

studied acyclic relations turn attention dag satisfying relations
formal definition follows
definition basic relation b said dag satisfying iff dag directed acyclic
graph labelled relations containing b satisfiable e corresponding rsat
model
typical example dag satisfying relation eq given dag labelled relations containing eq satisfy relations assigning non empty set variables
pp dag satisfying relation
definition let g arbitrary dag node v g said terminal node iff
arcs start v
lemma basic relation pp dag satisfying
proof let g dag labelled relations containing pp g satisfied
r model induction n number nodes g case n
trivial suppose g n nodes remove terminal node g induction remaining
graph g hv e satisfiable model swe shall construct model g
agrees every variable g let fm v j v v g let element
let g fffg obviously model g

state simple drakengren jonsson
lemma let g irre exive acyclic subgraph arcs g
reoriented resulting graph acyclic
specializing get next lemma
lemma let g irre exive acyclic subgraph let arcs labelled
relations containing pp arcs labelled relations containing pp ppi
g r satisfiable
graph irre exive iff arcs node v node v



fijonsson drakengren

proof reorient arcs g resulting graph acyclic possible
previous lemma furthermore whenever arc reoriented invert relation
arc g satisfiable iff g construction arcs containing pp ppi
reoriented every arc dag g contains pp thus since pp dag satisfying
lemma g satisfiable consequently g satisfiable

lemma correctly solves rsat r
proof assume finds strongly connected component g contains
relation fpp eqg containing two nodes g connected arc e labelled
relation r contain eq exists cycle c relation
every arc contains eq e connects two nodes c e part cycle
lemma c satisfied choosing relation eq every arc c since r

admit eq c unsatisfiable
otherwise every strongly connected component collapsed single node removing
arcs start end collapsed node transformation retains satisfiability
argument collapsing subgraph obtained considering arcs labelled
fpp eqg acyclic since remaining arcs labelled relations containing pp
ppi graph r satisfiable lemma note graph irre exive since every
node contained strongly connected component

lemma given graph g hv ei runs jv j jej time
proof strongly connected components found jv j jej time baase
remaining test made jv j je j time
