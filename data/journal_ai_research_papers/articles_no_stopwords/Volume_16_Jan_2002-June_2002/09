suboptimality spa
perhaps simplest example individual greed part agents lead
collective detriment occurs two agents determine shortest path
shared link limited capacity second option slightly
less preferable case common link degrades performance
parties since due limited capacity performance link quickly fall
second option
precisely consider case shared link cost given x
traversed x packets router optional second link destination
cost trac x traverse second link x acting alone single
packet send would send packet shared link cost
however incur larger cost cost used
second choices cost without knowing ahead time
information conventionally contained routing tables agents necessarily
mistaken cost estimates therefore make incorrect routing decisions even
limit differentially small packets use spa lead wrong routing decision

conclusion

effective routing network fundamental many fields including data
communications transportation shortest path spa
routers determine router decisions popular however
certain circumstances suffers number undesirable effects one effect
braess paradox pattern introduced trac network increasing
capacity network lower overall throughput due harmful sideeffects decisions made router trac rest system even
theoretical load balancing addresses effects produce
decisions optimal single moment time still suffer side effects
sub optimal performance effects extend across time
e affects performance later well space
collective intelligence novel way controlling distributed systems
avoid deleterious side effects routing decisions central idea learning
control autonomous agents constitute overall distributed system
collective intelligence coin central issue determine personal
objectives assigned autonomous agents one wants choose
goals greedy pursuit goals associated learning leads
desirable behavior overall system summarized mathematics
designing goals derived routing mathematics
ran computer simulations compare coin ideal spa
whose performance upper bounds real world spa routing coin severely handicapped estimation effect sets used
exceedingly crude addition learning agents particularly
unsophisticated therefore able effectively maximize individual performances contrast ideal spa access information concerning state
system real world implementable coin information real world
spa could access


fiwolpert tumer
despite biases favor ideal spa experiments ideal spa induced
average costs much higher coin furthermore
coin almost avoided braess paradox seriously diminished

domains coordination autonomous rovers tumer agogino wolpert

utility functions members mas ensure work coordinated
ecient manner optimize overall performance currently investigating extensions
coin involve novel goals agents goals learnable learning expanding simulations larger networks
commercial event driven simulator future work focus making approximation current trac levels affect future windowed loads equation
involve investigating better estimates effect sets particular including
