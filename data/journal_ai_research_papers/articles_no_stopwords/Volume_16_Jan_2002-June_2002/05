introduction
image retrieval selecting repository images images fulfilling maximum extent criterion specified end user
concentrate content image retrieval criteria express properties
appearance image e pictorial characteristics

nevertheless present systems fail treating correctly high level characteristics
image retrieve stamps galloping horse first systems cannot
even allow user specify queries lack language expressing highlevel features usually overcome help examples retrieve images similar

discussion pose similarities
worst difference evaluating pose similarities components may appear
somewhat drastic choice however guided choice goal preserving
downward refinement property even abandon exact recognition
previous section
theorem let c composite shape description let refinement c

c uhc b every image segmented regions r rm c
di computed similarities defined holds c
proof every injective function j used map components c extended
function j letting j n suitable region index range
j since computed extended mappings sufficient
values computed formula increase reference values computed
c
let j mapping maximum value c reached every extension

j j leads minimum value minn
formula lower c fact
pose differences computed maximums strictly greater set
values hence pose similarities value lower one regarding
color texture shape similarities adding another component worsen values
components c since assign components worst similarity group
consider another injective mapping j yields non maximum value v c
formula argument pose differences every
extension j leads minimum value v v since v c every extension
every mapping j different j yields value less c completes
proof

experiments although exhaustive catch
good extent users information need make refined distinctions images
searching composite shapes
believe proposal opens least three directions future first
language describing composite shapes could enriched logicoriented connectives e g alternative components corresponding compositions sequences shape arrangements cope objects internal movements video sequence retrieval second techniques computational geometry could
