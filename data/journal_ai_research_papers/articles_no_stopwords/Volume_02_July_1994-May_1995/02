abstract
information extraction task automatically picking information interest
unconstrained text information interest usually extracted two steps
first sentence level processing locates relevant pieces information scattered throughout
text second discourse processing merges coreferential information generate
output first step pieces information locally identified without recognizing
relationships among key word search simple pattern search achieve
purpose second step requires deeper knowledge order understand relationships
among separately identified pieces information previous information extraction systems
focused first step partly required link piece
information pieces link extracted pieces information map
onto structured output format complex discourse processing essential
reports japanese information extraction system merges information
pattern matcher discourse processor evaluation high level system
performance approaches human performance

introduction
recent information extraction systems individual pieces information extracted directly text usually identified key word search simple pattern
search preprocessing stage lehnert et al weischedel et al cowie et al
jacobs et al among systems presented fifth message understanding conference muc however main architectures ranged pattern matching
full fragment parsing onyshkevych full fragment parsing systems
several knowledge sources syntax semantics domain knowledge combined
run time generally complicated changing part system tends affect
components past information extraction interference slowed
development jacobs hobbs et al pattern matcher identifies
patterns interest appropriate information extraction texts narrow
domains since task require full understanding text

textract information extraction system described uses pattern matcher
similar sri fastus pattern matcher hobbs et al matcher implemented
finite state automaton unlike pattern matchers textract matcher deals
word matching caused word segmentation ambiguities often found
japanese compound words
goal pattern matcher identify concepts represented words
phrases text pattern matcher first performs simple key word concept
search locating individual words associated concepts second step template
pattern search locates phrasal patterns involving critical pieces information identified preprocessor template pattern search identifies relationships
matched objects defined pattern well recognizing concept behind relationship one typical concept relationship economic activity companies
participate
usually dicult determine relationships among pieces information
identified separate sentences relationships often stated implicitly
even text explicitly mentions descriptions often located far enough
apart make detection dicult although importance discourse processing information extraction emphasized message understanding conferences lehnert
sundheim hirschman system presented satisfactorily addressed
issue
discourse processor textract able correlate individual pieces information
throughout text textract merges concepts pattern matcher identified
separately usually different sentences concepts involve companies textract unify multiple references company even company
name missing abbreviated pronominalized furthermore processor segments
discourse isolate portions text relevant particular conceptual relationship
discourse segmentation lessens chance merging unrelated information kitani

tipster information extraction task
goal tipster project sponsored arpa capture information interest
english japanese newspaper articles corporate joint ventures microelectronics system must fill generic template information extracted text
fully automated process template composed several objects containing several slots slots may contain pointers related objects tipster extracted
information stored object oriented database
joint ventures domain task extract information concerning joint venture
relationships organizations form dissolve template structure represents
relationships tie relationship objects contain pointers organization
entity objects representing organizations involved entity objects contain pointers

pieces information referring entities merging produce correct
therefore correct identification entity references crucial

definition
section first describes word matching caused word segmentation ambiguities diculties reference resolution company names explained issues
discourse segmentation concept merging discussed example text

word segmentation
japanese word segmentation preprocessor gives rise subsequent matching
key word text found word segmentor lexicon
segmentor tends divide separate words current lexicon example


fikitani eriguchi hara

compound noun f teikei kaisyo consisting two words teikei joint
venture f kaisyo dissolve segmented two individual nouns thus
key word search f teikei kaisyo succeed segmented sentence
hand pattern matching process allows default partial matching
key word word text teikei z gyoum teikei
meaning joint venture matched single key word
teikei exibility creates matching example key word
js silicon matches f js nisanka silicon silicon dioxide although
different materials reported microelectronics domain segmentation diculties compound nouns cause major word japanese

company name references

corporate joint ventures domain output templates mostly describe relationships
among companies described section information interest therefore found
sentences mention companies activities essential extractor
identify topic companies main concern sentences appear order
correlate information identified sentence three make
dicult identify topic companies
missing subject
topic companies usually subject sentence japanese sentences frequently
omit subjects however even formal newspaper articles veniex system
nec presented muc identify company implied missing subject
explicit reference immediately preceding sentence doi et al
muraki et al clear whether veniex resolve missing
reference explicit reference appears sentence separated
subjectless sentence
company name abbreviations

discourse segmentation concept merging

joint ventures domain tie relationship object contains pointers objects
economic activities shown figure company involved multiple tie ups merging information tie relationship according topic companies
sometimes yields incorrect consider following example
x corp tied corp x start selling products
japan next month last year x started similar joint venture
z inc

obviously sale second sentence related tie relationship x
however since topic company subject sentence x three
sentences sale could related x z tie relationship incorrect
merging avoided separating text two blocks first two sentences
describe x tie last sentence describes x z tie thus
discourse segmentation necessary identify portions text containing related pieces
information crl brandeis diderot system segments joint ventures text
two types text structures cowie et al known well discourse
segmentation performed however
text segmented concepts identified pieces information merged
within discourse segment example expected income joint venture
often stated sentence explicitly mention participating companies
appear previous sentence case joint venture concept identifying
companies income concept identifying expected income must merged
latter linked correct entity objects

concept search

key words representing concept grouped list used recognize

concept search module recognizes concept locates one associated

hotel reservation key word concept search successful processing text
narrow domain words used restricted meanings
matching occurs compound noun key word list
concept fails match text instance compound text

concept matching prevented anchoring beginning end

template pattern search
textract pattern matcher implemented finite state recognizer choice

topic companies inherited even current sentence contains non company subject supposition sentence introduces companies
usually mentions explicitly subject
abbreviation detection unification

company name abbreviations following observed characteristics
