testing worth costs tests means cost must assigned
tests classification errors
another limitation many existing cost sensitive classification eg csid use greedy heuristics select step whatever test contributes

calculating average cost classification

section describe calculate average cost classification decision
tree given set testing data method described applied uniformly decision trees generated five examined eg cs id idx c
icet method assumes standard classification decision tree generated
c makes assumptions tree generated purpose
method give plausible estimate average cost expected real world
application decision tree
assume dataset split training set testing set
expected cost classification estimated average cost classification testing set average cost classification calculated dividing total cost
whole testing set number cases testing set total cost includes
costs tests costs classification errors simplest case assume
specify test costs simply listing test paired corresponding cost
complex cases considered later section assume specify
costs classification errors classification cost matrix
suppose c distinct classes classification cost matrix c c matrix
element c j cost guessing case belongs class actually
belongs class j need assume constraints matrix except costs
finite real values allow negative costs interpreted benefits however experiments reported restricted attention classification cost
matrices diagonal elements zero assume correct classification
cost diagonal elements positive numbers
calculate cost particular case follow path decision tree
add cost test chosen e test occurs path root
leaf test appears twice charge first occurrence test
example one node path may say patient age less years another node
may say patient age years charge cost determining patients age leaf tree specifies trees guess class case
given actual class case use cost matrix determine cost trees
guess cost added costs tests determine total cost classification
case
core method calculating average cost classification decision tree two additional elements method handling conditional test
costs delayed test
allow cost test conditional choice prior tests specifically
consider case group tests shares common cost example set blood
tests shares common cost collecting blood patient common cost
charged decision made first blood test charge
collecting blood second blood test since may use blood collected
first blood test thus cost test group conditional whether another
member group already chosen
common costs appear frequently testing example diagnosis aircraft
engine group tests may share common cost removing engine plane
restriction seems reasonable starting point exploring cost sensitive classification future work
investigate effects weakening restriction

installing test cell semiconductor manufacturing group tests may share
common cost reserving region silicon wafer special test structure image
recognition group image processing may share common preprocessing
examples realistic assessment cost decision
tree frequently need make allowances conditional test costs
often happens test available immediately example
medical doctor typically sends blood test laboratory gets next day
allow test labelled immediate delayed test delayed cannot
use outcome influence choice next test example blood tests
delayed cannot allow outcome one blood test play role decision
second blood test must make commitment second
blood test know first blood test
delayed tests relatively common example many medical tests must shipped
laboratory analysis gas turbine engine diagnosis main fuel control frequently shipped specialized company diagnosis repair classification requires multiple experts one experts might immediately available
handle immediate tests decision tree described handle delayed tests
follows follow path case root decision tree appropriate
leaf encounter node anywhere along path delayed test
committed performing tests subtree rooted node since
cannot make decision tests node conditional outcome test
node must pledge pay tests might possibly need perform
point onwards decision tree
method handling delayed tests may seem bit puzzling first difficulty
decision tree combines method selecting tests method classifying
cases tests delayed forced proceed two phases first phase
select tests second phase collect test classify case example
doctor collects blood patient sends blood laboratory doctor must tell
laboratory tests done blood next day doctor gets
tests laboratory decides diagnosis patient decision
tree naturally handle situation selection tests isolated
classification cases method first phase doctor uses decision
tree select tests long tests immediate soon
first delayed test encountered doctor must select tests might possibly
needed second phase doctor must select tests subtree rooted
first delayed test second phase test arrive next day
doctor information required go root tree leaf make
classification doctor must pay tests subtree even though
tests along one branch subtree actually used doctor know
advance branch actually used time necessary order
blood tests laboratory blood tests naturally want doctor pay
tests ordered even used making diagnosis
general makes sense desired immediate tests
desired delayed tests since outcome immediate test used influence
decision delayed test vice versa example medical doctor question
simplification situation real world realistic treatment delayed tests one
areas future work section

search binary space

icet searches biases space n real numbers inspired aha bankert
decided see would happen icet restricted space n
binary numbers real numbers modified icet eg given true cost
test instead pseudo cost bias conditional test costs used nodiscount cost see section n binary digits used exclude include test
eg allowed use excluded tests decision trees generated
precise let b b n n binary numbers let c c n n real numbers experiment set c true cost th test experiment genesis change c c constant given test given dataset instead
genesis manipulates value b binary number b used determine
whether eg allowed use test decision tree b eg allowed
use th test th attribute otherwise b eg allowed use th
test eg uses icf equation usual true costs c thus modified version
icet searching binary bias space instead real bias space
hypothesis icet would perform better searching real bias space
three experiments took one week sparc tried three settings

experiment raises interesting questions seeding population

icf equation device genesis controls decision tree induction

seems make sense current deprives eg direct

section

search bias space anything useful start true costs tests reasonable values parameters cf much improvement get
genetic search experiment seeded population individual represents exactly bias eg first n numbers true test costs last two numbers cf therefore determine value genetic search

currently implemented handle cost attributes calculated
attributes example thyroid dataset appendix fti test calculated
tt u tests fti test selected must pay
tt u tests tt u tests already selected fti test free
since calculation trivial ability deal calculated test could
added icet relatively little effort
icet currently implemented handles two classes test tests
immediate tests delayed clearly continuous range
delays seconds years chosen treat delays distinct test costs
could argued delay simply another type test cost example could
say group blood tests shares common cost one day wait cost
one blood tests conditional whether prepared commit

questions treated delays another type test cost

four possibilities
first cost test function prior tests selected icet

second cost test function actual class case example
test heart disease might involve heavy exercise appendix patient actually
heart disease exercise might trigger heart attack risk included
cost particular test thus cost test vary depending whether
patient actually heart disease implemented although could easily

third cost test function tests example drawing blood newborn costly drawing blood adult assign cost
blood test need know age patient age patient represented another test patient age test slightly complex
preceding cases must insure blood test accompanied patient age test implemented although could added

fourth cost test function test example injecting

attribute selection function n takes input n information

attributes may view c c n parameters attribute selection function parameters may used control bias attribute selection procedure

future would investigate general attribute selection functions
n

genesis would used tune weights neural network attribute
selection function might benefit addition input specifies depth
decision tree current node information gain values measured
would enable bias test vary depending many tests already
selected
another area future work explore parameter settings control genesis

substantially improve performance icet tuning parameters recent
