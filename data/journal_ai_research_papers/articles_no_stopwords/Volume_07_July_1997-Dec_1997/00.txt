Abstract

Starting likelihood preference order worlds, extend likelihood

considered notion relative likelihood context studying counterfactuals,
assumed total preference order worlds. Complications arise examining
partial orders present total orders. subtleties involving exact
approach lifting order worlds order sets worlds. addition,
axiomatization logic relative likelihood case partial orders gives insight
connection relative likelihood default reasoning.

Proof: Suppose > orderly qualitative relation. see > transitive, suppose
V1 > V2 V2 > V3. Since > orderly, follows (V1 [ V3 ) > V2 (V1 [ V2 ) > V3 .
Since > qualitative, follows V1 > (V2 [ V3 ). fact > orderly,

Proposition 2.5:
(a) partial preorder W , orderly partial preorder 2W
satisfies union property.
(b) partial preorder W , 0 orderly strict partial order 2W .
(c) strict partial order W , orderly qualitative strict partial
order 2W .

Proof: prove part (c) here; proof parts (a) (b) similar spirit,
left reader. fact orderly strict partial order straightforward,
left reader. see qualitative, suppose V1 [ V2 V3
V1 [ V3 V2 . Let v 2 V2 [ V3 . must show v0 2 V1 dominates
V2 [ V3 v0 v. Suppose without loss generality v 2 V2 (an identical
argument works v 2 V3 ). Since V1 [ V3 V2 , u 2 V1 [ V3 dominates
V2 u v. u dominates V3 , clearly dominates V2 [ V3 must

element u0 2 V3 u0 u. Since V1 [ V2 V3 , must v0 2 V1 [ V2

v0 dominates V3 v0 u0 . Since u dominates V2 u0 u, follows u
dominates V2 . Since v0 u0 , v0 dominates V2 . Hence, v0 dominates V2 [ V3 .
follows v0 cannot V2 , must V1 . Thus, element V1 ,
namely v0 , v0 v v0 dominates V2 [ V3 , desired.

Lemma 2.6: total preorder, strict partial order determined
modular. Moreover, > modular, strict partial order W , total
preorder W > strict partial order determined .
Proof: Suppose total preorder. see modular, suppose w1 w2 .
Given arbitrary w3 , w3 w1 , follows transitivity w3 w2 .
hand, case w3 w1 , w1 w3 . Thus, either
w3 w2 w1 w3 , modular.
suppose > modular strict partial order W . Define w v
either w > v neither w > v v > w hold. Clearly, exive. see
transitive, suppose v1 v2 v2 v3 . three cases: (1) v1 > v2 ,
since > modular, either v1 > v3 v3 > v2 . cannot v3 > v2 ,
would v2 v3 . Thus, must v1 > v3 , hence v1 v3 . (2)
v2 > v3 , using modularity again, get either v1 > v3 v2 > v1. Again,
cannot v2 > v1 , must v1 > v3 , v1 v3 . (3) neither
v1 >v2 v2 >v3 hold, claim neither v1 >v3 v3 >v1 hold. v1 >v3 ,
modularity, must either v1 > v2 v2 > v3 . v3 > v1 , either
v3 > v2 v2 > v1 , contradicts assumption v1 v2 v2 v3 . Thus,
conclude v1 v3 . Thus, transitive. Finally, almost immediate
definition > strict partial order determined .
Lemma 2.7: modular relation W , modular relation 2W .
Proof: Suppose modular. want show modular. suppose
V1 V2 , case V1 V3. must show V3 V2 . Since
case V1 V3 , must v 2 V3 u 2 V1 ,
u v . suppose v 2 V2. claim v v. see this, note since V1 V2 ,
must u 2 V1 u v. Since modular, either
u v v v. Since, choice v , u v , must v v.
follows V3 V2 .
Lemma 2.8: > modular strict partial order satisfies union property,

> qualitative.
Proof: Suppose > modular strict partial order satisfies union property.
see > qualitative, suppose (V1 [ V2 ) > V3 (V1 [ V3 ) > V2 . Since >
modular, follows either (V1 [ V2 ) > V1 V1 > V3 . (V1 [ V2 ) > V1 , then, using
fact > satisfies union property (V1 [ V2 ) >V3 , get (V1 [ V2 ) > (V1 [ V3 ).
Using transitivity, follows (V1 [ V2 ) > V2 . Using union property again, get
(V1 [ V2 ) > (V1 [ V2 ). contradicts assumption > irre exive. Thus,

must V1 >V3 . similar argument shows V1 >V2 . Using union property,
get V1 > (V2 [ V3 ), desired.

Proof: Suppose assumptions lemma holds X > ; must show

Let X 0 minimal subset X X 0 > A. Since F finite, X 0 must

Let Z 0 consist successors t0 labeled atoms contained 00 . Z 0 1-cover
