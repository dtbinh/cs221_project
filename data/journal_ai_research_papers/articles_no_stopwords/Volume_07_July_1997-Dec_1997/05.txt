3. Scene Analysis
Research machine vision long concerned problems involved automatic image interpretation. Marr (1982) defines computational vision \the process
discovering present world, is". Similar visual scene analysis, molecular scene analysis concerned processes reconstruction, classification
understanding complex images. section presents problem molecular scene
analysis context related research machine vision medical imaging.
Early vision systems generally include set processes determine physical properties 3D surfaces 2D arrays. input arrays contain pixel values denote
properties light intensity. Considerable research carried extracting
3D information one 2D images. review application stereo vision
sets 2D images found (Faugeras, 1993). principles stereo vision
applied moving images (Zhang & Faugeras, 1992). Range data provides
explicit depth information visible surfaces form 2D array (depth map).
Depending application, surface or/and volume fitting techniques applied
images. complete review vision techniques found elsewhere (e.g.,
(Arman & Aggarwal, 1993; Besl & Jain, 1986; Jain & Flynn, 1993)).
Similar crystallography problem, medical imaging techniques require genuine
3D data: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed high-resolution information
tissue density; emission computed tomography (ECT), includes positron emission tomography (PET) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), gives
noisy, low-resolution information metabolic activity. X-ray computed tomography
(CT) ultrasound provide 3D density data. methods used obtain
series 2D images (slices) which, properly aligned, provide 3D grid.
interslice spacing may much larger spacing grid points slice,
alignment slices followed interpolation slices one area research.
low-level segmentation medical images typically uses 3D extensions 2D techniques. Edge detection becomes surface detection, region growing defines volumes instead
areas. Many applications typically require detailed, high-level models. Surface
information used construct models simulations, volumes surfaces provide
structural measurements. Higher-level models used construction \templates"

acid residues along main chain identifying secondary structure motifs. higher
resolution, analysis would attend identification residues and, possibly,

primary step scene analysis (whether vision, medical crystallographic data
used) automatically partition image representation disjoint regions. Ideally,
segmented region corresponds semantically meaningful component object
scene. parts used input high-level classification task. processes
segmentation classification may interwoven; domain knowledge, form
partial interpretation, often useful assessing guiding segmentation.
Several approaches image segmentation classification considered

point surface range image. Image segmentation achieved
identification primitive critical points (peaks, pits, ridges, etc.). Haralick et al. (1983)
defined similar set topographic features use 2D image analysis, Wang Pavlidis

ridge defined point intensity falls sharply two directions
valley bottom point intensity increases sharply two directions.
examined behavior ridges valleys scale space; resulting
resolution hierarchies could used guide segmentation. Maintz et al. (1996) Guziec
Ayache (1992) use 3D differential operators scale space define ridges
troughs. provide landmarks used register images. Leonardis, Gupta

approach reconstructs backbone protein connecting critical points 3D

Critical points image considered medical domain. Higgins et

grown along ridges steep dropoff. Post-processing removes cavities spurs.
resulting volume tree-like structure, skeletonized pruned

1993b; Hunter & States, 1991; Unger, Harel, Wherland, & Sussman, 1989); although
scenes wish analyze novel, substructures likely appeared previously determined structures. Another significant difference molecular visual

simplifying eliminating many problems faced low-level vision (e.g., occlusion,
shading). complexity exist crystallographic domain relates

4.1 Representation Protein Structure

Crucial molecular scene analysis representation capture molecular shape

scene analysis parsing protein, protein fragments, shape primitives
allow rapid accurate identification. Shape information extracted
several depictive representations { example, van der Waals surfaces, electrostatic

means 1 ; 2 covariance matrix V12 . data might better explained
mixture, weighted sum, several Gaussian distributions, 2D mean
vector covariance matrix. approach, one tries find optimal set parameter
values representation datapoint x = (x1 ; x2 ). Optimality may defined

modeled one circular distributions von Mises distribution (Fisher,
1993).
Two independence assumptions, crucial computational eciency data eciency,
underlie approach:
1. Within given class, attributes characterizing segment mutually independent.
2. separate datapoints, corresponding segment, mutually independent.
Although neither assumptions strictly true application, assumptions commonly made circumstances, methods based work
well practice. dependence assumptions proves untenable, one employ elaborate models incorporate explicit dependencies, Bayes Nets
