explanation

observations raise number questions peak search cost exists
peak occurs near transition mostly solvable mostly unsolvable
thus independent particular search behavior seen
large variety constraint satisfaction
existing explanation concentration hard relies competition
changes number solutions amount pruning provided

pronounced larger considered leading sharper peaks abrupt
