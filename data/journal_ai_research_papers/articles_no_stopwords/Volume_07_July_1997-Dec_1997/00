capture likelihood ordering set w possible worlds partial preorder

b r b assuming anti symmetric
preorder



firelative likelihood partially ordered preferential structures

w w usual often write u v rather v u take u v
abbreviation u v v u u v abbreviation v u
relation strict partial order irre exive w case
w w transitive relation w say strict partial order determined

said introduction think providing likelihood preferential order worlds w thus w w holds w least likely preferred normal close
actuality w given interpretation fact assumed partial
preorder easy justify example transitivity says u least likely
v v least likely w u least likely w notice since
partial preorder may pairs worlds w w incomparable
according intuitively may prepared say one likelier
say total preorder connected linear preorder
worlds w w w w w w
since added likelihood worlds seems reasonable add likelihood
language allow us say likely example
exactly mean although semantic model allows us say
one world likely another immediately tell us say set
worlds likely another set observed introduction
need make sense likely
extend likelihood ordering worlds one sets worlds clearly
want way preserves ordering worlds
denote ordering sets would certainly expect u v would imply fug fvg
could impose minimal requirements certainly would enough
uniquely determine ordering sets example two general approaches
distinguish put subscripts
define u v u u v v u v
define strict partial order spirit two distinct ways
considering analogous procedure used get define
u v u v v u call standard method

b replacing definition define u v
u u v v u v call alternative method
define u v v v u u u v
u v note focuses symmetric difference u
v two ways getting strict partial order
standard method gives us u v u v v u
b alternative method gives us u v v v u
u u v u v
first used doyle shoham wellman defining

point relations weak allow us make important
distinctions go define notions comparison tuned
applications spirit notions considering
second typically widely used applications
literature example
dershowitz manna use define ordering multisets
used provide technique proving program termination
przymusinski uses order database
brass cayrol royer saurel delgrande geffner
use help model aspects default reasoning
focus variant second essentially due lewis
interesting connections default reasoning roughly speaking take
u likely v every world v likely world u
make precise u v w write u v every world v v
world u u u v easy check partial preorder
exive transitive superscript set moreover total preorder
finally would expect u v iff fug fvg relation
sets worlds viewed generalization relation worlds
apply standard method alternative method define
strict partial order standard method gives us relation u v holds
u v v u alternative method gives us relation defined
finite sets taking u v hold u nonempty every world v v
world u u u v reasons u taken nonempty
definition restricted finite sets discussed
approaches compare clearly u v implies u v although
converse hold general weak ordering consequence
incomparable similar remarks apply easy
see u v implies u v hand two notions equivalent
example suppose v v fvg fv v g fvg fv v g
focusing rather notion likelihood viewpoint seem reasonable intuitions regarding
extending likelihood worlds sets worlds seem well developed
may possible motivate finest relation extending certain properties fact motivation rather interest motivated
deep connections certain approaches nonmonotonic reasoning
said many questions consider could perfectly well explored apology discuss
except odd remark
explained two methods getting strict partial order sets
worlds partial order worlds standard method alternative
method really different easy see u v iff fug fvg iff fug fvg
true well thus agree singleton sets
extend relation worlds moreover strict partial orders

finite sets requirement u must nonempty definition u v
ensure strictly speaking added
definitions ensure strict partial orders shown
lemma fact identical underlying preorder worlds total
preorder however following example shows identical general

example suppose w fw w g w w incomparable
easy see fw w g fw g however case fw w g
fw g since element fw w g strictly likely w
notice careful define finite sets following

example illustrates

extending definition infinite sets essentially due

lewis case total preorders idea say order
u v enough every element v v element u
u likely v definition allows w w example
notice finite case easy see u v every element v
v must u u u v u dominates v
v v v u precisely domination condition
hold example observation provides motivation ocial definition
applies finite infinite domains

definition suppose partial preorder w u v w w w say
w dominates v v v case v w notice total
preorder equivalent saying w v v v write u v u
nonempty v v exists u u u v u dominates v
easy see definition agrees earlier definitions u v
finite
collect properties need definitions
say relation w necessarily preorder qualitative v v v
v v v implies v v v say satisfies union property
v v v v implies v v v say orderly u v u u
v v implies u v provide intuition properties following

argument works v v since v v v u v v dominates
