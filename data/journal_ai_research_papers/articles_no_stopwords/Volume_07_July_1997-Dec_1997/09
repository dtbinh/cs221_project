local search combinatorial search frequently encounter sequence states impossible improve value objective function
moves regions called plateau moves dominate time spent local search
analyze characterize plateaus three different classes randomly generated
boolean satisfiability identify several interesting features plateaus

appendix b random generation
appendix contains pseudo code random classes studied
first present uniform sat class parameters generator c number
clauses n number variables class procedure selects three literals
without replacement n assigns negative sign probability
procedure first presented crawford auton appears figure
procedure uniform sat c n

c

clause distinct variables selected uniformly n
negate variable clause probability
clause

end
return
end

figure random generation sketch
next present cluster sat generator parameters number
clauses c number variables n per cluster number clusters number
linking clauses l generator builds instances first creating independent subproblems c clauses n variables uniform sat generation procedure
described variables sub relabeled sub
shares variables sub sub linked generating
l linking clauses linking clause contains variables three distinct sub
kask dechter generate hardsolvable sat procedure defined
described kask dechter procedure appears figure
finally present hardsolvable sat generator parameters number
clauses c number variables n instances generated first selecting
assignment guaranteed solution clauses generated uniform sat
however clause zero two satisfied literals selected assignment
rejected instance clause b c would rejected assignment
since two satisfied literals assignment preserves uniform balance
signs variable limit resulting little information solution
present sign balances instance method discussed tsuji
van gelder given figure

final note random instance generation order none procedures
guarantees resulting instance contain variables large
number variables small number clauses used parameters resulting
may contain variables however ranges clauses variables used
work instances full range variables
