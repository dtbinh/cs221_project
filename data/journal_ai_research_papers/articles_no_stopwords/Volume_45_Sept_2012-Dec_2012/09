conclusion
given increasing prevalence importance relational data article surveyed
significant current issues relational representation transformation presenting taxonomy important transformation tasks section next
discussed four primary tasks link prediction link interpretation node prediction
node interpretation section considered tasks accomplished
simultaneously via techniques joint transformation finally section considered
perform representation evaluation key challenges future work
additional possible representation transformations space
discuss fit cleanly taxonomy figure instance bipartite
graph customers products may useful eliminate product nodes replacing
information content links among customers purchased
product somewhat related group discovery techniques section
considered depth potential transforming nodes edges


fitransforming graph data statistical relational learning

vice versa though representation choices figure relevant
technique sometimes useful pre processing step
taxonomy presented section highlighted symmetry possible
transformation tasks links nodes symmetry helped organize
survey suggests areas techniques developed one entities
used analogous task instance liben nowell kleinberg
reformulated traditional node weighting weight links likewise topic
discovery techniques lda used node labeling link labeling
finally many techniques used create node features used create link
features vice versa although node features studied much thoroughly
discussed section remains much work instance link prediction
remains difficult especially general case two arbitrary
nodes might connected together even significantly described
wide range techniques address transformation tasks end
day practitioner left wide range choices without many guarantees
might work best instance node weighting may improve classification accuracy
one dataset decrease another challenge made difficult
techniques described come wide range areas including
graph theory social network analysis numerical linear algebra e g matrix factorization
metric learning information theory information retrieval inductive logic programming
statistical relational learning probabilistic graphical breadth
techniques relevant relational transformation wonderful resource means
evaluating representation change techniques relevant particular task
time consuming technically challenging incomplete process therefore much
work needed establish theoretical understanding different representation
changes affect data different data characteristics interact process
combination techniques data characteristics affect final
analysis relational data
