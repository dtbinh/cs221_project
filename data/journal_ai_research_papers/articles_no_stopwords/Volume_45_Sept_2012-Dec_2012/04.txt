paper focuses investigating state-of-the-art Chinese-to-Spanish statistical machine
translation (Smt), nowadays one popular approaches machine
translation. purpose, report details available parallel corpus
Basic Traveller Expressions Corpus (Btec), Holy Bible United Nations (Un).
Additionally, conduct experimental work largest three corpora
explore alternative Smt strategies means using pivot language. Three alternatives
considered pivoting: cascading, pseudo-corpus triangulation. pivot language,
use either English, Arabic French. Results show that, phrase-based Smt system,
English best pivot language Chinese Spanish. propose system
output combination using pivot strategies capable outperforming direct
translation strategy. main objective work motivating involving
research community work important pair languages given demographic
impact.

2. Motivation
Although current web translation systems allow performing translations
Chinese Spanish, quality current Chinese-to-Spanish translations still well
quality achieved language pairs, English Spanish. far
know, much research translation task. main reason may
lack parallel corpora. study intends make progress involve researchers
area ChineseSpanish statistical machine translation by:
1. Listing available parallel corpora ChineseSpanish.
2. Comparing different methodologies performing statistical machine translation: cascaded (Wang et al., 2008), pseudo-corpus generation (Banchs et al., 2006; de Gispert
& Marino, 2006) triangulation (Wu & Wang, 2007).
3. Evaluating best language (among Arabic, English French) generating cascade, pseudo-corpus triangulation Mt ChineseSpanish.
4. Performing output system combination explore new ways improving Chineseto-Spanish translation.

3. Related Work
One first works dealing ChineseSpanish statistical machine translation
presented Banchs et al. (2006). Authors experimented two independent corpora

research event recently performed language pair 2008 Iwslt
evaluation campaign (Paul, 2008). evaluation organized two Chinese-to-Spanish tracks.
One focused direct translation one pivot translation

far pivot task.
best systems tracks developed Wang et al. (2008). Regarding
direct system, used standard phrase-based Smt system. makes different
participating systems provide Chinese segmentation

compared two different approaches. first one, referred triangulation, consisted
training two translation models ChineseEnglish corpus EnglishSpanish corpus,
building new translation model ChineseSpanish translation combining
two previous models proposed Wu & Wang (2007); second one obtained better
results based cascaded approach. idea translate Chinese
English English Spanish, means performing two translations.
participants proposed cascaded methodology. approximation
done n-best translations (Khalilov, Costa-Jussa, Henrquez, Fonollosa, Hernandez,
Marino, Banchs, Chen, Zhang, Aw, & Li, 2008).
Another proposal generate pseudo-corpus means translate either
English Chinese Spanish, creating parallel ChineseSpanish corpus.
pseudo-corpus used train ChineseSpanish translation (Bertoldi et al., 2008).
mentioned aboved, comparison performed Wang et al. (2008) showed
cascaded approach performed better phrase-table combination Chinese
Spanish pivot task.
Finally, previous work (Costa-jussa, Henrquez, & Banchs, 2011b) compared two
standard pivot approaches (pseudo-corpus cascaded) using English direct system. Experiments work showed quality direct system
pivot systems differ much. Additionally, cascaded system presented slightly
better results pseudo-corpus system. previous work (Costa-jussa,
Henrquez, & Banchs, 2011a), compared two pivot approaches (pseudo-corpus
cascaded) using Arabic, French English pivot languages direct system.
concluded English best pivot language.
present work, extending two previous studies by: (1) using pivot
strategies (including triangulation strategy); (2) introducing measure pre-evaluate
quality pivot approaches; (3) extending pivot combination experiments; (4)
providing evaluation.

5. Direct Pivot Statistical Machine Translation Approaches
several strategies follow translating pair languages
statistical machine translation (Smt). section present details ones
using work.
general, statistical machine translation system relies translation source
language sentence target language sentence t. Among possible target language
sentences choose one highest probability, show equation (2):

= arg max [P (t|s)]

(1)



= arg max [P (t) P (s|t)]


(2)

probability decomposition based Bayes theorem known source-channel
approach statistical machine translation (Brown, Cocke, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, Jelinek, Lafferty, Mercer, & Roossin, 1990). allows model independently target
language model P (t) source translation model P (s|t). one hand, translation model weights likely words foreign language translation words
source language; language model, hand, measures fluency hypothesis
t. search process represented arg max operation.
Later on, variation proposed Och & Ney (2002) named log-linear model.
allows using two models features weight independently

taking = 2 (two models) 1 = 2 = 1. general case, obtained
maximizing objective function held-out set (development set).
Among additional features used log-linear model lexical
models, word bonus, reordering model. lexical models particularly useful
cases translation model may sparse. example, phrases may
appeared times translation model probability may well estimated. Then,
lexical models provide probability among words (Koehn et al., 2003). word bonus
used compensate language model benefits shorter outputs. reordering
model used provide reordering phrases. not, reordering would
treated internally phrase. Finally, mentioned name log-linear
clearly misnomer many features logarithms all.
regards reordering model, standard way implementing distancebased model gives linear cost depending reordering distance. instance,
consecutive target words t1 , t2 come translating source words s1 s5 ,
sub-scripts indicate word position corresponding sentences, movement

= 2 words. visual representation phrases seen Figure 1
Besides traditional distance-based reordering mentioned before, state-of-the-art systems implement additional lexicalized reordering model (Tillman, 2004). lexicalized
reordering model classifies phrases movement make relative previous used
phrase, i.e., phrase model learns likely followed previous phrase
(monotone), swapped (swap) connected (discontinuous). instance,
considering sub-scripts word positions corresponding sentences, Figure
1 bilingual phrases (s1 t1 ) (s5 t2 ) connected, (s7 t6 ) followed
(s6 t5 ) (s2 t4 ) swapped (s3 s4 t3 ).
5.1 Direct System
direct system uses phrase-based translation approach (Koehn et al., 2003).
basic idea segment given source sentence segments one words,
source segment translated using bilingual phrase obtained training
corpus finally compose target sentence phrase translations. bilingual
phrase pair source words n target words extracted parallel sentence
belongs bilingual corpus previously aligned words. extraction, consider
words consecutive source target sides consistent
word alignment. consider phrase consistent word alignment
word inside phrase aligned one word outside phrase.
Regarding segmentation sentence K phrases, assume possible
segmentations (which considered hidden variable ) probability

P (s|t) =

Then, consider monotone translations phrase sk produced tk (Zens,

5.2 Pivot-Based Systems
cascaded approach handles sourcepivot pivottarget system independently. built tuned improve local translation quality
composed translate source language target language two steps: first,

target translation output.
pseudo-corpus approach translates pivot section sourcepivot parallel corpus target language using pivottarget system built previously. Then,
sourcetarget Smt system built using source side translated pivot side
sourcepivot corpus. pseudo-corpus system tuned using original sourcetarget
development corpus, since available.
triangulation approach combines sourcepivot (P (s|p) P (p|s)) pivot
target (P (p|t) P (t|p)) relative frequencies following strategy proposed Cohn &
Lapata (2007) order build sourcetarget translation model. translation probabilities computed assuming independence source target phrases

lexical weights computed similar manner, following strategy proposed
Cohn & Lapata (2007). approach handle lexicalized reordering
pivot strategies therefore represents limitation potential. Instead,
simple distance-based reordering applied decoding. model gives cost linear
reordering distance. instance, skipping two words costs twice much
skipping one word.
corresponding translation model obtained, sourcetarget system
tuned using original sourcetarget development corpus mentioned previous

Using 1-best translation output different pivot strategies, built n-best

2004).

Regarding fact English best pivot language task consideration, argue English might constitute better intermediate step

Iberian peninsula occupied Arabic culture 500 years, Spanish
strong influence Arabic) Chinese French Arabic. sense, English
seems represent optimal intermediate point Chinese Spanish,
translation complexity divided two phases. reordering burden resolved
Chinese-to-English phase morphology generation burden resolved

say English middle way Chinese Spanish,
passing French Arabic implies larger path kind detour proximities Spanish. conjecture, course, nicely explains

all, language pair great interest economically culturally take
