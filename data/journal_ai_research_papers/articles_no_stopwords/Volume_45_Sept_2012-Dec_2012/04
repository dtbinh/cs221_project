abstract
although chinese spanish two spoken languages world
much done machine translation language pair
focuses investigating state art chinese spanish statistical machine
translation smt nowadays one popular approaches machine
translation purpose report details available parallel corpus
basic traveller expressions corpus btec holy bible united nations un
additionally conduct experimental work largest three corpora
explore alternative smt strategies means pivot language three alternatives
considered pivoting cascading pseudo corpus triangulation pivot language
use english arabic french phrase smt system
english best pivot language chinese spanish propose system
output combination pivot strategies capable outperforming direct
translation strategy main objective work motivating involving
community work important pair languages given demographic
impact

introduction
chinese spanish distant languages many aspects however come close
together ranking spoken languages world ethnologue
web era content produced users number native
speakers excellent indicator actual relevance machine translation two
languages course factors literacy amount text published strength
commercial relationships taken account factors actually
support idea strategic importance developing machine translation
technologies chinese spanish huge increase online contents
chinese last years well steady increase commercial relationships
spanish speaking latin american countries china two basic examples
supporting fact needless say languages involve many economical interests

motivation
although current web translation systems allow performing translations
chinese spanish quality current chinese spanish translations still well
quality achieved language pairs english spanish far
know much translation task main reason may
lack parallel corpora study intends make progress involve researchers
area chinesespanish statistical machine translation
listing available parallel corpora chinesespanish
comparing different methodologies performing statistical machine translation cascaded wang et al pseudo corpus generation banchs et al de gispert

evaluating best language among arabic english french generating cascade pseudo corpus triangulation mt chinesespanish
performing output system combination explore ways improving chineseto spanish translation

related work
one first works dealing chinesespanish statistical machine translation
presented banchs et al authors experimented two independent corpora

event recently performed language pair iwslt
evaluation campaign paul evaluation organized two chinese spanish tracks
one focused direct translation one pivot translation
english best translation accordingly manual evaluation obtained
far pivot task
best systems tracks developed wang et al regarding
direct system used standard phrase smt system makes different
participating systems provide chinese segmentation
ldc linguistic data consortium bilingual dictionary regarding pivot task
compared two different approaches first one referred triangulation consisted
training two translation chineseenglish corpus englishspanish corpus
building translation model chinesespanish translation combining
two previous proposed wu wang second one obtained better
cascaded idea translate chinese
english english spanish means performing two translations
participants proposed cascaded methodology approximation
done n best translations khalilov costa jussa henrquez fonollosa hernandez
marino banchs chen zhang aw li
another proposal generate pseudo corpus means translate
english chinese spanish creating parallel chinesespanish corpus
pseudo corpus used train chinesespanish translation bertoldi et al
mentioned aboved comparison performed wang et al showed
cascaded performed better phrase table combination chinese
spanish pivot task
finally previous work costa jussa henrquez banchs b compared two
standard pivot approaches pseudo corpus cascaded english direct system experiments work showed quality direct system
pivot systems differ much additionally cascaded system presented slightly
better pseudo corpus system previous work costa jussa
henrquez banchs compared two pivot approaches pseudo corpus

regards reordering model standard way implementing distancebased model gives linear cost depending reordering distance instance
consecutive target words come translating source words
sub scripts indicate word position corresponding sentences movement

besides traditional distance reordering mentioned state art systems implement additional lexicalized reordering model tillman lexicalized
reordering model classifies phrases movement make relative previous used
phrase e phrase model learns likely followed previous phrase
monotone swapped swap connected discontinuous instance
considering sub scripts word positions corresponding sentences figure
bilingual phrases connected followed
