1. Introduction
reasoning decision making uncertainty, little doubt probabilities play leading part. Imprecise probability models provide well-founded extension
probabilistic reasoning, allow us deal incomplete probability assessments,
indecision robustness issues.1
Early imprecise probability models (going back to, amongst others, Bernoulli, 1713;
Boole, 1952, 1961; Koopman, 1940) centered lower upper probabilities events
propositions. later stages (see instance Smith, 1961; Williams, 1975b and,
clearest statement, Walley, 1991, Section 2.7), became apparent language
events lower probabilities lacking power expression, much
expressive theory built using random variables lower previsions (or lower expectations), instead.2 However, even though quite successful,
quite well developed, number problems lower prevision approach.
mathematical complexity fairly high, especially conditioning independence

2.1 Coherence Avoiding Non-positivity
Definition 1 (Avoiding non-positivity coherence). say set desirable gambles G(X ) avoids non-positivity f 6 0 gambles f posi(D),
words G(X)0 posi(D) = . called coherent satisfies following
requirements:
D1. 0
/ D;
D2. G(X )>0 D;
D3. = posi(D).
denote D(X) set coherent sets desirable gambles X.
Requirement D3 turns convex cone. Due D2, includes G(X )>0 ; due D1D3,
excludes G(X)0 , therefore avoids non-positivity:
D4. f 0 f
/ D, equivalently G(X )0 = .
set G(X )>0 coherent, smallest subset G(X ). set represents
minimal commitments part subject, sense knows nothing
likelihood different outcomes prefer zero gambles
sure never decrease wealth possibility increasing it. Hence,
usually taken model complete ignorance, called vacuous model.
One interesting feature coherent sets desirable gambles linked
field decision making incomplete preferences (Aumann, 1962; Dubra, Maccheroni,
& Ok, 2004; Shapley & Baucells, 1998), formally equivalent strict
versions partial preference orderings (Buehler, 1976; Giron & Rios, 1980). Given
coherent set desirable gambles D, define strict preference relation
gambles
f g f g gambles f g G(X ).
Indeed, due linearity utility scale, exchanging gamble g gamble f
transaction reward function f g, strictly preferring f g means
exchange strictly preferred status quo (zero). relation satisfies
following conditions:
SP1. f f f G(X )

[irreflexivity]

SP2. f > g f g f, g G(X )

[monotonicity]

SP3. f g g h f h f, g, h G(X )

[transitivity]

SP4. f g f + (1 )h g + (1 )h (0, 1] f, g, h G(X ) [mixture
independence]
Conversely, preference relation satisfying axioms determines coherent set
desirable gambles. Partial preference orderings provide foundation general decision
theory imprecise probabilities imprecise utilities (Fishburn, 1975; Seidenfeld et al.,
1995; Seidenfeld, Schervish, & Kadane, 2010). See work Moral Wilson
(1995), Walley (1991, 2000) Quaeghebeur (2012b, Section 2.4) information.

allows us clarify sets desirable gambles indeed informative coherent lower previsions, using example Moral (2005):
Example 2. Consider lower prevision P coherent sets desirable gambles Example 1. Consider event X1 = a, (upper) probability zero . conditioning event, obtain two different
updated sets: one hand,
D(X1 = a) = {g G(X 2 ) : g > 0} = G(X 2 )>0
whereas
(X1 = a) = {g G(X 2 ) : g(a) + g(b) > 0} .
means sets represent different information conditioning event
probability zero X1 = a. Indeed, apply Eq. (10) see first one induces
vacuous lower prevision P (g|X1 = a) = min{g(a), g(b)} gamble g X 2 ,
second one induces uniform linear prevision: P (g|X1 = a) = g(a)+g(b)
.

lower previsions P N P (|xI ) satisfy condition called Generalised
Bayes Rule (this follows Williams, 1975b Miranda & Zaffalon, 2010, Thm. 8):
P N (I{xI } [g P (g|xI )]) = 0.

Proof. (i). every x1 X 1 M2 = (M1 M2 )x1 D{1,2} x1 ,
equality follows Proposition 18. Since M2 maximal, implies M2 =
D{1,2} x1 x1 X 1 , similar argument shows M1 = D{1,2} x2
x2 X 2 . hand, follows Proposition 17 M2 = marg2 (M1 M2 )
marg2 (D{1,2} ). Since M2 maximal, implies M2 = marg2 (D{1,2} ), similar
argument shows M1 = marg1 (D{1,2} ). summary, see marg1 (D{1,2} ) =
D{1,2} x2 x2 X 2 , marg2 (D{1,2} ) = D{1,2} x1 x1 X 1 , showing
D{1,2} indeed independent.

case M{1,2} x1 M{1,2} x2 M{1,2} , sets M{1,2} x1 M{1,2} x2
maximal, Proposition 22. hand, Proposition 17 implies
marg1 (M{1,2} x1 M{1,2} x2 ) = M{1,2} x1 marg1 (M{1,2} ),
sets equal. Similarly, deduce
marg2 (M{1,2} x1 M{1,2} x2 ) = M{1,2} x2 marg2 (M{1,2} ),
therefore marg1 (M{1,2} ) marg2 (M{1,2} ) M{1,2} . Invoking first part
proposition, find M{1,2} independent product marginals.
first part proposition provides us simple characterisation
independent products two maximal sets: simply coherent supersets

independent natural extension independent product, two maximal sets
always maximal products (although differ independent natural

consequence set independent product.

Conversely, consider real number f nN Dn . Consider arbitrary

Eq. (3). set coherent Walley (1991, Thm. 3.8.1). Consider set Dn Dn ,
let us show coherent. Condition D2 holds trivially satisfied Dn .
see D3 holds, taking account Dn Dn coherent sets gambles,
particular cones, suffices show gamble f Dn g Dn ,
sum f + g belongs Dn Dn . Consider thus gambles f, g. f G(X n )>0 ,
belongs Dn consequence f + g Dn ; hand, f Dn \ G(X n )>0 ,
follows Pn (f ) > 0, whence Pn (f + g) = Pn (f ) + Pn (g) Pn (f ) + P n (g) > 0,
therefore f + g Dn . Since Dn Dn coherent, deduce
condition D1 holds, consequence set Dn Dn indeed coherent.
Now, Theorem 5 implies maximal coherent set desirable gambles

therefore nN Pn (f ) , using argumentation above. Hence N (f ) , therefore

Together Theorem 21 fact strong product lower previsions may
strictly dominate independent natural extension (see Example 9.3.4 Walley, 1991),
shows strong product marginal sets desirable gambles may strictly
include independent natural extension. explicit example given Appendix A.3.
