judgment aggregation procedures
next define three concrete types aggregation procedures
uniform quota rules majority rule
aggregation procedure f n n individuals quota rule every formula
exists quota q n f j nj q
class quota rules studied depth dietrich list
interested particular class quota rules
definition given n agenda uniform quota rule
quota aggregation procedure fm fm j nj
aggregation procedure satisfies mi n uniform quota

slightly narrow definition quota rule provided n uniform quota rule
fm satisfies u
quota rule special interest majority rule majority rule uniform
quota rule n
accepts formula whenever individuals accepting
rejecting recall assume n odd clearly majority
rule uniform quota rule satisfies wr
premise procedure
seen introduction majority rule may fail produce consistent
outcome two basic aggregation procedures set way avoid
discussed ja literature beginning namely
premise conclusion procedure kornhauser sager dietrich
mongin basic idea divide agenda premises conclusions
premise procedure apply majority rule premises
infer conclusions accept given collective judgments regarding premises
conclusion procedure directly ask agents judgments
conclusions leave premises unspecified collective judgment set
conclusion procedure complete outcomes indeed strictly speaking
conform definition shall consider premise
procedure hand set way guarantees consistent complete
outcomes provides usable procedure practical interest
many ja may natural divide agenda premises
conclusions let p c agenda divided set premises p set
conclusions c closed complementation

commonly understood premise procedure dietrich mongin
call rule premise majority voting investigated general class premise
procedures procedure used decide upon premises need majority rule

pbp j c

set premises accepted strict majority pbp return
set together conclusions logically follow
want ensure pbp returns judgment sets consistent
complete impose certain restrictions
want guarantee consistency impose restrictions
premises well known majority rule guaranteed consistent
agenda satisfies called median property e every inconsistent subset inconsistent subset size nehring puppe
list puppe immediately transfers pbp consistent
set premises satisfies median property
want guarantee completeness impose restrictions
conclusions assignment truth values premises truth value
conclusion fully determined
shall see section deciding whether set formulas satisfies median

distance procedure
basic idea distance aggregation select outcome

preference aggregation kemeny belief merging konieczny pino perez
first example ja procedure notion distance introduced
pigozzi albeit restrictive assumption agenda closed
propositional variables compound formula unanimously accepted
unanimously rejected agents importantly pigozzis syntactic
information contained agenda discarded moving aggregation
level formulas level syntactic variant procedure later

collective judgment set dbp minimises amount disagreement

resolute procedure profiles combine dbp tie breaking rule

dbp complete consistent design judgment sets j considered candidates searching solution however violates standard

h n consequence wr direction immediate acceptance
formula f depends number agents accepting f must
anonymous neutral independent condition h h n furthermore ensures
completeness complement freeness
dropping neutrality independence obtain following representation
proposition f f wr exists function h n
every formula satisfying h h n n

proof clear characterisation procedures satisfying terms
winning coalitions given procedure decide whether
collectively accepted looking cardinality coalition accepting
rest proof proceeds proposition

proof drop winning coalitions anymore associated formulas
