action formalisms. well known frame problem introduced McCarthy
Hayes (1969). Moreover, still problem axiomatising effects action,
called effect axioms. logical axiomatisation requires conditions
effects take place executing action precisely specified. However,
potentially infinitely many conditions, reasoner may never
thought about. realistic formalisation would ever able exhaustively enumerate
conditions. Nonetheless, start car, people worry whether

story long well-known within community commonsense reasoning,
particular reasoning action. known qualification problem
introduced McCarthy (1977).
number solutions frame problem (e.g., Shanahan, 1997;
Reiter, 1991; Castilho, Gasquet, & Herzig, 1999), qualification problem largely
ignored notable exception Thielschers (2001) solution within Fluent Calculus Doherty Kvarnstroms (1998) circumscription-based solution using fluent
dependency constraints. people argue frame problem already challenging would good approach thoroughly solve frame problem
complicating formalism qualification problem. argue danger
approaching problems point view (at least) two reasons:
1. may hard come uniform solution problems: many
existing solutions frame problem monotonic (e.g., Reiter, 1991; Castilho
et al., 1999), qualification problem inherently requires non-monotonic solution.
case original qualification problem stated McCarthy (1977)
dynamics actions/events need finitely axiomatisable
unexpected qualification action arises, agent must necessarily retract
initial expectation effects caused action would take place, making
underlying reasoning machinery non-monotonic (see section 1.2 discussion
qualification problem).
2. Many solutions frame problem succeed precise assumptions.
instance,
Actions always succeed. action omniscience assumption. precisely, assumption dictates qualification problem skipped.
case monotonic solutions frame problem. 2
Fluents change reasoner knows exists action
possibly changes value. termed domain omniscience
2. argument solution frame problem works nondeterministic action
subject assumption stand. quick fix allowing approach fortiori express
actions may fail representing failure possible effect invalid one.
longer infer that, absence evidences suggest otherwise, actions would normally succeed.

1.1 Frame Problem
late 1960s, frame problem recognised major obstacle formalising
dynamic domains (see discussions exposition McCarthy & Hayes, 1969; Green,
1969). Several alternative responses frame problem proposed along way.
respond explosive number axioms required theorem proving-based planners
proposed Green (1969), Fikes Nilsson (1971) introduce procedures operate
special data structures used represent dynamic domains. However, complex
sophisticated problem domains, e.g. domain constraints, concurrent actions,
observations different time points, etc. STRIPS quite often fails express domain
knowledge. fact, expressivity STRIPS quite limited pointed

Later, introduction qualification problem McCarthy (1977),

least two different kinds state constraints call ramification qualification constraints. go claim solution qualification (and
ramification) problem. basic idea behind solution qualification

Thus action may qualified even though appears (from explicit action

impossible, axiomatise possible preconditions action. example,
addition requirement gun loaded, guarantee performing
action shoot would kill victim, many preconditions must included as:
gun malfunctioning, shooter miss victim, victim
wear bullet-proof jacket, etc. among may improbable
as: alien interferes bullet. reasoner simply want consider conditions assuming case unless explicit
evidences stating otherwise. words, qualification problem original

always refer qualification problem original form. similarity
frame problem led John McCarthy conjecture that:
frame problem may sub-case call qualification

frame problem also.
(McCarthy, 1977, p. 1040, italics original.)
Roughly 10 years introduction qualification problem, McCarthy (1986)
presented solution problem using non-monotonic formalism circumscription. However, solution suffers almost identical flaw counterpart
regarding frame problem: simple minimisation abnormalities sanctions anomalous models (e.g., Thielscher, 2001).
2. McCain Turner (1995) propose solution problem described Lin
Reiter (1994), viz. problem deriving implicit preconditions state
constraints. McCain Turners solution posed model-based representation
action theories.

end troubles though. presence qualification
ramification constraints causes several complications. Firstly, syntactically distinguishable. Secondly, mentioned Doherty Kvarnstrom

ramification constraints may reveal implicit action preconditions.
Remark: terms ramification constraints qualification constraints first
introduced Lin Reiter (1994) careful examination state constraints

extremely hard understand error-prone. Recall failure non-monotonic

Thielschers formalisation, circumscription still required generate initial theories default theories (in addition set default rules). Nevertheless,
Thielschers solution still suffers following drawbacks: (i) Thielschers use
predicate P oss way formulated Doherty Kvarnstrom

rather different effects actions; (ii) Thielscher shows
problem anomalous models sustained McCarthys (1986) circumscription

1.3 Ramification Problem

indicate exceptions frame assumptions require special treatment.
several formalisms dealing ramification problem, e.g., see (Lin, 1995; McCain
& Turner, 1995; Thielscher, 1997), still several issues need careful
consideration. consider three examples motivate discussion.
Example 1 Consider Thielschers (1997) circuit:

Thus, sw1 sw3 closed, sw2 closed prevented

Thielscher (1997) proposes way remedy problem keeping track applications domain constraints re-expressed terms causal relationships.
Thus, given example, formalism able arrive next state

5. Reasoning Action: Frame Qualification Problems
general, adopt following guidelines seeking uniform solution problems
reasoning action:
derived pieces information conflict given facts;
Occurrences events minimised;
inertia fluents maximised though minimality event occurrences

Aside trivial case occurrences actions causing frame assumptions
rejected, two aspects actions distinguished:
1. action happens change supposed cause take place.
call expectation failure less qualification problem;
2. actions known happened caused change change

problem.
following assumption represents underlying intuition behind reasoning
action formalisms.
Assumption 1 Intuitive models contain minimal (with respect set inclusion) sets
surprises.
introduce model-theoretic counterpart notions assumption-based
notions presented above.

Thus, coherent model: (i) satisfiable basic actions must follow given

set qualification assumptions satisfiable I, denoted IAQ , :
IAQ = {[t1 , t2 ]AQl | (t1 , AQl , t2 ) AQI }
write IQF = IAQ .
Conversely, given theory set assumptions , reasoner construct
models domain interest.
Definition 5.4 Let = hLD , R, AB, domain description AB. model

normal disqualifications (i.e. underlined cause) anomalous disqualifications. Thus, facing collection Q-plausible sets assumptions, reasoner simply
selects set assumptions contains smallest (with respect set inclusion) set
leniently rejected qualification assumptions.
ability introduce different argumentation-theoretic semantics assumptionbased frameworks arguably biggest advantage approach. following example
illustrates critical point:

Given formalisation problem, traditional accounts non-monotonic
reasoning (i.e. Default Logic, circumscription, Autoepistemic Logic, etc.) provide
one solution since formalisms produce extension standard semantics. However, argumentation-theoretic approach gives several semantics problem including preferability semantics. Note, however, admissible
sets assumptions preferred sets assumptions domain contain none
assumptions: [0, 1]AQEvStolen , [0, 1]AQAtHome , [0, 1]AQAlive . essentially means
that, admissibility preferability semantics, reasoner could infer
none actions would succeed hand, proposed plausible
semantics gives alternative solution problem consistent set assumptions contain one following three assumptions: [0, 1]AQ EvStolen ,
[0, 1]AQAtHome , [0, 1]AQAlive . Moreover, plausible set assumptions must contain exactly one them. Among two assumptions belong
plausible set assumptions, one attacked leniently rejected.
believe examples underlined major advantages approach reasoner aware (defeasible) assumptions used reasoning
well able explicitly reason assumptions. flexibility allowing
reasoner introduce different argumentation-theoretic semantics assumption-based
framework simply varying notion acceptability sets assumptions certainly
another advantage favour approach.

6. Complex Dynamic Domains Indirect Effects
far havent taken consideration issues concurrent actions indirect
effects. ensure formalisation introduced expressive enough deal
complex domains, show issues coped approach. Firstly,
motivate formalisation informal discussion.
6.1 Concurrent Non-Deterministic Events
Given temporal representation, formulating concurrent events difficult issue
framework. However, subtleties need carefully considered.
Firstly, use assumptions. presented earlier paper, qualification assumptions
fluent oriented, i.e. qualify effects action rather action itself.
Whilst manifests capability formulating actions multiple effects, thus
effect qualified independently, may fail formalise concurrent events
effects. example, actions hit vase hammer shoot
loaded gun bring effect vase broken. words,
essential qualification assumptions dependent actions bring
effect consideration. Thus, given n actions fluents whose values
changed actions, potentially introduce 2 n qualifications
assumptions.14 Therefore, instead subscripting assumption symbols AQ
fluent literals F , extend set subscripts AQ, denoted AF, contain
14. fact, see later, potentially 2 (n + 1) qualification assumptions case
since one special event corresponding (natural) events bring indirect effects.

496

fiReasoning Action: Argumentation-Theoretic Approach

action corresponding fluent literals. 15 example, given two
actions hit shoot additional action repair whose effect change broken vase
non-broken, viz. broken, need introduce following qualification
assumptions: AQHit-Broken , AQShoot-Broken AQRepair-Broken . Therefore, syntactically
extend set AB AQ = {[, ]AQ | , E AF} semantically
function q : AQAF {true, false}. definition interpretation
= hh, , , q , f i, I([, ]AQ , t) = q (( ), AQ , ()), , E
AF.
Though increase complexity framework, price
pay expressiveness resulting system. best knowledge, none
existing formalisms possesses expressiveness.
non-deterministic actions? solution turns quite simple:
treat action non-determinism special kind action qualification. example, formulate Russian shooting scenario (Sandewall, 1994) gun non-deterministically
gets loaded spinning revolver, following action descriptions asserted:
[, ]spin, [, ]AQSpin-Loaded
[, ]spin, [, ]AQSpin-Loaded
adr1 =
adr2 =
[]loaded [ ]F Aloaded
[]loaded [ ]F Aloaded
together following two qualification rules:
qr1 =

[]loaded
[]loaded
qr2 =
.
[, ]AQSpin-Loaded
[, ]AQSpin-Loaded

guarantee either []loaded []loaded follow [, ]spin (remark set qualification assumptions AQ maximised), both.
consequence, two possible extensions arise given non-deterministic action.
Dealing non-determinism could complicated information used
encode action description disjunctive. restrict conclusion action
description rule contain fluent literals, disjunctive effect straightforwardly
dealt framework. However, note restriction similar imposed
action language (Gelfond & Lifschitz, 1998). extension action descriptions
similar way action language extended action language
C done allow complex expression conclusion action description rule.
However, sake presentation, choose use simpler language introduce
