representation hence need solve logic reasoning
action formalisms well known frame introduced mccarthy
hayes moreover still axiomatising effects action
called effect axioms logical axiomatisation requires conditions
effects take place executing action precisely specified however
potentially infinitely many conditions reasoner may never
thought realistic formalisation would ever able exhaustively enumerate
conditions nonetheless start car people worry whether
key car never bother checking whether something blocking
tailpipe checking electric circuits make sure well connected
story long well known within community commonsense reasoning
particular reasoning action known qualification
introduced mccarthy
number solutions frame e g shanahan
reiter castilho gasquet herzig qualification largely
ignored notable exception thielschers solution within fluent calculus doherty kvarnstroms circumscription solution fluent
dependency constraints people argue frame already challenging would good thoroughly solve frame
complicating formalism qualification argue danger
approaching point view least two reasons
may hard come uniform solution many
existing solutions frame monotonic e g reiter castilho
et al qualification inherently requires non monotonic solution
case original qualification stated mccarthy
dynamics actions events need finitely axiomatisable
unexpected qualification action arises agent must necessarily retract
initial expectation effects caused action would take place making
underlying reasoning machinery non monotonic see section discussion
qualification
many solutions frame succeed precise assumptions
instance
actions succeed action omniscience assumption precisely assumption dictates qualification skipped
case monotonic solutions frame
fluents change reasoner knows exists action
possibly changes value termed domain omniscience
argument solution frame works nondeterministic action
subject assumption stand quick fix allowing fortiori express
actions may fail representing failure possible effect invalid one
longer infer absence evidences suggest otherwise actions would normally succeed
worth noting lins extension reiters solution frame
situation calculus deal nondeterministic action circumscription

fivo foo

counterintuitive supposition victim shooting somehow still alive
shooting anomalous extension come following way first
allows default saying victim persists alive regarding shooting
action applicable consequence gun must loaded
shooting action therefore blocks application default saying
gun persists loaded regarding waiting action words loaded
gun would get unloaded magically waiting action undesirable conclusion block lines backward reasoning turner appeals
non contrapositivity inference rules replaces implications inference rules
guarantee formulation work correctly additional techniques required
fact formulated inference rule

false
enforcing completeness initial situation adding following rules
holds f
holds f

holds f

every fluent f
however turners formulation still fairly ad hoc different techniques
added fix known issues example inference rules used place
implications block application undesirable backward reasoning
rules completing initial situations added overcome unsoundness issue
morris formulation etc shows problematic side default logic
uniform formalisation common sense reasoning becomes
serious issue one proceeds question qualification
typical default reasoning solved turners formalisation
dynamic domains case example instead asserting
victim dies whenever shot loaded gun reasoner maintain
default proposition may many hidden possible conditions
victim may die thus reasoner able deal surprising situations
victim observed still alive shooting action loaded
gun another symmetric case surprises regarding persistence fluents
instance waiting action supposed unload gun gun
loaded wait action observed unloaded scenario
first introduced kautz scenario called stolen car
cases reasoning backward time necessary clear

doherty kvarnstrom make careful investigation qualification aware shortcomings present definition qualification
introduced lin reiter proceed one step distinguish weak strong forms qualification deal
comprehensively qualification full extent doherty kvarnstrom apply circumscription predicate plays similar role predicate
p oss used lin reiter
even though doherty kvarnstroms solution closest spirit
original form qualification still serious
intended designation predicate p oss variants actionoriented would qualify executability condition action
consideration towards effects action supposed cause
words circumscribing p oss guarantee capture full extent
qualification example single action shooting gun may cause
several effects killing victim making loud noise emptying cartridge etc
conditions action executable gun gun
broken gun loadable etc action executable necessary
effects take place may case loud noise
cartridge emptied victim still alive since victim wearing bulletproof jacket assuming reasoner somehow aware possibility
include requirement victim wear bullet proof jacket
qualification action shoot perhaps would still expect
hear loud noise cartridge emptied shoot action
end troubles though presence qualification
ramification constraints causes several complications firstly syntactically distinguishable secondly mentioned doherty kvarnstrom
qualification constraints may cause indirect effects arise vice versa e
ramification constraints may reveal implicit action preconditions
remark terms ramification constraints qualification constraints first
introduced lin reiter careful examination state constraints
taken discussed doherty kvarnstrom two kinds constraints might interact several ways consider example introduced doherty
kvarnstrom preconditions action board plane havingticket gate however passenger places gun pocket home
travelling airport proceeding gate qualification
action board materialises one ramification putting object
pocket stay travel location location e
ramification constraint reasoner could easily conjecture passenger fails
board plane hand fact passenger possesses gun
trying board plane must fail board plane qualification
constraint fact passenger possesses gun disqualifies
action boarding plane brings indirect effect action
boarding plane executed passenger put arrest note
indirect effect take place requirements must present action

recently thielscher gives exposition qualification
thielscher discusses sustained mccarthys simplistic circumscription policy viz anomalous introduces default logic
formalisation qualification fluent calculus shows
formalisation suffer anomalous note
thielschers formalisation circumscription still required generate initial theories default theories addition set default rules nevertheless
thielschers solution still suffers following drawbacks thielschers use

thus qualifications taken executability conditions actions

formalisation circumscription default logic suffer

ramification
context reasoning action ramification mainly related
indirect effects finding solution may easy indirect effects
indicate exceptions frame assumptions require special treatment
several formalisms dealing ramification e g see lin mccain

figure thielschers circuit

indirect effects
thielscher proposes way remedy keeping track applications domain constraints expressed terms causal relationships
thus given example formalism able arrive next state
detect following chains causal relationships dynamic system undergoes
several intermediate states arriving next state

proceed one step thielschers position formally
representing intermediate states possible states world believe
intelligent agent able reason intermediate states even though
may satisfy domain constraints capability especially important
reasoner needs explain certain observations world systematic way
note given observation may several chains causal relationships
bring observation unless intermediate states explicitly represented
reasoned way agent full insight system hand
certain information would missing
example consider lins spring loaded suitcase two latches lets assume
latches toggled suitcase closed following state constraint
supposed apply domain latch latch open suitcase
question robot close suitcase back opening mccain
turner consider answer
detect glimpse light relay sensitive enough make switch sw jump quickly
enough detect otherwise stay
note point view corresponds traditional definition states snapshots

general latches impossible perform action
closing suitcase one must concurrently toggle least one

mccain turner p italic original

complex dynamic domains indirect effects
far havent taken consideration issues concurrent actions indirect
effects ensure formalisation introduced expressive enough deal
complex domains issues coped firstly
motivate formalisation informal discussion
concurrent non deterministic events
given temporal representation formulating concurrent events difficult issue
framework however subtleties need carefully considered
firstly use assumptions presented earlier qualification assumptions
fluent oriented e qualify effects action rather action
whilst manifests capability formulating actions multiple effects thus
effect qualified independently may fail formalise concurrent events
effects example actions hit vase hammer shoot
loaded gun bring effect vase broken words
essential qualification assumptions dependent actions bring
effect consideration thus given n actions fluents whose values
changed actions potentially introduce n qualifications
assumptions therefore instead subscripting assumption symbols aq
fluent literals f extend set subscripts aq denoted af contain
fact see later potentially n qualification assumptions case
since one special event corresponding natural events bring indirect effects



fireasoning action argumentation theoretic

actions hit shoot additional action repair whose effect change broken vase
