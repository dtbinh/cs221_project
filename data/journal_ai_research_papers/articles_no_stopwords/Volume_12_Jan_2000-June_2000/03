large number potential strategy choices state dialogue
example consider one choice faced elvis email voice interactive system
spoken dialogue system supports access user email phone elvis provides
verbal summaries user email folders many ways summarize folder
sparck jones summary could consist simple statement
number messages different folders e g messages could provide
much detail messages particular folder e g messages
kim one message meeting second interviewing antonio
elvis must decide many properties message mention message
status sender subject message
decision theoretic applied choosing among dialogue
strategies associating utility u strategy action choice positing
spoken dialogue systems adhere maximum expected utility principle
keeney raiffa russell norvig

maximum expected utility principle optimal action one maximizes expected utility outcome states

thus elvis act optimally choosing strategy state si maximizes u si
formulation however simply leaves us derive utility
values u si dialogue state si several reinforcement learning
dynamic programming specify way calculate u si terms utility successor
state sj bellman watkins sutton barto bradtke singh
utility final state dialogue known would possible calculate
utilities earlier states thus determine policy selects optimal
dialogue strategies
previous work suggested possible treat dialogue strategy selection
stochastic optimization way walker biermann long levin
pieraccini eckert mellish knott oberlander donnell however
walker argued lack performance function assigning utility
final state dialogue critical methodological limitation seemed
three main possibilities simple reward function user satisfaction task completion
measure user effort elapsed time dialogue number
user turns appeared simple reward functions fail
capture essential aspects system performance example level user
effort complete dialogue task system domain task dependent moreover high
levels effort e g requirement users confirm system understanding
utterance necessarily lead concomitant increases task completion
strategies implemented elvis summarized figure note due practical
constraints implemented strategy choices subset states elvis uses fixed
strategy states section describe detail strategy choices elvis explores
addition choices summarization namely choices among strategies controlling dialogue
initiative reading multiple messages

discussion future work

proposes novel method dialogue system learn choose
optimal dialogue strategy tests experiments elvis dialogue system
supports access email phone strategies initiative reading summarizing messages reported experiments elvis learned system initiative

read strategy summarize system generally best summary strategy
tested policy elvis learned set users performing set
tasks showed learned policy resulted statistically significant increase
user satisfaction test set dialogues
previous work treated system choice dialogue strategy stochastic
optimization walker biermann long levin pieraccini
levin et al knowledge walker first proposed reinforcement
learning could applied dialogue strategy selection simulation experiments reported walker dialogues two agents artificial world
used test dialogue strategies optimal conditions
experiments varied dialogue agent resource bounds performance function used assess agent performance experiments showed strategies
optimal one set assumptions performance function could
highly ecacious performance function ected fact dialogue agent
resource bounded walker suggested optimal dialogue strategy could
obviously choice strategy test risked testing non optimal policy alternative
would try future work utilize summstrat state variable operations vector
state representation reinforcement learning simply distinguish states summarize
strategy selected summary produced states least one summary
produced analysis dialogue phase carries policy
learned use summarize strategy first summary dialogue afterwards
use summarize system strategy
