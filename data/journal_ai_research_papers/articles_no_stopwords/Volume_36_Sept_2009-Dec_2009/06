dowty describe relations hold predicate arguments
abstracting surface syntactic configurations example consider sentences

intermediate representation seems promising first step towards text understanding
ultimately benefit many natural language processing tasks require broad coverage semantic processing
methods automatic identification labeling semantic roles often referred
shallow semantic parsing gildea jurafsky important prerequisite
widespread use semantic role information large scale applications development

data training shallow semantic parser l independent parallel corpus
annotation projection paradigm faces least two challenges considering semantic roles firstly semantic structure projected must shared two
sentences clearly role semantic analysis source sentence e inappropriate
target sentence l simple projection produce valid semantic role annotations
secondly even two sentences demonstrate semantic parallelism semantic role annotations
pertain potentially arbitrarily long word spans rather individual words recovering word span semantic roles target language challenging given
automatic alignment methods often produce noisy incomplete alignments
address first challenge showing two languages exhibit substantial
degree semantic correspondence annotation projection feasible englishgerman parallel corpus test bed assess whether english semantic role annotations

ficross lingual annotation projection semantic roles

extensions improvements framework presented many varied
firstly believe developed article useful semantic
role paradigms besides framenet indeed types semantic annotation potential applications include projection propbank roles discourse structure
named entities mentioned earlier relevant machine translation
could used reordering constituents indicate syntactic
knowledge target side plays important role projecting annotations longer
spans unfortunately many languages broad coverage parsers available
however may necessary obtain complete parses semantic role projection
task two types syntactic information especially valuable bracketing information guides projection towards linguistically plausible role spans knowledge
arguments sentence predicates bracketing information acquired
unsupervised fashion geertzen argument structure information could obtained
dependency parsers e g mcdonald partial parsers able identify
predicate argument relations e g hacioglu another interesting direction concerns
combination longer phrases provided phrase smt systems
constituent information obtained output parser chunker
experiments presented article made use simple semantic similarity
measure word alignment sophisticated could combined
alignment scores information provided bilingual dictionary inspired crosslingual information retrieval widdows dorow chan propose bilingual vector
model underlying assumption words similar co occurrences
parallel corpus semantically similar source target words represented
n dimensional vectors whose components correspond frequent content words
source language framework similarity source target word pair
computed geometric measure cosine euclidean distance recent
polylingual topic mimno wallach naradowsky smith mccallum offer
probabilistic interpretation similar idea
article limited parallel sentences frame preserved allows us transfer roles directly source onto target language
without acquire knowledge possible translational divergences first generalization framework presented could adopt strategy form
