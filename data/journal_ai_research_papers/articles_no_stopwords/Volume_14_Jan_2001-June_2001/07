2. Conditional Plausibility

2.1 Unconditional Plausibility Measures

getting conditional plausibility measures, perhaps best consider unconditional plausibility measures. basic idea behind plausibility measures straightforward.
probability measure maps subsets set W [0; 1]. domain may consist
subsets W ; however, required algebra. (Recall algebra F
W set subsets W containing W closed union complementation,
U; V 2 F , U [ V U .) plausibility measure general;
maps elements algebra F arbitrary partially ordered set. Pl plausibility
measure, read Pl(U ) \the plausibility set U ". Pl(U ) Pl(V ), V
least plausible U . ordering partial, could plausibility
two different sets incomparable. agent may prepared say two sets
one likely another equal likelihood.
Formally, plausibility space tuple = (W; F ; Pl), W set worlds, F
algebra W , Pl maps sets F set plausibility values partially
ordered relation (so exive, transitive, anti-symmetric)
contains two special elements >D ?D ?D >D 2 D;
intended analogues 1 0 probability. usual, ordering defined

?D whenever clear context.
three requirements plausibility measures. first two obvious analogues requirements hold notions uncertainty: whole space gets
maximum plausibility empty set gets minimum plausibility. third
requirement says set must least plausible subsets.
Pl1. Pl(;) = ?D .
Pl2. Pl(W ) = >D .
Pl3. U U 0 , Pl(U ) Pl(U 0 ).
(In Pl3, implicitly assuming U; U 0 2 F . Similar assumptions made throughout.)
standard representations uncertainty literature represented
plausibility measures. brie describe representations uncertainty
relevance paper.
Sets probabilities: One common way representing uncertainty set probability measures. set often assumed convex (see, example, (Campos & Moral,
1995; Cousa, Moral, & Walley, 1999; Gilboa & Schmeidler, 1993; Levi, 1985; Walley, 1991)
discussion references), however, convex sets seem appropriate representing independence assumptions, make restriction here. example,
coin unknown probability heads tossed twice, tosses known
independent, seems reasonable representation given set P0 consisting
measures , (hh) = ff2 ; (ht) = (th) = ff(1 , ff); (tt) = (1 , ff)2 .
Unfortunately, P0 convex. Moreover, convex hull includes many measures
coin tosses independent. argued (Cousa et al., 1999) set
probability measures behaviorally equivalent convex hull. However, even
accept argument, follow set convex hull equivalent insofar
determination independencies goes.
number ways viewing set P probability measures plausibility
measure. One uses lower probability P , defined P (U ) = inf f(U ) : 2 Pg. Clearly
P satisfies Pl1{3. corresponding upper probability P , defined P (U ) = supf : 2
Pg = 1 , P (U ), clearly plausibility measure.
P P give way comparing likelihood two subsets U V W .
two ways incomparable; easy find set P probability measures W
subsets U V W P (U ) < P (V ) P (U ) > P (V ). Rather
choosing P P , associate different plausibility measure P
captures both. Let DP ;P = f(a; b) : 0 b 1g define (a; b) (a0 ; b0 ) iff b a0 .
puts partial order DP ;P ; clearly ?DP P = (0; 0) >DP P = (1; 1). Define
PlP ;P (U ) = (P (U ); P (U )). Thus, PlP ;P associates set U two numbers
thought defining interval terms lower upper probability U .
easy check PlP ;P (U ) PlP ;P (V ) upper probability U less
equal lower probability V . PlP ;P satisfies Pl1{3, indeed plausibility
measure, one puts partial order events.

trouble P , P , even PlP ;P lose information. example,
hard find set P probability measures subsets U; V W
(U ) (V ) 2 P (U ) < (V ) 2 P , P (U ) = P (V )
P (U ) = P (V ). Indeed, exists infinite set P probability measures
(U ) < (V ) 2 P P (U ) = P (V ) P (U ) = P (V ). probability
measures P agree U less likely V , seems reasonable conclude U
less likely V . However, none P , P , PlP ;P necessarily draw conclusion.
Fortunately, hard associate yet another plausibility measure P
lose important information. technical convenience become clear
later, assume index set P = : 2 g. Thus, example,
P = f1 ; : : : ; n g, = f1; : : : ; ng. Let DI = [0; 1]I , is, functions
[0; 1], pointwise ordering, f g iff f (i) g(i) 2 .1 easy
check ?D function f : ! [0; 1] f (i) = 0 2 >D
function g g(i) = 1 2 . U W , let fU function
fU (i) = (U ) 2 . example, set P0 measures representing two
coin tosses (which indexed IR), set W taken fhh; ht; tt; thg. Then,
example, ffhhg (ff) = (hh) = ff2 ffht;ttg (ff) = 1 , ff.
easy see f; = ?D fW = >D . define PlP (U ) = fU . Thus,
PlP (U ) PlP (V ) iff fU (i) fV (i) 2 iff (U ) (V ) 2 P . Clearly PlP
satisfies Pl1{3. Pl1 Pl2 follow since PlP (;) = f; = ?D PlP (W ) = fW = >D ,
Pl3 follows since U V (U ) (V ) 2 P . PlP captures
information P (unlike, say, P , washes much away taking infs).
way associating plausibility measure set P probability measures
generalizes: provides way associating single plausibility measure set
plausibility measures; leave straightforward details reader.
Possibility measures: fuzzy measure (or Sugeno measure ) f W (Wang & Klir,
1992) function f : 2W 7! [0; 1], satisfies Pl1{3. (That is, less general
plausibility measure requires range [0; 1] rather arbitrary
partially ordered set.) possibility measure Poss W special case Sugeno measure;
function mapping subsets W [0; 1] Poss(W ) = 1, Poss(;) = 0,
Poss(U ) = supw2U (Poss(fwg)), Poss(U [ V ) = max(Poss(U ); Poss(V )) (Dubois &
Prade, 1990). Clearly possibility measure plausibility measure.
Ranking functions: ordinal ranking (or -ranking ranking function ) W (as
defined (Goldszmidt & Pearl, 1992), based ideas go back (Spohn, 1988))
function mapping subsets W = [ f1g (W ) = 0, (;) =

2.2 Conditional Plausibility Measures

Since Bayesian networks make heavy use conditioning, interest
plausibility measures, conditional plausibility measures (cpm's). Given set W
worlds, cpm maps pairs subsets W partially ordered set D. write Pl(U jV )
rather Pl(U; V ), keeping standard notation conditioning. case
probability measure , standard take (U jV ) undefined (V ) = 0.
general, must make precise allowable second arguments are. Thus, take
domain cpm form F F 0 where, intuitively, F 0 consists sets
F makes sense condition. example, conditional probability
measure defined usual way unconditional probability measure , F 0 consists
sets V (V ) > 0. (Note F 0 algebra|it closed
complementation.) Popper algebra W set F F 0 subsets W W satisfying
following properties:
Acc1. F algebra W .
Acc2. F 0 nonempty subset F .
Acc3. F 0 closed supersets F ; is, V 2 F 0 , V V 0 , V 0 2 F ,
V 0 2 F 0.
(Popper algebras named Karl Popper, first consider formally
conditional probability basic notion (Popper, 1968). De Finetti (1936)
early work, apparently independently, taking conditional probabilities primitive. Indeed,
Renyi (1964) points out, idea seems go back far Keynes (1921).)
conditional plausibility space (cps ) tuple (W; F ; F 0 ; Pl), F F 0 Popper
algebra W , Pl : F F 0 ! D, partially ordered set plausibility values, Pl
conditional plausibility measure (cpm) satisfies following conditions:
CPl1. Pl(;jV ) = ?D .
CPl2. Pl(W jV ) = >D .
CPl3. U U 0 , Pl(U jV ) Pl(U 0 jV ).
CPl4 Pl(U jV ) = Pl(U \ V jV ).
CPl1{3 obvious analogues Pl1{3. CPl4 minimal property guarantees
conditioning V , everything relativized V . follows easily CPl1{4
Pl(jV ) plausibility measure V fixed V . cps acceptable satisfies
Acc4. V 2 F 0 , U 2 F , Pl(U jV ) 6= ?D , U \ V 2 F 0 .

CPl1{4 rather minimal requirements. example, place constraints
relationship Pl(U jV ) Pl(U jV 0 ) V 6= V 0 . One natural additional
condition following.
CPl5. V \ V 0 2 F 0 U; U 0 2 F , Pl(U jV \ V 0 ) Pl(U 0 jV \ V 0 ) iff Pl(U \ V jV 0 )
Pl(U 0 \ V jV 0 ).
hard show CPl5 implies CPl4.
Lemma 2.1: CPl5 implies CPl4.
Proof: Since clearly Pl(U \ V jV ) = Pl(U \ V \ V jV ), CPl5 follows Pl(U jV \ V ) =
Pl(U \ V jV \ V ), hence Pl(U jV ) = Pl(U \ V jV ).
CPl5 follow CPl1{4 (indeed, shown below, standard notion
conditioning lower probabilities satisfies CPl1{4 CPl5). cps satisfies
CPl5 said coherent. Although assume CPl5 here, fact holds
plausibility measures one main results applies (see Lemma 3.5).
case, CPl5 certainly coherence might required.
example, may seem reasonable require V V 0 disjoint,
case Pl(U jV [ V 0 ) > Pl(U jV ) Pl(U jV [ V 0 ) > Pl(U jV 0 ). Similarly, may
want require case Pl(U jV [ V 0 ) < Pl(U jV ) Pl(U jV [ V 0 ) <
Pl(U jV 0 ).2 Coming reasonable set coherence conditions remains topic

Pl(V jV 0 ) = Pl(U 0 \ V jV 0 ):
opposite implication, suppose Pl(U \ V jV 0 ) Pl(U 0 \ V jV 0 ). Then, Alg2,

notion. example, case probability, U V unrelated, seems reasonable expect learning U affect probability V symmetrically,
learning V affect probability U . \Unrelatedness" is, all, symmetric
notion.6 fact U V probabilistically independent (with respect probability measure ) thus expressed (U jV ) = (U ) (V jU ) = (V ).
technical problem definition: happens (V ) = 0? case (U jV )
undefined. Similarly, (U ) = 0 (V jU ) undefined. conventional say that,
case, U V still independent. leads following formal definition.

Definition 4.1: U V probabilistically independent (with respect probability measure ) (V ) =
6 0 implies (U jV ) = (U ) (U ) 6= 0 implies (V jU ) = (V ).
look standard definition independence texts, easy
calculation shows equivalent.
Proposition 4.2: following equivalent:
(a) (U ) 6= 0 implies (V jU ) = (V ),
(b) (U \ V ) = (U )(V ),
(c) (V ) 6= 0 implies (U jV ) = (U ).
Thus, case probability, would equivalent say U V independent respect (U \ V ) = (U )(V ) require (U jV ) = (U )
(V ) 6= 0 without requiring (V jU ) = (V ) (U ) 6= 0. However, equivalences necessarily hold representations uncertainty. definition
independence given seems generalize appropriately.7
definition probabilistic conditional independence analogous.
Definition 4.3: U V probabilistically independent given V 0 (with respect probability measure ) (V \ V 0 ) 6= 0 implies (U jV \ V 0 ) = (U jV 0 ) (U \ V 0 ) 6= 0 implies
(V jU \ V 0) = (V jV 0).
immediate U V (probabilistically) independent iff independent
conditional W .
generalization conditional plausibility measures (and hence representations uncertainty considering) straightforward.
Definition 4.4: Given cps (W; F ; F 0 ; Pl), U; V 2 F plausibilistically independent
given V 0 2 F (with respect cpm Pl), written IPl (U; V jV 0 ), V \ V 0 2 F 0 implies
Pl(U jV \ V 0 ) = Pl(U jV 0 ) U \ V 0 2 F 0 implies Pl(V jU \ V 0 ) = Pl(V jV 0 ).

Lemma 4.7: (W; F ; F 0 ; Pl) algebraic cps, IPl(U; V jV 0) implies NI Pl(U; V jV 0 ).
Proof: Suppose V 0 2 F 0 IPl(U; V jV 0) holds. V \ V 0 2 F 0 then, Alg2,
follows

Pl(U \ V jV 0 ) = Pl(U jV \ V 0 )
Pl(V jV 0 ) = Pl(U jV 0 )
Pl(V jV 0 ):
hand, V \ V 0 2= F 0 , Acc4, Pl(V jV 0 ) = ?. CPl3, Pl(U \ V jV 0 ) = ?,
Lemma 3.3, Pl(U jV 0 )
Pl(V jV 0 ) = ?. Thus, Pl(U \ V jV 0 ) = Pl(U jV 0 )
Pl(V jV 0 ).

Lemma 4.8: (W; F ; F 0 ; Pl) standard algebraic cps satisfies Alg40, NI Pl(U; V jV 0)
implies IPl (U; V jV 0 ).
Proof: Suppose V \ V 0 2 F 0 NI Pl(U; V jV 0). Alg2,
Pl(U \ V jV 0 ) = Pl(U jV \ V 0 )
Pl(V jV 0 ):
(2)
Acc3, V 0 2 F 0 , NI Pl (U; V jV 0 ) implies
Pl(U \ V jV 0 ) = Pl(U jV 0 )
Pl(V jV 0 ):
(3)
Since V \ V 0 2 F 0 (W; F ; F 0 ; Pl) standard, Pl(V \ V 0 ) =
6 ?. Since Pl(V \ V 0) =
Pl(V jV 0 )
Pl(V 0 ), follows Lemma 3.4 Pl(V jV 0 ) =

Pl(V jU \ V 0 ) = Pl(V jV 0 ) U \ V 0 2 F 0 . Thus, IPl(U; V jV 0 ).
Lemmas 4.7 4.8 show noninteraction independence coincide conditional
probability defined unconditional probability, ranking functions, possibility measures using Poss(U jjV ). Moreover, suggest coincide general. Since
neither Poss(U jV ) PlP satisfy Alg40 , perhaps surprising neither case
noninteraction imply conditional independence. (We shall shortly see example
case PlP ; Fonck (1994) gives examples case Poss(U jV ).) Indeed, noninteraction may even imply conditional independence arbitrary conditional probability
measure, following example shows.
Example 4.9: Suppose W = fa; bg, F = 2W , F 0 = F , f;g, (a) = 1, (b) = 0,
(bjb) = 1. easy see fbg independent itself, fbg interact
fbg, since (b) = (b) (b). Nevertheless, hard check conditional

CIRV3, suppose IPlrv (X; [ Y0 jZ). must show IPlrv (X; YjY0 [ Z).
requires showing two things:
3(a). X = x \ Y0 = y0 \ Z = z 2 F 0 ,
Pl(Y = yjX = x \ Y0 = y0 \ Z = z) = Pl(Y = yjY0 = y0 \ Z = z):
3(b). = \ Y0 = y0 \ Z = z 2 F 0 ,
Pl(X = xjY = \ Y0 = y0 \ Z = z) = Pl(X = xjY0 = y0 \ Z = z):
3(a), suppose X = x\Y0 = y0 \Z = z 2 F 0 . Thus, Acc3, X = x\Z = z 2 F 0 .
Since IPlrv (X; [ Y0 jZ), follows
Pl(Y = y00 \ Y0 = y0 jX = x \ Z = z) = Pl(Y = y00 \ Y0 = y0 jZ = z)
y00 2 R(Y). Applying Alg2 side (8), follows

Pl(Y0 = y0 jX = x \ Z = z)

Pl(Y0 = y0 jZ = z) 6= ?.
3(b), suppose = \ Y0 = y0 \ Z = z 2 F 0 . Since IPlrv (X; [ Y0 jZ), follows

Pl(X = xjY = \ Y0 = y0 \ Z = z) = Pl(X = xjZ = z):
Thus, prove 3(b), suces show
Pl(X = xjY0 = y0 \ Z = z) = Pl(X = xjZ = z):
(9)
Recall assuming IPlrv (X; [ Y0 jZ). CIRV2, follows IPlrv (X; Y0 jZ).
Thus, (9) immediate 2(b) (since = \ Y0 = y0 \ Z = z 2 F 0 implies Y0 = y0 \
Z = z 2 F 0).
Finally, consider CIRV4. Suppose IPlrv (X; YjZ) IPlrv (X; Y0 jY [ Z). must
show IPlrv (X; [ Y0 jZ). usual, requires showing two things:
4(a). = \ Y0 = y0 \ Z = z 2 F 0 ,
Pl(X = xjY = \ Y0 = y0 \ Z = z) = Pl(X = xjZ = z):
4(b). X = x \ Z = z 2 F 0 ,
Pl(Y = \ Y0 = y0 jX = x \ Z = z) = Pl(Y = \ Y0 = y0 jZ = z):
4(a) 4(b) straightforward. 4(a), suppose = y\Y0 = y0 \Z = z 2
F 0 . Since IPlrv (X; Y0 jY [ Z), follows
Pl(X = xjY = \ Y0 = y0 \ Z = z) = Pl(X = xjY = \ Z = z):
since IPlrv (X; YjZ), follows
Pl(X = xjY = \ Z = z) = Pl(X = xjZ = z):
Thus 4(a).
4(b), suppose X = x \ Z = z 2 F 0 . two cases consider.
Pl(Y = yjX = x \ Z = z) 6= ? then, Acc4, X = x \ = \ Z = z 2 F 0 . Moreover,
Alg2,
Pl(Y = y\Y0 = y0 jX = x\Z = z) = Pl(Y0 = y0 jX = x\Y = y\Z = z)
Pl(Y = yjX = x\Z = z):
(10)
Since IPlrv (X; Y0 jY [ Z), follows
Pl(Y0 = y0 jX = x \ = \ Z = z) = Pl(Y0 = y0 jY = \ Z = z):

since IPlrv (X; YjZ), follows Pl(Y = yjX = x \ Z = z) = Pl(Y = yjZ = z). Plugging (10) applying Alg2 gives
Pl(Y = \ Y0 = y0 jX = x \ Z = z)
= Pl(Y0 = y0 jY = \ Z = z)
Pl(Y = yjZ = z)
= Pl(Y = \ Y0 = y0 jZ = z);

Pl(Y = yjX = x \ Z = z) = ?, CPl3, follows Pl(Y = \
