conditional plausibility

unconditional plausibility measures

getting conditional plausibility measures perhaps best consider unconditional plausibility measures basic idea behind plausibility measures straightforward
probability measure maps subsets set w domain may consist
subsets w however required algebra recall algebra f
w set subsets w containing w closed union complementation
u v f u v u plausibility measure general
maps elements algebra f arbitrary partially ordered set pl plausibility
measure read pl u plausibility set u pl u pl v v
least plausible u ordering partial could plausibility
two different sets incomparable agent may prepared say two sets
one likely another equal likelihood
formally plausibility space tuple w f pl w set worlds f
algebra w pl maps sets f set plausibility values partially
ordered relation exive transitive anti symmetric
contains two special elements
intended analogues probability usual ordering defined

taking omit subscript
whenever clear context
three requirements plausibility measures first two obvious analogues requirements hold notions uncertainty whole space gets
maximum plausibility empty set gets minimum plausibility third
requirement says set must least plausible subsets
pl pl

pl u u pl u pl u
pl implicitly assuming u u f similar assumptions made throughout
standard representations uncertainty literature represented
plausibility measures brie describe representations uncertainty
relevance
sets probabilities one common way representing uncertainty set probability measures set often assumed convex see example campos moral
cousa moral walley gilboa schmeidler levi walley
discussion references however convex sets seem appropriate representing independence assumptions make restriction example
coin unknown probability heads tossed twice tosses known
independent seems reasonable representation given set p consisting
measures hh ht th tt
unfortunately p convex moreover convex hull includes many measures
coin tosses independent argued cousa et al set
probability measures behaviorally equivalent convex hull however even
accept argument follow set convex hull equivalent insofar
determination independencies goes
number ways viewing set p probability measures plausibility
measure one uses lower probability p defined p u inf f u pg clearly
p satisfies pl corresponding upper probability p defined p u supf
pg p u clearly plausibility measure
p p give way comparing likelihood two subsets u v w
two ways incomparable easy set p probability measures w
subsets u v w p u p v p u p v rather
choosing p p associate different plausibility measure p
captures let dp p f b b g define b b iff b
puts partial order dp p clearly dp p dp p define
plp p u p u p u thus plp p associates set u two numbers
thought defining interval terms lower upper probability u
easy check plp p u plp p v upper probability u less
equal lower probability v plp p satisfies pl indeed plausibility
measure one puts partial order events

trouble p p even plp p lose information example
hard set p probability measures subsets u v w
u v p u v p p u p v
p u p v indeed exists infinite set p probability measures
u v p p u p v p u p v probability
measures p agree u less likely v seems reasonable conclude u
less likely v however none p p plp p necessarily draw conclusion
fortunately hard associate yet another plausibility measure p
lose important information technical convenience become clear
later assume index set p g thus example
p f n g f ng let di functions
pointwise ordering f g iff f g easy
check function f f
function g g u w let fu function
fu u example set p measures representing two
coin tosses indexed ir set w taken fhh ht tt thg
example ffhhg hh ffht ttg
easy see f fw define plp u fu thus
plp u plp v iff fu fv iff u v p clearly plp
satisfies pl pl pl follow since plp f plp w fw
pl follows since u v u v p plp captures
information p unlike say p washes much away taking infs
way associating plausibility measure set p probability measures
generalizes provides way associating single plausibility measure set
plausibility measures leave straightforward details reader
possibility measures fuzzy measure sugeno measure f w wang klir
function f w satisfies pl less general
plausibility measure requires range rather arbitrary
partially ordered set possibility measure poss w special case sugeno measure
function mapping subsets w poss w poss

ranking functions ordinal ranking ranking ranking function w

conditional plausibility measures

since bayesian networks make heavy use conditioning interest
plausibility measures conditional plausibility measures cpm given set w
worlds cpm maps pairs subsets w partially ordered set write pl u jv
rather pl u v keeping standard notation conditioning case
probability measure standard take u jv undefined v
general must make precise allowable second arguments thus take
domain cpm form f f intuitively f consists sets
f makes sense condition example conditional probability
measure defined usual way unconditional probability measure f consists
sets v v note f algebra closed
complementation popper algebra w set f f subsets w w satisfying
following properties
acc f algebra w
acc f nonempty subset f
acc f closed supersets f v f v v v f
v f
popper algebras named karl popper first consider formally
conditional probability basic notion popper de finetti
early work apparently independently taking conditional probabilities primitive indeed
renyi points idea seems go back far keynes
conditional plausibility space cps tuple w f f pl f f popper
algebra w pl f f partially ordered set plausibility values pl
conditional plausibility measure cpm satisfies following conditions
cpl pl jv
cpl pl w jv

condition following

proof since clearly pl u v jv pl u v v jv cpl follows pl u jv v
pl u v jv v hence pl u jv pl u v jv
cpl follow cpl indeed shown standard notion
conditioning lower probabilities satisfies cpl cpl cps satisfies
cpl said coherent although assume cpl fact holds
plausibility measures one main applies see lemma
case cpl certainly coherence might required
example may seem reasonable require v v disjoint
case pl u jv v pl u jv pl u jv v pl u jv similarly may
want require case pl u jv v pl u jv pl u jv v
pl u jv coming reasonable set coherence conditions remains topic

independence

capture formally notion two events independent intuitively
means nothing totally unrelated occurrence one uence none representations uncertainty
considering express notion unrelatedness whatever might


ficonditional plausibility measures bayesian networks

mean directly best capture footprint independence
notion example case probability u v unrelated seems reasonable expect learning u affect probability v symmetrically
learning v affect probability u unrelatedness symmetric
notion fact u v probabilistically independent respect probability measure thus expressed u jv u v ju v
technical definition happens v case u jv
undefined similarly u v ju undefined conventional say
case u v still independent leads following formal definition

definition u v probabilistically independent respect probability measure v
implies u jv u u implies v ju v
look standard definition independence texts easy
calculation shows equivalent
proposition following equivalent
u implies v ju v
b u v u v
c v implies u jv u
thus case probability would equivalent say u v independent respect u v u v require u jv u
v without requiring v ju v u however equivalences necessarily hold representations uncertainty definition
independence given seems generalize appropriately
definition probabilistic conditional independence analogous
definition u v probabilistically independent given v respect probability measure v v implies u jv v u jv u v implies
v ju v v jv
immediate u v probabilistically independent iff independent
conditional w
generalization conditional plausibility measures hence representations uncertainty considering straightforward
definition given cps w f f pl u v f plausibilistically independent
given v f respect cpm pl written ipl u v jv v v f implies
pl u jv v pl u jv u v f implies pl v ju v pl v jv
walley calls asymmetric notion irrelevance defines u independent v u
irrelevant v v irrelevant u although focus independence irrelevance

another property probabilistic independence u independent v u independent
