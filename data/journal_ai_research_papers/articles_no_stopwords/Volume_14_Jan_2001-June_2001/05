proof let us glb n let glb definition
h ni satisfiable n n otherwise largest
value h mi satisfiable let us mark sub expression
trace components query assertion deduction


fireasoning within fuzzy dls

consider completion starting h mi applying rules inference
marked expressions type h mi h mi appear furthermore
satisfiable contains clash e value largest value
completions contain clash let us analyse contains clash
clash according table ii clash according table
case e clash distinguish
two cases marked b marked former case
contains clash independently value thus largest possible value
contains clash latter case hw mi
hw mi clashes value consequence largest
possible value contains clash according table assume ii
case e conjugated pair fuzzy constraints similarly previous
case distinguish cases marked four
cases
h ki h k none marked k k
therefore contains clash value thus largest choice
b h ki h mi marked k
therefore contains clash value k thus largest choice
k easily verified case analysis rules k n follows
c h ki h mi marked k
therefore contains clash value k thus largest choice
k easily verified case analysis rules k n
follows
h mi h mi marked
therefore contains clash value thus largest choice

summing proved largest possible value

work presented quite general fuzzy extension dl alc significant
expressive representative dls fuzzy dl enables us reason
presence imprecise alc concepts e fuzzy alc concepts semantics point
view fuzzy concepts interpreted fuzzy sets e given concept c individual
c interpreted truth value sentence c syntax point
view allow specify lower upper bounds truth value c complete
reasoning presented devised
