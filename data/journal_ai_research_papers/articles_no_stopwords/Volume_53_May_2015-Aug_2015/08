periodically introduce formal machinery
consider simple action domain involving four agents bob alice eve trent bob

trent provides sufficient basis determining three possible conclusions

plausibility functions
interested action domains agents beliefs action history may
incorrect context action believed executed given point
time represented total pre order possible actions minimal elements
pre order represent actions likely executed moving higher
ordering gives increasingly implausible possibilities representing actions
manner allows agent determine plausible alternative actions face conflicting
evidence similarly agent needs mechanism ordering states order represent
fallible observations fallible beliefs moreover would able compare
orderings actions orderings states one natural way create mutually
comparable orderings assigning quantitative plausibility values every action
state every point time towards end define plausibility functions
definition let x non empty set plausibility function x function
r x n
r plausibility function r x r say x least plausible
interested plausibility functions finite sets
non empty set minimally ranked elements
plausibility functions inspired spohns ordinal conditional functions spohn
important differences first allow plausibility functions
arbitrary set x rather restricting attention propositional interpretations
allows us treat actions manner treat observations another
important difference ordinal conditional functions must assign rank
non empty subset elements domain plausibility functions restricted
manner minimal rank given plausibility function may greater

introduce useful terminology notation let r plausibility function

simple example suppose agent believes certain lamp initially
power switch toggled agent observes lamp actually still
clearly sequence events consistently believed rational agent
manipulating degrees strength ra rs gives agent mechanism

initially easiest way incorporate information change
initial belief state contrast case agent completely certain
