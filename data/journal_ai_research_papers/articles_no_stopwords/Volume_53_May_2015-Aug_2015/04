truthful auctions main include truthful fptas multi minded bidders
approximates supply constraints within factor optimizes social
welfare ii deterministic truthful ptas submodular bidders approximates
social welfare within factor without violating supply constraints achieving
ii used direct generalization single good multi unit allocation method proposed
dobzinski nisan discussed developments best possible
terms time efficient approximation follows relevant hardness finally
showed treat general unrestricted valuation functions setting appropriately adjusting analysis dobzinski nisan closing gap
communication complexity lower bound single good dobzinski nisan
approximation goods requires understanding
communication complexity general setting
