complexity gives fails single peaked electorates
theorem faliszewski et al approval bribery np complete
theorem approval bribery p single peaked electorates
prove theorem informally explain key challenge namely
incomparability exists regarding proving proof overcomes challenge
namely directionality
recall approval bribery single peaked setting societal order l
part input voter approves possibly empty set candidates
contiguous respect l suppose input linear order l c l c l c l l c
respect society single peaked suppose candidate briber trying
make win c suppose input limit number people briber
bribe suppose input election voters call v

key challenge even given single peakedness stated word incomparability given know number approvals c go exactly

among votes choose bribe v least ni must initially

rub consider two voters v one approves c

however use single peakedness tame combinatorial challenge choosing
good subset particular use single peakedness induce directional attack
locally make incomparability disappear moment need make
decision choosing although focus bribery
construction arguments tailored mention line attack
modeled faliszewski et al call smart greedy
use study control attacks full proof appendix key idea
easily conveyed reader kind visualize along us moment
consider largest ni purpose example suppose
strictly greater let us say suppose n
must include least three members v approve c
three isnt incomparability still since chose largest
ni clearly n n although among voters v approve
c may incomparability approval ranges range differences right
c utterly irrelevant c already beating candidates anyway
interesting issue among voters v approve c leftmost approved
candidate isthe leftward better help possible ni deficits
direct comparisons take action put
three voters among v voters initially approve c whose approval range
leftmost v lacks three voters approve c since n successful bribery
impossible process continues one would expect three
votes ni values updated next leftmost ni satisfying similarly
handled ni handled starting
end l analogously handle c c neutralize ni within
bribes among v successful bribery otherwise none possible

covering caused incomparability
