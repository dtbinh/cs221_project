tac travel shopping game
tac market game presents travel shopping task traders assemble flights hotels

price prediction
tac participants recognized early importance accurate price prediction overall performance stone greenwald prices hotels highly variable game game
yet hotels price finalized auction closessome minutes game depending
random closing order agents tend submit serious hotel bids first
closing imminent useful information revealed price quotes fourth minute
play complementarity among goods dictates outcomes early auctions significantly affect
value agent places particular hotel later game conversely prices hotels
available later dictate whether agent bid wisely early game
anticipating hotel prices key element several decisions facing tac agent particular


fitac p rice p rediction

selecting trip itineraries flight prices tend increase agents great incentive
commit traveling particular days early game yet quality day choices
depends crucially hotel prices included travel days
bidding policy likelihood obtaining good given bid depends obviously
resulting clearing price moreover value particular good general function
price others example value obtaining room hotel increasing
function projected cost alternative hotel day decreasing
function projected cost complementary hotel rooms adjacent days


given importance price prediction surprising tac researchers explored
variety approaches stone et al noted diversity price estimation methods among
tac agents particular interest certainly connected tac
agent walverine introduced method quite distinct reported previously thus
highly motivated characterize performance price prediction task
indeed competitions tac successful facilitating necessary separately evaluate techniques developed subtasks stone although
interesting subtasks tend strictly separable complex game price prediction
component trading strategy may easier isolate particular
formulated terms natural absolute accuracy measures fact see
agent developers independently chose define price prediction distinct task
agent designs
divide price prediction two phases initial interim initial refers beginning
game hotel auctions close provide quote information interim refers
method employed thereafter since information available initial prediction flight prices
client preferencessee section strict subset available interim adds transaction hotel price data agents treat initial prediction simpler special case
initial prediction relevant bidding policy first hotel closing especially salient
trip choices typically made early game interim prediction supports ongoing revision bids hotel auctions start close analysis report focus initial prediction
mainly simpler two tasks involving less potential information moreover
agents initially relatively comparable information sets thus providing cleaner analysis
interim prediction quite important interesting focus work

forms prediction
one distinction observed tac agents explicitly formulated predictions terms
probability distributions prices rather point estimates predictions form enable
agent properly account price uncertainty decision making thus asked entrants
form predictions survey
although agents generate point predictions notable exceptions attacs boosting stone et al expressly learns probability distributions associated game
features roxybot tabulates game price statistics direct estimation deciles hotel
auction packatac harami measure historical variance combining historical averaging define parametric distribution hotel price walverine predicts point prices
hedging decisions amounts forming effective distribution around
given prediction form distribution agents may make decisions sampling
decision analytic techniques distribution may facilitate interim prediction task enabling updates treating observations price quotes evidence
however first controlled experiment evaluating distribution feature context attac
stone et al overall advantage decision making distributions
compared mean values authors offered several possible explanations observed
performance including implementation employs insufficient samples
use distributions makes unrealistic assumption subsequent decisions made
full knowledge actual price values greenwald b found bidding marginal utility means outperformed bidding expected marginal utility distributions time
implemented context roxybot since performed analogous trials walverinewhich generates applies distributions yet third wayand found bidding
means superior distribution bidding agent actually employed tac
although source deficiency conclusively established speculate
second reason adduced attac designers plausible


fiw ellman r eeves l ochner vorobeychik

despite evidence alternative ways distributions may well prove beneficial
study greenwald b demonstrated advantage roxybots strategy evaluating
candidate bid sets respect distributions compared strategy evaluating
respect means
nevertheless agents predict probability distributions take mean distributions subject analysis may discount potential advantages
discussion suspect thatwith possible exception roxybotagents

competitive analysis
walverines overall tac markets presume well approximated
competitive economy cheng et al method predicting hotel prices literal
application assumption specifically calculates walrasian competitive equilibrium
tac economy defined set prices markets would clear assuming
agents behave price takers katzner taking account exogenously determined
flight prices walverine finds set hotel prices support equilibrium returns
values prediction hotels final prices
let vector hotel prices consisting elements denoting price hotel type
day let denote agent demand hotel day prices write vector
demands aggregate demand simply sum agent demands
prices constitute competitive equilibrium aggregate demand equals aggregate supply
hotels since rooms available hotel day competitive
equilibrium
starting initial guess walverine searches equilibrium prices tatonnement protocol iterative price adjustment mechanism originally conceived walras arrow
hahn given specification aggregate demand tatonnement iteratively computes
revised price vector according following difference equation






although equilibrium prices guaranteed exist given discreteness complementarities tac environment found procedure typically produces approximate
equilibrium well within iterations walverine devotes prediction calculation
critical step competitive analysis determining aggregate demand function walverine estimates sum demand eight clients knows
expected demand agents clients specified tac distribution client preferences calculation expected demand others exact modulo
summarization entertainment effects given assumption agent demands separable
client cheng et al assumption true beginning game hence initial
prediction invalidated agents accumulate holdings flights hotels although
analytic expression expected demand somewhat complicated deriving conceptually computationally difficult
note larger component walverines demand estimation expectation
defined distribution client preferences therefore prices derives properly viewed
equilibrium expectation rather expected equilibrium prices latter might
actually appropriate measure price prediction however since expected equilibrium

difference would relatively small clients employ simpler measure

limitations
important emphasize several limitations study must qualify conclusions
drawn efficacy prediction methods evaluated
first focused exclusively initial price prediction whereas many agents placed
greater emphasis interim prediction task
second many cases represented agents predictions abstraction actual
object produced prediction modules particular reduce probability distributions
means consider first unit priceline prediction generally
account different ways agents apply predictions generate without question
even measure introduce evpp inspired thinking terms walverine uses
predictions perhaps measures tailored processes agents would justifiably
predictions favorable light
third recognized despite desirability isolating focused components
agent analysis complete separation possible principle prediction evaluation relative
agent uses prediction makes tradeoffs e g

must strive balance benefits decomposition appreciation interconnections
synergies among elements sophisticated agents behavior

conclusions
presented comprehensive survey approaches initial price prediction tac
quantitative analysis relative accuracy analysis introduces measure expected
value perfect prediction captures important sense instrumental value accurate
predictions beyond nominal correspondence realized outcomes
draw several conclusions price prediction tac exercise first
clearly demonstrate instance specific information provide significant leverage pure
background history three agents use instance specific information perform better least
one measure constant prediction particular initial flight prices provide substantial
predictive value induced verified empirically seen success
machine learning agents predictive value flows influence flight prices demand
hotels indicated success competitive analysis capturing relationship
believe striking purely analytical without empirical tuning could
achieve accuracy comparable best available machine learning method moreover many
would surely skeptical straight competitive analysis could prove successful given
manifest unreality assumptions applied tac analysis certainly
competitive equilibrium best possible model price formation tac
demonstrate deriving shape market idealized economic theory surprisingly effective


fitac p rice p rediction

several advantages model reasoning obviously ability perform
minimal empirical data even historical information available misleading rely nonstationary environment tournament setup tac naturally violates
stationarity agent pool evolves time selection well individual learning
development course dealing time variance particularly multiagent environments
active area current ultimately best methods combine elements
model data reasoning
finally suggest present study represents evidence competitions
right circumstances produce knowledge insights beyond might emerge independent efforts hope additional researchers inspired bring innovative
ideas trading strategy next tac look forward investigating
interplay future work
