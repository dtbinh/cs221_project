Abstract
paper discusses interested party wishes inuence behavior agents
game (multi-agent interaction), control. interested party
cannot design new game, cannot enforce agents behavior, cannot enforce payments
agents, cannot prohibit strategies available agents. However, inuence
outcome game committing non-negative monetary transfers dierent
strategy proles may selected agents. interested party assumes
agents rational commonly agreed sense use dominated strategies.
Hence, certain subset outcomes implemented given game adding nonnegative payments, rational players necessarily produce outcome subset.
Obviously, making suciently big payments one implement desirable outcome.
question cost implementation? paper introduce notion
k-implementation desired set strategy proles, k stands amount
payment need actually made order implement desirable outcomes. major
point k-implementation monetary oers need necessarily materialize
following desired behaviors. dene study k-implementation contexts games
complete incomplete information. latter case mainly focus VCG
games. setting later extended deal mixed strategies using correlation devices.
Together, paper introduces studies implementation desirable outcomes
reliable party cannot modify game rules (i.e. provide protocols), complementing
previous work mechanism design, making applicable many realistic CS
settings.

1. interested party may wish assume little possible agents rationality.
Ideally, assumed agent adopt strategy dominated

2. interested party may wish minimize expenses.
Consider following simple congestion setting.3 Assume two agents,

lines, etc.) One service providers, f , fast one, other, s, slower one.

Moreover, given strategy prole (f, s) selected interested party
pay nothing. implemented (in dominant strategies) desired behavior (obtained
one Nash equilibria) zero cost, relying creditability, without
modifying rules interactions enforcing type behavior.
Similar simple examples found contexts (see e.g., Segal (1999), footnote
30, Dybvig Spatt (1983), Spiegler (2000)). work advocates following line
thought. Instead reasoning agents behave given protocol,
may wish cause agents follow particular behaviors making desirable, using
monetary oers. important point monetary oers need necessarily
fully materialized agents follow desired behavior.

However, requirement V 0 means interested party cannot force players

One use xi = zi order get costless strict inequality required denition

Hence, optimal implementation vector z, V dened every by: Vi (xi , ) = 0
xi = zi , Vi (zi , xi ) = maxxi Xi (Ui (xi , zi ) Ui (zi , zi )) + (xi ), : Xi
nonnegative function satises (zi ) = 0, xi = zi , (xi ) > 0.
Therefore (3.1.1) satised.
Note z equilibrium every player i, maxxi Xi (Ui (xi , zi )
Ui (zi , zi )) = 0. Hence following characterization equilibrium corollary Theorem 1:

3.2 Innite games

example, possible Xi = {zi } zi dominant strategy. E.g., consider
two-person game player 1 choose strategy z1 , number 0 < x1 < 1,
player 2 choose z2 x2 . U1 (z1 , z2 ) = 0.5, U1 (z1 , x2 ) = 10, U1 (x1 , ) = x1 . U2
arbitrary function. easily seen every x1 dominated bigger number
open interval (0,1), z1 dominated, hence X1 = {z1 }. However, z1
dominate x1 x1 > 0.5. Moreover, max operator used proofs Theorem 1

every Xi compact metric space, payo functions continuous X endowed
product metric.
Theorem 2 Theorems 1 holds regular games.
Proof : proof requires standard techniques, therefore omitted.
immediately get:
Corollary 2 Corollary 1 holds regular games.

probability distributions B. is,
(B) consists functions q : B [0, 1] bB q(b) = 1. Let G(U ) = (N, X, U )

is, xi dominant (dominated) strategy G(U ), continues dominant

Gm (U ) regular game apply Theorem 2 Corollary 2 deduce:
Theorem 3 Let G(U ) nite game strategic form least two strategies every
player. Let p prole mixed strategies G(U ). p mixed strategy equilibrium

Hence, technically, case mixed strategies follows theorems regarding pure

Intuitively, frugal VCG mechanism center never allocates unnecessary goods.

Consider interested party wishes 0-implement ex post equilibrium b =

positive payment every buyer whenever follows recommendation play according

interested party know valuation functions. Hence, could know whether
player follows recommendation? Indeed cannot. However, since known

best interested party oer every player positive payment reported

6.2 0-implementations correlated equilibrium
Aumann (1974) introduced concept correlated equilibrium. provide one
many equivalent denitions:
Denition Let G(U ) = (N, X, U ) nite game strategic form. correlated equilibrium G(U ) probability distribution X ( (X)) strategies
bi (si ) = si , si Xi , N , form equilibrium game G(U, I), = (S, h, V )
following implementation device:

h = ,
Vi (s, x) = Ui (x) every N every s, x X.
Hence, forms correlated equilibrium mediator makes changes
players payo run randomization device according , picks prole pure actions
s, sends every player recommendation play si , every player better
obeying recommendation believes players obey recommendations.
well-known ( implicitly used proof Theorem 7) p mixed
strategy equilibrium, p correlated equilibrium. Moreover, going proof
Theorem 7 reveals property mixed-strategy equilibrium p use
fact p correlated equilibrium. Hence get:
Theorem 8 Let G(U ) = (N, X, U ) nite game least two actions every
player. Every correlated equilibrium prole 0-implementable G(U ) appropriate implementation device = (S, h, V ) which, = X h = .
Note eventually, interested party implements mixed strategy equilibrium
correlated equilibrium implementation device I, players using pure
strategies game G(U, I). expected value operator linear,
easily seen obeying recommendation remains dominant strategy every player
even player believes players use mixed strategies G(U, I),
mixed strategy G(U, I) probability distribution Qi set pure
strategies. mixed strategy natural description behavior G(U, I).
natural, less computational demanding concept one behavior strategy:
behavior strategy game G(U, I) function ci : Si (Xi ). Hence, player
using behavioral strategy chooses mixed strategy game strategic form
function signal, player using mixed strategy G(U, I) picking
pure strategy G(U, I) randomization device receives signal. sets
mixed behavioral strategies technically related other. However,
Kuhn (1953) ( see Hart (1992) details), every player i, every strategy bi
every prole Qi = (Qj )j=i mixed strategies players, exists
prole ci = (cj )j=i behavioral strategies players every signal

si expected utility using bi given players using Qi equals
expected utility players using ci , vice versa.16
Hence, theorems 7 8 remain valid environment allows utilization
