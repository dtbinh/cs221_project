discusses interested party wishes inuence behavior agents
game multi agent interaction control interested party
cannot design game cannot enforce agents behavior cannot enforce payments
agents cannot prohibit strategies available agents however inuence
outcome game committing non negative monetary transfers dierent
strategy proles may selected agents interested party assumes
agents rational commonly agreed sense use dominated strategies
hence certain subset outcomes implemented given game adding nonnegative payments rational players necessarily produce outcome subset
obviously making suciently big payments one implement desirable outcome
question cost implementation introduce notion
k implementation desired set strategy proles k stands amount
payment need actually made order implement desirable outcomes major
point k implementation monetary oers need necessarily materialize
following desired behaviors dene study k implementation contexts games
complete incomplete information latter case mainly focus vcg
games setting later extended deal mixed strategies correlation devices
together introduces studies implementation desirable outcomes
reliable party cannot modify game rules e provide protocols complementing

many distributed systems multi agent interactions interested parties cannot control

community benets reliable party one source power
reliability commit payments dierent agents certain observable
outcomes reached agents sure paid appropriately
work introduce study implementation desired behaviors interested
party two major issues make task non trivial challenging
interested party may wish assume little possible agents rationality
ideally assumed agent adopt strategy dominated
another strategy
interested party may wish minimize expenses
consider following simple congestion setting assume two agents
select among two service providers e g machines communication
lines etc one service providers f fast one slower one
capture agent obtaining payo one
uses f payo one uses agents select
service provider speed operation decreases factor leading half
payo agents use f one obtains payo
