grounded semantic composition
use term grounded semantic composition highlight semantics
individual words word composition process visually grounded
model lexical entrys meaning grounded association visual model
example green associated probability distribution function defined
colour space propose processes combine visual words governed
rules syntax
given goal understanding modelling grounded semantic composition several
questions arise
visual features people use describe objects scenes
figure
features connect language
features descriptions combine produce whole utterances
meanings
word meanings independent visual scene describe
meaning whole utterance meanings parts
composition meanings purely incremental process
assumed easy answers questions place start modelling
effort current implementation assumes meaning whole utterance
fully derived meanings parts performs composition incrementally without
backtracking let visual context influence interpretation word
meanings despite assumptions system handles relatively sophisticated semantic
composition evaluated test data system correctly understood chose
appropriate referents expressions purple one behind two green ones
left green cone front back purple one
analysing systems performance human participants utterances found

word meanings strongly dependent visual scene describe
instance found four distinct visual interpretations word middle
linguistically indistinguishable instead depend different visual contexts
understood
meaning utterance may sometimes depend meanings
parts meaning may depend visual context utterance
occurs modify parts compose example objects
referred frontmost left would referred neither left frontmost
isolation multiplicative joined estimation two
composition meanings task purely incremental process
cases found necessary backtrack reinterpret parts utterance

resolved current interpretation due strictly feed forward model

contrast primarily concerned understanding language referring objects

previously proposed methods visually grounded language learning roy
pentland understanding roy et al generation roy however
treatment semantic composition efforts relatively primitive phrase
visual word phrase individually evaluated multiplied
method works phrases conjunctive modifiers even cases
discuss later ordering modifiers sometimes needs taken account e leftmost
front refer front leftmost simple
worked constrained domains addressed past scale
present task example describer system roy encodes spatial locations
absolute terms within frame reference visual scene describer
makes mistakes humans would make grounding word highest
example defined probability distribution centred specific height scene
object closest height best example highest accounting
fact may objects greater height depending relative sizes
shapes objects addition describers interpretation phrase highest
green rectangle object close center probability
distributions highest green accounting fact human
listener highest green rectangle need high screen higher
green rectangles word highest requires visual binding
includes notion rank ordering move however requires rethinking
achieve semantic composition addressed

spatial description task
designed task requires people describe objects computer generated scenes
containing objects random positions virtual surface objects
identical shapes sizes green purple colour object
chance green otherwise purple refer task bishop
task resulting language understanding model implemented system simply
bishop
motivation task design
previous work investigated speakers describe objects distinctive
attributes colour shape size constraint speaking task scenes
constant number objects roy speakers task rarely compelled
use spatial relations never use groups objects cases objects
distinguished listing properties designing bishop task goal
naturally lead speakers make reference spatial aspects scene therefore


figrounded semantic composition visual scenes

drastically increased number objects scene decreased number
distinctive object attributes let number objects vary throughout trials
cover scenes cluttered objects scenes objects analysis
variation task ran experiments system chose objects
random speaker describer rather allowing describer make choice
found made task difficult highly unnatural speaker
often visually salient arrangements randomly chosen objects took part
listeners make many errors resolving reference variation
task error speaker chose object versus system
chose limits accuracy pure linguistic reference appeared
reaching random selection version task speakers seemed much
harder time finding visually salient landmarks leading long less natural descriptions
example centre bunch green cones four um actually
four ah theres one thats centre pretty much pile
top ahm say seventh cone right
side followed listener counting cones pointing screen avoid collecting
unnatural data decided use random selection version task
another possible variant task would let system choose objects
non random manner systems analysis objects would natural describe however would clearly bias data towards objects
matched preexisting system
since interested people described objects spatially well visual
features found salient decided let listener pick objects felt
concisely yet trivially describable acknowledge task design eases
difficulty understanding task speakers could interesting object
easy describe ways resorted simpler choices leftmost
one yet utterances elicited task relatively complex see appendix
complete listing provided serious challenges automatic language
understanding perspective
scenes rendered instead equivalent scene anticipation
transition understanding system camera driven vision system use
rendering introduces occlusion shadows sources ambiguity must
eventually addressed transition real vision system however note
scene include interesting spatial relations features
claim description task thus system presented would generalize
directly true setting furthermore use information
visual scene system interprets spatial relations errs side
ambiguity inherent word leftmost reference one scenes
interpretation differ due perspective effects leftmost object interpreting
scene might leftmost interpreting believe
task types visually grounded descriptions produced challenging
computational system understand hope remainder
finally note goal design task study collaboration
dialogue agreement goal experiments analyses carletta
mellish eugenio jordan thomason moore use speaker listener dyad


figorniak roy

ensure descriptions produced understandable human listener
purposefully allow listeners speak feedback channel speakers
successful unsuccessful selection described object introduce
minimal form dialogue low error rate listeners leads us believe negative
reinforcement negligible speakers task viewed
exercise collaboration cannot rule listeners adopted strategies used
partners turn speak however relative similarity strategies
pairs shows phenomenon make data unrepresentative
even produces types shortenings vagueness would expect see
extended description task speaking machine
data collection
participants study ranged age years included native
non native english speakers pairs participants seated backs
looking computer screen displayed identical scenes
figure pair one participant served describer listener
describer wore microphone used record speech describer used
mouse select object scene verbally described selected object
listener listener allowed communicate verbally otherwise
except object selections listeners task select object
computer display verbal description selected objects matched
disappeared scene describer would select describe another object
match describer would attempt description understood
listener describer listener dyad ensured speech data resembled natural
communicative dialogue participants told free select object
scene describe way thought would clear told
make task trivial example selecting leftmost object describing
leftmost scene contained objects beginning session
session ended objects remained point describer listener switched
roles completed second session participants fulfilled role multiple times
found listeners study made extremely mistakes interpreting descriptions
seemed generally task easy perform

consistency along following criteria
candidates must refer group single object
candidates marked referring unambiguously specified single object
must unambiguously pick referent
referent specified single object case must across candidates
candidates marked selecting group must select group
consistency checks fail filtering provide exact information type inconsistency occurred within group ambiguity contradicting

grouping

visual grouping left scene figure shows example grouping composer

future directions
given analysis bishops performance several areas future improvements may explored descriptive strategies classified

distance simple implementation understand strategy grammatical behaviour spatial relation composers uses inverted distance measure
score target objects
symmetry selection symmetry occurred symmetry across horizontal centre
board data thus propose mirror landmark object across
horizontal centre scoring possible targets inverted distance mirror
image
numbered grouping limited groups two three objects
work higher numbers
group numbering descriptive strategy second row understood slight modification ordering composer put peak
exponential distribution ends middle sequences
rather arbitrary points
connectivity simple way understand lonely cone could measure distance
closest objects within group possible referents better solution might
construct local connectivity graph look topologically isolated objects
furthermore already mentioned several areas possible improvement
existing system due faulty assumptions
individual composers every one semantic composers attempts solve separate
hard e g grouping spatial relations seen long
lines work dedicated sophisticated solutions individual
emphasis believe improvements
implementation improve system whole much following
possible techniques
backtracking lack backtracking bishop addressed parse

loosen decisions made stages interpretation referent

visual context semantics backtracking solves system knows
failed obtain answer knows answer produced
unlikely one however numerous examples data one
interpretation utterance produces perfectly likely answer according
measurements example middle finds object exact centre screen
many scenes interpretation produces correct answer measurement
relative objects would produce wrong one however observe
participants interpret middle way obvious structure
rest scene chance scene divided group objects left

groups even another object closer actual centre

lexical entries made assumption lexical entries word entities

task somewhat faulty assumption example ambiguity word
resolved careful design grammar see section may
useful treat entire phrases left single lexical entries perhaps
grammar replace left spatial markers jackendoff
proposed absorbing rules syntax lexicon see jackendoff
dialogue constructing parse charts obtain rich set partial full syntactic
semantic fragments offering explanations parts utterance present
largely ignore information rich resource selecting best referent
successful might entail backtracking revision described
engage clarification dialogue human speaker system could
use fragments knows check validity interpretation
group green ones mean could simply disambiguate directly
two mean followed explanation confusion terms
semantic fragments formed
manual construction visually grounded lexicon presented limited
accuracy due structural parametric decisions manually approximated machine learning may used learn many parameter settings
