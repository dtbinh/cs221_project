abstract
recent technological feasibility electronic commerce internet
much attention given design electronic markets types
electronically tradable goods markets however normally need function
relationship markets related goods usually downstream upstream supply chain thus example electronic market rubber tires
trucks likely need strongly inuenced rubber market well
truck market
design protocols exchange information sequence markets
along single supply chain protocols allow markets function separately information exchanged ensures ecient global behavior across supply
chain market forms link supply chain operates double auction
bids one side double auction come bidders corresponding
segment industry bids side synthetically generated
protocol express combined information links chain double
auctions markets several types study several variants
incentive compatible double auctions comparing terms eciency
market revenue

introduction
recent rush towards electronic commerce internet raises many challenges
technological conceptual deals conceptual challenge coordination electronic markets let us look years technological future
electronic commerce seems likely following two key challenges
adequately solved industry
supply chain integration enterprise information systems businesses
able securely eciently share information inter operate information systems suppliers customers partners
electronic markets ecient sophisticated robust liquid electronic markets
available trade goods segments industry markets
interactively respond changes supply demand dynamically changing
trade quantities prices
interested conceptual question markets related goods
share information consider example ctional market rubber tires trucks
two related markets rubber trucks one imagine following

simplied supply chain forming rubber manufacturers placing sell bids rubber
rubber market tire manufacturers placing buy orders rubber market sell bids
tire market truck manufacturers placing buy bids tire market selling
trucks truck market nally customers bidding trucks one would expect
combination markets together information systems manufacturers
able automatically respond markets changes economically ecient way
thus example surge demand certain type trucks raise price
truck market causing manufacturers type truck automatically decide
increase production consequently automatically raising electronic bids tires
turn may increase tire prices tire market etc etc leading eventually
indirectly still completely automatically increased rubber production rubber
manufacturers
let us emphasize process described occurs slowly normal human trade
combined eects large number self interested decisions many people
involved supply chain desire combination participating
information systems electronic markets automatically without human control
rapidly within time frames electronic commerce reach similar
even economically ecient ones humans usually achieve
achieved despite fact information systems manufacturers still
self interested optimizing companys prot global economic eciency
seeing invisible hand function normal human economic activity one would
certainly expect electronic markets reach types however key conceptual design challenge emerges bidders must concurrently active
one market tire manufacturers must concurrently participate buyers rubber market sellers tire market clearly quantity rubber wish buy
given price determined amount tires sell given price thus
price bid buying rubber must intimately related price bid selling
tires increase one lead corresponding increase
theoretically impossible dene suggested bid one without thus
two markets operate independently tires manufacturers able reasonably
participate operate sequentially say rst rubber bought
afterwards tires sold serious exposure emerges tire manufacturers must
conservative bids rubber know advance price
get tire market
one handling inter dependence markets run complete
supply chain single complex huge market conceptually spirit
recently popular vertical markets vertical portals try vertically integrate
information trade complete vertical segment industry integration
markets single complex market complex optimization
done address pure optimization
centralized solution obvious advantages problematic due necessity
concentrating information communications decision making single point
centralization information problematic sense distributed computing
systems economic sense
