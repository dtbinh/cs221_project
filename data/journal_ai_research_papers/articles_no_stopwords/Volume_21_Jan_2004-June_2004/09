many concerns expressed regarding representation however
applicable far generally
begin noting notion probabilistic inference two quite different
interpretations one interpretation forms basis bayesian paradigm
probabilitic inference consists basically conditioning start prior distribution event space condition whatever observations obtained
interpretation given set probabilistic assertions goal
reach conclusions probabilities events
focus latter interpretation although discuss relationship bayesian
section
suppose procedure making inferences probabilistic knowledge
base sensitive way knowledge represented consider following
examples use perhaps best known non deductive notion probabilistic inference
maximum entropy jaynes
example suppose information whatsoever regarding whether
object colorful probability assign proposition colorful symmetry
arguments might suggest since information seems object
likely colorful non colorful conclusion reached
maximum entropy provided language proposition colorful
suppose know colors red blue green propositions corresponding
colors moreover colorful actually mean red blue green
case maximum entropy dictates probability red blue green note
cases conclusion follows constraints trivial one
probability query somewhere
example suppose told half birds fly two reasonable ways represent information one propositions bird fly
use knowledge base kb fly
def pr fly bird second might
basic predicates bird flying bird use knowledge base kb fly
def flying bird
bird pr flying bird bird although first representation may appear natural seems representations intuitively adequate insofar representing
information given use inference method maximum
entropy first representation leads us infer pr bird second leads us
infer pr bird
examples basis frequent criticisms maximum entropy
grounds representation dependence pointing examples
little work fact work salmon
paris seems work formalizing notion representation dependence one might say consensus whatever representation
independence property enjoyed maximum entropy
although much discussion motivated representation dependence encountered
maximum entropy understanding maximum entropy works essential
understanding discussion

inference procedures attempt understand notion
representation dependence study extent achievable
study representation dependence must first understand mean
representation real world complex reasoning process must focus
certain details ignore others semantic level relevant distinctions captured
space x possible alternatives states possible worlds example
first representation focused single attribute colorful case two
states state space corresponding colorful true false respectively
second representation red blue green richer state space clearly
distinctions could make
interpret representation syntactic entity case typically capture relevant distinctions formal language example use propositional
logic basic knowledge representation language choice primitive propositions
characterizes distinctions chosen make take states
truth assignments propositions similarly use probabilistic representation language belief networks pearl knowledge representation
language must choose set relevant random variables states
possible assignments values variables
mean shift representation e state space x another representation roughly speaking want capture level state space shift
say feet meters thus x distances might described terms feet
might described terms meters would expect constraint
relating feet meters constraint would give extra information x
would relate worlds x worlds thus first attempt capture representation independence somewhat indirectly requiring adding constraints relating x
place constraints x different conclusions x
resulting notion called robustness turns surprisingly strong
every robust inference procedure must behave essentially logical entailment
try define representation independence directly mapping f
one representation another example f could map world individual
feet tall corresponding world individual meters tall
obvious constraints f necessary ensure corresponds intuition
representation shift define representation independent inference procedure
one preserves inferences every legitimate mapping f e kb
kb iff f kb f
definition turns somewhat reasonable first attempt
exist nontrivial representation independent inference procedures however still
strong notion particular representation independent inference procedure must
act essentially logical entailment knowledge base objective information
e essentially non probabilistic information moreover representation
independence incompatible even simplest default assumption independence
even told nothing propositions p q representation independence
allow us jump conclusion p q independent
suggest want inference procedures capable jumping
nontrivial conclusions must accept least degree representation de

pendence add support claim choice language carry great

positive note use intuition choice language
carries information get limited forms representation independence idea
language put constraints counts appropriate representation
shift example suppose certain propositions represent colors others represent
birds may willing transform colorful red blue green may
willing transform red sparrow reason demand inference procedure behave way suddenly shift wildly inappropriate representation
symbols mean something completely different provide general
constructing inference procedures invariant specific class representation

probabilistic inference
begin defining probabilistic inference procedures discussed introduction
two quite different ways term used one given prior
distribution probability space knowledge typically consists events
space used condition distribution obtain posterior
focus work probabilistic inference procedure takes input
probabilistic knowledge base returns probabilistic conclusion
take knowledge base conclusion assertions probabilities events measurable space x fx measurable space consists
set x algebra fx subsets x fx set subsets x closed
union complementation containing x formally assertions viewed
statements constraints probability measures x fx example
x infinite may want consider countably additive probability measures take fx
closed countable unions issue play significant role simplicity
restrict finite additivity require fx closed finite unions

fx statement pr holds distributions probability
least therefore x fx set probability measures x fx
probability measures domain fx view knowledge base set
constraints x fx fx clear context often omit notation
writing x rather x fx
place restrictions language used express constraints
assume includes assertions form pr subsets fx rational
closed conjunction negation kb kb
knowledge bases expressing constraints kb kb kb however
langauge could include many assertions besides obtained starting assertions
form pr closing conjunction negation since language
puts constraints probability measures cannot directly say fx must hold
closest approximation language assertion pr thus call
constraints objective knowledge base consisting objective constraints called
objective knowledge base since pr pr equivalent pr
without loss generality objective knowledge base consists single constraint
form pr given knowledge base kb placing constraints x write kb
measure x satisfies constraints kb use kb x denote
measures satisfying constraints
practice knowledge typically represented syntactically logical language describe possible states typical languages include propositional logic firstorder logic language describing values set random variables general
base logic l defines set formulas l given vocabulary propositional
logic vocabulary simply set propositional symbols probability theory
vocabulary consist set random variables first order logic vocabulary
set constant symbols function symbols predicate symbols facilitate comparison
vocabularies assume base logic vocabularies finite
subsets one fixed infinite vocabulary
working language assume state state space defines
interpretation symbols hence formulas l case
propositional logic thus assume associate state truth assignment
primitive propositions first order logic assume associate
state domain interpretation symbols probabilistic
setting assume associate state assignment values
random variables often convenient assume state space fact
subset w w set interpretations assignments vocabulary
note truth formula l determined state true
state w write w
probabilistic extension lpr base logic l simply set probability
formulas l formally l pr numeric term formulas
lpr defined boolean combinations arithmetic expressions involving
numeric terms example pr fly bird formula lpr fly bird
interpret conditional probability expression pr pr pr
multiply clear denominator analogy constraints formula form
pr called objective formula

say kb whether syntactic semantic consistent kb x e
constraints satisfiable finally say kb entails another set
constraints x written kb x kb x x e every measure satisfies
kb satisfies write x satisfied every measure x omit

entailment well known weak method drawing conclusions
knowledge base particular respect treatment irrelevant information
consider knowledge base consisting constraint pr fly bird even
though know nothing suggest red relevant entailment allow us
reach nontrivial conclusion pr fly bird red

shift minimum must assume constraint give additional
information x far logical inference goes syntactic level use
following definition given knowledge base kb lpr say lpr
conservative kb formulas lpr kb iff kb
thus adding knowledge base permit additional logical inferences
vocabulary inference procedure robust unaffected conservative
extensions kb lpr kb iff kb

kb get conclusion q c q c f kb q x appears
positively kb case already know least one q

match intuition reasonable representation shift one might
therefore think perhaps definition even propositional

justified choice appropriate representation encodes significant information
particular encodes bias knowledge base designer world researchers
machine learning long realized bias inevitable component effective
inductive reasoning e learning evidence completely surprised
turns types leaping conclusions context depend

motion sensor might carve world differently agent color sensor
distance sensor consider two agents different sensors yet
made observations suppose talk distance tree
reasonable two agents reach different conclusions distance
different sensors thus use different vocabularies although
made observations would follow agents change
conclusions switched sensors despite made observations

bayesian probabilistic inference

standard maximum entropy arise even simple case
simply bayesian conditioning starting uniform prior space
standard bayesian statistics use invariance certain transformations order define appropriate uninformed prior example might
want prior images invariant rotation translation certain cases

objective information observations bayesian uninformed

conclusions
