summary
investigated series key issues relating text geolocation prediction
twitter users applied number feature selection methods identify location indicative
words liws demonstrated effectiveness feature selection regional na
global world datasets extended study analyse impact non geotagged data
influence language complementary geographical information user metadata
evaluated model time heterogeneous dataset assess sensitivity
temporal change moreover discussed users tweeting behaviour affects geolocation
prediction drew conclusions users make less easily geolocatable finally
explored indicators estimate prediction confidence terms balance
prediction coverage accuracy
number conclusions drawn study corresponding different sections
believe findings contribute deeper understanding text geolocation
prediction shape design practical solutions
demonstrate explicit selection location indicative words improves geolocation prediction accuracy compared full feature set
non geotagged tweets users whose location known boost prediction accuracy
substantially training testing demonstrate modeling geotagged
data inferencing non geotagged data indeed feasible largely
similarity geotagged data non geotagged data although minor differences
observed geotagged non geotagged tweets
modelling inference multilingual data viable easier monolingual english data tweet language strongly affects prediction accuracy due
uneven geographical distribution languages tweets users geographically diverse languages e g english spanish much harder geolocate users geographicallyfocused languages e g japanese dutch although trivially determining locations
language tweets fine geographically focused languages insufficient
majority users post tweets geographically diverse languages integrating
language information different ways found training range monolingual
language identification predicting location model users
primary language achieves better monolithic multilingual model
user declared metadata though noisy unstructured offers complementary location indicative information contained tweets combining tweet metadata information stacking best global geolocation attained english
users correctly predicted city level median error distance km
time heterogeneous evaluation suggest applying model trained old data
predict data generally feasible although user declared location field loc
sensitive temporal change classifiers tweet content text user timezone
tz generalise reasonably well across time
pilot study user geolocatability led following recommendations preserve
geolocation privacy reduce usage location indicative words particularly gazetted
