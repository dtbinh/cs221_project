abstract
recent years task automatically linking pieces text anchors mentioned
document wikipedia articles represent meaning anchors received
extensive attention typically link wikipedia systems try set
wikipedia articles candidates represent meaning anchor later
rank candidates select appropriate one ranking process
systems rely context information obtained document anchor
mentioned wikipedia center attention use
wikipedia links context information particular offer review several candidate
ranking approaches state art rely wikipedia link information
addition provide comparative empirical evaluation different approaches
five different corpora tac corpus four corpora built actual wikipedia

henceforth simply refer link wikipedia general task discovering
links wikipedia includes wikification named entity linking particular
cases
according erbs et al task discovering links divided series
steps include identifying anchors linked searching candidate link

usually involves creating ranking candidates choose one highest

et al article adopt term candidate ranking
order select best wikipedia article link given anchor candidate
ranking process relies context information provided set features
features extracted document anchor placed context document
different wikipedia articles considered candidates become link target

given ample variety link features candidate ranking described
state art comparative analysis different alternatives useful decide
approaches considered designing link wikipedia

evaluation involves ranking stage candidate searching
candidate selection processes thus impact performance different system
components mixed second general link wikipedia systems rely
link features rank candidates combine features
types thus effects different contributions ranking process mixed


fievaluation link approaches candidate ranking link wikipedia

taking account main goals twofold offer overview
link approaches candidate ranking link wikipedia systems perform
empirical evaluation compare approaches order address aforementioned difficulties focus analysis candidate ranking stage isolating
much possible candidate search selection stages consider linkbased features combined text titles similar comparison
knowledge authors available time writing
rest organized follows section presents definitions
formal description addressed section outlines different linkbased approaches compared section describes setup empirical evaluation
carried well section offers overview related work
finally section closes concluding remarks future lines work

definitions formalization

wikipedia links thus consider wikipedia articles members f

taking account aforementioned definitions candidate ranking process
addressed context may formalized follows

overview approaches
describe different candidate ranking approaches evaluated
common source context information links
particular links considered available context document dc well
constitute link structure wikipedia including links
candidate wikipedia articles ci c dc
however approaches considered use link information
manner particular classify two families name bag oflinks approaches graph approaches main difference
second group links used build graph structure later analyzed
select best candidate case approaches first group
bag links approaches
section present set approaches characteristic common
rely building graph link context information rank candidates
nevertheless approaches family differences way address
task particular distinguish least three alternative groups
approaches rely similarity metrics compute similarity score
context document candidate later select candidate
highest score similar one
another alternative rely popularity metrics simply try compute
popularity score candidate popular candidate selected
approaches rely information provided context document
ranking process modeled statistical statistical methods
used select likely candidate given context information
accordance classification following sections describe group approaches
similarity metrics
first similarity metrics consider relatedness computed basis
wikipedia link measure milne witten relatedness used feature


fievaluation link approaches candidate ranking link wikipedia

link wikipedia approaches milne witten b han zhao
kulkarni et al pilz fahrni et al han et al ratinov
et al
basically relatedness allows compute similarity two wikipedia documents wi wj links common original definition milne
witten computed
rb wi wj

log max b wi b wj log b wi b wj
log w log min b wi b wj



according milne witten relatedness metrics normalized google distance ngd defined cilibrasi vitanyi ngd
intuition terms similar related meaning co occur frequently
documents thus given pair terms google search engine used obtain
mention terms mention indicate relatedness
one suggest unrelatedness indicated milne witten
relatedness metrics defined equation shares inspiring principle uses wikipedia links instead google search account mentions
distance metrics relatedness values expected smaller similar
wikipedia articles however easy transform distance metrics
similarity metrics following gracia mena requires
computation
simrb wi wj e rb wi wj



second similarity metrics wikipedia articles considered
computing pointwise mutual information pmi sets links articles

another well known compute document similarity within natural language processing information retrieval communities cosine similarity basically
vector built represent context document candidate article similarity context document candidate computed cosine
angle respective vectors several approaches state art bunescu
pasca fader soderland etzioni nguyen cao fahrni et al
ploch et al ratinov et al use cosine similarity however
differences features used build vector representations
documents
case requirement considering solely links context information
thus document represented links mentioned
document similar model documents compute cosine similarity
used instance fahrni et al ploch et al
particular document represented vector vd r w component
vd w vector vd computed traditional term frequency

graph approaches
second family link approaches candidate ranking consider graph
approaches rely building graph processing select best candidate
pagerank personalized pagerank
first consider within graph family pagerank first defined
