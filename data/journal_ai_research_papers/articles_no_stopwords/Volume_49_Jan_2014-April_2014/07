monetary compensation focusing agents declarations allocated goods verified payments performed setting considered
verification might subject errors payments awarded presumption innocence incorrect declared values necessarily mean manipulation
attempts agents within setting mechanism designed shown
truthful efficient budget balanced moreover agents utilities fairly determined
shapley value suitable coalitional games enjoy highly desirable properties
equal treatment equals envy freeness stronger one called individual optimality
particular latter property guarantees every agent utility
maximum possible one alternative optimal allocation
computational complexity proposed mechanism studied turns

two polynomial time randomized variants proposed one still truthful
efficient approximately budget balanced high probability another
one truthful expectation still budget balanced efficient

wireless communication networks underlying bandwidth allocation
instance design protocols high speed wide area wireless networks
role monetary compensation played adjustments priorities users see
e g jalali padovani pankaj moreover number network applications
emerging direct forms monetary compensation considered
example let us consider ad hoc networks self organizing wireless infrastructures mobile nodes cooperatively act via multi hop routing transmit data even
source destination nodes transmission ranges cooperation
achieved associating credit balance node nodes use credits pay
sending traffic earn credits forwarding traffic nodes compensate bandwidth power consumptionsee instance work gobel krzesinski
mandjes references therein consider setting nodes sn
willing transmit data ad hoc network given configuration
network nodes r rm used forward data particular whenever
si rj n j within transmission ranges
denote ci j credit paid si transfer data via rj large enough value ci j
used state transmission possible resulting cost
modeled via allocation scenario valuation vector
wi rj ci j n j thus maximizing social
welfare amounts minimizing overall credits paid source nodes
easily seen even private information everything public
fairness issues emerge context indeed different sources may want use
routing node transfer data instance simple setting
n r preferred routing node e c c
c c node forced transfer data via r might perceive
given allocation unfair suggests credits paid source nodes
adjusted via payment rules proposal shapley value
