ficlosure consistency logic associated argumentation

general condition closure contraposition creates attack
defeasible argument inconsistency aspic systems words systems happen contain knowledge several causally independent domains
flying penguins hair colour thais closure contraposition interlink
making necessary resolve possible inconsistencies parts systems able answer query independent whether inconsistencies
causally related query
contrast argument systems attack
admissible controversy flying capabilities penguins effect
acceptance
though closure transposition avoids conflict propagation
adopted many well known practical systems indiscriminate application
could lead counter intuitive many cases example consider simplified
version example birds fly penguins dont aspic whose set strict rules
closure transposition following strict rules
app b f

p f

p app

app ordinary premise app app
therefore rule app p included set strict rules
suppose knowledge base consists ordinary premise app stating
default birds fly applicable
without information two arguments app b
p
accepting ordinary premise app simply says information
default birds fly applied say anything penguin closure
transposition implies definitely penguin around rather slippery way
make conclusion
context logic programming rule app p rather unnatural app
viewed assumption explicit negation operator whose intuitive reading
explicit negation assertion hard evidence
another assumption gelfond lifschitz
contrast aspic systems much done study logical
closure consistency semantics well known widely applied systems
logic programming assumption argumentation gelfond lifschitz
lifschitz bondarenko dung kowalski toni properties closure
transposition contraposition embraced logic programming assumption
argumentation prakken observed assumption argumentation yields
unintuitive argument unwanted conclusion inference rules satisfy transposition property hence natural ask
whether conditions implied conditions closure contraposition transposition still guaranteeing important properties logical closure
consistency
pollock wu pointed classical propositional proof systems propagate
conflicts throughout knowledge bases unrelated parts

given abstract logic cn con ra x closed iff x cn x set x

proper subset x consistent
definition say abstract logic satisfies
strong absurdity axiom con ra x con ra cn x l

follows immediately abstract logic tarski abstract logic satisfies
strong absurdity axiom x l x inconsistent
example let rs wr go b hw hw set strict rules
l language consisting literals whose atoms occur rules rs define
al cn con ra follows
x con ra iff x contains pair literals l l
cn consequence operator defined rs
illustration cn wr go cn wr go hw cn b
wr go hw b hw hence set b inconsistent contradictory
difficult see al abstract logic cn hw hw
hw hw follows al satisfy strong absurdity axiom
note con ra could empty case definite logic programs l consists
positive literals nonetheless con ra l con ra
words set sentences x inconsistent contradiction could derived though
contradiction may present directly x e inconsistent set may contradictory
proper subset x subset x x
tarskian one abstract logic needs satisfy absurdity coherence x
inconsistent cn x contradictory since strong absurdity satisfied cn cn x l
idempotence cn cn x cn x hence cn x l coherence holds
weak coherence axiom abstract logic cn con ra due strong absurdity
con ra due weak absurdity fact con ra follows l

let set arguments af argument af holds
acceptable wrt iff acceptable wrt core
let set arguments af admissible iff core admissible
proof
since core acceptable wrt core obviously acceptable wrt
suppose acceptable wrt let b attack hence
attacks b therefore assumption hence core b hence
attacked core e acceptable core
follows immediately previous assertion
lemma let e e complete extensions af holds
e e iff core e core e
proof need core e core e implies e e reverse
direction obvious let core e core e let e hence
assumption acceptable wrt e lemma acceptable wrt thus acceptable
wrt e lemma hence e similarly could assumption e
belongs e thus proved e e
lemma let b ar ar following observations hold

c one one mapping ar onto ar

b att iff c c b att

acceptable wrt iff c acceptable wrt c
proof
first assertion obvious
obvious argument ar c
viewing argument ar proof tree height tree defined
length e number links longest path root leaf let ar k
set trees height k ar prove induction c one one
ar k
obvious c one one ar suppose c one one ar k let b
two different arguments ar k last rules b different
obvious c c b different suppose last rules b identical
b respectively forms h b bn h
without loss generality assume b hence induction
hypothesis c c b therefore c c b
straightforward prove induction b ar
ar c b
suppose b att let b basic defeasible subargument b
attacks b b two cases
cnl oj lr b undercut attack cnl cnl c
follows cnl c oj lr b oj lr b supp c b c
hence attacks c b wrt att
ii cnl h h cnl b hence cnl c h h
supp c b c hence attacks c b wrt att
b suppose c c b att two cases
cnl c oj r defeasible rule r oj r supp c b
cnl cnl c follows cnl oj r r defeasible
rule b hence basic defeasible subargument b b
lr b r hence attacks b b af
ii cnl c h h supp b hence basic defeasible
rule r b hd r h therefore subargument b b
lr b r hence attacks b b rebutting af
assertion clear conflict free iff c conflict free
suppose defends attacks let attack c af therefore
assumption second assertion b c assertion
follows b attacks therefore attacks b hence c attacks


ficlosure consistency logic associated argumentation

suppose c defends attacks let attack af let b c
assertion follows b attacks c therefore c attacks b hence attacks

follows immediately assertion
theorem complete extensions e af complete extension e
af vice versa following properties hold
c e core e
literal l l l cnl e iff l cnl e
proof let e complete extension af assertion lemma follows
c e admissible let set assumptions acceptable wrt
e complete let b af acceptable wrt e suppose b
assumption let c b lemma assertion acceptable wrt e hence
e therefore b b assumption b proved e
complete core e c e uniqueness e follows directly lemma
let l l l cnl e since l clear l cnl core e hence
l cnl c e first assertion lemma follows l cnl e
