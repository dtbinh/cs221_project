motivation
resolution emission tomography pet biological
malignant tumors screening pet imaging
injected molecule serves contrast

analog sugar glucose rapidly
atom undergoes decay creates photons simultaneously
travel opposite directions photons decay picked
detectors decay assumed occurred joining
detectors lines join
detected photon accumulate
solving mathematical inverse
contrast reconstructed intersection
lines bright spots doctors
tumors located call photon
purpose illustration




arises photon misidentified leading
placed incorrect detector cause
detector efficiency
decay meaning photons
originated decays detected
leading tumor contrast
call misidentified pairings
