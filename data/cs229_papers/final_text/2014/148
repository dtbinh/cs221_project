ntroduction

motivation
lane departure warning ldw designed
warn driver vehicle leaves
lane arterial roads seek
driver safety addressing causes
road incidents collisions namely
portion
car manufacturers ford toyota
started incorporating ldw vehicles
biggest limitation
inability track incorrect lane markings
seek address limitation developing ldw
rely
lane markings presence leading vehicle
reliably detects lane departures inferring
vehicle surroundings tracking
weak

optical flow road view
aim interval
straight vehicle
lane deviate vehicle leaving lane
