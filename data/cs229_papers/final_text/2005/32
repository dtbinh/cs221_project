synthetic grasping
orientation monocular
steve chuang eric


determining orientation established
pose designed approximate facial positions
tracking leverage consecutive
slight extracting affine transformations
particularly buildings employs
explicit structural
aim robotic arm grasping viewed mounted
generalize monocular
extends monocular cues filters ashutosh
addresses sub robotic arm grasping


focuses angular robotic
arm grasp
contact cup handle cap constrain
angles opposed roll yaw simplicity
evaluates synthetic
place motivation generating
potentially considerably

graphics tools cups handles regular
discuss tool generating synthetic
cup briefly introduce
details
discusses
conclude readily avenues

generating synthetic
comes princeton benchmark instances
cups meshes loaded blender tool
generating synthetic blender supports scripts manipulating
blender smooth shading blender
texture anti aliasing ray tracing script rotate
record rotation angles unable properly access blender ds projection
grasp ad hoc
sphere located script spot record
grasp rotation coordinates
synthetic passed argument cup
distinct rotation
