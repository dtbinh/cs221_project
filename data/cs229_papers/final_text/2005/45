california irvine repository

purpose
norms
strategies investigate
notation
minimized


fraction flipped

subgradient
motivation
differentiable usual oscillate
overcome modify rule

rule

usual

dont




vary sqrt boyd advantage
slowly decreases stable ie converges doesnt oscillate
disadvantage guess
reach diminishes

nonlinear conjugate newton raphson
huber
motivation huber
huber approximates desirable property
differentiable everywhere unlike quadratic origin
differentiable behaves
residuals
residues heavily penalize
residuals residuals
doesnt driving residuals leaving residues
