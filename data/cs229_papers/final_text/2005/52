ptr pl



pr pl refer coordinates matches
ransac iteratively computes
matches evaluates matches agree eight
construct fits ransac evaluates
applies ransac stores details candidate
terminates sure matches outliers
outlier picked fraction matches deemed inliers candidate
ransac classifies correlations inliers outliers discard outlying matches
ransac ignores angular deviations
matches coordinates checks
afterwards avoid costs iterative ransac
assumes rotation streams
angular rotations concerned primarily nearby leads faster
consistent ransac
