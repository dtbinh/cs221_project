difficulty dealing soft tissue

deduced soft tissue
block prostate rarely moves
central portion slice prostate
rarely inside organ kidney falsely


typical prostate contour
middle organ round centered
decently contour
surrounding soft tissue

fion detecting prostate
processed
detected thin middle portion missed
produces scattering detections


promising
encompasses slices prostate tens hundreds
generalize
selectively slices scan
representative shapes slices
faster chunk
ct slice broken sized blocks

attempting identifiable
prostate rely incorporating
divide soft tissue remains
