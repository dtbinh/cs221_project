joint compliances gaits varied indicating

joint compliances converged
simulations piston compliances front hip converged
spring damping enables leg
push strongly providing greatest upwards forwards
joint compliances converged reasonably simulations

hip angles varied widely
surprising hip angle
laboratory isprawl gait simulated executing hip angles


fithe varied

conclusions
assessment
hill climbing coordinate ascent converging rewards
gaits benefit
partially setup robustness trials tended converge
rewards bad qualitative gaits
revealed tended exhibit tendency bounding motions
seemed converge
gaits varied greatly gaits
