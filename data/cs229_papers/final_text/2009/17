configurations resolution
ashish kulkarni


motivation
advances technology interact computers
touch screens accelerometers
extension trend enable interaction gestures
movements tackle sub detecting
configurations resolution naturally configuration
configurations detected gestures
technology widespread sign interpretation
interaction


swissranger generation flight

configurations
simplify focused poses opened
closed hands allowed variations
