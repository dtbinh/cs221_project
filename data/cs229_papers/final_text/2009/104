finger touching occurs elastic hysteresis property
skin fingertip skin outer covering finger transfers external forces
underlying sensors finger elastic
skin causes hysteresis force loaded
finger elastic hysteresis
deformation skin consistent loading
unloading force material force deform

fingertip proved spent
easier force feedback sensors relies heavily finger
finger skin optimized easier
solutions touch slippage grasping

expose sensors skin outside forces directed
underlying force sensors surface contact maximized

keep sensors finger elastic
