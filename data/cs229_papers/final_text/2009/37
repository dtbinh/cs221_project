brute force
initially thought brute force
tokenization
brute force permutations breaks
guaranteed indeed
providing perfect scoring
impractical



turns ties
shorter


initially phrases
unreasonable
exponential permutations
wholly impossible hardware
generating possibilities
exponentially
solutions
analyzed
proved confirmed
longer exceedingly rare
longer pass
brute force
partition leave subsequence
unfortunately alone
tractable
enumerate
permutations exponential
