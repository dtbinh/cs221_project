phasespace

hardware phasespace cameras mounted
sides stair attached led pulses uniquely identifiable phasespace cameras cameras chained
communicate phasespace ethernet stair
needs ethernet cable trail remain
onboard stair allowing autonomy
phasespace cameras documentation claims sub experience claim truth
truth persons stairs
phasespace triangulation calculations automatically
meters extensive
ill suited restrictive setup closely spaced led went
meters beyond cameras returned
triangulation layered
phasespace api access
detectors tuples
immediately obvious triangulation
locally tuple
phasespace ordered
soon studying
cameras worked discovered reverse engineering setup allowed
analytic detector

navigation

think handful pose

moves stair toward quickly safe
operation constraint safe operation obstacle avoidance
consideration dynamics
algorithmic executing velocity commands dynamic meets
constraints exists

circular trajectories mathematical choosing



velocities velocity choosing velocity
obstacle resultant
velocities dynamic velocity dynamic immediately accessible velocities torque restrictions

specified angle immediately

feel explain exact

preliminary concrete chunk
early quarter finished milestone elected
navigation stack stair fairly dramatic shift
message api going
seemed worthwhile nav stack entirely
dependable seemed obsolete
practice turned discovered wanting
experience debugging hardware dependent
bulk quarter lend odometry
laser updated hood
bugs longer deterministically fails port bundle
configuration stair interacts nav stack
bugs navigation really likes walls
novel pieces



stages



briefly

recently october
reproducing detail
meters phasespace cm
reliable horizontal view degrees
expanding degrees
disappointingly navigation reliable
execution stair walls gates presently stair maintain particle persons pose

specified plan avoids laser hit obstacles
dwa thats presently bit difficulty
