presents enhance slide alignment
presentations solely intended
handle wide videos
slide coupled alignment vanilla
sift keypoint matches
slide proves partial occlusion moderately tolerant lighting
empirical demonstrate diverse
handle ambiguous videos
constrained videos slide view zoom
mostly stationary expanded videos


internet allowed wide recordings live slide presentations
wider audience watching experience suffers
compression slides critical presentation
commonly completely authors aware
slides come automated aligning slides
proper alignments viewing experience providing
synchronized display digital format slides watching
alignment implications retrieval allowing videos internally indexed
slides displayed
align videos slides
slide detects
sift leverage presentations mostly monotonic
jumps slide slide construct
slide transitions induce
combine determining
sift keypoints alignment
slides partial occlusion slides perhaps caused avoids
bounding tricky
