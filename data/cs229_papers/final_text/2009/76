buying selling block security followed unfavorable
block execution causes abrupt imbalance supply
demand convey investors fundamental
security reflected investment decisions submitting orders

propose execution transaction incurred
buying selling block incomplete
indeed practice execution strikes balance
exploration exploitation needs unknown
decisions exchange losing optimality

necessarily uncertainty
precisely formulated dynamic uncertainty challenging bellman
mainly incorporating
difficulty comes spaces
practical horizon finite say seek propose reasonably heuristic captures balance exploration exploitation
upper bound
relaxation propose linearized squares
squares dealing efficiently nonlinear
