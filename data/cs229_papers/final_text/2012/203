static processes
bharath






xt evolving perhaps nonlinearly
observe yt parameterized
typically unknown yt
critical gaining processes
nonlinear processes arise situations
evolution volatility
track nonlinear evolution xt typically solved sequential monte
carlo smc particle
monte carlo particle encounter difficulties
unknown
consequently focusing
researchers econometrics introduced particle mcmc
mixes chain monte carlo mcmc sequential monte
carlo unfortunately tend slow
require quadratic
introduce learns inference
namely modify decayed mcmc static
empirical showing robustness handling static
prove preliminary correctness
