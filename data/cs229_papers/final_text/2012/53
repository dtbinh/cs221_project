discs introduced
addresses variant subspaces discs
recovery manifolds samplings kernelization discs exhibited



advantages demonstrated synthetic kernelized

motivation


connected underlying suppose
sampled smooth potentially
rn wishes recover underlying
arguably fundamental aspect characterization connected
manifold manifested unfortunately
expectation maximization fail properly characterize shapes
succeeds circumstances separable
ordinary characterization fails
drawn elongated subsets
subspaces variant seeks
subspaces kernelization subspaces achieves drawn
nonlinear
extent awkward subspaces
diculty bounded drawn subspace

heuristic initializing centroids discs proper

expensive subspaces recovered

depends greatly
initialization procedures initialization heuristic
enhance special landmark
landmark adds landmark repeatedly
adds maximal landmark
centers evenly spaced initialization sometimes

repeated initialization preferable
