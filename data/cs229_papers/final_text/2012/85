semiconductor manufacturing prone issues
chips proportion systematic defects manifest spatial signatures
failing chips silicon wafers systematic spatial indicative defects
tracked primary challenges failure signatures wafers presence
systematic failure mechanisms wafer presence defects
chips fail amounts
automatically track spatial systematic failure

manufacturing semiconductor wafers numerous chemical mechanical
finished wafer cut chips
susceptible variations tool recipe issues render affected chips useless
early generation defects systematic
systematic wafer signature failing dies wafer systematic
chips fail outer wafer processed wafer hundred
signatures exist wafer quickly
signature affects wafers resources focused addressing biggest yield
tracking spatial signatures thousands wafers

looked ranging quantifying
serve purposes takeaways

lr worked indicated

hotspot eventually
garnered theta

converges weighs hotspot chip
surrounding die immediately surrounding chips hotspot fail

excellent
iterates classifies

worth noting
minimal drastic reflected

neighbor
lr weigh chips tends weigh
equally wash failure think
addressed require custom signature
gaussians none effectively clustered
predictable month
uninteresting feel largely unweighted affected
radial zone encoding justify deeper

encoding schemes
encodings
surprisingly adaptive encoding outperformed zone encoding
smallest adaptive encoding worked signatures
achievable tuned
pick confidence vary
fortunately sqm alleviate
sub sqm
unlabeled stable predictable vote confidence
encoding wafer outperformed zone
