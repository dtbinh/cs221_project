interact wearing special glove
motions interpreted
hardware commodity
webcam motions analyzed

gesture received great deal
attention
mobile technology gaming realtime imaging technologies

gesture explored
researchers minority
interaction becoming somewhat
feasible wearable projector

finger recognizing fingertips
simplified extracting colored blobs


fingertips
track gestures accomplish

gesture devices hope proprietary
eventually adopt
