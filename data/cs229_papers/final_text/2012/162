jazz melody generation
joseph victor



jazz solos
jazz simplicity
diversity solos typical jazz followed
musician turn melody chord chord
constrain choices soloist guide melodic evolution
solos abstractly jazz musician reads chord
deterministically outputs melody
obvious computationally
generation jazz musician solo
guess chord inspired
admittedly musicians beat
soloist
accompaniment hear jazz
soloist isnt playing anything wild hope statistically hear
toe
philosophy fine bunch reasonably structured jazz melodies
format chop bunch melody snippet pairings analyze
chain
solutions


accumulation
educational websites offer free pdf transcriptions jazz
solos great recordings famous artists easy write scripts grab jazz
pdfs said websites pdf
pro reads pdfs nice sheet outputs parse
format tell pro getting
getting rhythms
fix half began
thrown formats simplicity
systematic issues rhythms


drastic simplification reality melody influenced
choices musicians responding soloist soloist
soul



automatically pass sanity checks fixes
eventually thrown frustrating eventually got
believed
harmonic chords
impossible pro reliably chord
chord came ralph vanilla book
comprehensive ascii chord progressions famous jazz
minutes worth semi manual solo transcriptions issues things solos starting
transcribed luckily
chord matched beginning
worth
consisted lists chord lists
solos came

definitions
notevalue bb octave
integer duration integer notevalue modality chord
modalities denoted minor dim augmented altered
extensions modalities
differentiate chord chord
dominant chord chord chord duration integer records
beats chord played notevalue modality chord played
triple bb interval
inclusive
matters subtract interval interval
notevalue chord notevalue chord datapoint
chords played melody solo
phrases interchangeably detail
datapoint musical datapoint ranges phrases
beats

normalization
say musician plays say chord transposed bit
played chord logic learns
chord progression shift progression shouldnt throw
chords fix notevalue
intervals chords
say datapoint
think multiplying transposed chord
progressions seeing say seeing
seeing cm


trying theory think attribute


story great musician charlie parker coming jam session
bb leader saying throw young musician



chords chords held lengths depends
finely chop

chains solo generation
chains convincing sounding jazz solos pretty
chord progression say chord
beats advance picking beat
consistent chord somewhat
easy stuck insert
beats thing sound convincing
underlying chord progression detectable unfortunately
quantifying worked
felt midi playback sounded
choices opinion sounding
got lost
simplest scientific certainly
entertaining fun possibly biggest

melodies
musical phrase divided
beats beat eighth perhaps triplets storing solo phrase whatever detail desired format easy details
phrase half phrase half beat
twice edit
shortest deletions insertions
assign insertions deletions
depend operated
edit hopes reasonably tell
solos hope solos coming progression snippets solos
coming progressions edit distances
thing say edits detail
edit distances datapoint
detail chord datapoint failed
pretty drastically detail hope
solos coming chord progression happen
smallest kth neighbor datapoint came
chord progression except beat detail
datapoints
thing modifying intuitively
played somehow insertions deletions
choices inserting deleting eighth
quarter half half unfortunately
wanted changing
edit
effectively
choices matter abandoned




trying say things didnt
ask chord chords inspired
details quarter twice
eighth
buckets say spam
things trying chord progressions

melodies luckily everything ended
tractable
pick detail chop normalize
mini chord progression laplace smoothing
assigning duration figuring
bit discuss apparent
priors divided datapoint transposed
keys explicitly datapoint
interestingly harmonically
harmonically half phrases harmonically half phrases
harmonically beats half

snippet solo sums duration notevalue
chord progression
intervals
say options
fourth answer surprising jazz
musicians things chord substitutions solos intentionally
imply wrong chords wrong chords

thing

buy bunch
duration big reasons unknown
quarter duration seeing played quarter
decisions forming matter
needs
raised occurrences nice
acted regular internally never
think changing multiplication multiplication

think six thousand
buy spam
spam regardless priors divide exponent
duration eighth eighth
quarter choices somehow triplet
thirds sixteenth half
logical wasnt bad
leave subtracting entries retraining datapoints



answer divided possibilities ranked progression
detail ranked answer rankings
phrase half phrase half beat beat think
particularly confusing guess
misclassified datapoints fewer
happen say soloist resting except
beat pickup


thing chord progression
late
chain except

transitioning observable emitted
depending goes
things
solo guess
solo progression
hmm chord progression beats observables
emitted beats worth came
chord progressions
solo pieces normalization
covering assumed beat
depended harmony beats
hmms
observables

meant unable hmm libraries

straightforward wikipedias pseudo remarkably
leave viterbi spot
phrase completely
chords viterbi
leave smart retrain
thing
think
confusing
