toward automating legal
editing
blake



drafting legal experienced lawyers careful nuanced reasoning nonetheless
drafting intensive delay consequence
law firms hire employees assist bureau
labor released workers legal services roles
legal assistants workers paid bn annually
starting reducing spent editing
writing reviewing legal reach challenges
understood subsequently addressed comprehend legal
reflect lawyers recommended edits

objectives
initially evaluates automate editing legal scope
narrowed analyzing legal edits
legal agreements ndas agreements ndas
private contract participants sensitive routinely exchanged
companies transactions company sale
require buyers sign nda providing financial statements public
edits consist participants requests
inserted deleted nda reviewing participants requested
reflect negotiation parties duration agreement employees
restrictions buying limitations sharing meaning fixing
typos wording
ideal automating editing modify party reflect
preferred legal maintaining integrity writing proper
grammar consistent eliminate editing lawyers today
feasible simpler
edited nda come nda party requested insertions
deletions party reverse engineer edits
ideal edited benefit seeing
conversely ideal suggest

legal gauges complexities
ideal highlighting difficulties unbalanced
