preliminaries

sender encodes message specified trajectory trajectory message
priori trajectory codebook sender receiver sender intends send message
trajectory trajectory codebook
senders trajectory necessarily directed receiver sender
bring ambiguity message decoding depending trajectory codebook receivers monocular
unable robots
trajectory decode message receiver allowed sequentially
sender observe repeating trajectories leads sequential
