motivation
automated aircraft landing typically employed commercial flights routinely operate
airports visibility designed
conjunction instrument landing radio
navigation aircraft guidance
runway hardware installed runway typically costs
tens millions dollars install cat

instrumentation installed ga aircraft improving rapidly
largely moore law gps receivers wide augmentation
ubiquitous glass typically composed bright screens
awareness offered aircraft
render simulated views outside terrain highway sky style
navigational overlays fairly inertial measurement radar
cameras avoidance weather installed
piston aircraft flight management automation
advantage instruments crucial role ga aircraft

fairly auto lander enabled aircraft follow
shallow touchdown reality dangerous obstacles
buildings towers lines terrain intersect planned
