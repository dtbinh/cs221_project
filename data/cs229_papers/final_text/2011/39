reflective markers
optical acceleration angular

joint angles
positional minimal
setup requirements inertial come appealing alternative
marker inertial
require setup viable
capturing outdoor motions

mountain biking never
traditional marker
sound inertial
big disadvantage unlike marker
inertial lacks absolute positional
relies heavily integrating acceleration
angular velocity
absolute
approximation integration
quickly becomes
inaccurate passes
