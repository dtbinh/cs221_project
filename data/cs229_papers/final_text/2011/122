water resources managers benefit availability groundwater
groundwater shallow
basin jasper ridge biological preserve ie
weather lake stream flow moving averages
weather stream flow month months
six months moving averages
summer groundwater contrast feed delay
winter groundwater
groundwater throughout
longer moving averages seasonality


motivation
california groundwater follow sinusoidal winter
summer perfect mass balance groundwater
storage practically mass
precipitation stream
lake subsurface flows bring mass water evapotranspiration
discharge streams subsurface flows mass water
storage
groundwater groundwater elevation
stored depending geometry
subsurface water flows typically require hydrologic basin conductivity porosity
soil water flow subsurface empirically thorough subsurface
hydrologic conductivity porosity soil

groundwater explicit soil
basin
implicitly soil basin basin soil
