proof helper addresses education automated assistance
proofs hints student ideally
wed student judged sufficiently confused
service collect submission histories predictors
reliably
examined examine analyze guess






scalability facing todays education
education evaluating assisting
concepts office hours guidance
traditional classroom education enabling
assistance crucial improving scalability
education ultimately capable teaching anyone
interested
launch courses stanfords
relying videos teach
remain
easy today educational experience
verify truly understand material guidance solving
teach guidance come
automated tool
proof helper progress fulfill allowing
enter proofs formalized providing automated verification proofs
interaction student knowledgeable entity
ultimately proof helper student hint
kind hint student address
formulating student confused
submission





languages allowed
formal proofs efforts occupy proof helper unlike


proof helper primary purpose
mechanism specifying proofs student
automated

conducting

collecting pilot roadblocks proof helper
encounter



pilot

participated pilot feedback tool revealing bugs
assignments parser crucial lesson individuals
seeing proof helper writing proofs
recorded tutorial walking proof difficulty
par proofs said helpful seeing begin
tutorial proof alternate tutorial proof





began pilot schedule updates proof helper
pilot late
proofs quickly accepting job

student believes proof confused repeatedly
rejects proof format conducive
sequential progress student observing repeated
