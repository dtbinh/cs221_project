terminology
planet planet star sun
definition planet kinds ambiguity mass solar
planets boundaries definition arent entirely planets resemble stars dont undergo hydrogen fusion
dim star brown somewhat arbitrarily delineated
masses neither great concern yet unable
sized worlds star mass ambiguity arise
mass discovers planets brown dwarfs
helpful distinguish eclipsing binaries
planetary transit exoplanet planets dim
bright host stars imaged
indirect exist planetary transit repeatedly checks
brightness star periodic regular dips sometimes happen exoplanet
