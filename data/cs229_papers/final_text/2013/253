accelerating triangle inequality

accelerate triangle inequality skip
unnecessary calculations distances datum centers
exactly uncertainty distances incremented
subsequent rule datum changed
distances exactly approximations introduced easy
accelerated identical accelerated substantially cheaper
pseudo alg
surprisingly think introduced
elkan subtly
treatment bounds bounds incremented
whenever moves eventually loose increment bounds
whenever moves bounds exactly prevent
becoming loose admittedly minor detail numerical tighter bounds
