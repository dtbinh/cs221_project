motivation

cooperative routing received attention wide
unmanned aerial vehicles packets communication
describes novel inspired cooperative outperforms shortest dynamic
environments
studied extensively superior static agents limitations
dynamic dependent
authors investigate taxi routing taxi originating traverse arrive destination
assumptions trivial autonomous agents taxis agents vehicles traverse
dependent autonomous agents immediate
vicinity contribution agents
static dependent interpreted
