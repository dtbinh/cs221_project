contaminant release release crucial
environmental safety monitoring homeland security industrial
accidents biological attacks urban environments immediate
contaminant release subsequent contamination assist

contaminant inversion involves intricate geometry uncertain flow
readings moreover ill conditioned readings
cause release deterministic calculations
lack robustness nearly outputs
measurement robustness
numerous simulations quickly computationally expensive
studies conducted coarsening
expansions studies uncertainty quantification
analyze propagation uncertainties combine
fluid dynamics discover release
robustness readings
chain monte carlo mcmc walker walkers
