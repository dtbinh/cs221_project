motivation
successfully wide
generative attractive
utilized partially unlabeled scenario
welcome reasons usual come
unlabeled midi mp
somewhat subtly devising reliable truth musical annotation
trivial melody
underlying chord progression preserve uncertainty
chord progressions devise
melody valid harmonic progression
devise captures piece
refer things chord progression
recognize downstream melody generation
