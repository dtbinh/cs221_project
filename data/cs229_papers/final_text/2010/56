scheduling threads core processor

advent core processors scheduling threads gone considerably
priority threads ready scheduling
core processors shared resources cache thread
core affect thread cores threads
hog cache scheduled cores
co scheduled threads hog cache situation complicated
thread bound
computationally bound threads communicate
co schedule
threads cores share cache
scheduler threads co scheduled
co scheduled threads grouped core keeping
mind thread behave differently scheduler
scenarios
rl giving feedback
say job monitoring progress core utilization
thread scheduled ready blocked
processor counters instructions retired interval
cache misses synchronization instructions failed
goals synchronization failures
brought threads core decrease aggregate
instructions execution calls auto rl


counters address tracing facility processors
cache sharing threads clustered threads
core analytical cache hierarchy cpu
hardware counters
threads schemes rl inter
communications comes closest benefit
hardware counters learnt rl
thread thread bring benefit

rl delivered opportunity

scheduling decisions affinity ideally thread os
scheduler schedule core wants os dont flexibility

bits consisting bits environment bits
keeping generalize
articulation controller hashing requirements
enable unexplored approximated hashing
bucket scheme utilizes hash tables hash
yet unknown approximated nearby
nearby affect nearby hashing
bucket whereas away hash buckets
hash tables hash extracts
bits bit come bucket hashed
tables
hashes
whereas away hash entirely
