replacement scheme

replacing batteries conservatively cause
battery failure exponentially
replacing aggressively cause
unnecessary replacement

keep failure
keeping replacement

replacement heuristics keep failure


replacement replacement

failures grow exponentially failure
batteries managed properly failure
never exceed
