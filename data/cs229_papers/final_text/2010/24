bot detecting switches

demand robots gone rising increasingly busy
offices personal homes forget switch lights
doors throw away garbage come handy kind
autonomously navigate
surroundings recognize
latter turning lights needs
switch turn lights precisely

switches come kinds lighting fluctuation angles
switch walls switches
