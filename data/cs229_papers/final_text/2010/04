efforts mobile robotic localization relied probabilistic
kalman monte carlo localization thrun rely
expensive lasers sensing
lasers thousands wifi localization
purpose inexpensive mobile robotic localization





recently efforts utilize wi purpose
localization achieving localization robots odometry expensive
laser seeks localization feasible robotic
laser
localization divided phases simultaneously maps
environment captures wireless nearby access readings
access mac strength strength utilizes laser sensors
environment robots pose
laser wifi
localization
neighbor lookups utilized poses
pose lookup closest reading
belonging
lastly environment remains
come purely wifi readings predetermined
incoming wireless scans lookup poses
monte carlo particle
