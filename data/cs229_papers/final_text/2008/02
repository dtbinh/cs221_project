negligible involves lengths
links arm
arm intensive manual

normally fairly
complicated involves gradients
involved optimize purposes
primarily numeric opted levenberg marquardt
numeric minimization repeated suited purposes
governing kinematics arm sufficiently complicated prevent easy calculation
gradients
optimizing lengths links rotation translation returned
transformation co ordinates arm prone
