experimenting algorithmic composition

algorithmic composition artificial creativity concept arguably mathematical
art existence composers processes
creative structures notable counterpoint
baroque era dictated strict rules organized writing ubiquitous
classical era supplied piece
famous musical
dice mozart rolls six sided dice sections
patched musical piece capable producing
yet composition evolved
decisions everything
dynamic markings composed
berg manual
creative composer


motivation

researchers employed artificial
manual notable david cope
musical intelligence emi emi analyze pieces
novel musical composition style
criticized manipulate great composers
aspects spontaneous rhythms harmonies timbre
articulation intra mappings musical
intend piece keys modulate
modulation act changing piece adds shifting tonal
accompanied signature structures rules
modulation vary greatly genres eras exclusion twelve tone knowing
piece written crucial establishing compositional foundation
assist overcoming issues outlined processes
algorithmic compositions

excerpt piano showing modulation











midi carry messages specify notation dynamics numerical
easier modify manipulate advantage midi compact
stored
baroque classical eras midi format loaded
fl studio checked edits wherever
separated respective voices keyboard baroque era string quartets
keyboard pieces classical era separating beyond
impose sparsity consuming harmonic lines oftentimes came
crossed ended
