motivation

bitcoin crypto currency widely valued digital currency
existence sees thousands transactions blockchain blockchain
agreed transaction ever occured continually extended
linked transaction blockchain say alice paying bob btc
transaction outputs serve sums btc sums
transaction outputs utxo remain owner bob
pay someone else referred spent
seeks remain formally
beginning transaction utxo
bitcoin creation predicts ten broad
scales utxo lifespan fall predictor inform broader
anomaly fraud trade volatility modelling
spending habit bitcoin industry worth billions dollars growing rapidly
insights financial institutions
involved
