ntroduction
unlike products electricity isnt stored
producers anticipate meet
demand peak load
outages consuming fuel
electrical generators isnt free producers
operational costs keeping generation reserve meet demand
suboptimal producing peak
electricity wasted
problematic outages occur
inadequate supply electrical forecasts essential management production
transmission forecasts
decisions realtime scheduling electricity production
plants generation
