sensory modalities despite stimuli activate overlapping peripheral receptors travel paths utilizing overlapping
neurons distinction emerges remains unclear neuroscience

overcome limitation designed whereby
purely modality stimulus animal
logic record actively involved
detecting stimuli modalities decoder distinguish

accomplish record
neurons primary cortex mice heavily implicated
fmri distinguishing tactile stimuli utilized
mice expressing whenever
neuron expressed fires glass
cortex mouse photon fluorescence microscopy observe
population neurons simultaneously recorded
neurons hz mm cortex processed
pipeline existent laboratory whereby recorded
microscope registered bodies
segmented quasi manual fluorescent neuron








calcium imaging
