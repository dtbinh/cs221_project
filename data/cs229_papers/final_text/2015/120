conclusions

come recognize faces emotions remark
emotion absent
emotion someone
tend fail geometry
keeping emotion separation emotions visible
separation geometries millions
someone resembling emotion
disappear

emotion certainly

notice great spatial pyramid
mouths mouths noses noses
facial
geometry
regards concrete recognize emotions
view environments
orientations sift
naturally suited robustness affine transformations
ultimately substantial possibility emotions
indeed facial expressions
emotion capturing facial emotion presence
finer closer intelligence
