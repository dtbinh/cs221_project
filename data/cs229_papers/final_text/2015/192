reuse attacks

exploitation malware
kinds attacks require attacker
execution historically involves injecting
vulnerability execute arm
harvard architecture
shared
introduced execute never
intel introduced execute
processors implementations
ensure never mapped
executable unless specified explicitly
os mitigates injection attacks relies execution attacker controlled
stored attackers
rely reuse programming
rop
behind rop attacker
targets executable
reuse executable
targets stack
vulnerability stack typically
store pointers
call pointer
execution caller call attacker
pointer flow anywhere executable attacker finds gadgets
instructions operation
load store jumps pointer stack inject
pointers stack execution

rop attacks powerful attackers attack rop bypass operating restrictions compromised
