motivations

originally steve gould phd student
laboratory researchers waste calibrating cameras
sensors robots kinds
cameras rst internal cameras
lenses defects
helps getting rid quadratic deformations pictures
enhance pictures
intrinsic depend cameras
environment
kind extrinsic
relate cameras outside extrinsic
positions orientations cameras
cameras extrinsic essential stereoscopic
sensitive outside engineer
calibration extrinsic
cameras moved
calibration pictures
checkerboard angles feeding
calibration toolbox eective tedious
