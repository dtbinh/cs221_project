olshausen suggest gabor bases activate
sparsely reconstruct extended
activations adapted coding
simplified shapes
caltech shapes
responses
caltech yielded projection
responses caltech
failed converge discuss reasons occurred
representations

coding
coding theory met functional neurons primary cortex

columns
coefficient activations reconstruction
reconstruction
sparseness coefficient




hierarchical coding
extracting coding
bases activations desirable property invariance
transformations rotation scaling ultimately nice hierarchical biological
coding alone unfortunately
activations coding kind
invariance activations slight transformations
activate completely bases representations
transformed mostly uncorrelated
transformation invariant

activations projection
coding transformed

fiwhere bases columns
bases projection
projections outputs reconstruction
outputs written intuitively projection
maps apart
presumably projection invariance
coding




conveniently eric xing projection
dissimilarity judgments
assigns distances judge distances
judge dissimilar
dissimilar
summarized guess
iteratively projects ensure satisfies constraints intuitively constraints
maximizing dissimilar keeping keeping
semi definite
xing




dissimilar
frobenius
semi definite convolution operator
array activations


indeed xing demonstrates
effectiveness
address projection
coupled coding yield representations lend


consisted rotations drawn
shapes circle triangle rectangle rotated increments
started easier understand
bases wanted projection
rotational invariance

shapes

bases activations bases geometric
colored
coefficient bases
closely pictures circular shapes

nd bases shapes
interestingly
dropped validated
utility coding shed usefulness
moreover responses identity
returned
hit ceiling early suggested perhaps
didnt representations
clustered turned caltech


bases bases caltech
interpret moved quantitative

nd bases caltech
responses yielded huge decrease
coding
decreased hoped
unfortunately activations caltech proved fragile
projects guess onto constraint
failed converge
guess manipulations seemed
converge properly

verified
ensure failing identity
answer initialized identity semidefinite guess
rule possibility bug
moreover
loop unable
loop
criterion guess
guess iteratively projecting satisfy constraint repeatedly failed
suitable projection simultaneously satisfying constraints

propose reasons failure
responses
optimizing indeed
xing thirty
robustness coding potentially activations
transformations
perhaps unable projections highdimensional
despite failed converge
