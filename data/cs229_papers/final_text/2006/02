motivation wanted quickly tell
exams ee exams pass fail student
answer formal exams
conducted propose formal electrical engineering
student professor professor professor examine independently
judgments professors aggregated
contrast student examined
professors meet committee
utility np determining

constraints arbitrary correlations

intuition behind construction duplicates
professors ask draw conclusions answers
individualized access
professor budget pb professors sma
sequential mechanism professor selects

budget professor independently
professors posterior pass fail

smac operation committees
professors put committee professor budget pb inside
committee
belong professors inside committee
simultaneously none committee observe
budget exhausted

stated proof motivation
sma mechanism beats smac mechanism

budget researchers
mechanism outperforms sma mechanism smac yields
utility sma yields utility
