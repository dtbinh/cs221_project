overview
rna nucleotide polymer transcribed dna thought
messenger molecule rna recognized essential wide cellular
processes transcription translation regulation rna
alignment rna
unknown coding rna genome
consequently rna alignment essential tool
understand biological evolutionary processes
rna alignment remains biologists
evolve mutations maintain nucleotide pairings
mask homology rna molecules pairings
folding simultaneous alignment structural
alignment leads alignments
conserved superiority demonstrated
simultaneously predicts rna alignment
yielding alignments downside
