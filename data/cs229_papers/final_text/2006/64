motivation

behind embedding
preserving relationships
coordinates
mutual
unable relationships exactly
matter inspired
geometry positions
incomplete inaccurate
localization molecule determination
wireless sensors communicate sensors
neighborhood received strength arrival
arrive rough positions
sensors situation molecule
ray distances
atoms molecule
