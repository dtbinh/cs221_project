fmri

fmri functional magnetic resonance imaging magnetic resonance imaging blood flow blood fmri typically highdimensional amounts
subjects fmri processed fairly
usable
started star plus fmri
carnegie mellon preprocessed
arranged manner dealing practical
snapshots half snapshots

coding

coding postulated occur portion cortex coding bases linearly reconstruct
coding come bases
reconstruction

coding finds activations
bases

hope coding fmri

typical fmri rois
someone neuroscience analyze
designate anatomical landmarks
coding hope comparable






originally wanted bases worked
subjects
subjects subjects
varied substantially subjects realized



fiin somehow normalize fmri
subjects
translate fmri slice
helped slices
calculating
bases discovered
