the ability to automatically verify and classify course related documents is of
interest to websites such as coursehero com and outlinedepot com  in particular  outlinedepot com manages more than        law school outlines that must
be manually verified and classified which cause delays and inaccuracies throughout the system  an algorithm that can automatically verify and classify law school
outlines will allow for fast information access  increased verification classification
accuracy and reduced costs  therefore  we have developed a machine learning
algorithm that can quickly and accurately verify and classify law school outlines into six major first year law courses  we investigate both supervised  nave
bayes  and unsupervised  k means  learning algorithms to validate uploaded law
school outlines  to address the classification problem  we have developed and
tested three outline classification algorithms that encompass both supervised and
unsupervised learning methodologies  multinomial nave bayes  support vector
machine  svm   and k means  we find that our nave bayes based algorithms
achieve perfect        classification and verification accuracy  however  we find
that an unsupervised approach using k means for both classification and verification provides a dramatic improvement in computational efficiency while only
sacrificing less than    in classification verification accuracy 

   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   

 

introduction

the popularity of user contributed content has allowed website like coursehero com and outlinedepot com to collect  store  and distribute course related documents to students all around the world 
these website operate in a give and take style principle where users upload documents to obtain
credits that can be used to download other course related documents  during document uploading 
the user supplies supplementary information such as  school name  professor name and course name
that the website administrators use to manually verify the document and classify it into its respective
category  only after the document has been successfully verified and classified does the user receive
his her upload credit  manual verification is a slow process that limits the users ability to access
data in a quick and efficient manner  according to courehero coms faq web page  our system
takes an estimated three days on average for documents to be accepted and credited to your course
hero account  outlinedepot com  which specializes in distributing law school outlines  states that
outlines can take as long as one week to be accepted by system administrators  a system that can automatically verify and classify these documents will improve the efficiency of these websites while
reducing operational costs 
in this paper  we develop a machine learning algorithm that can automatically verify and classify law
school outlines with high accuracy  we have focused on law school outlines in this work because of
the availability of training data  law school outlines consist of    or more pages of class notes that
are meant to provide a general overview of the important topics of the entire course  sharing outlines
are a popular way for many law students to prepare for final examinations  rapid verification and
classification will allow law students to share law school outlines without delays and will give system
administrators an accurate and cost effective tool to organize course related content  we show that

figure    block diagram of algorithm  uploaded documents are first passed to a pre processing
unit which deletes stop words  i e  with little no predictive power  and stems all words to their roots 
the verification step ensures that the integrity of the website is maintained by rejecting candidate
documents that do not fit the pattern of law school outlines  we have developed a verification algorithm that implements a supervised  nave bayes  or unsupervised  k means  approach to validate
uploaded documents  outlines that cannot be verified are removed from the system  approved outlines are sent to the classification unit where one of three  multinomial nave bayes  svm  k means 
developed algorithms classifies the outlines into one of six core law school courses  these classified
outlines are then stored on the database and made available immediately to users for downloading 
a textual classification algorithm using both unsupervised and supervised learning methodologies
can achieve fast and accurate outline verification and classification  although we have focused our
attention on law school outlines  the methods presented in this paper can be used automatically
verify and or classify any textual document 

 

methods and data

the algorithm is split into three main functional blocks  figure     the first block performs preprocessing on uploaded outlines  the second block determines the validity of uploaded documents
by using either a nave bayes or k means algorithm that discriminates law school outlines from
other textual documents  not law school outlines   after successfully verification  the classification
block can use one of three  multinomial nave bayes  svm  k means  developed algorithms to
classify outlines into six first year core law school courses  which include civil procedure  torts 
constitutional law  property law  contracts  and criminal law 
we find that with a proper algorithm and feature vector choice we can correctly validate and classify
outlines into their respective courses with perfect accuracy     test error   all performance measures were conducted using a leave one out cross validation methods due to the limited amount of
training data 
   

training data

training data was donated by law school students and downloaded from various sources on the internet  due to the scarcity of outlines  we collected     law school outlines that encompassed six core
first year courses  we also gathered    other  non outline  textual documents to represent a broad
range of disciplines  e g  science  art  history  etc   these non outline training data were used only
during training of the verification stage of the algorithm  the training data was manually classified
and checked for errors  table   shows analysis on these law school outline training data  although
we achieved high classification and verification accuracy  more training data would be required for
refined classification schemes  such as classifying outlines with course name and professors name 
   

pre processing

extensive pre processing procedures were developed for simplification and data reduction  outlines
were first converted from microsoft word documents to text files using open source software   
our algorithm then pre processed the outlines by      removing all special characters  numbers and
punctuation  and     removing stop words  i e  words with little no classification value  such as

algorithms     pre processing achieved a data reduction of     on average 
we computed the frequency of words that appeared in outlines of a specific course  table     this
procedure was used to determine the feasibility of the verification classification problem  the high
frequency words from a specific course were well delineated from the high frequency words in other
courses  providing evidence that a properly chosen dictionary would allow for accurate classification 
   

verification

to maintain the integrity of course material  we have developed and tested both supervised and
unsupervised learning algorithms that can verify uploaded documents by classifying them into one
of two categories  law school outline or not law school outline  the verification algorithm
attempts to recognize and exploit patterns found in the key words of law school outlines  users
who attempt to submit documents that are not law school outlines  e g  history essays  art criticism
essays  scientific literature  etc  will have their submission rejected since their document will be
lacking the necessary pattern of high frequency words found in law school outlines 
one limitation of our current verification strategy is that the algorithm does not check for proper
grammar and sentence formulation  this poses a problem for the system since astute users can gain
download credits by uploading documents aggregated with a collection properly chosen key words 
such a document would pass the verification step  in future work  we plan to developed specialized
algorithms that will assign all outlines a grammar score that can be used as a feature variable 
this will improve the filtering of illegitimate outlines  the verification step has been separated from
the classification algorithm in order to allow for the development of these specialized verification
algorithms 
     

verification using supervised learning  nave bayes

one of the verification algorithms we have developed and tested is a nave bayes  with laplace
smoothing  algorithm that includes the existence of words found in the vocabulary  and word count
of the uploaded document as features  the vocabulary  which consisted of      words  was formed
by aggregating     of the highest frequency words from every positive  law school outlines  training
example with     of the highest frequency words from every negative  not law school outlines  training example  we find that our nave bayes verification algorithm can correct discriminate outlines
from non outlines with a      accuracy rate when using this vocabulary 
     

verification using unsupervised learning  k means

we have developed a k means clustering algorithm that uses the feature vector x i   
t
 f    f            fn   such that kx i  k       here fk is the number of times the k th word in the vocabulary appears in the document  k  k  is the l   norm  and n is the size of the vocabulary  the l  
normalization condition is required to account for outlines with different lengths  we find that when
using the same vocabulary presented in section        our k means verification algorithm achieves
a       verification accuracy  this performance metric was measured using a leave one out cross
validation scheme

figure    dictionary word size vs classification test error  here we show how the dictionary
word size effects the classification test error  the test error was computed using leave one out cross
validation  we find that k mean dominates the svm algorithm for all dictionary sizes  however 
nave bayes is the only algorithm that achieves a    classification test error 

   

classification

verified outlines are passed to the classification block where outlines will be classified into one
of   first year law courses  civil procedure  torts  constitutional law  property law  contracts  and
criminal law  our classification algorithm can utilize both a supervised learning  multinomial nave
bayes and svm  algorithms or an unsupervised learning  k means  algorithm 
     

classification using supervised learning  multinomial nave bayes and svm

   
   
   
   
   
   

the supervised classification algorithm begins by converting the multicatagory classification problem into a binary category classification problem  for example  when the classification algorithm
wants to check if a particular outline belongs to civil procedure it will assign civil procedure a
label of y     and all other courses will receive a label of y      or y     when using the
svm algorithm   the classification algorithm performs this sub method on all six course categories
until a classification prediction of ypredict     is found  although this method is computationally
inefficient  we find that it produces a reasonable low test error prediction results 

   
   
   
   
   

we used a dictionary that aggregates n of the highest frequency words from all of the outlines in each
course category  the resulting dictionary will contain  n words that are not unique    we produce
a unique dictionary by removing multiple occurrences of the same word  we find that changing the
value of n will change  usually improve  the classification test error for both the multinomial nave
bayes and svm algorithm  fig     

   
   
   
   
   
   

we find that our multinomial nave bayes algorithm  with laplace smoothing  achieves perfect
       classification accuracy when using a vocabulary size of     words  we show the confusion
matrix for the multinomial nave bayes using a    word size vocabulary in table    we find that
    of the total error can be associated to confusion between civil procedure and constitutional
law  this was expected since table   shows that there is large overlap between the high frequency
words of civil procedure and constitutional law 

   
   
   
   
   
   

the svm algorithm achieves a best case test error rate of      using a vocabulary size of     words 
we expect the performance of the svm algorithm to improve as the number of training examples is
increased 
 
the high frequency words in some of the course categories overlap causing a dictionary with words that are
not unique   see table

table    confusion matrix  we have computed the confusion matrix for the multinomial nave bayes
classification algorithm with a    word vocabulary 
     

classification using unsupervised learning  k means

here we present an unsupervised learning approach using a k means algorithm which follows the
formulation presented by steinbach et  al      we follow the same feature vector formulation presented in section        in this implementation  we do not assume six clusters  one for every course
category   we treat the number of clusters as a variable in order to correctly model real life systems 
we estimate the number of clusters using the gap statistic method presented by tibshirani et  al 
     we find that with a properly chosen vocabulary  the result of the optimal number of clusters
is always six  as expected  
we find that our k means algorithm achieves a higher best case classification test error        when
compared with the multinomial nave bayes algorithm  but does better than our svm algorithm for
all vocabulary sizes  we also find that the k means algorithm becomes unreliable if the dimension
of the feature vector is much larger than the number of training data  n       figure    
although k means achieves a higher classification test error  it provides many benefits over supervised learning approaches  for example  once clusters are formed  the entire data set can be
manually classified for training purposes by manually classifying a single data point in each cluster  since supervised learning requires every data point to be manually classified for training  this
method will provide a dramatic reduction in the cost and time required to manually classify large
data sets  another advantage that k means provides is computational efficiency  we find that the kmeans classification algorithm presented here runs   x faster than our svm classification algorithm
presented in section       

 

conclusions

we have developed a machine learning based algorithm to reduce the inefficiencies of law school
outline sharing websites  in this paper  we have shown that both supervised and unsupervised learning methods achieve low verification and classification test error   maximum test error of      and
     respectively   using a nave bayes algorithm for both classification and verification allows for
     accuracy  in both problems  with a properly chosen vocabulary  however  using an unsupervised approach sacrifices accuracy for a dramatic gain in computational efficiency
