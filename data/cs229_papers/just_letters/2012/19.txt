optimal vehicle to grid regulation service scheduling
christian osorio
introduction
with the growing popularity and market share of electric vehicles comes several opportunities
for electric power utilities  vehicle owners  and vehicle manufacturers  vehicles have a tremendous
capacity to provide services to better the electric grid  these services are the focus of so called vehicle
to grid  v g  technologies  v g represents the idea that electric vehicles can not only charge from the
grid  but also send power back to the grid when it is advantageous to do so 
an area of focus for v g technologies is the ability of fleets of electric vehicles to provide
ancillary services to the grid  because power must be consumed at the time it is produced  ancillary
services make up the difference between the scheduled amount of power generated  and the actual
amount of power consumed  in order to maintain a    hz grid frequency  regulation services are
employed  regulation service providers are called upon by utility companies to increase or decrease
grid power in order to regulate the grid frequency  power sources that can be switched quickly are
valuable for ancillary services  electric vehicles are well suited for this purpose 
v g implementation poses several problems  contracts for regulation services must be
scheduled one day ahead of time  as electric vehicles are not static generators  they will not always be
available to provide ancillary services  also  the vehicles need to be available when needed by their
drivers  because of this  i propose a machine learning algorithm solution to schedule both charging and
regulation services for a fleet of distributed  consumer owned electric vehicles 
scheduling electric vehicle charging poses several problems  the aim is to predict when
vehicles will be plugged into their home chargers  and optimize the schedules to charge when
electricity is least expensive  and provide regulation services when it is most lucrative  all while
charging the vehicle to an acceptable level by the time the driver needs to use it 
ideally  one would like to be able to predict the ancillary service  as  clearing prices  electricity
prices  and vehicle availabilities  then schedule the charging and regulation services as a constrained
linear optimization problem  unfortunately  there are several difficulties with this approach  first  it is
not clear that all of the required features are predictable  in fact  it seems highly unlikely that the as
clearing prices can be predicted  power utilities schedule electricity production to track actual
consumption by using algorithms to predict the consumption  these algorithms take into account a
variety of features  and are very good at scheduling electricity production  the as clearing prices are a
response to the error of their predictions  for this reason  the as clearing prices do not appear to be
correlated with any of the features  if the as prices were predictable  the profit margins of the utility
could be increased by raising or lowing electricity production based on the predicted as prices 
another problem with scheduling via linear programming is that there will be error in the predictions 
these errors could lead to cars being charged below an acceptable level  and failure to meet ancillary
service contracts  charging and regulation services should be scheduled taking safety margins on the
predictions into account

in order to schedule the charging and regulation
electricity market
services of electric vehicles  i propose a bottom up
approach  first  the availability of each individual
vehicle is predicted  the hourly electricity prices are
neighborhood
also predicted  reinforcement learning is used to
schedule charging and regulation services for each
price
vehicle  after creating the individual schedules  these prediction

also be necessary to develop a control system to fulfill
regulation service contracts and manage the charging
availability prediction
of vehicles  for this project  i focus on the first three
steps  predicting the availability of vehicles  predicting
electricity prices  and using reinforcement learning to create individual schedules 
electricity price prediction
electricity price prediction is a commonly researched problem  in a paper by raquel gareta et 
al     hourly electricity prices are forecasted using neural networks  gareta uses features including the
day of the month  a flag to indicate weekdays or weekends  and prices from the previous days  in one
of their most basic models  they use a neural network with    hidden nodes 
i decided to use different features than the gareta paper suggests  instead  i used one year of
hourly temperatures and dew points obtained from weather underground     the weather data was
collected at the san francisco airport  i also created a binary matrix indicating the days of the week
and the hour of the day  the elements combined to form    dimensional input vectors  the neural
networks have a single output node for the hourly electricity price  i obtained one year of locational
marginal electricity prices  lmp  for a grid node near the san francisco airport from the california
independent system operators  caiso  website      matlab was used to create and train neural
networks with various numbers of hidden nodes  the data set was randomly split into training 
validation and test sets  the training data represented     of the data points  the validation      and
the test data      each network was trained three times  and the average and minimum mean squared
errors of the network versus the training set were collected  these values are plotted below  from the
plot we see that there isn t significant improvement in performance of the neural network after   
neurons

because of the lack of improvement past    neurons  i selected a neural network with    hidden

filayer neurons  after retraining a few times  the network achieved an r value of     and a mean squared
error of     this neural network is      and the mean squared error is      
strangely  the mean squared error of the network seems unusually high  it seems that due to the
size of the data set  matlab has some problems checking the mean of the data  however  by plotting
a fit to the data  we can see that the neural network seems to be working well  below  i ve plotted the
neural network prediction of the lmp for the first week of the year  as well as the actual prices  in the
future  i hope to obtain better metrics to measure the performance of the neural network

availability predictions
after predicting electricity prices  the next step towards planning a vehicle to grid schedule is
predicting when vehicles are available  for this problem  i was provided a data set of charging histories
of ten electric cars from bmw  the data set contains logs of charging events for the vehicles for a five
month period  the data indicates when a vehicle is plugged in  when it is disconnected  it also indicates
the mileage of the vehicle and the state of charge of the battery at each charging event  this data is used
to create a binary vector indicating whether the vehicle is plugged in or not each hour  because some
data is missing  the missing hours are skipped 
in order to predict when vehicles will be plugged in  the prediction is treated as a classification
problem  unfortunately  the data is anonymized  so that i know nothing about the customer  because of
this  i am unable to use any data based on the location of the vehicle  the features used to classify the
availability of the vehicle are represented by a binary matrix indicating the day of the week and the
hour of the day  for this reason  we have a    dimensional feature space 
i first attempted to classify the data using support vector machines  svm   i trained an svm
with a linear kernel using the first      data points from the first vehicle  and achieved a classification
error of      however  the process was very slow  the data did not separate very well in the   
dimensional feature space  and out of      data points  there were     support vectors  because the
application is made to be real time  as time goes on  the data set will grow  when attempting to train the
svm on more data points  the computer ran out of memory  because of this  an svm would not make
a good candidate for the final implementation of the program 
instead of the svm  a naive bayes classifier was used to classify the data  the naive bayes
algorithm took much less memory to calculate  and was able to be trained much faster  for the first
vehicle  trained on      data points  the naive bayes classifier achieved a classification error of     
however  when trained on a      data points  the classifier achieved a classification error of     

fiunfortunately  some drivers are more predictable than others  while the first vehicle becomes
fairly predictable with more data  other drivers are not  the naive bayes classifier for another driver in
the data set misclassifies the availability     of the time  the unpredictable nature of some drivers
may indicate that they are poor candidates for vehicle to grid services 
scheduling with reinforcement learning
in order to accommodate error in the predictions of the availabilities of the vehicles  a
reinforcement learning algorithm will be developed to optimize the margin of safety of scheduling the
charging and regulation services  the schedules for regulation services and vehicle charging need to be
decided upon at least one day ahead of time for a    hour period 
in order to frame the problem  the data is separated into    hour periods  during a period 
charging periods are selected by the availability predictor  actions are decided upon for each charging
period  the charging period will have an expected length  which will be used to determine the action
taken 
for each day  the outcomes of all actions are evaluated  a value matrix keeps track of the
expected rewards of a each action based on the expected length of the charge period  if the vehicle is
charged to a target value by the time the vehicle is unplugged  it is assumed that the vehicle owner is
satisfied with the action taken during the charge period  for this  the reward will be the sum of a bonus
for satisfying the customer  and the net revenue during the charge period  if the customer is unsatisfied 
the reward function is just the net revenue 
because the space of possible actions is so large  the actions will take the form of different
charging policies adjusted for different safety margins  an example of a policy is maximizing
electricity purchased when electricity is projected to be the least expensive  within an expected charge
period  we can choose to limit the charge period of the policy as a built in safety margin  the value
matrix is parametrized by the actions taken  and the safety margin  actions are decided upon by the
highest expected reward for a given length of an expected charge period 
the proposed reinforcement learning algorithm will be my next undertaking in the project 
unfortunately  i was not able to implement the algorithm in time for this paper  however  i believe that
the framework will produce a viable reinforcement learning problem 
conclusion
scheduling electric vehicle charging for a day ahead market is a complex problem with many
moving parts  the steps taken in this project will help to push the problem closer to a solution  previous
studies had already shown that electricity prices can be accurately predicted using neural networks  i
implemented a neural networks predictor in hopes that i could use in in the future with a reinforcement
learning based scheduler  the naive bayes classifier worked fairly well for predicting when drivers are
available  it shows that some drivers may be better candidates than others for day ahead scheduling  in
implementing vehicle to grid technologies  many vehicles will have to be aggregated to provide enough
power capacity to make a difference in the market  hopefully  the aggregated predictions will be even
more accurate  while i was not able to finish implementing the reinforcement learning based scheduler 
i am well on the way  and hope to complete this soon  by demonstrating these methods  i hope to
demonstrate that vehicle to grid technologies can be profitable and useful
