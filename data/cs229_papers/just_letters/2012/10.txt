predicting nba player performance
kevin wheeler

introduction
predicting the outcomes of sporting events and the performances of athletes represents a natural
application for machine learning  major  professional sports such as the nba  nfl  and mlb contain a
significant amount of easily accessible data whose outcomes and player performances tend to be
randomly distributed and offer attractive data to predict  the nba is particularly well suited for machine
learning applications because the performance of nba players across different positions can be measured
using the same set of statistics  this is unlike the nfl  for instance  where different positions are
measured using different metrics  e g  qbs are measured based on how many tds they throw while
linebackers are measured based on how many people they sack tackle  
furthermore  applying machine learning algorithms to predict the performance of individual athletes also
has a natural extension in predicting the outcomes of games  by predicting the scoring performances of
each player and summing them up  it can be determined if predicting individual performances can be used
an accurate win loss classifier 
in this project  i set out to develop a model using linear regression  with nave bayes and svm
implementations to compare  to predict how many points nba players would score against an opponent 

methods
feature selection
the ability to accurately predict the performance of nba players depends upon determining and using
features that are strongly correlated with the number of points an nba player will score against any given
opponent  a   test was used to analyze a set of    team and individual  gave level statistics to determine
the subset of features to be used in the prediction models  for instance  the minutes a player plays or the
number of shots a player takes in a game represent game level statistics while pace and opponent turnover
rate are team level statistics  using a   value of      as a cutoff  all statistics below this value were
subsequently disregarded      features were ultimately used to calculate the parameter vectors for each
player  the features are shown in table   below

linear regression
linear regression was used to predict both the player level statistics and the number of points each player
would score against a particular opponent using equation   below  the training set consisted of statistics
from every game each player played in over the last three seasons 
                

   

above   was the parameter vector   was the training set where the rows represented each game the
player played in and the columns were the features  and  were the training results  once the regression
parameters were calculated for each player  they were used to make scoring predictions  as stated above 
the parameters were calculated based on all of the players games played over the last three seasons 
predictions were then made for the current             season and the end of last season            
using cross validation 
win loss classification
the linear regression model was then extended to determine whether the outcomes of games could be
predicted  this was done by summing up the predicted points scored by each player and comparing the
results between two opposing teams 
to compare the performance of this type of classifier  nave bayes and support vector machine  svm 
models were implemented  a multinomial event model with laplace smoothing was implemented for a
nave bayes model  maximizing the likelihood expression given in equation    resulted in the likelihood
parameters given by equations    
                    

 
    



 

 

 
 

       

   

 

       
 

   

   

   

 
    

  
    

 

  

 
 
                
   
 
                   
   
  

 
 
                
   
   
 
                   
   

 

                  

 

      

   

   

   

   

            
 

where                                                   the likelihood parameters
were calculated using the same set of features used in the linear regression model  as seen in table    

   

   

fisince the statistical categories were a combination of percentages and integers  each xij in the training set
was classified and converted into a number from     based on what decile the value belonged to relative
to its category  for instance  if a players efg  was       for one training example  i e  one game played
in  and the   th and   th percentiles were       and      respectively  then this percentage was converted
into a   for being this decile  this was done to relatively weight each category and put the calculation of
the likelihood parameters on even footing  it should also be noted that the svm incorporated a linear
kernel and the training sets used were consistent across the various models 

results
game by game scoring fluctuations were difficult to model and predict
overall  the linear regression model was able to predict a players points scored per game  ppg  to within
     of his season average  however  the standard deviations in the predictions compared to a players
actual performance differed dramatically  on average  the standard deviations in the predicted ppg were
    times less than the players actual standard deviation of ppg  the standard deviation in the actual
ppg of a player was roughly         of his season average while the standard deviation in the
predicted ppg was between         
predicting player level statistics using linear regression was better than using player averages
despite being unable to accurately predict the large deviations in the ppg and player level statistics 
simply using a players season averages for their player level statistics resulted in less variance in the
predictions  for instance  in stead of trying to predict how many shots a player will take make or how
many minutes he will play  using his season and career averages for these statistics resulted in average
standard deviations in the predicted ppg of      
ppg predictions did not scale well to accurately classify win loss
using the linear regression model to predict a players ppg and then adding up the predictions for each
player on opposing teams to predict win loss outcome had an error rate of      this is unlike the nave
bayes and svm classifiers that had error rates as low as      as seen in figure

conclusion future directions
accurately predicting player level statistics is key
the inability to accurately predict the deviations in a players ppg was most likely due to the inability to
accurately model player level statistics  the challenge in predicting these statistics lies in difficult toquantify and not well understood factors  for instance  the number of minutes a player plays and shots he
takes can depend in factors such as how well he is playing on that particular game  which specific player
is defending him  how well the other players on his team are playing  and his confidence level may
influence his performance  but it is not straightforward how they should be represented in a regression
model  furthermore  the coachs decision to play a player can also depend on a number of behavior 
philosophical  and social factors  each of which may vary from coach to coach  
social media and weighted regression provide possible strategies for improving predictions
a possible strategy to quantify the behavior  philosophical  and social aspects stated above is to use social
media and weighted regression as part of the feature set and regression model  respectively  for instance 
one strategy is to attempt to classify the confidence level of a player  which may influence how well he
plays  by weighting his recent performances more than his earlier performances  one could further
classify confidence by quantifying his social media and press coverage  e g  positive twitter postings and
press coverage may indicate higher confidence levels  
attempting to predict player performances still has value and potential future applications
though the predictions made here were less than optimal  this was an important first step in predicting
player level performance  if improvements can be made to the model and the above strategies can be
successfully incorporated  this will represent an important step in building models that can accurately
predict and outperform classifiers based on nave bayes and svm models
