introduction
we plan to evaluate the kaggle project a wind power forecasting problem  predicting hourly power generation up
to    hours ahead at   wind farms  the details of this project can be found at https   www kaggle com c gef    wind forecasting  this project has been sponsored by ieee power   energy society and a total prize pool of       
have been dedicated to the first   teams  moreover selected teams will be invited to ieee pes general meeting     
in vancouver  canada to present their methodologies and results 
cristina archer and mark z  jacobson     estimated that the total wind energy that can be extracted in a practical
and cost competitive manner is between    and     tw but predicting future energy generation precisely for an
specific wind power generation field is very important  the ability to predict generated wind power would help in
proper design of the power network and achieving full compliance of customers energy demands  in this project  we
are predicting power generation at seven wind farms  we are given the    hour ahead forecast for wind speed  wind
direction  and the zonal and meridional wind components at each of the farms  the outputs are normalized wind
power measurements between   and   for each of the seven wind farms  from            to            is a model
identification and training period  from            to            is the evaluation period  in this period we are given
generated power for the first    hours slots and we need to predict the power for the next missing    hour periods 
this pattern of    hours     hours of given and    hours of missing data  is repeated over the entire evaluation period 
such predictions can be extremely challenging as the features change over time  the weather and climate forecasts are
our main resource for predicting wind power generation despite the difficulties for meteorologists to create accurate
weather forecasts  as a result  the collected the data has complicated features with sudden jumps that make it difficult
to make accurate predictions for wind power generation 

problem modeling
we present detailed study of the predictive learning algorithms that are based on time series regression and feature
selection for the wind farms  figure    a  shows the generated power at the wind farm on january  st       and figure
   b  shows the generated power at the wind farm over the month of january       we developed four models to
predict the generated power over the    hours periods  for our first two models  we use univariate series without using
the given wind data  speed and direction  from the wind farms  however  we try to optimize our next two models by
making use of this wind farm data 
figure     shows the auto correlation function  acf  of the generated power at the wind farm  the acf has a peak
at the lag of one hour and not surprisingly decreases as lag hour is increasing  another important observation is that
there are local maximas around lag hour    and     this is expected because the generated power at each hour should
be highly correlated to the same hour   day ago and   days ago 

plain off the shelf arima models
we first notice that we cant use plain off the shelf arima model      we have to forecast data    periods ahead
and a plain off the shelf arima model such as the one given below will lead to a wide confidence interval and a poor
prediction

hence  we have to take advantage of inherent structure in the system and come up with a new model as described
below  as mentioned above  we see that for any observation the maximum correlation is at lag   along with local
maxima at lag    and lag     these observations can easily be used to forecast wind power for one period ahead 
however  for forecasting two period ahead we will not use forecasted value at lag   as an input  rather we will make
another model with last known value and    hours back value  specifically 
yt
yt l

        yt      yt  
        yt      yt l  
        yt       yt l  

   l    
    l    

thus  when we have to forecast one period ahead  we used the last value and the value at lag     when we need to
forecast between period   and     we used the last actual known value  instead of the forecasted value at period   
and the value with lag     this helps us to avoid propagation of   period ahead forecasted error and is not problematic

fias the correlation between yt with its few lagged values is good as suggested by acf plot  for forecasting period
between    and    hours  we will use the forecasted value at period    and the actual value with    hours lag  this
held us to take advantage of high correlation at lag    where we have known value instead of forecasted value 
regularization  instead of doing plain regression of yt on its lagged value yt    yt            we decided to use
regularized regression  the regularized regression is    arg min   yt   t ytl          t  where the value of  is
decided using cross validation  however  we decided to use    arg min   yt   t ytl     subject to       c and
      c  the value of c was used as   and no penalty was added for intercept term 

locally weighted regression model
the next possible model that we can think of for time series data prediction is locally weighted regression    
based on the generated power data itself

where we calculate the predicted value at each time instance based on the value of    vectors  as we mentioned above 
the data over each specific time period has correlation with the similar periods which is called the seasonality of the
data  we can make use of this hidden characteristic of the data and make the locally wighted regression for the data and
predict the power based on the similar instances of the data in the past  in the prediction period  we are given    hours
of the generated power and we are asked to predict for the next    hours  therefore  we divide the model identification
data in chunk of       periods and use the similarity of first    period to forecast the next    period using locally
wighted regression model  in order to find the right value for the bandwidth parameter  we use cross validation method
to optimally compute it 

arimax model with wind speed
other than the historic time series data generated power data  we are provided with wind speed and direction features
which can be used in training and prediction process  specifically we are provided with four features wind  speed 
direction  zonal and meridional components of the wind  as an important stepping stone  we need to intelligently
choose the features that are closely correlated to that generated power  this process is feature selection   since these
features may have inner dependencies and using all of the features together may lead to over fitting  therefore we
looked into the correlation of wind features and generated power in the training set  we observed a high correlation
between wind power and wind speed  however wind direction  zonal  meridional components were not found to have
significant correlation to the power  so we include the wind speed as part of linear regression model with the new
model as follows 
yt

locally weighted regression with wind speed
instead of relying only on univariate wind power  we now use forecasted wind speed  direction  zonal component 
meridional component in our model  the locally weighted regression model automatically discards the features which

fihave low correlation to the generated power so we dont need to worry about the low correlated features  again in this
model we are using cross validation to find the bandwidth parameter  in this model y predicted formula stays the same 
the only difference is the extra term in wi formula

results and discussions
figure     shows the predicted power over a specific    hours period for wind farm   with four models 

figure    predicted power vs  actual generated power over    hours period with four models 

the results for the arima model show that this model is trying to smooth out the sudden jumps of the data and
give an averaged out prediction  the prediction for the first    hours is quiet reasonable  but for the second    hours
period the result is poor  the reason is that the model uses the first    hours predicted power to predict over the second
   hours 
the cross validated locally weighted regression does a great job in predicting the sudden jumps and following the
trend of this specific    hours period  however  there are few periods where this method drastically fails in prediction 
the method tries to minimize the error over the given    hours which sometimes lead to a worse prediction for the
next    hours since the weather conditions can dramatically change over these periods 
the predictions for the arimax and locally weighted regression with wind speed models are much closer to
the actual data  we are making use of the the wind speed feature which is highly correlated  up to     correlation 
to the generated power  these two models successfully predict the sudden peaks and valleys of the data over the time
periods in a day that power generation are the highest and the lowest 
figure     shows the root mean square error  rmse  of the prediction from            to            for four
models for all seven wind farms along with the best rmse submitted to the kaggle com for this contest  as we can

fisee  performance of arimax model is comparable to the best entries submitted to kaggle  all four models give a
better result than the result of the benchmark method currently being used for wind farm prediction

summary and conclusion
in this project  we predicted wind power generation at seven wind farms  the model identification and training period is
from july         to september           and the evaluation period for the plots is from october         to december
         while the evaluation period for kaggle submissions is from            to             in this period we
are given generated power for the first    hour slots and we need tovpredict the power for the next missing    hour
periods  as any other climate and meteoric related data  the wind power data is highly noisy and prediction on this
type of data can be extremely challenging 
in this project we used two time series prediction models  arima  locally weighted regression  which make
predictions based on the historic features of the generated power itself  as we saw that although the arima model
tries to average out the prediction  its overall performance is better than the locally weighted regression model  the
arimia model trains itself based on the hourly generated power over all of the training set  in contrast  the locally
weighted regression gives more regression weight to the training instances that are similar to the    hour given data
in the prediction intervals  however  this often leads to huge error in the prediction for locally weighted regression 
we improved these models by adding wind speed features that we chose in our feature selection procedure through
correlation to the generated power  these new arimax and locally weighted regression with wind speed models
which had a quite reasonable performance improvement over arima and locally weighted regression and beat the
benchmark method by almost a factor of
