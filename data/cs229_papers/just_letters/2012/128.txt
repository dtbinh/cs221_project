introduction  
  
the  primary  goal  of  this  project  is  to  answer  the  question   does  performance training  with  
this  simulator  transfer  to  improvements  in  clinical  robotic surgery  on  real  patients   
briefly    the   role   of   surgical   simulation   is   to   train evaluate   residents    medical   students   
before   stepping   into   the   shoes   of   robotic surgeons    so    this   project   focuses   most   on  
evaluating   the   simulator   that   evaluates   doctors    in   sense    we   are   trying   to   predict   the  
validity   of   a   simulator    given    by   collecting   the   data   it   provides   after   a   group   of   experts  
 robotic surgery    perform   on   it    so   we   will   be   predicting   the   r score    which   is   the  
governing   score   for   graduating   a   resident   into   an   operation   theatre     from   a   given  
collection  of  r scores   which  is  in  turn  dependent  on  a  set  of  governing  performance  related  
metrics   e g   time  taken   camera  usage   clutch  usage   left  pinches   right  pinches   cauterizer  
usage  and  etc   
  
data  and  features  
the   data   is   available   at   my   current   employers   database    i   work   for   simulated   surgical  
systems    we   build   the   ross    robotic   surgery   simulator     it   is   a   start up   company   in   ny   and  
this   simulator   is   designed   for   training   doctors   for   intuitive   surgicals   da   vinci   surgical  
system    so    we   already   have   about        simulators   spread   around   usa   and   a   couple   in  
europe    so    we   have   collected   a   huge   set   of   data   of   experts   practicing   on   it   and   teaching  
their  residents  using  the  ross

i   have   spent   time   on   selecting   features   and   generating   them    this   helped   me   in  
consolidating  the  useful  data  from  unwanted  features   in  our  model   the  predicting  problem  
is   converted   into   multiclass   classification   problem    we   will   nave   bayes   as   our   prototype  
model   initially   for   training   and   testing   data    we   will   compare   the   performance   of   the  
technique   by   employing   another   technique    the   logistic   regression    and   then   will   try   to  
achieve  the  final  feature  and  model

in  our  experiments   the  time  taken  is  the  strongest  individual  indicator  of  a  users  r score   
in   the   final   report    i   will   attach   the   plot   for   the   x y   scatter   graph   of   time   taken   and   r score   
which   helps   us   in   finding   their   correlation    hence   using   it   as   the   baseline   result    in   sense    all  
reasonable  models  should  be  able  to  achieve  at  least  this  correlation   
  
model      linear  regression  
in  our  first  model   we  used  a  standard  least  gradient  descent   which  we  implemented  in  c  
for  efficiency   once  we  had  trained  a  set  of  feature  weights   we  could  then  generate  the  r 
score  prediction  
  
r score                 f                         where    are  the  weights     are  the  features  
and  n  is  the  number  of  features  
  
to   measure   the   goodness   of   our   results    we   looked   at   the   correlation   between   our  
predicted   metric   values   and   the   actual   metric   values    as   was   done   in   other   papers             as  
alternative   measures   to   interpret   our   results    we   also   considered   other   metrics   such   as  
mean   absolute   percentage   error    mape    and   symmetric   mean   absolute   percentage   error  
 smape    
  
mape   is   not   the   best   metric   for   our   work   because   the   error   is   unbounded   metric   value  
 time   of        sec  for  a  given  surgery  exercise  that  was  performed  in       sec   then  error  
would   be           skewing   any   average   we   would   take   over   all   test   examples    in  
compensation   to   this    we   also   tried   smape    which   returns   error   values   from       to          
however  neither  metric  gave  consistent   explainable  results   
below   are   the   correlation   results   we   found   for   each   of   our   feature   sets    using         of   our  
data  in  training  
  
in  our  first  model   we  used  a  standard  least squares  linear  regression   to  do  this   we  used  
stochastic   gradient   descent    which   we   implemented   in   c   for   efficiency    once   we   had   trained  
a  set  of  feature  weights   we  could  then  generate  r score  predictions  as  follows

model      classification  by  logistic  regression  
as a second model  we also tried classification by standard l  regularized logistic regression  we
chose this method because it generated a multi class model with linear weights  most directly
comparable to the feature weights given by linear regression  to define our classes  we drew a
histogram of surgery exercise to create   different buckets for prediction as shown below 
the first bucket includes the lowest     of the r score distribution and the last bucket includes
the highest     
buckets

the procedure for using logistic regression was fairly similar to that of linear regression  the
difference being that we now use labeled buckets as our y values  instead of real valued rscores  and pass the data to liblinear to build the model for classification  this model gave the
following accuracy results on our     test set 
in general  none of these accuracy figures were as high as we had hoped  indicating that this kind
of classification was not the right approach to the problem

final  comparison   
having   developed   these   different   models    we   need   some   way   of   comparing   these   results   
for  this  project   i  implemented  two  methods   we  map  the  results  from  linear  regression  into  
the   five   bucket   classes   from   logistic   regression    so    in   order   to   do   this    we   take   the   real 
valued   outputs   from   our   linear   regression   model    assign   labels   to   them   according   to   the  
buckets   into   which   they   fall    and   check   these   corresponding   values   in   the   same   bucket   as  
those  of  the  actual  r score

these  numbers  decrease  with  additional  features   likely  because  of  increased  variance   that  
is    some   over fitting   on   the   training   set     further   discussion   of   this   in   the   following   section    
however    all   are   roughly   comparable   to   the         accuracy   achieved   by   logistic   regression  
on  the  classification  problem   showing  that  linear  regression  is  almost  as  good  at  the  task  of  
classification  as  logistic  regression   the  algorithm  dedicated  to  classification     
in  the  second  method   instead  of  mapping  from  real  values  to  buckets   we  map  from  our  five  
buckets   to   real   values    to   do   this    we   first   find   the   average   r scores   classified   into   each  
bucket   in   logistic   regression    then    instead   of   generating   class   labels   from   logistic  
regression    we   can   use   the   corresponding   averages   instead    giving   us   real valued   output  
from  the  classifier   thus  the  resulting  correlation  scores  are  as  follows   
  
  
simple  features  
complex  features  
sentiment  features  
test  data  set  
        correlation  
        correlation  
        correlation  
  
none   of   these   approach   the          range   of   correlation   seen   with   linear   regression    much   less  
the          baseline   correlation   using   a   simulation   exercises   time   taken   alone    much   of   this  
has  to  do  with  the  fact  that  logistic  regression  can  only  generate  one  of  five  distinct  values   
so   we   thought   we   might   experiment   with   different   number   of   buckets    our   expectation   was  
that   accuracy   would   consistently   decrease   as   number   of   buckets   increased    but   that  
correlation   would   have   some   optimal   point   where   the    positive    granularity   of   having  
smaller ranged   buckets   balanced   with   the    negative    trend   toward   fewer   training   examples  
per  bucket   we  were  surprised  to  find  that  while  accuracy  decreased   correlation  remained  
fairly  constant   as  shown  in  the  following  figure   
  

  
  
  
  

  

fiit   appears   that    in   terms   of   the   correlation   measure    having   fewer   training   examples   per  
bucket  was  evenly  offset  by  the  greater  granularity  of  having  smaller ranged  buckets   
  
conclusion  
we  framed  this  problem  as  both  a  regression  and  classification  problem  because  we  were  
not   sure   which   would   provide   a   better   result    as   such    we   implemented   both   and   devised  
methods   to   compare   them    in   general    we   found   that   linear   regression   works   almost   as   well  
as  logistic  regression  for  classification  on  our  data   while  having  a  much  better  correlation  
with   the   actual   gross   revenues    in   general    we   found   that   the   features   we   used    simple  
numeric    text    and   sentiment   features    were   insufficient   to   make   strong   predictions   of   r 
score   for  future  work   besides  using  different  feature  sets   we  might  consider  using  better  
regularization   on   linear   regression   in   order   to   provide   a   more   rigorous   safeguard   against  
high variance   models    as   we   consistently   observed   decreases   in   linear   regressions   test  
accuracy  with  increasing  numbers  of  features     
  
another    fundamentally   different    data   set   that   might   be   useful   in   predicting   a   simulators  
validity   would   be   social   graph   data    using   such   data    we   could   analyze   the   characteristics   of  
how  a  trainees  performance  propagates  through  real  surgery   as  well  as  characteristics  of  
the   propagation   tree    such   as   its   speed   and   extent   over   time    the   propagation   speed   of   a  
trainee   would   represent   performance   expectation   to   see   that   a   simulation   exercise    which  
we  expect  will  be  directly  related  to  its  r score   
  
moreover    we   looked   at   our   feature   weights   for   text based   features    and   from   them  
extracted   the   highest    and   lowest weighted   features   in   right   hand   movement    left   hand  
movement   and  clutch  pedal  usage   camera  usage
