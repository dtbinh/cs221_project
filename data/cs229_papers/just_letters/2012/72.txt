a novel approach to image segmentation for traffic sign recognition
jon jay hack and sidd jagadish
introduction motivation  as autonomous vehicles  such as googles self driving car  have
recently become more prominent  the ability to detect and recognize informational road signs is
of elevated importance  road sign detection faces the same challenges as many other detection
tasks  namely that of shadows and outdoor lighting conditions obscuring the signs  road sign
detection is easier than many other detection tasks  however  as one can assume regular shapes 
nearly uniform colors  single angle of presentation and non deformable nature  a majority of
existing approaches to traffic sign recognition separate the task into two phases designed to
capitalize on these advantages   the first phase  known as the segmentation phase  determines
which regions of an image are likely to yield traffic signs  and the second phase  known as the
classification phase  determines what kind of sign  if any  is contained in this region  here  we
describe a new approach to the segmentation phase 
we trained and tested our algorithm on a publicly available  database of images of three
different types of road signs  bike crossing  pedestrian crossing  and intersection signs   these
road signs were of three different shapes   square  circle and equilateral triangle   multiple colors
and pictured in a diverse set of lighting and weather conditions 
initial approach  center surround saliency  traffic signs are designed to be salient to the
human visual system and  more often than not  to pop out from their surroundings  therefore 
having extensive experience and understanding of the human perception system  our first
approach to creating a novel segmentation algorithm drew inspiration from the human visual
systems implementation of center surround and bottom up saliency

fiin the human visual system  center surround color opponency describes the behavior of
photoreceptors in the eye that react most prominently to stimuli that stand out from their
surroundings  a red green color opponent photoreceptor fires most rapidly if the center of its
visual field is very red  and the surrounding areas are very green  and least rapidly if the opposite
is true   blue yellow color opponent cells  intensity center surround cells  and orientation
center surround cells behave similarly  although they react to blue yellow color opponency and
differences between orientations of edges in the center and surrounding areas of their visual
fields respectively  
we implemented the model of the human visual

systems bottom up saliency described by itti et al  
which used blue yellow  red green and intensity centersurround  as well as oriented gabor features  in order to

discern which regions of the image were of greatest interest  we
found that high center surround value points part of exceptionally
salient signs such as that in figure    but failed to identify less
prominent signs  such as that in figure   
new approach  color region segmentation  as previously
mentioned  empirical analysis revealed that our saliency based
approach to road sign detection did not provide adequate
performance  we therefore hypothesized that features of regions of

the image would be more informative than saliency values for individual points within an image 
our next approach consisted of segmenting the image into clusters of pixels of similar colors and

fianalyzing properties of these clusters in order to make a prediction of whether they contained
road signs or not 
in order to determine which pixels were of a similar color  we implemented the the kmeans clustering algorithm to compress the input image such that every pixel was one of a small
number of values  we experimentally determined that k   eight clusters provided optimal
performance  as any fewer often caused the pixels of road signs to be grouped along with other
visual elements of the image  such as the sky  we then implemented the union find algorithm to
group neighboring pixels of the same cluster into regions  these regions were the objects of
mta ratio

 pixels inside region  pixels inside tbb  mass to area 

classification  having computed

aspect ratio

width height

statistics to describe each region 

centroid x

location of mass centroid relative to tbb

centroid y

location of mass centroid relative to tbb

we input these as features to
machine learning algorithms 

avg  hues

average rgb components inside tbb outside tbb

 logistic regression  svm 

for each region of neighboring pixels belonging to the same k means cluster   henceforth
referred to as merely regions  we constructed a tangent bounding box  tbb  and computed the
following statistics to use as input features to our machine learning algorithms

   figure   illustrates our recognition process  the first image shows a grey scale version of our k means image compression 

the second image
shows the region  created by union find  that corresponds to the sign  the third image shows the tangent bounding box of the region in the
second image  and the fourth shows the tangent bounding box around the original image  after classifying it as a positive example

  

fiadjusting parameters  we evaluate our success based on our true positive rate  positive   value
 tp  tp   fp   and accuracy  note that for this task  since it is meant to quickly process an
image before running a more sophisticated object recognition algorithm on a small region  our
true positive rate is extremely important  a low true positive rate would mean missed traffic
signs  even at this early stage   we also want to maximize ppv   p traffic sign classified
positive   to ensure we are sufficiently narrowing down the image  as such  for our logistic
regression classifier  we altered the threshold t at which we classified an example as positive 
finding that  for all t        tpr         as the number of false positives decreases dramatically
with increases in t  we ultimately chose a threshold t         testament to the degree of
separation logistic regression provides between positive and negative examples 
for a task performed in moving vehicles  such as traffic sign recognition  algorithmic
efficiency is of obvious importance  unfortunately  unaltered k means and union find are fairly
inefficient  we therefore took measures to optimize both algorithms for this task  we first
limited k means on our test data to a mere    iterations  to increase our performance with such
a small number of k means iterations  we initialized our clusters for our test data to mean
centroids for the training images   with very little change in performance after limiting kmeans to    iterations  we opted to completely forgo running the k means algorithm on our test
images  instead compressing each test image by replacing each pixel in the test image with the
closest mean centroid  taking the same amount of time as one k means iteration  the time to

                                                                                                                
  to  do  this   for  each  k means  centroid  in  the  first  training  image   we  find  the  closest  k means  centroid   by  euclidean  distance   in  each  of  
the  other  training  images   think  nearest  one  neighbor  by  euclidean  distance  for  each  of  the     and  take  the  mean  of  these  n  centroids  
 where  n  is  the  number  of  training  images      we  repeat  for  each  of  the  other  centroids  in  the  first  training  image   so  we  are  left  with  eight  
mean  centroids    one  for  each  k means  cluster     doing  so  increases  the  degree  of  convergence  through      iterations   
 

fifind the nearest centroid   we found that this quick substitution takes roughly        of the
time k means takes to run  
although k means is a fairly slow algorithm  union find accounts for the majority of the
time it takes our algorithm to process a test image  our original implementation involved finding
regions corresponding to all eight k means centroids  instead  we opted to find the average color
within the traffic sign  define a feasible color range  and only find regions corresponding to
colors within the feasible color range  both when training and testing  this both decreased our
number of false positives  our models are now more sensitive to small changes in color related
features  by        on average  and decreased our average computation time for a test image to
      of the former computation time 
results conclusion  we performed    fold cross validation for both the logistic regression and
svm variants of our algorithm  presented below  as we had hoped  our tpr is very high  at
near   for each kind of sign  so very few signs were missed  our ppv values are not high

but are sufficiently high that it is clear we
have succeeded in narrowing down the area of
the original image that could potentially yield

a sign  our accuracy values are extremely high  but these are somewhat inflated due to an
abundance of examples  regions  too small to hold a sign  ultimately  requiring a few seconds
per image  this method of image segmentation may not be ideally suited to a time sensitive task
like traffic sign detection  however  the high true positive rate and sufficiently high ppv imply
that this may be a useful method to screen images for many other object detection tasks 
                                                                                                                
  theoretically   going  from      k means  iterations  to  one  iteration  should  take  only      of  the  time   but  we  implemented  the  quick  
substitution  ourselves  in  matlab   whereas  with      k means  iterations   we  used  matlabs  built in  k means  implementation   which  is
