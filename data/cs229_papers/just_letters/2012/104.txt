analysis for association between genomic information and
survival rate of glioblastoma multiforme
yingying bi  weiruo zhang  jieying luo

   introduction
in order to combat cancer  more and more efforts have been made in genome studies  as cancer is likely to be
caused by errors in dna that let the cells grow uncontrolled  glioblastoma multiforme  gbm  is the most
aggressive malignant brain tumor  and it has a very low survival rate of about one year      it is significant 
if some relationship can be found between the survival rate of gbm patients and the genome information 
the cancer genome atlas  tcga  project collects tumor tissue donated by cancer patients  the tcga data
contains clinical information  genomic characterization data and high throughput sequencing analysis of the
tumor genomes     
in this project  we make use of tcga gene expression data and clinical data  the tcga microarray gene
expression data contains     samples  and each contains       genes indicating gene expression changes  in
the clinical data  there are also     samples  and each sample gives the survival days and censoring information of a patient      samples out of     samples are deceased patients 
we use the gene expression data as features and formulate the problem such that we can predict the survival
time of a patient  this problem is challenging in the following aspects      firstly  sample size is relatively
small  which makes it difficult to identify genes associated with survival from thousands of genes exhibiting
expression changes  secondly  due to the nature of high throughput microarray technologies  many gene
expressions may be random noises  which make them poor indicators  thirdly  different subtypes of cancer
may exist  which adds further complexities to identify the important gene signatures     
in the current literatures  several computational methods to approach this problem have been reported 
firstly  feature selection methods are applied to select important indicators from the gene expression data 
for example  bair et al  used cox proportional hazards model to select genes      and zhang j  et al  made
use of differential gene expression clustering to select differentially expressed gene indicators      secondly 
after the feature selection  computational models such as svm  supervised principal components  partial
least squares  various regression methods etc  are used to predict the survival 
in our project  we followed the standard approach in the current literatures  in the preliminary step  we selected the high variance genes out the       genes  we first applied feature selection on those high variance
genes and then tried different learning methods  including svm and cox regression 

   methods and results
   svm
svms are capable of dealing with a large number of input variables with a slight increase in computation
complexity  and thus it is suitable for the analysis of high dimensional gene expression microarray data  they
can also integrate classification and feature selection in a single consistent framework  therefore  linear svm
is chosen as the classification algorithm 
we started approaching this problem with a simple two classes classification model  according to biomedical statistics  most gbm patients die within one year  therefore  we started by dividing the patient samples
into long survival if they have days to death greater than     days and short survival if they have days todeath smaller than     days  we have noted that there are only    samples are within the range of        
days which may be problematic as they are close to the threshold 
 

fi a  feature selection
we use feature ranking techniques to perform feature selection  a fixed number of top ranked features can
be selected for further analysis or to design a classifier  we apply the svm method of recursive feature
elimination for gene selection  the procedure is implemented as follows     
    start  ranked feature set r        selected feature subset s            d  
    repeat until all features are ranked 
a  train a linear svm with features in set s as input variables 
b  compute the ranking scores for features in set s with certain ranking criterion ci
c  find the feature with the smallest ranking score  e   arg mini ci  
d  update  r    e  r   s   s   e   
    output  ranked feature list r 
two ranking criteria are applied 
criterion    svm rfe      ci   wi    this objective function in linear svm is j        w      using this criterion
of wi  corresponds to removing the features whose removal changes the objective function the least

 b  two classes svm
two rankings of genes are obtained using criterion   and criterion    for each ranking  two versions of
cross validation  cv  have been implemented to design the optimal classifier and find the most correlated
gene subsets  namely  k fold cross validation  k     and hold out cross validation      for training and    
for testing   to reduce variability of cv estimate  the hold out cv is run multiple times and an average is
computed  to testify our cross validation  we also run the same process with randomized survival data and
cv errors are around     as expected  the results are summarized in table i  figure   and figure

criterion   produced an optimal subset of     genes  while criterion   produced an optimal subset of    
genes  they have     genes in common  we find that cross validation prediction performances of r svm
and svm rfe are nearly the same  and they both have very small cv errors  which demonstrates that the
feature selection algorithms worked well  criterion   can offer even smaller cv error 
 

fi c  multiple classes svm
to make the prediction more clinically meaningful  multiple classes svm is also investigated  the distribution of survival days in our dataset is shown in fig     we divide the survival days into several classes such
that each class has a certain number of data and different classes are as separated as possible 
three classes                                 and four classes                                             are
studied  svm is used and the feature selection method is the same as in section      a   as the prediction
becomes more complicated  the cross validation error increases with multiple classes  fig      in the case of
three classes  the

   clustering
because gbm may have different subtypes  simply classifying the patients according to the survival days
may not be biologically meaningful      different subtypes may have different gene signatures but share
wide overlap region in the survival days  classifying patients based on the survival days solely cannot differentiate subtypes and may result in inaccurate predictions

we use k means clustering method to first cluster the data into four clusters  and then apply svm with
multiple classes  to evaluate the quality of clustering  the silhouette value is calculated  fig      the average
silhouette value is          which is comparable to the reported value for clustering gene expression data
      in       each cluster is trained separately using svm with four classes  the performance of prediction
is greatly improved compared to the case of multiple class svm without clustering  fig      also the genes
selected for each cluster are different  which is an indication of potential different subtypes

fi   cox proportional hazard model
one issue with svm model is that it does not take the censoring information  if a patient is still living  we
do not have their number of days to death  thus  those samples are not included in the svm prediction  to
solve this problem  we use cox proportional hazard model to take into account the information of patients
who are still living and turned it into an inferential problem 
let t    t    t       tn   be the times of observation of the n samples  and in the regression  xi is a vector of gene
expressions as predictors xi     xi        xi n   and i is the status indicator  i is   if the patient is dead and i is
  if right censored       the cox model assumes hi  t    h   t  exp xti    where hi  t  is the hazard for patient
i at time t  h   t  is the baseline hazard  and  is a fixed length vector  therefore  we can make the inference
using the partial likelihood

where ri is the set of indices j  using    penalties to maximize the partial likelihood  we can obtain the
value for   we use the r package glmnet  implemented by simon n et al       which reduces the partial
likelihood maximization problem into a repeatedly solving penalized weighted least squares problem

after obtaining   we use kaplan meier curves in the cross validation      as shown in figure    let b denotes
the vector of regression coefficients and x denotes the vector of gene expressions  if bi       then the gene
i is not included in the prediction  for k fold cross validation  b k  is the vector of regression coefficients
based on training set  d  dk    if a sample j in testing set dk has predictive index b k  xj which is larger than
the median of b k  xi of the training set  then the sample j in testing set is assigned to higher risk group  otherwise  it is assigned to lower risk group  higher risk means lower survival rate for the samples in the group 
we calculated the p value to test the statistical significance between the high risk km curve and low risk km
curve using r package survival survdiff function  we obtained p value of          p        as the significance  which indicates that the two groups are differentiated and the predictions for survival is significant 

 

fi   discussion
we have tried two models to approach this problem  namely classification and inference  in the classification
model  two classes model and multiple classes model can both produce reasonable cross validation errors 
multiple classes model has higher errors  but it is more accurate in association with survival in the sense
that it separates the classes of samples more than only two classes  by using clustering to first divide the
samples  the results can be further improved  we find several important genes which have higher ranking
in the clustering result than that of the multiple classes svm result  for example  igfbp  ranked     in
the multiple classes svm result  but it is ranked  th in cluster    this further indicates that gbm may have
several different subtypes  and each may have different set of gene signatures 
in the inference model  cox proportional hazard model makes use of the censoring data and finds fewer
gene signatures than that of classification model  by comparing the inferential results of high risk survival
and low risk survival  it is clearly that the two groups are differentiated 
we compare the results of the three methods  and some interesting genes are identified as shown in table ii

   conclusion
to summarize  we have tried both classification model and inference model to the problem  we find that
there are clearly some association between the gene expression and gbm survival information  there are also
some important gene signatures identified which are proved experimentally to be associated with survival
