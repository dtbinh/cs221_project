introduction

   

end  multi class classification algorithm based on gaussian
discriminative analysis  gda  is implemented 
on the basis of the two separately constructed statistical
models  the joint pdf for wind field features and the wind
turbine load classification function  the expected wind turbine class can be calculated in a probability framework 
from a lifetime health monitoring perspective  it is important to tack the expected wind turbine load given a certain atmospheric condition rather than simply identifying
abnormal loads  the instantaneously monitored abnormal
loads do not necessarily indicate the deterioration in a wind
turbine system since these loads can be caused by strong
wind in a short duration  in contrast  if the expected load
changes over a time  it can possibly indicate that the system is under abnormal conditions  the expected wind turbine load classes are compared between the day and night
time conditions as an example  the overall framework and
objectives are summarized in figure   

motivation

the stable boundary layer  sbl  is a stably stratified atmospheric layer that usually forms in the night over land when
the earth cools as a result of a net loss of radiation     the
wind field characteristics in sbl distinctly differ from those
in unstable boundary layer that forms in the daytime  figures   a  and   b  show how the longitudinal wind speed
and the wind direction change with the time  the variations in wind field characteristics accordingly affect the
wind turbine responses such as extreme load  power output  and fatigue damage  understandings in the wind field
characteristics variation and the corresponding impacts on
a wind turbine  therefore  very important not only for designing but also for managing a wind turbine effectively

objective

the machine learning algorithms are applied  in this paper 
to understand i  how the wind field characteristics change
depending on atmospheric conditions and ii  how wind turbine loads are affected by different wind field characteristics  the variations in wind field characteristics are investigated by comparing the joint probability distribution function  pdf  for wind field input features  gaussian mixture
model  gmm  is implemented to construct the pdfs conditional on the time  day and night times  the influence of
wind field on wind turbine loads are studied by constructing
the wind turbine load classification model mapping wind
field input features to wind turbine load statistics  to this

 
   

methodology
input and output data

we use wind fields simulated by the computational fluid dynamic code  large eddy simulation  and the corresponding
wind turbine load responses simulated by the aerodynamic
wind turbine load analysis code  fast      the characteristics of a    min long wind field are described by timeaveraged statistics  the mean wind speed at a wind turbine
hub height u   the power exponent  describing the steepness of the vertical wind profile  and the standard deviation
 

fiand em algorithm  the two pdfs can be updated during
the daytime and the night time  respectively  with respect
to gda  the wind field input data are divided into training and testing data sets  both of which consists of     
sets of input output pairs  x i    y  i     the wind input features from both daytime and the night time are included
to the training data to exposure the the leaning algorithm
to wide range of input feature space  note that the gda
algorithm can be continuously updated regardlessly of the
time since the output are assumed to depend only on the
input feature vector x

of wind speed u measuring the level of turbulence  wind
turbine blade bending moment statistics  the    min maximum load and the equivalent fatigue damage  are used as
outputs  the input and output statistics are depicted in
figure  

 

background

   

there are two types of classification methods in machine
learning  one is discriminativeapproach that directly map
input x to output y using parametric fitting  the other
approach is generativealgorithm differentiating data on the
basis of input features distributional information learned
from data  for both classification methods  two class 
binary classification algorithm have been matured  while
multi class classification has not yet extensively studied     
surveyed different type of supervised multi class classification methods  most of which are based on binary classifications      has proposed linear discriminative in classifying
multi labeling problem  in this study  gaussian discriminative analysis  gda  will be implemented in classifying
the wind turbine load statistics 
the wind turbine load function l x  is constructed using
the gaussian discriminative analysis  gda   the gda
is a generative learning algorithm that classify the input
features label using the learned input feature distribution 
given the training data set  the posterior distribution on y
given x is modeled according to bayes rule as follows

where p x y  is the input feature distribution given the output label y  and p y  is the class priori  then  to classify
the label for the new input feature xnew   the label can be
selected according to the maximum a posteriori detection
 map  principle as follows

to validate the proposed framework  we compare the
expected wind turbine loads between the two operating
times  day  unstable atmosphere  and night  stable atmosphere   given          min wind field time series and
the corresponding       wind turbine load times series 
we extract the      sets of input wind feature vectors 
x    u     u    and the corresponding      load statistics y    ymax   yef l    figure   shows how the sets of
wind field input feature vectors and the wind turbine load
statistics are used for modeling the statistical model via
the gmm and the gda  for the gmm  we first classify
wind field input data into two groups  day time and night
time data on the basis of the time  then  the conditional
pdfs are modeled for the day time fx w  x i   w   day 
and for the night time fx w  x i   w   night  using gmm

finite mixture models are effective way for statistical modeling of data  which has been widely used for unsupervised
clustering and density estimation     in structural health
monitoring community  gaussian mixture model has been
used for identifying damages in a structure on the basis
of estimated output feature distribution     in this paper 
the wind field features characterizing the wind field are depicted by the their joint probabiilty density function constructed by gaussian mixture model  the centers  shapes 
and dispersion of pdfs depending on different atmospheric
condition can give us insight into how the wind field evolves 
the join pdf fx w  x w  conditional on an atmospheric
condition w is constructed on the basis of the mixtures

expectation maximization  em  algorithm  the mixture

into how a wind turbine experiences different levels of a

figure   compares the  d joint pdfs of wind field input
features for the day and night time  the x  y  and z axes
represent  respectively  the mean wind speed at the hub
height u   power exponent   and standard deviation of
wind speed u   therefore  the location of each dot specifies a    min wind field characteristic  and the color of the
dot shows the relative probability calculated by the joint
pdfs constructed by gmm  for the construction of pdfs 
four gaussian mixtures are used and em algorithm is applied  due to the modeled pdfs  the probability of any
combination of wind field input features x    u     u  
can be calculated  the calculated probability of wind input
features are shown in three marginal pdfs  which are the
projections of the  d pdfs on the subspace spanned by
the three combination of input features   u       u   u  
and    u     the marginal pdfs are shown in figure  
for the day and night times 
the two  d pdfs clearly show the variation in the characteristics of wind field between the day and night time 
wind fields in the daytime has more large dispersion in
each input feature than the night time wind field  this is
because unstable boundary layer  daytime  has more active
air flow mixing due to the convection

polynomial kernel technic is used  it is worth noting that
the exact load classification is not necessary for the wind
turbine life cycle management perspective  but is is important how the distribution of the classes vary depending on
the atmospheric and wind turbine operational conditions 

classification of load using gda

wind turbine load classification results are summarized in
figure    the two blade load statistics    min maximum
and equivalent fatigue load corresponding to      set of
input features vectors are classified into    levels  the histogram for the measured and predicted classes are compared in each figure  figure  a for the    min maximum
load and figure  b for the equivalent fatigue load   the
distribution of classes  histogram  for the measured and
predicted cases are compared and are shown to be comparable  in addition  the classification errors  defined as
y  y  are plotted for each input output pair  the percentage of the exact classification  y  y      is about
    due to the small input feature dimension     and large
number of classes       however  if the error criterion is re
