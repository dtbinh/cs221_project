abstract
one method for analyzing pediatric b cell leukemia is to categorize each malignant cell
based on its resemblance to one of   stages in b cell development  researchers hand
label  gate  b cell maturity by drawing separate gates per patient  however  this
process is both time consuming and must be done patient by patient due to the
heterogeneity of each cancer  we aimed to automate this gating process with one
classification algorithm for all patients  we found that a crammer svm algorithm
classifies cells with     accuracy  indicating that information from other dimensions of
the data can compensate for patient specific differences  this revealed that we can
reliably apply a consistent framework to a diverse set of patients 

background
a struggle in cancer cell biology is the heterogeneity of the disease  each cell in a cancer sample
is different  as is each patient  therefore amidst this chaos of cancer it is challenging to define a
structure that could provide insight into cancer development  progression  and outcome 
b cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia  all  is a hematologic cancer where b cells  the antibodyproducing cells of the immune system  become mutated and excessively proliferative during
development  current work in dr  garry nolans lab involves looking at protein expression on
single cells from bone marrow from b cell all patients  cells in a given sample are stained
with metal conjugated antibodies specific for certain antigens or proteins  using a technique
called mass cytometry  or cytof   the time of flight of the ions conjugated to those antibodies
provides a readout of the levels of each protein on each cell   this outputs a matrix of      
cells by     parameters  proteins  that we have measured

work in our lab has found a potential structure for understanding b cell all  kara davis and
sean bendall found that healthy b cell development can be broken down into a progression of
seven stages based on the expression of certain sets of markers  proteins  on each b cell  figure
 a   using this definition of healthy development  dr  davis imposed this framework onto the

fiall samples  assigning each malignant b cell a maturity score based on its resemblance of
that given developmental stage  figure  b   this assignment revealed that each sample has a
different composition of cells from each stage in b cell development  i e patient a has mostly b
cells in stage   and    whereas patient b has mostly b cells in stages   and   for instance   we
have on the order of      cells from nine patients that have been assignment a maturity score by
the researcher who has gated the data by hand 

statement of the problem
assigning maturity to the cells within the cancer may provide insight into the structure and
progression of the tumor  perhaps having implications for patient outcome  when hand gating 
the researcher takes into account   of the    dimensions to separate the populations  drawing a
new personalized gate for each patient  however  it remains to be seen how well one classifier
can perform on cells from different patients  as there is a large amount of person to person
variation in protein expression  the goal of this project is to automate b cell maturity gating 
which is time consuming for the researcher  as well as determine how well we can impose a
common framework to a diverse set of patients 
it was clear that a subset of the cells could be correctly assigned with high confidence because
they have an unambiguous phenotype that matches normal b cell development  for cells near
the stage boundaries  some degree of misclassification is unavoidable due to the unique cellular
makeup of that patient  however  we hypothesized that some features we have measured on
those cells could help classify them better  allowing us to determine what fraction of cells we can
classify with confidence to get the distribution of b cell maturity within a given patient 

methods and results
pre processing the data
the ion pulses from the mass cytometer are extracted as cell events and written to a  fcs file
format  the data were then visualized and hand gated  first removing debris and non b cells  by
kara davis using the analysis software at cytobank org  we then exported a separate  fcs file for
each population for each patient and converted them to a data matrix for learning in matlab 
models and justification
for this project we needed to consider multiclass classification algorithms  as we have seven
populations  we decided to test three multi class algorithms in the liblinear package  
 softmax  the multi class extension of logistic regression
 one vs  all support vector machine  a set of binary svm classifiers
 crammer multi class svm   an all in one svm classifier
these algorithms were selected based on the analysis of aly et al and hsu et al on the
performance of multi class classifiers      for the svm algorithms  we used a linear kernel
because it performed well and the gaussian kernel was too computationally expensive for the
size of our data 
in addition  we wanted to contrast these discriminative algorithms with a generative algorithm 
protein expression in populations of healthy cells is often considered to be normally distributed
 though this may not be the case in cancer due to abnormal protein expression   therefore we

fiimplemented gaussian discriminant analysis  modeling each population as a multivariate
gaussian  each with its own mean and variance  
model selection
we compared the four aforementioned algorithms using k fold cross validation  we used a
special form of k fold cross validation where we left out all the cells from one patient each time
rather than a random subset of the pooled cells  we used this method to accurately simulate
evaluating cells from a new patient that was not used to train the model  this method reveals the
variance of a models performance patient to patient  i e  how well we can trust performance on a
given patient rather than the average performance   it was also informative in analyzing whether
any of our patients was a strong outlier

as plotted in figure    the crammer svm performed best with        average accuracy  it also
performed the most consistently across patients  in addition  we varied the cost parameter c on
each of our svm and softmax models as described in hsu et al  and saw little change in model
performance  figure  a  
for a full analysis of the success of the crammer svm classifier  we generated a confusion
matrix from the predictions to extract precision and recall values for each population  as shown
in figure  b  precision and recall were high across all populations  increasing our confidence in
our model  never dropping below

feature selection
we were interested in running a feature selection algorithm to gain insight into which features
our best classification algorithm was using  we ran a forward search to select the top ten
features and  as expected  our top four features were those used by the researcher to initially gate
the data  cd    tdt  cd    and cd    figure     those features alone classify the data with
    accuracy  however  taking into account additional features  cd  b  cd   cd    cd  d 
and hla dr  increased accuracy by       this indicates that other dimensions of the data can
help the algorithm generalize to more than one patient  though it performs quite well looking
only at the first four

discussion
in all  we found the accuracy  precision  and recall were significantly better for crammer svm
than any of the other models  yielding an average accuracy of         this model  along with
the other svm models  worked nearly the same with all choices of the cost parameter  as
expected  most of the accuracy could be attained using only the four features used by the

firesearcher in hand gating  however  our classifier achieved a notable gain when using more
features 
the crammer svm model was predictably the most successful svm because it directly
optimizes the multiclass classification problem rather than approximating it with a one vs all
method for each class  it was slower  but still classified in a reasonable time on our data 
gaussian discriminant analysis performed surprisingly poorly  in general  the distributions of
cells within a stage of development are often considered to be gaussian over the parameters that
we considered  however  due to the abnormality of the cancer cells and the fact that their forms
only approximate these stages of normal cells  the distributions are more abnormal and this likely
made the gaussian model too strong of an assumption 
our results from feature selection were promising  the features beyond the four used by the
researcher increased the accuracy of our classifier  telling us that it was working intelligently 
these extra features  which do not directly relate to which stage of development a b cell is in 
help the classifier adjust the thresholds in the primary four dimensions differently for each
patient  for example  a patient with particularly large cells would have a higher measure in all
parameters  thus  higher values in extra features inform the classifier to adjust the classification
threshold for the primary features  this allows our classifier to work generally across patients
with different cell profiles  something that a human researcher would have to do case by case 
these results are very exciting for the researcher and she plans to use this algorithm in future
work  she will be analyzing many more patients  n        and she now has a method for gating
the developmental populations efficiently and consistently  furthermore  she will have matched
clinical data that includes treatment response  disease progression  and outcome  we will
continue working with her to build predictive models for clinical data using the maturity scores
across patients
