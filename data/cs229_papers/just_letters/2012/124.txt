introduction
dark matters gravitational pull affects the positions of galaxies in the universe  if
galaxies were circular  detecting the locations of dark matter halos would be directly based on
the ellipticity of the surrounding galaxies  however  galaxies are inherently elliptical  and this
property is random  our challenge is to account for this randomness when finding the center
of dark matter halos  our data set includes simulated skies with one  two  or three halos and
our task was to find their centers  we found that using the sum of the tangential ellipticities   of
surrounding galaxies was the most salient signal for determining halo locations  while this can
be directly determined for one halo skies  two and three halo skies required more sophisticated
methods due to interactions between multiple halos 

data
kaggle provides all of the data for this problem  which consists of     simulated skies
with         galaxies in each  each galaxy has an x  y coordinate  and ellipticity components  e 
and e   each sky has a given number of one to three halos 

proposed methods
the following initial methods were overall unsuccessful  but were essential in helping us gain an
understanding of our data and for leading us towards our eventual proposed solution 

histograms of angle and magnitude
description for single histogram approach
in this method we divide the sky into m rectangles
  for each bin 
training example we built a x histogram of angles by magnitudes  both calculated from
ellipticity   with this representation of the data  we created our design matrix
such that each
row of the matrix is a training example and each column is an angle magnitude bucket of the
histogram corresponding to that training example 
results
this initial method was a largely unsuccessful strategy for identifying our cluster
locations  we found that the bin containing the halo did not have very indicative features
since we would also had very few galaxies per bin  furthermore  we suspected that a bin might
actually be better at indicating halos in adjacent bins since the galaxies would essentially point
in that direction  this insight inspired us to use a multi histogram approach to try to identify the
general location of the halos 
description for multi histogram approach
we modified our design matrix x such that each row training example had nine
histograms concatenated together  the histogram for the rectangle of interest and the
histograms of the eight surrounding rectangles  
results
 

the ellipticity of a galaxy at a position  x y  tangential to a point  x  y   is e tangential   e cos    e sin     
where the angle of the galaxy with respect to the dark matter center is given by   atan  y y    x x    

fiunfortunately  this approach also performed disappointingly  using an svm on our data
yielded a model that predicted that no halos were present in our test skies  therefore with    
bins we had at least a     accuracy rate on training skies due to our skewed data  but this result
is clearly not helpful because it gives us no indication of the halo location  and our models least
sure negative predictions were only rarely the correct positive predictions 
conclusion
the evidence reveals the largest difficulty in analyzing our data   the massive amount of
noise in the ellipticity of our galaxies  the effect of a halo on its surrounding galaxies seems to
be so slight that using a subset of our galaxies would make the effects statistically insignificant 
we therefore decided to pursue more holistic approaches that attempt to get rid of the noise of
individual galaxies 

clustering galaxy positions with k means
description
the general strategy of this approach is to use clusters in an attempt to get rid of the
noise of individual galaxies  this approach can be divided into three steps 
   cluster the galaxies into k clusters based on their x y position in the  d sky
   calculate the average ellipticity and magnitude of each cluster
   weight the position of each cluster based on its average ellipticity magnitude to calculate
a predicted halo position
the number of clusters used significantly affected the success of our guesses  with too few
clusters       the average ellipticity of clusters were telling  but we would not have enough
clusters to make an accurate guess  with too many clusters       the large amount of noise
from galaxies was not averaged out so making accurate guesses from these results proved
difficult  we found a medium amount of clusters          gave us the best results 
results
we were able to generate features by using a fixed number of clusters and using our
various average cluster centroids  average ellipticities  and average magnitudes to predict the
halo location  because k means clustering can generate different results depending on the
cluster starting location  we decided that we should generate multiple guesses and average our
results  we did    iterations on each of the     skies  we applied this method to skies with only
one halo   and found that on average we were about     pixels away from the actual location of
the halo  the sky is      x      pixels  
conclusion
this approach is able to more accurately guess on some skies  but fails significantly on
skies with halos to the sides of the sky and with multi halo skies  although this approach got
rid of some of the randomness of galaxy ellipticity  it does not give features that can accurately
predict halo location 

reflection on previous methods
our failed attempts pushed us to approach the problem from a different perspective 
instead of looking at individual or clusters of galaxies and seeing where they guess a halo is 
we considered a specific location and assigned it a likelihood of being the position of the dark
matter halo center  the best indicator was tangential ellipticity 

final methods
subtraction approach

fiin this approach  we define our signal of the most likely halo location to be the sum
of the tangential ellipticities with respect to that location  if there is only one halo  we take
the location with the strongest signal  if there are multiple halos  the effect of the prior halos
is subtracted out before determining the strongest signal  this is possible because tangential
ellipticities from different halos add linearly  
to determine the signal  we divide the sky up into bins  for each bin  we calculate the
tangential ellipticity  the center of the bin with the highest tangential ellipticity is set as the
initial point for a smoothed annealing algorithm that refines the peak signal location  the
result becomes the guess for the dark matter halo  on average  our guesses for the initial halo
position in all skies were        pixels from the actual position  this high accuracy is due to one
halo almost always dominating the sky with its effects  while the remaining less massive halos
became harder to locate precisely 
to determine how to subtract the effect of a halo  we model the force of a halo on
the ellipticities of surrounding galaxies as   where r is the radial distance to a halo  since
the cross component of the tangential ellipticity is zero  we can find this force in terms of
the ellipticity components  e  and e   and subtract it from the e  and e  of each galaxy  the
variables a and b are learned by finding the best fit between the force s e  and e  and the actual
sky s e  and e  
for two halo skies  we locate the first halo  then  we calculate the  best  parameters
and
to eliminate the first and second halos  respectively  the  best  parameters
are those that eliminate both halos in such a way that the resulting sky appears to have no
halos  this happens in two layers of optimization  the top level optimizes

  for each

iteration 
are used to subtract out the effect of the first halo  the highest seven resulting
signal peaks are chosen as potential second halo locations  for each of these choices  an
inner optimization layer tries to find the optimal
  after optimizing on both layers  the
second halo location with the minimum cost becomes the second halo guess  this two layer
optimization performed better than finding the first halo location  subtracting its effect based
on and learned from the one halo skies in the dataset  and choosing the second halo location
based on the highest signal from the resulting sky 
for three halo skies  we built on the two halo procedure with a third layer of
optimization  we find the optimal choice of a    b  which depends on the third halo location 
which comes from the optimal choice of a    b  which in turn depends on the second halo
location  which is ultimately based on our optimal a    b   this strategy worked successfully  but
was far too time consuming  so for our final results we subtracted the first halos effect using
the result of a neural network learned on the one halo training data  this method was very
successful and efficient on most of our training data  on average  our proposed halo locations
were off by     pixels from the actual halo location 
below  we see this method successfully identifying halos in skies with one  two  and three
halos using the methods described above 

fione halo sky

two halo sky

three halo sky

we tried a variety of methods to improve our results  the galaxies  ellipticities almost
perfectly fit a gaussian distribution with sigma       so we tried gaussian filtering to help get rid
of some of the noise in the data  we also tried restricting our calculations of tangential ellipticity
to a certain radius around the point of the proposed halo to cope with interfering effects 
neither of these improved our results  we believe that this is because it ended up losing more
information than it clarified 

modeling approach
this approach assumes an einasto profile  to model tangential ellipticity as a function of
distance  it was suggested that this equation might be a
good fit  chivers   we confirmed this by fitting the
equation  and learning its coefficients  from the tangential
ellipticity and distance of one halo skies  the fit is shown in
the figure to the right  we used this model to determine
what a noise free sky would look like with halos in certain
locations  the optimization objective is to find halo
locations that result in a sky model that has the least meansquared difference from an actual sky 
for one halo skies  we find the halo location via the same procedure as in the subtraction
approach  for two halo skies  we find the first halo in the same way and incorporate its effect
into the model for that sky  then  we optimize for the second halo location using a multi start
minimization algorithm to find the best sky model  we determine the starting locations by
subtracting out the effect of the first halo and creating a matrix that represents the signal at
the centers of cells in a    by    grid of the sky  the top ten peaks are used as starting locations 
choosing the top peaks  rather than the top bins  prevents starting locations from all being
clustered together in particularly high signal areas  the procedure for three halo skies builds on
 

the equation for the einasto profile is a exp  b r c   where r is radial distance   einasto profile   

fithis by optimizing instead on the locations of both the second and third halos  we determine the
starting locations for the third halo by subtracting out the effect for each of the second halo start
points 
the resulting sky models reflected the sky well  as seen below  the actual sky is on the
left and our model is on the right   however  there were other cases that satisfied the goal of the
algorithm  but resulted in halo location guesses that were in corners or on edges 

conclusion and future work
we are proud of our algorithms performance  but see further work that can potentially
improve our results  for example  we began exploring the use of neural nets to learn different
ways of subtracting halos based on whether it was dominant  secondary  or minor in the sky  so
far this approach showed promise on a couple of difficult skies  but we were not able to get it
fully functional 
we also observed that particular algorithms worked better on certain skies than others 
so it would be beneficial to use different algorithms depending on the situation  as a result 
we believe that we could improve our performance by running several of our most successful
algorithms  and then have each of them evaluate their confidence based on their mean squared
difference  an evaluation of the sky  and their prediction locations  then we could use a voting
system to choose the predictions of the most confident algorithms 
we also hoped to apply more physics to apply the true lensing effect that dark matter
halos have on surrounding galaxies instead of our simplified version of the lensing equations 
we should be careful of using this method because the simulated skies in the dataset also do not
use the true physics  but to make this program truly applicable in finding real dark matter halos 
incorporating this physics would be a necessary step
