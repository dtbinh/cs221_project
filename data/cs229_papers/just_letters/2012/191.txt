abstract
we apply stylometric techniques to determine the authors of posts in online forums  after selecting a small number      of features by information gain  we used the naive bayes and support
vector machine algorithms to perform multiclass classification  the svm achieves the best performance  being     accurate on the six most frequent posters in the data set and     accurate
on the top     using ten fold cross validation   accuracy is limited by short posts and the number
and types of features used  but proof of concept is achieved 

 

introduction

one of the world wide webs most integral features is the possibility  in principal  of complete anonymity 
though todays web is not anonymous by default  tools like tor      encryption  and careful browsing
habits can render users difficult to trace and hamper the association of multiple online identities with a
single behind the scenes individual  while this may be a good thing for political dissidents living under
oppressive regimes  in other circumstances it would be desirable to remove anonymity to whatever extent
possible  e g  in the case of law enforcement monitoring the communications of criminals or terrorists
over cyber channels  in particular  the discussion forums of such malicious actors are of great interest 
interesting questions include  who are these people  could anonymous posters in forums be linked to
facebook accounts   on what other sites do they post  are any of them using multiple usernames  i e 
how many distinct individuals exist in an organization  
this project applies machine learning techniques to perform stylometric analysis on online forum
posts  stylometry  the study of linguistic style  was used long before the internet existed to resolve
historical authorship disputes  in the information age  it has been studied as a means to identify
bloggers  it is essentially the only tool one has to attempt to reveal or track anonymous entities in web
forums  this environment presents challenges  however  the very short length of many forum posts
yields little stylometric information  many users are only active on a forum for a brief time  making few
posts before their activity ceases  it is an open question as to what extent stylometry can succeed in
such an environment

data

the data were obtained by scraping posts from an online forum  name omitted to respect privacy  via
a custom written php script  the collected corpus contains     unique usernames and        posts  a
small core of long term participants accounts for a majority of these posts  the    most frequent posters
are responsible for     of all posts  the six most frequent posters account for     of all posts  some
basic sanitization was performed  primarily removing quotations to prevent confusing text written by
different authors 

 

methods

there are essentially two components to stylometry  feature selection and classification algorithm 
most features were selected from previous literature         though a few  like time of posting and use
of emoticons  were unique to this project  information gain was used to select the most useful features 
this quantity is defined  for a feature distributed among posts according to a probability distribution
x  as  ig y  x    h y    h y  x   y is the probability distribution for a post to be written by a
each author  h y   is the entropy  of that probability distribution  h y  x  is the conditional entropy
of the author distribution given the distribution of the feature in question  since all the features were
continously valued  they had to be discretized before information gain could be calculated  this was
done via a heuristic algorithm based on the notion that bins should on average have a width proportional
to the average standard deviation of that feature among all users  but should also contain roughly equal
numbers of examples  we used the top fifteen features as ranked by information gain  using more
features than this number involved diminishing returns  likey linked in part to the high frequency of
short  ambiguously authored posts  in some cases adding features even worsened performance  keeping
the list short has the added benefit of computational efficiency  a very serious implementation would
use hundreds of features  but this was unnecessary for a proof of principle exercise  brief descriptions
of the selected features are found in table

fithe top features can be seen in figure      the same set of features was found to be best for all
users with      posts and       posts  though the ordering changed slightly  for example  time ofposting is more important when users with fewer posts are included  possibly because the more frequent
posters have broader distributions of posting times  it is interesting that some useful features are either
not available or less powerful in other stylometric applications  for example  time of posting makes
little sense in the context of books or newspaper articles  although it could conceivably be applicable
in the blogosphere   others  like the fraction of characters that are punctuation  the average number
of apostrophes per word  and the fraction of characters that are upper case  are likely so useful in
forums precisely because there is little incentive for individuals to follow the established rules of english
orthography beyond making the effort necessary to be understood  this is an important aspect of
stylometry in forums that differs from other application regimes 

figure      the top features  ranked by information gain 
two algorithms were used  the first was a multinomial naive bayes classifier with laplace smoothing  it was implemented in python and used the same discretizations used to calculate the information
gain  the second was a support vector machine  svm   rather than implement our own  we used the
svc support vector machine in the open source scikit learn     python module  which itself uses
libsvm       multi class classification is handled by constructing a binary classifier for each pair of users 
the decision process is then treated as an election in which each classifier votes for a particular
user      since the various features all had different value ranges  we rescaled the extracted features
to have mean   and standard deviation   before running the svm  a number of different kernels were
   
experimented with  linear  exponential  e x x      and polynomial kernels of various degree  the best

performing kernel was found to be quadratic in the inner product of the feature vectors  specifically

is roughly six percentage points better than a linear kernel  using higher degree polynomials does not
yield improvements in accuracy 

 

results

the performance of these algorithms is summarized in table    two  non disjoint  subsets of users were
tested  those with more than     posts  six individuals  and those with more than    posts  forty six
individuals   ten fold cross validation was used to assess the accuracies  the selected folds were the
same for both algorithms  in all cases random chance is outperformed by a significant amount  though
the accuracy is reduced for the larger set of users  it is actually better compared to random than for fewer
users  a major factor limiting performance is very short posts  which contain little stylistic information
and are thus difficult to attribute  as an example of this  training and testing on only posts with more
than ten words for those users with greater than     posts improves the accuracies to      and     
percent  for naive bayes and the svm  respectively  to give some indication of the challenges involved
in separating the data with the chosen features  figure     shows an example svm classification using
three posters and two features  the substantial overlap of the data highlights the need to use many
features and nonlinear decision boundaries

conclusions

this project represents proof of concept for stylometry in online forums where data is often noisy and
less abundant than in other written environments  improvements could certainly be made  it is difficult
to imagine significant progress on attributing extremely short posts  e g   welcome to the forum    but
the use of more extensive feature sets may improve accuracy for longer posts  examples of promising
features include function word frequencies  see      and recognition of particular phrases or grammatical constructs preferred by posters  which would require some level of natural language processing to
extract   the objective of long term interest  which was not demonstrated here  remains cross domain
attribution  so that actors in an anonymous context can be linked with known actors in a non anonymous
context by posting style
