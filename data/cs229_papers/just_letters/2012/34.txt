   abstract
authorship attribution is the task of identifying the writer of a linguistic sample  the project s aim is to analyze machine
learning techniques to identify authors of writing samples based on stylistic markers  film reviews by users on the imdb
website provides an extensive dataset for authorship analysis  we use supervised learning to address the problem of
identifying the author of an unknown review from a set of authors  the performance of different feature representations 
specifically bag of words and syntactic lexical features  is analyzed  we propose a hybrid feature representation using a
compact set of syntactic lexical features and character n grams that gives high accuracy on the supervised learning problem
while also being less computationally expensive and context agnostic 

   introduction
authorship identification has historically been used in determining authorship of unattributed texts and resolving claims of
plagiarism  such as the disputed authorship of the federalist papers as studied by mosteller and wallace      with the
proliferation of electronic text  this area is becoming increasingly important in various scenarios such as identifying email
spammers  online fraud and terror message origination  trollers on message boards  and writers of malicious code 
some past work on authorship identification has focused on email datasets or journal articles      writing samples from
such datasets may not be truly indicative of a persons writing style due to external factors  for our authorship analysis
study  we used movie reviews posted by users on imdb website  the underlying hypothesis is that movie reviews would
better capture individual stylistic nuances as these are sufficiently informal  uninfluenced and free from context specific
jargon 
authorship analysis can be framed either as a supervised learning problem that requires a priori knowledge of the training
class labels or as an unsupervised learning approach that uses techniques to cluster unlabeled writing samples based on
similarity of stylistic markers  some past studies on authorship identification have been limited to large text corpora by a
few authors        we try to address the problem of authorship identification in the online domain  where feature
representation needs to be compact and scalable over large number of potential authors with limited writing samples 

   methodology and results
we primarily address the question  can we determine the author of an unclassified text from a set of n authors whose
writing samples are available  extension to unsupervised approach to the problem is also discussed towards the end 
    dataset and feature generation
imdb has many active users  with a good number of contributors who have reviews in excess of      we scraped the
reviews from the imdb website for    highly prolific contributors  refer to the user as in this example
http   www imdb com user ur         comments   any explicit information that may aid in the classification  but is
unrelated to the writing style is removed  for instance  the username of the contributor or the date on which the review
was written  the average length of a movie review in our dataset was around     words 

 

fithese writing samples are then parsed to generate relevant features  for a preliminary analysis  we generated a bag ofwards representation for the reviews  this gave rise to tokens  features  that are in excess of         to arrive at a more
compact feature representation  we looked at stylistic features for authorship analysis  these are features which are
invariant to texts written by a particular author but differ across the writings of different authors  a lot of research has been
done on stylistic markers  but there is little consensus on which features constitutes a set of strong stylistic markers that
can be used to differentiate authors  juola argues that syntactic features such as function words and part of speech based
features are more effective than vocabulary based features     
we have chosen a set of     markers that is a combination of lexical  syntactic and structural features  we used python
with the nltk library for feature extraction  some of the features used are shown below



lexical  uppercase and special characters  number of unique words  word length frequency
structural  average sentence or paragraph length
syntactic  occurrence of function words  or punctuations             

    performance analysis
we found through experimentation that a regularized logistic regression based optimizer performed best on the problem 
often giving better results than svm or nave bayes  for the    author classification task using syntactic lexical features 
svm gave an overall accuracy of     on the test data  as compared to      achieved by regularized logistic regression  all
our results are  therefore  with respect to an l  regularized logistic regression using one vs  the rest implementation for
multi class classification     
fig    shows the performance of the bag of words representation with that of syntactic lexical feature based approach on
the test data  as the training set size is varied  as can be seen  the latter performs better when the training size is limited 
while the bag of words representation gives higher accuracy with more training data  the syntactic lexical features      in
total  achieve comparable performance  we further analyzed the top features obtained by either representation using
random forests  rf  with     trees to measure variable feature importance      as can be seen from fig    a   the most
important features under bag of words approach were             spoilers  etc  moreover  bag of words also uses
proper nouns such as movie name and directors name  these features are highly context specific to the domain of movie
reviews

syntactic lexical features

fig    a    b   rf feature importance for bag of words and syntactic lexical representation

for a generalized authorship detection task  such heavy dependence on the training data may not be desirable  thus  we
consider the syntactic lexical approach to be superior since in this case  the trained model is likely to suffer from less
variance when fed with test samples that are not from the same source  for instance  when comparing emails or product
reviews by the same set of writers  the heterogeneity of the context will not affect performance of the model  given these
advantages  we further probed into syntactic lexical features to identify the most important amongst them and to prevent
over fitting  we used forward search feature selection to identify the top contributing features and the incremental
increase in accuracy upon each feature addition  fig    b  shows the top results from feature selection on a set of   
authors  along with rf based feature importance  since there is correlation in the features  we found that top    features
contributed maximally to the classification accuracy  and the rest did not improve it appreciably 
also  top    features identified by the above feature selection method on different sets of authors were local to that
particular set of authors  thus  a global set of features that will offer improved accuracy could not be achieved through this 
therefore  we aimed at identifying a compact global feature list that would perform well across any set of authors chosen
for the supervised learning problem 
    hybrid representation
character n grams have been widely used in text classification  particularly in the online medium  as they are more robust
to spelling inaccuracies      they can also capture more subtle stylistic nuances like the presence of punctuations  e g      
and have therefore been previously used for authorship identification      we generated a new feature set of character ngrams  n ranging from      and selected the top      based on rf variable importance as used earlier  using only these
character n grams as the feature set gave classification accuracies similar to that obtained by the syntactic features 

 

fito generate a universal feature set for our problem  we used the rf based feature importance to select the top    
features combining both the syntactic lexical and character n grams  we found that beyond      any incremental increase
in features led to inconsequential improvement in accuracy  the hybrid feature set concisely captures the best features
from both character n grams and syntactic lexical features  thus  prevents over fitting  and remains globally applicable
across different author sets  there are    syntactic features in this list of     global features selected through feature
importance 
this hybrid feature set performed substantially better in classification of different number of authors  improving the
accuracy by        over the corresponding classification using either only syntactic feature or character n grams 
moreover  the results obtained were within     of the corresponding accuracy from bag of words representation  this is
noteworthy given that the hybrid list is compact and relatively context free  fig    shows the accuracy obtained by the
different feature representations on the authorship identification task 
fig   shows the performance of hybrid feature representation relative to the syntactic lexical feature representation for
classification of   and    authors as the training size is varied  fig   is to be viewed in comparison with fig   to better
understand the improvement in accuracy resulted by the hybrid feature representation  importantly  hybrid feature
representations perform classification with high accuracy even at lower training sizes

fi   conclusion and future work
we implemented a hybrid feature representation from a compact set of syntactic lexical features and character n grams 
this feature representation is computationally effective and context invariant  thereby providing a scalable method for
author identification 
for the writing classification task when posed as an unsupervised problem  we implemented k means clustering on the
syntactic feature matrix to obtain the matching matrix  the input dataset had a total      training samples for    authors
with     syntactic lexical features for each sample  the highest accuracy that we could obtain was correct classification of
   samples out of     for only a single author  k means technique generates clusters based on distance or similarity
between samples  where samples within a cluster are closer to the cluster centroid  however  for high dimensional data
 syntactic feature matrix has over     features   the distance measure may tend to clump together for different samples 
an alternative approach that can be implemented  as future work  is a grid based clustering methodology       this
methodology involves density estimation and selection of high density areas for clustering and low density regions are
assumed to be noise 
as seen earlier  the imdb dataset that we used had a highly contextual text content that was exploited by bag of words to
achieve high accuracy on the supervised identification task  the hybrid representation that we propose is designed to be
relatively context free  therefore  another area for future work is to validate the results of our hybrid feature
representation against a heterogeneous data source that shall test robustness against context insensitivity
