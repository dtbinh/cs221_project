abstract

found a high indication of utilizing intrinsic properties of the questions
to predict their long term value  which we believe has a similar parallel
for users      we believe that elite users have some common intrinsic
properties that help distinguish them from regular users  although
identification of long term value in users may require looking into
larger time frames of data as inputs  there are many properties of
users that could act as features to help predict their likelihood to
become elite users in a year 
besides evaluation of long term value in questions in the communities  the identification of the expert set of users in these q a
communities has been explored in the research community as well
        our work is different in that not only do we want to identify experts  but we also want to identify expert users who are highly
active and can make the biggest impact  additionally  we want to
discover value from their behaviors that not only distinguish them in
the community but also allow us to predict and identify elite users
early on in their careers  such work is similar to a  pal  et al  as they
argue that evolutionary data of users can be more effective at expert
identification than the models that ignore evolution      we want to
complement this work with further experimentation on other features
expressed by users on stack overflow and further discover attributes
that separate elite users from regular users 
by continuing previous works in predicting entity values in q a
communities  we want to show that it is possible to distinguish elite
users early on and not have to rely on years of actions in order for them
to gain credibility in the community  this is important because a past
study showed that users who contributed a lot had greater influence
than new users      this intuitively makes sense because those already
contributing continue to maintain their long lasting value  however 
new users who may be elite users are greatly undervalued 

question and answering  q a  communities depend on a set of
users who have mastery of the topics being discussed and also actively
respond to questions  we will refer to these users as elite users 
identifying these elite users allows general users to identify credible
sources  it can also help in allowing community designers to direct
unanswered questions to these elite users for a higher chance of a
response and credibility  the goal of our work is to investigate the
activity and behavior of users in a particular q a community and
discover whether or not it is possible to predict elite users based on
early signals

introduction

online education has been growing rapidly over the last few years 
many of these systems use some aspect of a question and answering
forum where anyone can ask a question and anyone in the community
can respond  these communities provide a completely communitydriven knowledge portal  however  much of this process relies on the
fact that a subset of users in the community have some mastery of the
topics  otherwise  the questions would rarely be answered  we refer
to these users as elite users and are those who contribute actively
and are reliable sources  these users form the most important aspect
of these forums and provide the necessary driving force to make such
systems successful 
many websites reward such users with some form of reputation that
can be granted through votes and rewards for responding  thereby
allowing users to identify those with mastery of the topics  unfortunately  gaining such status takes time and hides the proficiency of an
early user 
we believe that identifying elite users will be beneficial because it
provides community designers the ability to direct unanswered questions to these elite users for highly reliable and credible responses  it
can also help by allowing community designers to grant special privileges to these users earlier on in their career  thus allowing them to
better utilize their expertises  to assist in the identification of these
elite users  we explore a particular community called stack overflow 
to see if early attributes or activities associated with users can help
distinguish elite users

data set description

stack overflow employs a targeted model in both domain and question type encouraged on the site  as opposed to the myriad of popular
general q a sites on the web today  yahoo  answers  quora   stack
overflow advertises itself as a programming only q a site  furthermore  all questions posed on the site are meant to be looking for a
single  best answer  subjective questions that have no hope for such
a definitive response are usually weeded out 
this focus on both domain and question type is only successful
thanks to the users  first  the subset of the population equipped to
answer programming questions is small  and the value question askers
acquire is largely based on having the right expert answer their question  second  many of the top users serve as de facto moderators 
removing questions that do not fit the mission of stack overflow and
merging duplicates  to ensure this power is not abused  users are incrementally granted increased abilities based on their own reputation 
the possible and quantifiable actions that occur on stack overflow
extend beyond simply asking and answering  users can both comment
on questions and answers  all forms of communication can be voted
on  and users can favorite questions  finally  any of the possible
answers can be designated as the accepted answer by the original
asker  all of these attributes are used to present each question on
the site  after displaying the question at the top  the answers and
comments are stack ranked based on the number of up minus down
votes  with the accepted answer always presented first 
for our project  we are using a complete trace of the site that
extends from the sites inception on july           to august         
some basic statistics of this dataset can be seen in table    we are
using mysql to query the data and the python library sklearn to

related works

there has been previous research involving question and answering
communities that focused mainly on analyzing questions and answers
and gaining insight about their properties         one particular study
looked into predicting long term value of a question in the stack overflow community      we believe that  in conjunction with such work 
being able to identify elite users can provide q a communities the
ability to bring more attention to these users sooner  this would
help the site match the most reputatable users with the constant influx of new questions and further improve upon the reliability and
long lasting value of questions and answers 
this study also provides a parallel evaluation for long term value
of an entity in these q a communities  a  anderson  et al  primarily

figure    reputation versus accepted answers
communities rely heavily on users who have mastered the topics to
respond and answer questions  in figure    we have plotted user
reputations as of august         and the max  median and minimum
number of questions and answers for a user to be a member of each
cohort  for the maximum number of post types  the values are very
similar to the general population of users  and the trend is that there
is a similar number of answers and questions for all reputations below
        after        reputation  we see a separation between the
answer and question counts  signifying that top tiered users generally
have more answers than questions  this coincides with our intuition
of the built in reputation system  which uses reputation to evaluate
the eliteness of a user over time  similarly  this holds for the rest of
the population as can be seen by the median and minimum graphs in
figure    we want to explore the idea of elite users  which we define as
those who can largely contribute to the community through activity
and trustworthiness  since this intuition is consistent with the above
reputation analysis  we will utilize reputation to help classify and
validate our prediction model 

table    stack overflows reputation system
help with our prediction models  since our predictions will be relating
to evaluation of users being elite or not  we rely on the reputation
system that stack overflow has developed based on the actions taken
by each user  table     we use this evaluation because it is the social
evaluation of whether or not a user is of any value to the community
and given enough time should be a good indicator of the value of the
user to the community 

 

analysis of dataset

we began by looking at the dataset to learn more about the community and verify some of our possible intuitions about the network 
we looked at some various properties and found the dynamic between
questions  answers  and reputation to be rather interesting 

   

   

we want to find the top tier of users who are active and credible 
as a result  we explored the average view counts over a users set of
answers and accepted answers  in figure    we notice some interesting
information  for low reputation users  we see a higher average view
count of answers given than that of accepted answers  this occurs for
the maximum  median  and minimum  however  as we reach       
reputation  we see that these values begin to converge  this is similar
to the threshold where the number of answers given and the number
of questions given diverge for maximum number of posts in figure   
consequently  an elite users accepted answers and given answers are
more than likely correlated as compared to a regular user who may
have more answers but very few accepted ones  finally  we look at
the max average views for the maximum of these average views  far
left graph in figure     this shows that  even with high number of
page views  a user is not necessarily going to gain large reputation 
thus  the number of answers and popularity of a post do not coincide
with developing intuitions of necessarily having high contributions
to the community  specifically  this does not happen until a users
accepted answers gain more popularity  even then  we notice that the
accepted answers max average views is staggeringly lower than that
of answers given  we also see that the average page views decrease
as the reputation of a user increases  as a result  even though a post
is popular  it does not necessarily portray the same social measures
as being credible or worthy 

reputation before and after

we began by looking at cohorts of users who joined stack overflow
in specific time frames  in other words  each cohort of users has a
specific time window since the users inceptions to interact with the
stack overflow community  after exploring the data  we found that
the correlation coefficient was       between the reputations of cohort
of users who joined   months before september         versus their
reputations roughly a year later on august          given the plot of
the users reputations before and after in figure   we can see that the
effective loss in the top right quadrant is smaller than in the bottom
right quadrant  this leads us to the intuition that getting higher
reputation scores early on is a good predictor of separating out elite
users later on 

   

average views

reputations social evaluation

the reputation of stack overflow heavily favors those that answer
questions  based on the reputation system  authors of answers stand
to gain more reputation than authors of questions  see table     this
shows the importance of answers because question and answering

   

average accepted answers

our final discussion of our analysis looks at the accepted answer rate
of users versus their reputations  overall  the maximum and median
plots do not tell us much except that there are possibly many users
who have a few questions that have been accepted  reasonably  a
new user can have his or her answer accepted  and  as the answer
gains reputation  the user gains reputation  the most intruiging part
of figure   is the minimum accepted answer rate  intuitively  a new
user is usually motivated to join if they have a specific question to
ask or answer to contribute  this leads us to think that their first
action of either type should be of a higher quality  in this way  new
users can have a decent answer rate if they can achieve few accepted

of reputation and direct evaluations of a users questions and answers 
we decided to add the number of upvotes and the number of downvotes to the baseline features  we used these baselines to determine
whether or not our chosen models and predictions provide meaningful
insights into the development of elite users 
to evaluate our performance  we used classification accuracy  area
under the roc curve  auc   and f   scores  although classification
accuracy is a standard metric in determining the success of the classification algorithms  this measurement usually provides misleading
results for highly skewed data  as a result  we performed undersampling on the data set to balance the class label distribution before
reporting our evaluation results      auc measures the relationship
between true positive rates and false positive rates and an f   score is
defined as 
precision  recall
 
precision   recall
in order to train our models  we calculated and used the following
standardized features 

answers  however  we see that  as reputation increases  this minimum
average accepted answers decreases to almost    and then begins to
rise again at around        reputation  the transition point similar to
those seen in previous analysis sections   at this point  we see that the
accepted answer rate begins to increase to a point where it converges
at almost     acceptance rate  this phenomenon indicates that top
tiered users who have lots of reputation tend to have higher average
acceptance rates for their answers  there are still many possibilities
for a user to gain reputations  however  from analyzing these plots 
we see that higher answer acceptance rates generally correspond to
higher probabilities of elite users 
to conclude this section  we see that the characteristics of answers
help describe whether or not a user will become elite  we aim to not
only look at the users characteristics  but also the answers users give
and the types of questions they seem to target  by looking into a
variety of features  we hope to capture a few essential signals that
will help identify early elite users 

 

methods

 characteristic of the user  number of questions asked 
number of answers given  number of accepted answers  number
of comments  number of personal favorites  amount of bounty 
number of badges  number of user profile views  number of upvotes  number of downvotes  reputation 

to predict whether or not users will be elite the following year  we
decided to use two different classification algorithms  logistic regression and svm with an rbf kernel  rbf svm   in general  logistic
regression is the standard method for numerous classification tasks
and tries to optimally find a linear decision boundary among the
data  in the case that our data is not linearly separable  we also decided to use an svm to generate more complex decision boundaries
in the hopes of identifying possible nonlinear structures and achieving a higher performance  a common choice for this purpose is the
rbf svm 
in addition to applying these algorithms with a full set of features  we also decided to have baselines using logistic regression and
rbf svm on the following three features  reputation  upvotes  and
downvotes  from our data anaylsis on early reputation values  figure     we found that there is a high correlation between the early
reputation of a user and the reputation of a user the following year 
because stack overflow uses upvotes and downvotes as main sources

our classification task is to predict whether or not users will become elite users based on what they have accomplished in a time
frame since they joined stack overflow  to simplify our model  we
defined an elite user to be in the top     percentile of a cohort based
on reputation  while this is an arbitrary choice  we viewed any larger
percentiles  i e  top      would lower the difficulty in achieving high
evaluation scores in this prediction task and would make it too easy for
a user to be classified as elite  also  we believe only the top performing users should be characterized as those who contribute immensely
to the community 
for our predictions  we decided to use the idea of cohorts  specifically  we sample users at time frames of one week  one month  and
three months since their inceptions and look at their features after
this time frame  we use a users feature vectors as examples and
whether or not their reputation is in the top     of their cohorts the
following year as labels  specifically  we trained our classification algorithms on september      and september      data and tested our
classification algorithms on september      and august      data 
the reason we do not use labels corresponding to the top    
of the global population is that we want to take into account the
discrepancies between the user start dates  specifically  a user who
joined in      would have an additional year to accumulate more
reputation than a user who joined in       using the idea of cohorts 
we essentially normalize the data set to remove any extra advantages
users have for joining earlier 
after running our classification algorithms on our baseline and full
feature sets  we decided to use feature selection to determine a set of
essential features and focus our analysis on these imperative features

accumulated favorites of the corresponding question to a users answer  accumulated number of comments on the users answer  number
of accepted answers  and reputation 
for a brand new user  reputation is not a strong predictor of
whether or not a specific user will eventually become elite  this result is consistent with our data analysis section earlier  specifically 
once we allow users a month to contribute to the stack overflow
community  we begin to see that reputation becomes a stronger predictor of whether or not they will be an elite user the following year 
this phenomenon follows closely to figure    in which we begin to
see divergences once a user has begun accumulating more reputation 
another similar feature is that of number of accepted answers  elite
users are very important to a community with respect to their active
contributions and their credible backgrounds  as we allow elite users
more time to answer questions in the community  we see that the
number of accepted answers becomes a stronger predictor for an elite
user  both reputation and number of accepted answers are intuitive
features that we hope would shine in the prediction model 
the accumulated number of comments for a specific users answers
and the accumulated favorites of the corresponding questions of a specific users answers are two other features that contribute to the prediction of an elite user  we notice that these two features are related
in the sense that they involve community engagement  specifically 
if a user answers an important or thought provoking question in the
community  it is likely that the users answers will generate discussion among other users  causing a large number of comments for the
users answers  similarly  we find that  as time progresses  another
common feature of elite users is the general decline of importance in
the questions they are responding to  which can be estimated by the
number of favorites on their corresponding questions  we see that  in
the beginning  elite users tend to answer highly favorited questions
to establish themselves  however  as they spend more time on the
site  they begin to answer questions that are specific to the individual
and are not necessarily high in favorites  in this way  by answering
a variety of questions  elite users welcome other users to ask questions regardless of the questioners status  from this analysis  we
find that elite users not only contribute meaningful answers  but they
also involve and welcome other members of the community in their
questions and answers 
apart from these four common features in all the time frames  there
are four other features that play an important part in determining
whether or not a user will eventually become elite  accumulated score
of the corresponding questions  the total number of comments the
user has made  accumulated length of their answers  and the number
of downvotes  interestingly  we find that the accumulated scores of
questions a user answers has a negative weight in the one week time
frame and a small weight in the three month time frame  this result
means that elite users do not only answer questions with large number
of upvotes early on  but they answer a variety of questions  including
those that may not be as popular or heavily upvoted  the number of
comments and the accumulated length of the users answers are two
features that relate back to the idea that elite users not only provide
thoughtful insights to questions  but they also generate community
engagement among their peers  the number of downvotes is also
expected to have a negative weight  however  this is intuitively a

results

table   and   provide the results found through logistic regression and rbf svm on our baseline and full feature sets  from these
results  we find that our prediction model for the one week cohort
is considerably less accurate than that for the one month and three
month cohorts  intuitively  this result makes sense as it shows that the
longer a user spends in the community  the better prediction we can
make in their future community contribution level  in terms of the
specific algorithm performances  we find that logistic regression provided similar or better results than rbf svm across all time frames
for both feature sets  however  after users spend three months in the
community  logistic regression performs better than rbf svm  we
also notice that  although logistic regression performed similarly for
the full feature set and the baseline feature set in terms of auc scores
and classification accuracies  logistic regression performed much better with the full feature set than with the baseline feature set in terms
of f  scores  rbf svm with the baseline feature set performed better than with the full feature set for the one week cohort  however 
rbf svm with the full feature set consistently had higher accuracies
for the other time frames 
after running feature selection  we find that there are nine essential
features for each time frame  performing logistic regression and rbfsvm on these nine essential features shows about a      decrease
in classification accuracies       decrease on auc scores  and     
decrease on f  scores from using the full feature set on all time frames 
however  if we remove a feature from this set of essential features  our
evaluation metrics take a considerable performance hit of around     
decrease in classification accuracies       decrease on auc scores  and
    decrease on f  scores 
to further analyze these top nine core features  we decided to look
at the weights vector generated by logistic regression  the relative
importance of the essential features with respect to each time frame is
shown in table    by analyzing the weights generated from our nine
essential features  we find numerous intriguing points  first  we notice that there are four consistent features across all the time frames

table    top coefficients using logistic regression with nine essential features on the   week    month  and   month cohorts 

thought about looking at this data with a modification of the pagerank algorithm  possibly defining the nodes as users and the edges as
high quality interactions between them and producing a pagerank
score for each user  we could also look at betweenness centrality
to find the most important and connected users in the question and
answer network  to generate discussion on the overall structures of
the network  we can form clusters and examine the elite user communities  in particular  these methods can either be represented as
new models to discover elite users or be used as features in prediction
tasks similar to the tasks presented in this paper 
overall  nurturing the most productive users is paramount to a
site like stack overflow  where users run  moderate  and produce
most of the content  with the large amount of data stack overflow
collects  we found that simply using some select features could help
the site accurately identify the best users within a month of joining
the site  in consequence  beyond the normal social evaluators such
as reputation  upvotes  and downvotes  we see that there is large
potential for predicative power in the features of a user 

high precision  low recall feature  specifically  if a user is downvoted
many times  the user is most likely not an elite user  however  having
low number of downvotes does not necessarily indicate that the user
will eventually become an elite user 

 

conclusion

our results show that we can reasonably predict whether or not
users will become elite users in the future from their initial behaviors  although our prediction model does not improve much over our
baseline analysis  we gained a great amount of insight on the interaction between the current evaluation system of reputation and what
we would want reputation to represent  we see that early reputation
is a great indicator of whether or not a user will be elite  however  we
also know that other interactions and behaviors also provide clues 
by performing a classification task to forecast elite users  we find
that our intuitions are on the right track and we are able to devise a
prediction model with appropriate sets of features 
we initially approached this as an implementation exercise  but
ended up learning far more  first  examining the data and deciding
on an approach proved to be very important  we were lucky to have
a large dataset to work with  but its size made initial data analysis
before exploring possible features paramount  next  we learned a lot
about the varying methods of both producing the necessary features
and running our algorithms efficiently  when dealing with such large
cohorts of users who each take thousands of actions  the efficiency of
our queries was very important in enabling us to examine the large
cohorts and our large list of features  finally  we also learned about
the importance of a good evaluation metric  we initially thought that
classification accuracy would be sufficient  but we soon learned that
the nature of our prediction task led to high classification accuracy
regardless of our features  in exploring auc and f  scores and their
advantages  we ended up being exposed to a much more telling indicator of accuracy  through our analysis of the data set and user
features  we also gained deep insights into early indicators of whether
a user will eventually become an elite user  as a result of our work  we
hope to equip a site like stack overflow with a method to efficiently
forecast the future value of new users on a simple set of features and
use the results to further target and nurture the growth of elite users

possible future work

the next steps for this task involve possible new features and new
algorithms  in particular  we could look into temporal information 
which involves recreating the users history  for instance  features
involving the time it takes for the first answer to arrive on a new
question or the time it takes for the highest scoring answer to arrive
could be important for a users behavior  to better understand the
meaning of an elite user  we could look at other metrics and methods
of classifying elite users as well  also  we could explore other algorithms or models to better understand the network  for instance  we
