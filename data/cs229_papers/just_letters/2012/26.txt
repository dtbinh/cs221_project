detecting nonlinear scaling

in data visualization  geometric shapes are used to
represent relative quantities  usually numbers or percentages 

in a nondistorted graphic  the size of a

mally  the observed ratio between the bars is around

sents  formally  a scaling function can be represented

y    y          

as follows 

but the actual ratio of values for each bar is

for example  say an observer sees a simplistic data

to be easier to calculate the area of each bar instead
of its height 

area is a reliable proxy only if the

width of each bar is constant  as was the case for
test data in this project  but future implementations
should use height data instead 

this module used

k means clustering to quickly assign a label to each
pixel based on its color and its adjacency to other
pixels  this was necessary because the prior run of
k means didn t necessarily assign a unique color to
each bar  so this run needed to take the location of
the pixel in the image into account as well

what do you estimate the proportion to be

seems fair to estimate that the larger bar is twice as
large as the smaller bar  but feel free to make your
own estimate

then  what if you later discovered

as a general rule  the dimensionality of the graphic

the following labelings for each bar 

should not exceed the dimensionality of the data it

comes a nontrivial task  other kinds of data graphic

three dimensional bar or pie charts  which are often

also present a challenge  especially when the orga

to detect this avor

of each geometric representation  then de

conclusion

for this

portion of the project  a reliable and general method

machine learning and interaction design

of detecting shape wasn t found  it was possible to
subdivide the graph into matrices for each bar  but

as it turned out  the design of the tool relied exclu 

this approach was computationally expensive and un 

sively on k means as the learning algorithm of choice 

reliable  since the scope of this project was limited

after trying pca for the color module  it turned out

to bar charts with correct dimensionality  this wasn t

that k means was faster and resulted in fewer errors 

an issue  but further implementations should take  d

this may have been a result of the data impoverished

charts into account 

nature of this particular problem  the limitation to

a serious diculty for this problem was the need
to analyze each data graphic independently 

a discretized  nite color subspace  as well as the rel 

this

atively small size of each graphic  meant that run 

 within subjects  design for the tool and its under 

ning any algorithm was close in complexity to do 

lying learning problem was more true to life because

ing the same task by brute force  i e  simply going

this tool would need to make a judgment on each data

through the image pixel by pixel   additionally  dur

ing the design process  it became clear that the tool

relatively data poor  in the sense that each has only

may be limiting to users with more skill at generating

a handful of bars data labels to evaluate  this make

graphics  this highlighted a need for balance between

the explicit computation of distortion very simple 

skilled users  who would be able to design data graph 

but increases the complexity of the natural next step
question 

ics more exibly while still maintaining good cogni 

is it possible for the tool to learn which

tive design principles  similar to how skilled writers

graphical patterns are indicative of distortion with 

can play with grammar   whereas beginners would

out explicitly computing the distortion 

need more scaolding to create good graphics  the

this would represent a  between subjects  design

how can this tool best encourage behavior

straction for the critical values in the data graphic 

as a philosophical aside  the pro 

cess this tool goes through to learn about distorted

as well as a binary distortion label for each graphic 

graphics closely mirrors how humans might learn to

it would be interesting to see whether this approach

perform the same task  including the transfer step

increases the speed of the classication  importantly 

previously described 

this approach doesn t allow repair of detected distor 

this project shows that sim 

ple learning algorithms are best for this kind of basic

tions  but if it is markedly faster than the explicit

graphical distortion test  but how can the context

to improve the execution time of the tool 

port human learners 

another source of diculty came from considering other types of data graphic  especially pie charts 
bar charts were especially tractable for the scaling
problem because they re ordered from left to right 
which made comparisons with the labels straightforward  with pie charts  however  the polygons are arranged in a circle  so assigning labels to polygons be
