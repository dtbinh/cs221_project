final write up

overview
enhancers are dna elements that specifically activate the expression of their target
genes  they are usually associated with modifications on the histones  the proteins that
facilitate the organization of dna in the cells  and thus can be identified based on such
modifications 
enhancers have features quite different from promoters  including high variability in
nucleotide sequence  high flexibility in relative position to the target genes and highly
complicated combinatorial regulation 
the enhancer sequences have a high diversity and account for the large degree of
variability in gene expression between different cell types  the sequences can be far
from genes and quite flexible in position  its far from trivial to associate an enhancer
sequence to its target genes 
on the other hand  the large numbers of enhancers and genes create a large set of
combinations  and hence high correlations readily occur simply by chance  creating a
host of false positive results 
the project aims to associate enhancer elements to targets  based on the activity of
enhancers and the expression level of genes  the activity of enhancers is variable in
different cell types and accounts for different gene expression levels  the active
enhancers are first recognized by epigenetic modifications  then the enhancers in action
are fed into a generalized linear model  glm  to predict the expression level of a host of
genes  then with parameter selection  the enhancers most relevant to the gene
expression level are identified and the association is established 
active enhancers are characterized by h k   acetylation peak whereas the transcription
start sites  tss  have enriched h k  methylation peaks  fig     some h k  
acetylation peaks will be proximal to the h k  methylation and highly correlated with
gene expression level  these proximal peaks tend to make other acetylation peaks trivial
when fit into the glm model  hence only the subset of h k   acetylation peaks without
overlapping h k  methylation peaks are recognized as active enhancers in the project

figenome is divided into functional partitions by insulator elements  so that long range
action of enhancers is limited  besides  significant association would be offset by
background noise if too many peaks were included in analysis  therefore  active
enhancers are subsequently divided into subsets based on functional partition of the
genome  the glm model only considers the enhancers in the same functional partition
as the gene and will be more sensitive to relevant enhancer elements 
in order to select the most relevant enhancer elements  the glm model is fitted via
penalized maximum likelihood with l  regularization  cross validation determines the
best lambda value for l  regularization and selects the parameters  the model is then
refit with the selected parameters  peaks with coefficients that significantly deviate from  
are considered as the enhancer in action 
in order to validate the results  false discovery rate  fdr  is estimated  the genes are
shuffled  so that the peaks are fitted to a random gene  the same criteria are used to pick
significant associations  the associations found this way were considered as falsediscoveries  the fdr is estimated by the following formula

the threshold for significance will then be tweaked to minimize fdr 

raw data
chromatin immunoprecipitation  chip  and rna sequencing  rna seq  data from
lymphoblasts in    individuals were generated by the snyder lab at stanford and
preprocessed by sofia kyriazopoulou to obtain the signal at  h k  methylation and 
h k   acetylation peaks as well as the expression values of genes  the data are also
processed with deseq to find differential expression patterns  only genes that show
differential expression in at least    pairs of the samples are included in the enhancer
prediction 

preprocessing of raw data
for the genes with very low expression  fold change tends to be overestimated due to
experimental noise  to reduce the effect of noise on low signal genes peaks  the signal
was variance stabilized using the asinh function  the signal across all individuals was
quantile normalized to account for experimental differences between the cell lines 
the peak data are also similarly processed  to get the mean counts from replicate
experiments and then performed asinh quantile normalization 

partition of genome
the genome is partitioned with deseq data  genes with differential expression and the
flanking regions without differential expression are defined as a functional partition 
partitions with too short lengths are merged 

fifig    function partition of the genome

the real functional partition in genome is formed by insulator elements and the genes
within a partition will tend to have similar trends in expression  the partitions obtained
from deseq data is an approximation of the real partitions  the length of partitions are
well controlled to be less than  mb  so the actual partitions obtained this way are nonoverlapping with gaps  the regions without significant differential expression are depleted
of partitions  this approach for partitioning is appropriate for finding associations in
enhancers 
the mean and median of the length of partitions based on deseq p value  e     e     e    e   is plotted as follows 

fig    change of length as p value

the length of partitions decreases gradually with less stringent p value 
chromosome   is shown below to shown the distributions of the partitions in the genome  
less stringent p value yields a host of small partitions  the final p value is chosen to
ensure that the size of partitions are not too small and the partitions cover all the
differentially expressed genes

l  regularization
the glm is fitted with l  regularization  in this way  only the parameters  h k  
acetylation peaks of enhancers  highly relevant to gene expression have non zero
coefficients  cross validation is used to determine the lambda value with the least
deviation  parameters  the peaks  with non zero coefficients are chosen as the
candidates  the selected parameters are then refit in glm  the p value for coefficient to
be zero is calculated  only parameters with p value less than a threshold are considered
significant and recorded as a hit 
the number of hits and estimated fdr is as follows

discussion
in previous studies     diverse cell types were used to include a major change in the
transcriptomes  so that the differential expression would be common and associations
would be abundant  in these studies  major enhancers for determinants of the cell types
would be discovered 
in this project  the data are derived from lymphoblast cell lines from    individuals  as
only one cell type is used  the differential expression will reflect minor differences
between individuals and tend to be rare  the associations of enhancers with genes
discovered in this data set will thus be rare but related with personal genomics  the
nature of the discovery determines that most of the previously established associations
will not be present in the results 
the algorithm for this project discovered a very tiny set of the enhancers  many of them
are not reported in previous studies  the fdr is still not satisfactory  but can be improved
by finely tuned cut off parameters in the algorithm
