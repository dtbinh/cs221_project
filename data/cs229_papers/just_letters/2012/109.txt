background
for this project  we looked at a dataset containing tuberculosis  tb  symptoms  symptom
onset time  and time until treatment was sought for      non urban households in bihar  india 
all households had at least one household member who was being treated for active tb disease 
we are interested in identifying the relationship between an individuals characteristics  such as
disease symptoms an individual experienced  and the time it took for the individual to seek
treatment  this could potentially guide health education programs that support timely
identification of disease cases to prevent transmission 
we first cleaned and prepared the data  explored some basic statistics to get an intuition
for the dataset  then used several algorithms to see if we could accurately predict the time of
seeking treatment  and  more importantly  use the algorithm outputs to identify reasonable
characteristics of patients that sought care quickly  the methods we used were logistic
regression  pca  k means clustering  and svm  these results are presented below 
data exploration
the dataset provides care seeking and disease symptom information on tb patients in
clinics in the state of bihar  india  we formatted and cleaned the data  variables with missing
observations or observations with missing variables were dropped  each observation also had a
sample weight attached  due to the sampling design of the survey the data comes from  and we
 unweighted  the data by repeating observations according to its weight  for instance  those
observations with weights of   appear twice in the unweighted dataset  those with weights of  
appear   times  etc    we created the variables of interest from the raw data  our  variables will
be the duration of the symptom prior to seeking care  for the seven symptoms we have
information on  cough  cough with blood  fever  weight loss  night sweats  constant tiredness 
loss of appetite   we also included a flag for each symptom indicating whether the symptom
was present when the patient sought care  this allows differentiation between a patient who had
   days with cough and did not seek care until much later  indicating the cough did not motivate
him to seek treatment  and a patient who only had    days with cough prior to treatment because
he started treatment due to becoming alarmed about the cough  for our  variable we used the
time from the first symptom to the time of seeking treatment  this variable is bimodal  see
figure    with means around    days and    days  we use    days as the cutoff between  fast 
care seekers and  slow  care seekers for use in categorical learning algorithms

figure  

fiwe first explored basic statistics about our dataset  we saw that the number of symptoms
patients had experienced when they sought care varied from zero to seven out of the seven
symptoms we have information about in the survey  see figure     it does not seem that any one
symptom had always been experienced by the time the patient sought care  see figure    
although from these graphs we can see that the majority of people had cough at the time they
sought treatment  which is not the case for any other symptom

principal components analysis
we used pca to get a better visualization of our data  in our pca analysis  we ranked
the components along dimensions on which the variance of the data was maximized  allowing us
to reduce the dimensions of the data until it could be visualized  see figure     we found that
    of the variation was captured by reducing to two dimensions  which increased to     if we
use three dimensions 
in the figures below  fast treatment seekers are plotted in green  slow treatment
seekers in red  and the blue points  x  through x    correspond to the variables  the first
component is aligned with variation in all variables  whereas the second principal component
seems to capture differences between the durations of symptoms  x  x   and the presence of the
symptom at the time of treatment  x  x    

figure  a and b
the inclusion of the third principal component on our visualization shows that the third
principal component captures mainly variation between variables coding for the presence of the

fisymptom at time of treatment  the presence of a cough  x   or a bloody cough  x   seems to
be generating most of the variation in these variables  fast and slow patients appear to be well
separated  indicating that we might be able to use the pca loadings to separate the types of
patients  figure   below shows our dependent variable plotted against such an index generated
using the first principal component 

figure  a and b
patients with pca index larger than    are slow treatment uptake patients  these are not
the majority of patients  but we are able to identify them with perfect accuracy  unfortunately 
those with a pca index smaller than    could be either fast or slow treatment uptake patients
and are not possible to separate 
k means clustering
from the pca outputs  however  it seems like we should be able to generate clusters of
fast and slow patients  we used k means to generate types of patients  if the clusters the
algorithm generated contain predominantly fast or slow treatment seeking patients  we could
then make statements about the mean characteristics of these types 
running two clusters until convergence generated two groups  a smaller group with
    of the patients  and a larger group  the smaller group is almost completely slow uptake
type patients      slow uptake   this group has  on average  longer durations for every
symptom and has more symptoms at the time
of seeking treatment for all symptoms  if we
assign the majority label to all patients in the
cluster  we are able to achieve     accuracy
with these two clusters 
are   clusters the ideal number of
clusters 
we examine the increase in
accuracy with increasing the number of
clusters  see figure    
increasing the
number of clusters does not significantly
increase accuracy  accuracies shown on the
plot are typical outputs generated from   
random initializations  so results are noisy

fisupport vector machine
training an svm algorithm on     of our data achieved very high test accuracy         accuracy with a linear kernel  and     accuracy with a quadratic kernel   however  the
svm approach is difficult to interpret  so the results are not clear from a hypothesis testing
perspective  if we want to identify symptoms that encourage  or discourage  patients to seek
care  this is not useful  a better approach might be logistic regression 
logistic regression
we randomly divided the       weighted  examples  i e          unweighted  examples 
into     training examples and     testing examples  if a symptom was present at the time of
seeking treatment  then this symptom was a driving factor why the patient went to seek
treatment   since were interested in which or which combinations of symptoms induce fast
treatment seeking behavior  we find all possible combinations of          or   symptoms   and
pick out the ones that are significantly and  relatively  strongly correlated with the categorical 
variable  the fast slow treatment seeking behavior  in addition  having a certain or combination
of symptom s  at the time of seeking treatment  given this person is categorized as slow
treatment seeking patient  implies that this or this combination of symptom s  is in general not
alarming  and induces slow treatment seeking  on the other hand  having a certain or
combination of symptom s  at the time of seeking treatment  given this person is categorized as
fast treatment seeking patient  implies that this or this combination of symptom s  is in general
alerting and therefore induces fast treatment seeking  further latent factors should also be taken
into consideration when interpreting the results 
we have feature vectors as follows   a  duration of each symptom that is present at the
time of seeking treatment   b  product of combinations of          or   symptoms durations  that
are present at the time of seeking treatment  given that having this symptom or combination of
symptoms is significantly and  relatively  strongly correlated with the fast slow treatment
seeking behavior  roughly we get       error  based on the regression result  we find that   see
table      a  for single symptom  having one more day of bloody cough or appetite loss increases
the probability of being a fast treatment seeker while having one more day of cough  fever  night
sweat  or constant tiredness increase the probability of being a slow treatment seeker   b  for
combination of   symptoms  having one more day of both bloody cough and cough at the same
time does not become more alarming than having one more day of bloody cough alone   c  for
combination of   symptoms  having one more day of cough  fever  weight loss and constant
tiredness increases the probability of being a fast treatment seeker  even though having one more
day of each one of these symptoms individually does not increase the probability of being a fast
treatment seeker   d  for combination of   symptoms  having one more day of cough  fever 
weight loss  constant tiredness  and appetite loss increases the probability of being a slow
                                                                                                                
 

we realize that this symptom might not necessarily be the driving factor why a patient went to seek treatment  but
in general  this statement should hold 
 
we didnt look at   or all   symptoms  because having those many symptoms may offer less insight for us in terms
of fast or slow treatment seeking behavior 
 
we only report highly significant features    

fitreatment seeker  even those having one more day of a subset of these   symptoms increases the
probability of being a fast treatment seeker  this is probably because poor patients are reluctant to
seek treatment until they have more symptoms

conclusions and future work
we are able to isolate several symptoms combinations of symptoms that encourage or
discourage patients from seeking care quickly using logistic regression  in general  it seems that
we would recommend health education groups to raise awareness that a cough  fever  night
sweats  or tiredness in isolation can be symptoms of tb  additional financial or transportation
support might be necessary for patients who have five or more symptoms  as we suspect that
there may be unobserved effects in that group  in addition  it seems that the types of patients can
be separated using a hyperplane using some permutation of the feature space  as seen from our
results from pca and svd   although finding actionable results from this separation is difficult 
in the future we would like to include demographic variables  such as income  family
characteristics  such as number of dependents  etc    or ease of access to treatment facilities in
our analysis to better understand the underlying patterns in our data  presumably these features
can help us separate the fast slow treatment seekers better when they have similar characteristics 
i e   durations of symptoms  in addition  these features would also help target individuals with
different socioeconomic background when making tb education outreach
