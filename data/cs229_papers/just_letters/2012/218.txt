introduction
light rail systems are becoming more popular in cities and urban residential areas around the country 
one of the main environmental impacts from light rail systems is noise from the trains as they pass
through residential areas  in response to increasing noise complaints  it is becoming more common to
perform noise measurements in the residential areas and attempt to identify noise mitigation solutions
based on the results  currently  most of the noise measurements are attended with a technician keeping a
log of when trains pass the measurement location so those train events can be extracted from the
continuous recording during post processing  this method limits the amount of data that can be collected
due to limited man hours  a machine learning algorithm that identifies train events in a continuous noise
recording would increase efficiency during both data collection and post processing 
ats consulting has a significant body of noise recordings adjacent to light rail tracks  the goal of the
project is to develop a supervised learning algorithm that can separate the train events from the
background noise with a high success rate  we applied logistic regression and support vector machine
 svm  learning algorithms to attempt to solve this problem  for the purpose of train noise analysis  it is
acceptable for the algorithm to fail to identify about one in ten train noise events  especially if they are
corrupted by simultaneous environmental noise sources  for example  a lawn mower   however  the
algorithm should have a much lower error rate for classifying other noise events  such as a car  as a train
event  misclassifying events as trains could lead to misdiagnosing the cause of loud noise levels and
recommending inappropriate mitigation measures  while failing to identify some events as trains is merely
weeding out corrupted samples that would most likely not be included in future analysis 

data and labeling
the training data for this project consists of noise measurements conducted along the exposition light rail
line in los angeles  california  at each of the measurement sites  a     hour noise measurement was
recorded  each including    to    train passbys  at two of the measurement sites  a twenty four hour
measurement and a second two hour measurement were recorded 
all of the short term      hour  measurements were attended by a technician keeping a log sheet of the
time of all train passbys  the labeling of our training data  train or not train  was based off of the notes in
these log sheets  the long term     hour  measurements were unattended  no record of train passbys  
the data from the unattended measurements has been inspected by hand post recording to identify train
events  the labeling of our long term data was based on this post recording inspection  and may include
labeling error  for these long term data sets  we expect that some true train events have gone unidentified 
due to the possibility of labeling error in the long term data  it was not included in the training data set 
and was only used for testing the trained classifiers 
the noise measurements were recorded as  wav files  however  the data is available in text file format
with the overall a weighted noise levels and the     octave band levels extracted with a rms time step
of       seconds  with the exception of one long term measurement at site    that had an rms time step
of      seconds   the a weighted sound level is the overall loudness weighted to approximate the hearing
of the human ear  the frequency content  available in     octave bands  is the pitch of the noise  figure  
 left  shows a sample spectra of train events recorded at site    the spectra of background noise is the
bolded black line in the figure  the spectra vary from train to train depending on the direction the train is

traveling and the speed of the train  however  all of the spectra have generally the same shape  with noise
levels peaking in the     hz and      hz     octave bands 
a typical train passby in our data set is approximately    to    seconds long  as shown in figure   on the
right   for a data set with       second time step  about    data points will be included in one train event 
our approach to the problem of identifying train events is to run a machine learning algorithm on each
time step of each recording and label each time step as a train or not a train  after classifying each
individual time step  we look for clusters of positive examples where a significant percentage of the data
points are classified as train events  these clusters of positive examples are then labeled as a single train
passby  we chose this approach to guard against our results being sensitive to misclassifications of
individual data points 
to label each data point in the training data set  we had to define a precise start and end point to all of the
train events  using only the logsheet notes  data points near the beginning and end of the event were
labeled as part of the train event even before the train noise exceeded the background noise  in practice  a
train noise event is often defined by its  db or   db downpoints  us dept  of transportation   we tried
two approaches to cull ambiguous data points from our training set      removing the data from the ends
of the manually labeled event to the    db downpoints  and     removing a constant fraction of the
labeled train events from each end of the event

logistic regression
we first implemented a nave bayes classifier with discretized     octave band features  but soon moved
on from this approach in favor of logistic regression so we could work directly with the continuously
valued features  the     octave band noise levels   in our first regression implementation  we used the    
octave band noise levels in the     hz to      hz     octave bands  the noise from trains in bands
outside of this range is generally not above the background noise level  as seen in figure    the
performance of this first iteration of our classifier was mediocre  identifying only about half of the train
events  performance of our classifier was significantly increased when we normalized the noise levels by
subtracting out the mean noise level of each     octave band and dividing by the standard deviation  the
normalization significantly decreased the false positive identification rate of measurement locations with
high background noise level  a low signal to noise ratio  
because the     octave band noise level can vary significantly depending on the speed of a train or the
distance from the microphone to the train  we were also interested in including features that did not
depend solely on the noise level  the train noise spectra typically have a very consistent shape  with peak
noise levels showing up in the     or      hz     octave band levels  including features that capture the
shape of the spectrum  rather than just the magnitude of the     octave band levels may improve the
performance of our classifier  clavel  ehrette  and richard   possible features include the first and second

page  

spectral moments as features  the first and second spectral moments are the mean frequency and the
frequency variance  we experimented with adding these features  in addition  we tried adding a feature
that was the product of the normalized levels in what we expected to be the peak     octave bands for
train events      hz       hz  and      hz  and a feature of the peak     octave band 
the preliminary results from our model are presented in table    results are presented for our analysis
with our original features  which included only the normalized     octave band levels and a weighted
noise level  and for our analysis that added extra features in an attempt to capture the shape of the
spectrum  including features such as the mean frequency and variance of the frequency  
following are some observations from the results presented in table   


as expected  the logistic regression classifier performs best on sites that have the highest signalto noise  snr  ratio  sites with high snr are                and     sites with a low snr are      
      and    



in general  the extra features  mean frequency and the product of sound levels in the     hz 
     hz  and      hz     octave bands  did not improve the performance of the algorithm  there
was little to no change in the true positive rate  there was a more consistent decrease in the falsepositive rate at sites with a low snr  however the false positive rate was low to begin with 



the true positive rate is unacceptably low for sites with low snr  however  there is not a
significant increase in the false positive rate for sites with low snr 

an encouraging result is the number of false positives is relatively low for most of our sites  which was
one of our design goals  one option for improving the number of true positive events identified is
including a ridge parameter to reduce our sensitivity to outliers  optimizing a ridge parameter may allow
us to increase our true positive rate  without increasing the false positive rate to the point where we are
false positives occur in a large enough cluster to be classified as an event  however  this was not
implemented during the quarter  another avenue for improving the performance may be to do more
research on features that are less dependent on the snrfor example  features that take into account how
the spectral values change with time  currently  we are not exploiting the fact that the noise levels rise
and decrease with a very regular pattern as the trains approach and pass the microphone location

svm
we used the libsvm implementation of support vector machines  chang   lin  to search for train events
in a similar manner as we did with logistic regression  by classifying individual timepoints and then
discerning events from clusters of points  an svm may improve performance by using a kernel to take
advantage of higher dimensional features  intuitively  we believe train events are most easily identifiable
at their peak volume levels  when the train is closest to the recorder  the volume during the crossing will
rise to a peak over some number of seconds  and then fall off  and the peak decibel level of a train passby
is usually much louder than background noise levels across many features  we expect that these peak
noise levels will be separable from the levels experienced during non train events 
to produce our training data  we reserved five recordings as test data which were not used in training 
including both    hour recordings  and trained using all data from the middle     of each train passing
 to exclude datapoints which would be harder to distinguish from background noise   to avoid biasing the
classifier by providing too many negative examples  ben hur   weston   we only included     of all
datapoints from outside train crossing in our training data  as train crossings were relatively rare  to
normalize data  we zeroed out the mean of the decibel levels for each octave band  and divided by
standard deviation  as in the logistic regression implementation   we also attempted to normalize values
by scaling the  st and   th percentile values of each feature to the range      but this produced poor
performance  
early in development  we performed a forward search to try to trim the set of features to those which gave
the best performance  but did not find this to be a good time investment  forward search did seem to
confirm that frequencies between     and      hz were the most useful for distinguishing events  as we
suspected  but after normalizing our input data  we did not find a decrease in accuracy when classifying
using data from all octave bands  we also attempted classification with the extra features added for
logistic regression  variance  and products of the            and      hz bands  but did not notice a
significant improvement in performance 
we trained and tested an svm using a gaussian kernel for different values of  with the cost for all
classes fixed to its default value  c       in our experiments we found that a gaussian kernel with        
gave the best performance for this problem  and that linear kernels also performed well  in table    we
present results from testing for two cases      using all frequencies at a timepoint as input features  and    
using only the eleven audio bands between     and      hz  finally  to find train crossings in the svm
output  we returned intervals where     of all data points were positively classified within a   second
timespan

notes  a  the redondo  catalina   cloverdale   catalina long term  and cloverdale long term data sets were
not included in the svm training data

we see that as with logistic regression  it is very difficult to find train crossings in the catalina long term
recording without identifying many false positives  the cloverdale  test case also stands out again as
being a difficult case  we could adjust the costs of misidentifying the two classes to tweak results  but
there is not much leeway for improvement over all casesincreasing the penalty for false positives or
negatives improves results for some cases at the expense of others  the overall performance in finding
events is similar to logistic regression  except that the svm was able to find many more train events
during the long term catalina recording 

conclusions
the logistic regression and svm classification methods both show some promise in correctly classifying
train events and show very similar results  for both methods  the number of correct positive events
identified decreases with decreasing snr  somewhat surprisingly  the number of false positive train
events is quite high for the data site   and    which had high snr  but were not included in the training
data 
we did not meet our original goal of positively identifying nine out of ten train events for sites with low
snr  however  based on the success with identifying at least nine out of ten events for sites with high
snr  implementing more sophisticated features into either of the two classification methods may yield
satisfactory results  these features may include methods of extracting more information about the shape
of the spectrum  or including features that have to do with how noise levels change over time for a train
event  time series classification also seems promising for identifying events and incorporating
information about the shape of the audio signal   wei   keogh  claim one nearest neighbor time series
classification with a euclidean distance metric to be very competitive  we experimented with this
algorithm but did not manage to improve performance to the same level as the svm within the quarter
