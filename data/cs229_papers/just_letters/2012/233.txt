problem statement

in addition to observing astronomical objects through the electromagnetic radiation they give off 
astronomers also study the universe by analyzing gravitational effects on mater  more specifically 
one can work back from these observed effects to determine the mass distribution in the universe
 both inside and outside galaxies   in this project  we worked on one specific gravitational effect 
weak gravitational lensingthat is  the bending of light due to medium sized clusters of galaxies 
in particular  we attempted to measure the mass of unseen matter  also called dark matter  that
should be present to produce the observed lensing effects  we analyzed data from the dark energy
galaxy survey  des  simulations  found out where weak lensing occurs  and attempted to fit
our model of mass distribution to the data in the simulations  while this problem has been
attempted before  with varying degrees of success   the current techniques usually rely on the
shape distortion of galaxies caused by weak lensing  in this project  we focused on the magnitude
distortions  which should provide a roughly independent measure of lens mass  however  the
intrinsic systematic uncertainty associated with this method is larger than in methods using shape
distortion calculations  due to the higher amount of noise in the galaxy magnitude distribution 

 

available data

given a cluster of galaxies  and an associated dark matter halo     we possess list of galaxies  u i   
i           n   near it    each galaxy data point consists of a list of parameters u i     m i    r i    z  i    
defined as follows 
    m i  is a vector of magnitudes in the g  r  i  z  and y bands  that is  each element of m i  is
the brightness of the galaxy  averaged over a range in wavelengths  
    r i  is the distance  on the   dimensional sky plane  between the galaxy and the cluster center 
given in arcminutes 
    z  i  is the redshift of the galaxy 
 
physically  what we observe is that clusters of galaxies and halos of dark matter go hand in hand  so that dark
matter in the halos is what causes the gravitational lensing 
 
strictly speaking  these are the galaxies with a distance r   rmax from the cluster center  where r is the distance
on the sky plane  measured in arcminutes  note that  in the three dimensional picture  this includes galaxies that
are behind the clusterthese are precisely the galaxies that will be affected by weak lensing 
 
for the purpose of this project  we can think of redshift as the distance between the earth and the given galaxy

model and relevant physics

from the list of galaxies above  we wish to derive some prediction that can be parameterized by
  r   the density of dark matter  to do so  we introduce the galaxy number density function  
if there were no gravitational lensing   would have some natural functional form in magnitude
mlet us call this function     through some fairly involved calculations  it can be shown that  in
the presence of a gravitational lens of  small  lensing parameter   the observed number density
function is     
 
 r  m  z     
   m      z 
     
where the lensing parameter     r  z    is a complicated function of r and z that can be calculated from the mass distribution       at this point  we will make a simplifying  but physical 
assumption  that the mass distribution follows a navarro  frenk and white  nfw  mass distribution     
c  c c  z 
 r  rs   c   

 
r
r
 
 
rs
rs
this enables us to write down the dark matter distribution as a function parameterized by rs  
the virial radius  the total halo mass is then obtained by integrating the given mass distribution 
this simplifies our problem to fitting this parameter to the available data  note that  in order to
recover any predictive power whatsoever  this assumption is necessary after all  if we were fitting
a general mass distribution  our parameter space would be infinite dimensional 

 

probabilistic setup

the first problem we face is to find the functional form of     for this  we take the galaxies at
a radius r   router away from the center of the cluster  and consider them to be unlensed    in
the relevant range of magnitudes  we have found that a shifted power law provides a good fit to
the number density of galaxies  as a function of m  more specifically  given a redshift range z  we
model the probability of finding an unlensed galaxy of magnitude m as  pz  m     ma  for m 
 a  mmax      using this  we can write down the maximum likelihood estimate for the value of the
parameters  and a 
  

 
log mmax  a  

 
n

pn

 i 
i   log m  

   and a   min m i   
i

where  acts as a normalization constant  since   is just the galaxy number density  we can relate
these quantities as 

 m  a     m  a 
r 
while this fit was only an intermediate step in order to reach our final goal  we will present a
sample of the results  in the graphs to below  the fit    m  obtained is plotted alongside a few
values calculated from the data    for each magnitude band and range of galaxy redshift 
   m    n

 

this can be justified by noting that the value of  at these radii is negligible  given halos of typical rs
we denote pz to make explicit that  for each redshift range  there is a different density function  to achieve this 
the galaxies must be divided up into redshift bins 
 
note that these calculated data points are never used in the fit  that is  our fit only used individual galaxy
magnitudes   in a loose sense  these points are the histogram of the galaxy magnitudes 
 

 

fionce this fit is performed  we can move on to analyze the data of lensed galaxies  r i    router   
given a lensed galaxy at a radius r and magnitude m  we want to find the probability p r  m  of
observing this data point 
p r  m   

e   of galaxies with magnitude   m and radius   r 
 r  m  z  rs   c 
  r rmax r mmax
e total   of galaxies 
 r  m  z  rs   c drdm
 

 

the probability above enables us to  numerically  write down a log likelihood function for our
observed data points l rs    while this function can be expressed and differentiated analytically
with respect to rs   the resulting expression in unimaginably complex  due to dependence of  on
rs    therefore  in this project it was decided to instead compute the likelihood function numerically 
as in the expression above  thus  to maximize l with respect to rs   we applied gradient ascent
numerically  that is  the derivative is computed numerically   which results in a relatively efficient
optimization process 

 

results

after setting the fitting parameters    our initial attempt to implement the methods described
above produced the results shown in the graph below  as can be seen  the weak lensing signal is
quite weak for the less massive halosthe only conclusive result is for halos of mass larger than
 

interestingly  we found that the fit was relatively robust to changes in the maximum fitting radius  within reason 
of course   however  the essential parameter to which the fitting is extremely sensitive to is the number of bins in
galaxy redshift  set to    

 

fi        solar masses  in studies of
weak lensing  this is usually the best
one can hope for      seeing as how
the signal present in the galaxy magnitude data is often overwhelmed by
noise  specifically  the error of     
on more massive halos is competitive with those seen in galaxy shear
 shape  distortion studies      to
readers who are unfamiliar with weak
lensing studies  this might seem like
a rather unsatisfying resultafter all 
why shouldnt we be able to recover the mass of a dark matter halo  to answer this question  we
bring up two important factors that impact our analysis 
    the non uniformity in the galaxy background     in our model of this situation  we assumed
that galaxies are roughly uniformly distributed in the skyhowever  this is far from true 
    as depicted graphically below  the two shifts in the function  scaling and shift to the left  have
an almost null combined effect  so that it is increasingly difficult to differentiate between lensed
and unlensed magnitude distributions  for small values of   

 

future studies   the color magnitude map

in the interest of producing a better fit for the halo
masses  this project will explore a possible remedy for the
second of the two factors above  which might be applied
to future studies  specifically  if we were able to classify
the galaxies by their color  then we could perform the
analysis described above separately in each color group 
the advantage that we wish to explore is that different
colored galaxies  when grouped together  might produce a
different galaxy background function     if this is indeed
the case  then one should be able to analyze the combined shift in each magnitude function  producing a stronger mass estimate  in other words  random noise is less likely to affect each function
individually in such a way that mimicks lensing  
for this classification problem  we take galaxy color and magnitude as our input features  where
color is defined as the difference between two observable wavelength bands  then  we proceed to
apply k means clustering to classify the data   one important factor that we ran into while applying this algorithm is the range of the data in each coordinatewhile magnitude varies between   
and     the color is usually between     and       thus  in order for the algorithm to weigh each
coordinate equally  we used the following kernel 
x  y 
xt y  
  x  y 
w
 

where the weight w was computed by equating the squared spread of each coordinate  w     
 
  
    this method produced reasonable results  similar to those found in the literature when a
 

in the literature  it is customary to apply gaussian discriminant analysis to this problemwe choose to use
k means clustering because no training set was available for this given simulation 

 

fitraining set is available       depicted bellow  also depicted are the fitted and numerical galaxy
background functions for the i band  averaged over all redshift there is an apparent difference in
the two  reflected in the parameter estimates 

one would expect  due to this difference  that this classification will enable us to achieve better
errors on our halo mass estimation problem  however  there is an additional problem that comes
with separating the data as we have  namely  after binning the galaxies in redshift  each bin is left
with very few galaxies  which then compromises the galaxy background function fit  the number
of observed galaxies in our data set proved much too small to make this method work adequately 
producing extremely poor fits for the galaxy background function in each bin of redshift  and thus 
an extremely poor fit for the halo masses   more specifically  over     of redshift bins have less
than    galaxies  making the power law background fit unviable  this secondary result  however 
is relevant to inform the direction that future studies of weak lensing might take  given that the
number of background galaxies is increased  say  by improvements in data gathering techniques  
one should expect a significant improvement in the halo mass calibration  in other words  a future
experiment that used this technique in the data analysis would expect a reduction in the statistical
error  that is  such a study
 should check if the statistical error in the mass estimation does indeed
decrease faster than o    n   due to this technique
