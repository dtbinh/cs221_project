how we build

abstract
how do we go about building things  what steps do we take  and in what order  these
are the fundamental questions addressed in this project  using information gathered from real
people  via the xbox kinect  recorded by a web cam  and labeled by hand  machine learning
algorithms are trained on this data to label the actions of unknown builders  subjects are asked
to build simple  albeit intricate  designs to satisfy few constraints  given straws  tape  and a
paper plate  participants are asked to build a structure to hold a pingpong ball  without taping
anything to the table  immediately they begin testing their items and preparing to build and are
recorded every step of the way  building is a part of everyday life  from construction of
makeshift desk aids to architecture  there is a lot to be learned from the theory of building  with
more information comes the possibility of enhancing our abilities and bringing new light to the
world of construction 

introduction
the aim is to automatically label
building sessions based on hand motion 
how well a computer can classify actions
based on physical cues  we will specifically
be focusing on upper body cues  and even
more specifically on the right and left hands 
the xbox kinect has the capability to
capture the x  y  and z positions of the right
and left hands and is just waiting to be
hacked 
however  some challenges present
themselves at this stage  for instance 
which body parts will be most useful 
where do we set the kinect  how will we
measure the data  discrete  continuous 
time steps    data is the most important
piece in this puzzle  aside from appropriate
analysis  so these questions are important 
the next question is how to organize this
data  there is manually labeled data  kinect
recorded data  video data  and semantic
data for every experiment

there are many machine learning algorithms which could be run  to wit there are many
available libraries which do a lot of the work  but it is first necessary to get and format the input
data  one available tool is called weka  from the university of waikato  the graphical user
interface makes it easy to apply various machine learning algorithms and discover underlying
trends  as well as generate charts 

data gathering
in such an experiment  the training data is very important and was undertaken carefully 
i was very excited about the prospect of gathering completely new data rather than using stock
data from a database  this process would prove to be a time consuming one  first to hack the
xbox kinect  then to record real people  label the data  and then to synthesize the data into
something useful 
the kinect api was fairly easy to work with  i downloaded the api from microsoft online
and began development  the script is a little longer than     lines of code  i specified which
joints to measure  only upper body  and generated time stamps every     milliseconds  this
would all output to a comma separated value file

very special thanks go out to
marcelo worsely in the transformative
learning technologies lab for bringing high
school students in to test and gather data 
we labeled this data by watching videos
and creating time sheets with mappings to
the intended action as determined by us

the choice of features becomes an important consideration at this point  the features
desired include hand position and hand displacement  delta position from previous time stamp  
formulation of when to label is also important  the decision here was that it would be easy
enough to manipulate the data form python after recording it by hand in the way displayed
above 

data manipulation
python was used to translate the data from unformulated into a comma separated value
files ready for analysis  numpy is a statistics package for python and was used for the creation of
aggregated data  the main concern during this step was whether to display the data on a by
time interval basis  aka use the intervals delineated by our labeling  or to have a fixed time
interval   second for example   here lay the decisions of features which was in turn fueled by
the analysis

analysis
after training  the classification algorithm should be able to classify each action a person
takes during the building process  the strengths of this approach are clear  if we choose a good
domain of classifications and good features  we can hopefully solve our problem  an apparent
weakness is that choosing correct features and formulating them in conjunction with our time
stamps is hard 
weka was used for analysis  originally  nearly all of the  second intervals were
classified as building  this resulted in a false sense of accomplishment as it most of the intervals
actually were building as shown below 

fimicah arvey  

with fixed time intervals therefore  it was difficult to convince the machine to choose
anything but building  a new approach was to aggregate the data and use the time intervals
delineated by the label files  the domain space of classification was shrunk to   items  listed
above  this proved to be a valid approach when the correctly classified percentage surpassed
the percentage of building predicted intervals        accuracy was determined by the nave
bayed algorithm and shown below from the output of weka        is      better than the
baseline of     accuracy when based off of random guessing

conclusion
though the result is not staggering it shows that there is  obviously  insight on what
action people are taking based on physical action motions  for further analysis  an hmm  hidden
markov model  may be appropriate because it is obvious that once a person starts a task  they
will likely continue that task for a certain period of time and therefore it can be construed that
the previous action has some influence on the next action  also information could be gathered
from open cv to give data about how close the hands are to the objects
