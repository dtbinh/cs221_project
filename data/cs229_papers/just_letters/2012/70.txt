    introduction
we built a mobile app that help people get opinions and recommendations from their social network 
the app enables people to create picture poll and have friends to vote on it  since it contains
user generated content  it is essential to censor the content to ensure that there is no pornographic
content in the picture  monitoring all the content created in the app merely by human is labor cost 
therefore  we wanted to apply the knowledge learned from machine learning class to help detect the
pornographic pictures with some learning algorithms  our algorithm should be able to detect the
suspected pornographic picture  which could be censored by app admin in the end 
we collected the preliminary training examples labeled images  from online adult websites  the
nudity detection includes skin region recognition  feature extraction and image classification  two
classification methods are applied  which are classification by skin area and classification by
regionization  comparing the results  classification by regioniaztion is significantly better 

  dataset
for the training data set  we collected      normal pictures  marked as negative samples and     
pornographic pictures  marked as positive samples  the normal pictures consist of the categories of
mans fashion  womens fashion  design  food  travel  the size of the picture varies from  k to
   k      positive images and     negative images are used as the testing set

        skin  detection  
the most important feature that provides clues to image content is color  color is a low level feature 
which makes it computationally inexpensive and therefore suitable for real  time object
characterization  detection and localization  martinkauppi        
nudity often consists of showing naked persons  special shots of sexual organs  or a picture of
sexual intercourse  lin et al          the presence of large skin area is a main trait of these pictures 
therefore  skin color is a basic feature used in nudity detection  a disadvantage of systems using
color as a primary feature is that the systems will not work with black and white images  however 
nude images are rarely in black and white 
the simplest methods in skin detection define or assume skin color to have a certain range or values
in some coordinates of a color space  the rgb color space is one of the most widely used color
spaces for storing and processing digital image  however  the rgb color space alone is not reliable

fifor identifying skin colored pixels since it represents not only color but also luminance  skin
luminance may vary within and across persons due to ambient lighting so it is not dependable for
segmenting skin and non skin regions  chromatic colors are more reliable and these are obtained by
eliminating luminance through some form of transformation  some studies show that hsv is invariant
to highlights at white light sources  to matte surfaces  and ambient lighting  thus  the color space we
used in this article is hsv 
by referring to prior work from others and trial errors  a set of threshold values in hsv color space is
set up  hue h              saturation s             value v              this threshold works very
well  it has     accuracy rate with     false positive rate 
with this skin pixel recognition mechanism as a building block  some high level features can be
extracted in this experiment 
     features
        normalized  skin  size  
normalized skin size is defined by the percentage of skin pixels relative to the image size  it is one of
the main features that affect the probability of an image being nude or not  the larger the percentage
of skin is  the higher the probability that an image will be classified nude 
        normalized  n th  largest  connected  skin  area  size  
normalized n th largest connected skin area size is defined as the ratio between the number of
pixels in the n th largest skin area to the total skin pixel count in the image  we take      and   as n in
this study  these features mainly characterize the concentration of skin area because nudity pictures
always show grouped skin pixels rather than scattered skin pixels  all the   features were normalized
so they are not affected by their scale factor 
        normalized  average  distance  among  the  three  largest  connected  skin  areas     
the relative distance among connected skin areas can characterize the typical pattern of a
pornographic picture  one feature was the normalized average distance among the three largest
connected skin areas  the steps to extract this feature was as follows     find the geometric centers
of the three largest skin areas in an image     calculate the distances between any two of these three
centers     average the three distances into a value    divide this value by the diagonal length of the
image

       logistic  regression
the hessian h of the log likelihood function for the logistic regression was calculated  h was used in
the newton method to update theta consider it as converged when the difference between two theta
was less than           
       gaussian  discriminative  analysis  
since the input feature x are continuous valued random variables  we applied the gda model to train

fithe data  the parameters     were calculated and the training error obtained was         which was
unacceptable high 
       bayes  naive  
in this study  bayes naive algorithm was applied to train our model with the   above mentioned
features extracted  since naive bayes algorithm is only applicable to discrete features while the
above mentioned features are continuous  discretization must be applied to preprocess our features 
in this study  the continuous features were evenly discretized into a scale of   to     concretely  the
normalized values were scaled up by a factor of    and then rounded out to the nearest integer 
       svm  
support vector machine algorithm with a gaussian kernal  sigma      was applied to train our model 

    classification  by  regionization
      feature  extraction
       skin  filtering
since we only care about how many skin pixels an image contains and how they are distributed
across the image  we process all the images by filtering the skin pixels  for each sample image 
a matrix with the same size as the image was created  each element in this matrix corresponds
to a pixel in the image  after applying a skin pixel filter mentioned in section     on all the pixels
in the image and storing the answers in this matrix  we can get a binary matrix of which each
element stores   or   representing whether its corresponding pixel in the image is considered as
a skin pixel or not  figure   shows the visualization of this binary matrix converted from its
original image  as shown in figure     the white regions represent skin pixels and the black
regions represent non skin pixels 

figure        original  image                                    figure      a  binary black     white   matrix  visualization  for  skin  pixels  
  

       regionization  

in order to represent the distribution of skin pixels across an image  recording whether a pixel is a

fiskin pixel for all pixels in images is an exhaustive approach  however  images will have different size
therefore different numbers of pixels  moreover  taking information about all pixels individually as
features will definitely make a very high vc dimension  this is a cause for overfitting  to reduce the
number of features and vc dimension  we chose a    d vector to represent skin distribution 

the process of downsizing an image with any size to a   x   matrix i e     d vector by
concatenating rows or cols  is called regionization  specifically  the way to regionize an image is
simple  first thing first  partition the binary matrix obtained in section     into  x  regions  as
shown in figure     secondly  average the binary values within each region and put these
average values into a    d vector in row first order  figure   gives a visualization of this
averaging process  these are the two steps to do the regionization to an image  with
regionization  features representing the distribution and concentration of skin pixels in an image
can be extracted 

figure      partition  a  binary  image  into   x   blocks         figure      the  visualization  of  the  result  of  regionization  

     classification  

after downsizing all the images into a  x  matrix of skin proportions  all the data set were divided
into    divisions    of them were used as training set by the svm with guassian kernal  sigma  
      and the rest   was used as a test group  the best hypothesis is obtained by    fold cross
validation 

    result     
     classification  by  skin  area  
with features characterizing skin areas and their relative distance  the best training error obtained
among logistic regression  gaussian discriminative analysis  nave bayes and svm was        
which was very high  but it led to the exploration of classification by regionization  which significantly
improved the performance 

fi     classification  by  regionization  
with the features extracted by   x   regionization  the optimal performance for the svm model has
the accuracy of        on training set and accuracy of        in testing  it has false positive rate of
       and false negative rate of
