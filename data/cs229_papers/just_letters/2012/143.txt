motivation
in the   th century  many people are suffered from various kinds of chronic diseases without
effective medicines to cure  the trend analysis on medical treatment and topics can benefit
not only the professionals in biomedical domain but also those individuals who want to
educate themselves and to discover whether there is an alternative solution or growing trend
for curing a specific disease  the project exposes the trend information and builds up a basic
framework for future extended research 

abstract
there are two parts of trend analysis in this project  the first part is to measure medical
treatment trend given a disease or condition  the second part is to extract topics from
clusters and predict the topic trend  the analysis is performed against of         clinical trial
articles  technically  natural language processing and machine learning techniques are
applied to the work  such as linear regression  locally weighted linear regression and kmeans clustering algorithm  programming tools such as java based lucene indexing engine
is also applied in order to facilitate the processing  future work for improvement such as
named entity recognition is recommended 

introduction
the analysis is based on clinical trial articles  which can be downloaded from
clinicaltrials gov     the website is a service of us national institutes of health that contains
over         articles  in a clinical trial  also called an interventional study   participants
receive specific interventions according to the research plan or protocol created by the
investigators  these interventions may be medical products  such as drugs or devices 
procedures  or changes to participants  behavior  for example  diet  clinical trials may
compare a new medical approach to a standard one that is already available or to a placebo
that contains no active ingredients or to no intervention  when a new product or approach is
being studied  it is not usually known whether it will be helpful  harmful  or no different than
available alternatives  the investigators try to determine the safety and efficacy of the
intervention by measuring certain outcomes in the participants 
there have been many researches in trend analysis  tomonari et al      proposes the method
of adopting and extending latent dirchlet allocation  lda  for analyzing reference relationship
among scientific articles  nallapati et al      proposes topic flow model that basically
combines ideas from network flow and topic modeling  ren et al      proposes dynamic
hierarchical dirchlet process to model the time evolving statistical properties of sequential
 

fidata sets  the statistical properties of data collected at consecutive time points are linked via
a random parameter that controls their probabilistic similarity 
it seems the project is a forerunner project  because it is hard to find research papers in trend
analysis on medical treatments  in the project  a foundation framework is built up as the first
step  in the future  more sophisticated algorithms and methodologies can be applied 
each clinical trial article is in xml format where multiple fields are defined including
disease condition and intervention  those two fields are extracted for disease and treatment
information  respectively  furthermore  many other fields are extracted such as title 
description and summary  co occurred terms plays an important role in natural language
processing  for example  given the sentence   smoking can cause lung cancer    smoking 
and  lung cancer  are co occurred terms which indicate relationship through the verb  cause  
by analyzing the disease and intervention fields along with co occurred terms in summary 
title and description fields  medical treatment trend can be exposed 
a cluster of terms represents the topic of the cluster  in this project  k means clustering
algorithm is applied first before extracting the topic and computing the trend  for better topic
granularity  we classify terms inside the cluster into categories by year distribution  by looking
at terms in each category  we can discover how topics or terms are changed year after year 
detailed description is described in the following methods section and results section 

methods
multiple techniques have been applied to the projects 
xml parsing and lucene indexing
clinical trials downloaded from clinicaltrials gov are in xml format  which has well defined
fields  including disease condition  intervention  title  summary  description  study start date 
study completion date and primary completion date information  for the date field  we only
choose study start date as our temporal information  the fields and values are extracted into
key and value pairs and indexed using lucene indexing engine  lucene default standard
analyzer is applied without being customized in the project 
lucene search query and co occurred term relatedness
after indexing  search query and relatedness computation are performed by given any two
terms  the project focus is to find the trend on disease condition term and medical treatment
term  so any disease term such as  rheumatoid arthritis  can be given and treatment terms
 fish oil  can be given 
the relatedness of those two terms are computed using pointwise mutual information  pmi  
pmi indicates the strength of relatedness between terms  the equation is described in the
following 

 

fipmi   log  p term   term      p term   p term    
assuming n is total number of docs and df is a function of document frequency 
p term     df term     n
p term     df term     n
p term   term     df term  and term     n
above pmi equation is revised in the following in order to incorporate temporal information 
pmi   log  p term   term   year     p term   p term   p year   
the value of df can be easily acquired by counting the size of the search query result set
through lucene search engine  the total number of documents also can be easily acquired
using lucene api 
using lucene to store the data for computing the pmi is not only for quick implementation but
also for memory consideration  the project runs under    bit desktop machine  instead of   bit  however  there are         clinical trial articles which can contain lots of terms in the text
 there are over one million unique terms in biomedical domain    if storing df values for all
terms into a matrix  out of memory problem will most likely occur  however  by default lucene
only store only one term into memory for every     terms in its dictionary  therefore  using
lucene can achieve the memory efficiency 
linear regression  locally weighted linear regression using matlab
after pmi are generated  linear regression and locally weighted linear regression are applied
to generate analysis reports 
topic extraction and topic trend analysis
topic is extracted and trend of the topic is measured through the following steps 
   at first  a term vector is constructed for each document of the whole clinical trials 
where the tf idf based term weight is retrieved from lucene index  each term vector
contains various length of term weight pairs  including the investigation starting time of
the trial 
   then k means clustering algorithm is applied to generate clusters  the number of
clusters is set      then for each cluster  classify vectors into categories by year
distribution  then for each category  compute the center vector  mean  
   the term vector of the mean in each category is sorted by the term weight in
descending order  after removing noisy terms  we extract only top    highly weighted
terms to represent the topic of the category  the sum of the weight of those top   
terms represents relevant importance of the topic in the cluster to all topics in the
 

fiwhole clusters  common terms  such as  study    clinical  etc are considered noisy
terms  because they don t expose significant information  therefore  they are taken
out from the list 
the k means clustering program runs over two days under a    bit machine 

results
medical treatment trend
one trend is measured at a time by choosing only one disease condition and only one
medical treatment  in our cases  we measure two trends by choosing  arthritis  as the
disease condition and  stem cell  and  fish oil  as one of the corresponding medical
treatments  figure     shows the trends for each case  the red points shows the trend
prediction  developed using locally weighted linear regression algorithm

topic extraction and topic trend
a cluster of terms represent the topic of the cluster  and the topic trend in each cluster
indicates how important of that topic relevant to the whole clinical trial corpus  in the
following  we use three clusters related to  cardiac  vaccine and implant  respectively to
demonstrate our results in topic extraction and topic trend analysis 
fig    shows  cardiac  related topics categorized by years  fig    shows  cardiac  related
topic trend across years  both linear regression and locally weighted linear regression are
applied for the analysis  from the graph we know that the trend goes down  fig    and  
show  vaccine  related topics and trend  fir    and   show  implant  related topics and trend

conclusion and future work
multiple improvements can be done naturally in the next step 
named entity recognition and semantic distance measurement
the trend analysis currently doesn t consider of matching synonyms or near concepts  for
example  we don t measure how close of the meaning of  arthritis  to  polyarthritis   so during
clustering process  those two terms are considered orthogonal  thus  it is possible that a
document containing  arthritis  and another document containing  polyarthritis  are not fall
into the same cluster 
named entity recognition  ner  is a process of annotating concepts on those terms
meaningful to the system  with ner  synonyms will be annotated with the same concept 
thus  term like  bursitis  is the same as  frozen shoulder   therefore  pmi will be more
accurately measured  the semantic distance measurement  sdm  is to measure how close
of two concepts are each other  with sdm  the clustering quality can be improved if the term
weight tf idf is revised by plugging sdm  the ner can be achieved using umls
thesaurus     the other advantage of using ner and sdm is to reduce the term vector
dimension so as to contribute to the computational performance 
latent dirchlet allocation and hierarchical clustering
 

filatent dirchlet allocation  lda      is an unsupervised generative model based clustering
algorithm  it has been popularly applied to clustering and trend analysis  the main difference
between lda and k means is lda is soft link and k means is hard link based clustering  it
will be interesting to compare the quality between lda and k means 
no matter which clustering algorithm is used  converting the clustering algorithm into a
hierarchical clustering is an important step in order to have better computational speed and
quality  for example  currently for k means  it is set     clusters  to determine the cluster
the document will fall into  we need to compute the distance to each cluster center  meaning
the computation complexity is o       if converting the clustering algorithm into a hierarchy 
instead of setting      we can set maximal    clusters in each node of the hierarchy  the
distance is measured in top down fashion by traversing the hierarchy  because each node
has at most    clusters  the computation complexity could be less than o      when the best
cluster of some node is found in the hierarchy
