abstract

 given an individuals characteristics and relationships  what is the probability that she will
hear about and decide to participate in microfinance 

using data from a microfinance organization operating in southern indian villages  we use a logistic
regression classifier to predict the probability that
an individual will join the microfinance program in
her village  we perform our classification in two initial settings  one where we use only demographic and
graph features of an individual and one where we also
use labellings on the other nodes in the graph  as expected  the latter is able to improve our predictions 
we therefore try an iterative classification algorithm
to attempt to achieve better prediction accuracy than
the base model without being given knowledge of the
other labellings 

 

 can we use the relationship data and limited
data on who else in the village decided to participate in microfinance to update these prior probabilities and find the posterior probability that
an individual participated in microfinance when
we know that certain people in her village did
 or didnt  

 

data and preprocessing

the data consists of three sources 

introduction

 household census  each household was asked
for its religion  caste sub caste  roof type  number of rooms and beds  latrine type  and whether
their home is owned or rented 

between      and       the microfinance organization bharatha swamuki samsthe  bss  identified   
rural villages in southern india in which they hoped
to start operations and which previously had almost
no exposure to microfinance institutions or access to
formal credit  when they begin work in a village 
they do so by seeking out people in the village to
serve as injection points who they expect to be wellconnected within the villageteachers  leaders of selfhelp groups  shopkeepers  etc and holds a private
meeting with these village leaders to teach them
about the program and to ask them to help spread
the word about microfinance in the village 
in conjunction with bss  the authors of banerjee 
et al  collected social network and demographic data
in these villages in order to show that the influence
of these leaders  specifically  their eigenvalue centrality  in the social network graph of a village was positively correlated with the villages overall participation level in the microfinance program     
using this same dataset  we attempt to make similar conclusions at the node level  specifically  we seek
to answer the following questions 

 individual survey  about half of bss eligible
villagers in each village and asked for demographic information such as their age  religion 
caste  subcaste  mother tongue and other languages spoken  whether or not they are a native of the village or how long ago and why they
moved  where they work  whether they belong to
a savings group  have an election card or a ration card  they were also asked to provide information on their social network by listing other
people in the village who they interacted with
along thirteen different dimensions  who they
lend borrow money or material goods  kersone 
rice  to from  give seek advice from  go to temple with  people they visit and who visit them 
 participation data  the ids of the village leaders are recorded  as well as who ultimately joined
the program 
 

fiby the time data collection ended  bss had entered
   of the    villages they initially identified  due to
keying and other errors in the data  e g  nonunique
person ids   we restricted our sample to    of these   
villages  because we only have data for the surveyed
individuals  we also chose to restrict our social network graphs to the graphs between surveyed individuals  this eliminates the potential for asymmetries in
the network  e g  where a surveyed individual is not
listed as many times as she lists other people  solely
because the others did not have the opportunity to
list her because they were not surveyed  across the
   villages  a little less than        people were surveyed  after cleaning  we were left with       clean
observations  of these      were microfinance participants  and between   and    in each village were
identified as village leaders 

 

the social network graph  how many neighbors
she has  and her minimum and average distance
to the leaders in the village 

   

we chose to classify using logistic regression  because we split most of our features into categorical
dummy variables  we decided that an assumption
of linearity was unlikely to be too harmful  we confirmed by trying principal components regression and
svm with various kernels and saw little to no improvement in accuracy 
to get a sense of the importance and predictive
power of each of the three feature classes above 
we fit each feature class separately before combining them into two larger models  one with both the
demographic and graph features  and another with
all three feature classes  in fitting the demographic
model  we used forward feature selection to identify
the most relevant predictors 

methodology

   

learning

features

we use three types of features 
 demographic  we use the features from the individual surveys  because many of these features
are categorical  we do some initial dimensionality
reduction by restricting to features possessed by
   or more villagers  removing these relatively
uninformative variables reduces the sparsity of
the matrix and leaves us with    features 

one significant obstacle we faced was the problem of class imbalance  because less than   percent
of our sample participates in microfinance  a model
with a good prediction accuracy  by the usual standards  would be one that just classifies everyone as a
nonparticipant  thus  it was necessary to adjust our
measure of model accuracy from classification error
and the probability threshold above which we classified a node as a participant  as a preliminary attempt  we picked the probability threshold at what
we called the crossover point  where the percent of
correctly classified participants was equal to the percent of correctly classified nonparticipants  see figure     we chose this threshold because we do not
have any information to suggest that false positives
are more problematic than false negatives  discussed
further in future work  this measure is advantageous because it captures both types of error in one
assessment of model accuracy  class imbalance can
also distort the fit of a model since many learning algorithms assume a balanced dataset      a common
solution is to either undersample the majority class or
oversample the minority class in order to construct a
balanced dataset  in these cases  a correction should
be applied to the logistic regression coefficients     
we tried both undersampling and oversampling  using the correction suggested in     

 graph measures  we construct various measures of well connectedness to use as additional
features  intuitively  a more connected person
should be more likely to hear about microfinance 
and possibly be convinced to join it  to that
end  we use a persons clustering coefficient  betweenness centrality  eigenvector centrality  degree  and closeness  our adjacency matrix is initially defined so that all edges are undirected and
represent any type of relationship between two
nodes 
 participation  if we are given information on
who else in the village is participating in the
microfinance program  we can improve upon the
graph measures used above by using the fact that
an individual is probably more likely to participate in microfinance if she has a relationship
with someone else in the program  we therefore
add features such as whether or not an individual has a microfinance participant neighbor in
 

ficondition is reached  i e  the number of classifications doesnt change by more than  from one
iteration to the next

clearly  the more accurate the bootstrap stage is  the
more efficient the algorithm and the more likely we
are to get the right classifications  we thus tried two
different versions of the bootstrap stage  in one  we
assigned initial classifications using the partial model
 with demographic and graph features   in another 
we used our prior knowledge of the village leaders to
label just the leaders as microfinance participants

after applying this algorithm  we found that we
generally overpredicted the number of microfinance
participants  because there was too much diffusion
from the initial nodes  we found that due to the nature of our participation features  it was unlikely for
a node to go from being labeled as a participant in
one iteration to a nonparticipant in the next  this is
because having a neighbor do microfinance is a strong
predictor in our model of microfinance participation
since participants are so rare  and so once a microfinance participant is labeled it becomes likely that
almost all of her neighbors will also be classified as
participants  our solution was to slow the diffusion by using a weighted average of the participation
features in the current iteration and in the past iteration to make predictions  we can select this weight
by cross validation

prediction

there are essentially no villagers with links between
the villages so we treat them as separate graphs 
we furthermore assume that villages are homogenous
when working with demographic data  given that we
had over    examples per feature  as in      we split
our data into a training set of    villages  a test set of
  villages  and then a vaulted set of   villages  we
trained on    of these villages  and given our models 
we seek to evaluate them on a test set of   villages 
we choose to do so under different informational  no
information  limited information  and full information  settings and using different models 
in the no information setting  we are not given any
information about who participated in the microfinance program in the village  thus  we classify using
our model that was fit using only the demographic
and graph features  on the other hand  in the full
information setting  we are given the label of every
node in the graph except the one we are making a
prediction for  thus  we can use our full model to
make predictions 
to make use of the training data  where we do have
participation data  without requiring the same of the
test data  we implement an iterative classification
algorithm  ica  due to lu and getoor      the basic
structure of the algorithm is as follows

above we have recorded the different crossover
accuracies for our various models and algorithms 
the first column refers to the accuracy when we
make classifications based on the threshold chosen
on the train set  the second column refers to the
accuracy if we were able to choose the threshold
given the test set  the third shows the effect of
oversampling and applying the necessary coefficient
corrections  again using the training threshold 
we generally see a small improvement from the
imbalanced model 
the demographic model uses all demographic features  the graph model uses only network features 
the particpation model uses average distance to local
leaders  minimum distance to local leaders  and the
partial model uses demographic and graph data and
the full uses demographc  graph  and participation 
ica is  as before  the iterative classification algorithm  as expected  the individual and partial models do worse than the full model  it also appears that
our ica was not able to achieve the same crossover
accuracy as the no information model  with the leaders version doing particularly badly  upon further
review of the data  we found that many of the lead 

ers did not themselves end up participating in microfinance  it seems like the algorithm is unable to
overcome the error of labelling them as participants
in the first iteration in order to start the diffusion
process 
however  for the ica where we used the partial
model to make initial classifications  we found that
while the ica did not succeed in improving on the
crossover accuracy  it does dominate the partial demographic and graph model at some points of the
sensitivity specificity curve  that is  for a fixed positive ica model classification accuracy  the corresponding negative classification accuracy is strictly
superior to that of the partial demographic and graph
model  this can be seen in in figure      which shows
the sensitivity specificty curve for the baseline model
 blue  and the ica model  red  with a diffusion rate
of    
in figure      a heatmap shows the space and
intensity in which the ica outperforms the partial
model  the x axis in this plot is the weight  or diffusion rate  in the ica model  as the weight increases 
information diffuses more quickly  so that when the
weight is one  the diffusion is immediate  the yaxis shows the classification threshold above which
response predictions are labelled positive  we find
that  for diffusion rates less than      and typically
above     there exists some range of thresholds such
that the ica model strictly dominates the partial
model  furthermore  in general  there is a band of
thresholds between     and     with greatest outperformance over all diffusion rates

conclusion

using logistic regression and an iterative classification algorithm  we are able to train a model of microfinance participation in indian villages using both
demographic and network features  and to classify
entire village graphs at once  we show that this
model is able to improve on the partial model that
doesnt use features such as how many of an individuals neighbors are participating in microfinance
in certain situations  our full model is also able to
attain a    percent classification accuracy 

one of our initial reasons for using logistic regression
was for its interpretability  identifying features that
are particularly predictive of microfinance take up are
of particular interest in guiding real world microfinance programs  however  we have learned recently
of methods to interpret algorithmic model structures
from breiman      given that we are not to the functional form of logistic regression  using algorithmic
models may prove worthwhile 
we believe that random forests may be a good
candidate for two reasons  the first is that bss currently chooses new microfinance injection points using a decision tree and tree structures determined algorithmically would inform the current selection process  the second is that our data set is relatively
noise free and therefore a good candidate for boosting methods such as boosted trees or random forests
     this method   and others   can be extended by
determining from bss whether it their resources constrain them to a maximum ratio of acceptable false
positives to positive results  this would allow us to
construct a loss matrix modeling actual costs of false
positives and negatives to modify the gini coefficient
used when pruning trees

of relationships matter more than others  e g  giving receiving advice  and that we could take advantage of these differences to improve classification  as
with many graph problems  there is always the possibility that better measures of the underlying property
that we are trying to capture with our model exist
