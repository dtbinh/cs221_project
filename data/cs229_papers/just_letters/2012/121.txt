predicting airfare prices
manolis papadakis

introduction
airlines implement dynamic pricing for their tickets  and base their pricing decisions on demand
estimation models  the reason for such a complicated system is that each flight only has a set number
of seats to sell  so airlines have to regulate demand  in the case where demand is expected to exceed
capacity  the airline may increase prices  to decrease the rate at which seats fill  on the other hand  a
seat that goes unsold represents a loss of revenue  and selling that seat for any price above the service
cost for a single passenger would have been a more preferable scenario 
the purpose of this project was to study how airline ticket prices change over time  extract the factors
that influence these fluctuations  and describe how they re correlated  essentially guess the models that
air carriers use to price their tickets   then  using that information  build a system that can help
consumers make purchasing decisions by predicting how air ticket prices will evolve in the future  we
focused our efforts on coach class fares 

related work
there has been some previous work on building prediction models for airfare prices using machine
learning techniques              the various research groups have focused on mostly different sets of
features and trained their models on different kinds of flights  a major distinction among these projects
is the specific trend they are trying to predict  specifically  we can categorize projects into  
approaches  studying the factors that influence the average price of a flight      or those that influence
the price of a specific flight in the days leading up to departure          we will use this distinction in
the definition of our model 
there also exist commercial services  like bing travel  which actually evolved from the work in      
that perform this kind of prediction  but their models are not made public 

data collection
there are various sources of airfare data on the web  which we could use to train our system  a
multitude of consumer travel sites supply fare information for multiple routes  times  and airlines  most
airlines also expose a booking system on their websites  these sites could be scraped to extract data for
the subset of flights we are interested in  there are also applications  like kvstool  that offer more
direct access to the information published on the reservation systems  in a format that is more
convenient to parse  some research groups have made their datasets available to other researchers 
although the set of features they have recorded may be different from the ones we are interested in 
one feature that is especially important for our purposes is historical ticket prices  both for the specific
flight we are reasoning about  and as an average for similar flights in the past  the former is sometimes
available from consumer travel websites and air travel analytics companies  but can also be collected
manually over a period of time  the latter can be extracted from statistics released by certain air travel
governing bodies  in addition to other aggregate statistics that may be useful  
there are certain features that would be very useful in training a prediction algorithm  but which the
airlines  due to their competitive environment  do not release to the public  this includes the actual
number of available seats on a flight  the distribution of ticket purchases over the lifetime of a fare and
fine grained sales figures  also  the publicly available fare data does not include certain kinds of
tickets  like consolidator and corporate tickets  which are negotiated in private with the airline  finally 

fimany low cost airlines do not publish their rates on the reservation systems  and are thus not indexed
by most online systems 
we decided to use data collected from bing travel  which conveniently included historical information
on lowest daily fares for the past    days  this freed us from having to collect such data manually  but
did somewhat limit our design choices  if we wanted to remain compatible with the historical
information available from the site  for example  we had to restrict ourselves to round trip flights
between us airports  and couldn t pick specific itineraries  e g  only non stop flights  or specific
airlines  also  the only departure date for which we could get a full fare history  i e   up to the last day
before departure  we assume flyers would buy their tickets at least one day in advance  was the day
after our collection day  since online sites generally do not keep data on past flights 
under these constraints  we picked    flights to consider  all round trip flights between   major us hub
airports  atlanta  chicago  los angeles  dallas and denver  leaving on            and returning one
week later  due to our choice of features  we could only use information about those dates for which
we had at least   days of prior fare history  i e     out of the    days     previous days plus the present
day  that we had data for  this adds up to     data points 
the data collection phase was slightly involved  because bing travel does not present the historical
information in text  but only in the form of a fare chart  to extract fare data about a flight we had to
crop a screenshot of the site  the fare chart was not directly accessible as an image  to only the interior
of the graph  and feed that to a graph digitizer  engauge   which we had previously configured
appropriately so that it could automatically detect the chart line and the axes  which we had to draw
manually on the cropped image   with the added information about the minimum and maximum values
on the axes  engauge would export a csv file with the day to price values represented by the chart 
we then had to filter those values to only include points corresponding to integer valued dates  and
subsequently process those to extract the desired features 

model
we can view the price of a flight as a random variable c  based on our assumption that prices of
different flights exhibit similar patterns of fluctuation over time  we can model c as the sum of two
random variables  b and f  b models the base price of the ticket  which is constant for the duration
of the ticket sale   and f its fluctuation  the parameters that determine the value of c affect b and f in
different ways  some only affect one of the two  e g   the date of booking only affects f  by definition  
most of them affect both  but to different degrees  e g   we expect that the date of travel and the
historical average will mostly affect the base price  
based on the above formulation  we can more formally reason about our objective  our aim is to
predict the fluctuation of ticket prices  so we are mostly interested in f  and  by extension  in those
features that affect f the most  which we will have to discover  
although we only care about the distribution of f  if we want to combine data for more than one
flights  we will need to compensate for their difference in the value of b  we will  therefore  need to
further simplify our model  one possibility  which aims to normalize fluctuation across different
flights  is to assume that fluctuation is always relative to the base price  i e  to make fluctuation into a
multiplier  c   bf   going a step further  we may assume that the features which affect b are
completely disjoint from those that affect f  thus separating the problem of predicting f from that of
predicting b 
since we don t want to reason about b  our initial approach was to substitute its  unknown  value for
each flight with an approximation  possible candidates included the price of the same flight a year ago 
the historical average for that route  or the average price over the whole period from the moment

fiticketing opens up to   months before the date of departure  prices exhibit little fluctuation with
demand over that time  which must mean that the offered fare is a reasonable one for the flight   of
these values  only the first two were readily available  and the aggregate data we could find was often
unusable  because it averaged over all fare classes  while we only cared about coach class tickets 
moreover  from comparing the past averages with the data collected from bing travel  we found that
they had little correlation with current prices  as a result  we opted not to follow this approach  and
instead chose to record previous days  prices in relation to the price at each specific day  to compensate
for differences in the base price across different flights 

feature selection
there are multiple features that can be used to train a predictor  and for some it makes sense to collect
them over a period of time 
we expect certain features to be mostly relevant for the base price of a flight  e g  
 characteristics of the carrier  size  business model  i e  low cost or traditional 
 date time of flight  and of return leg  if applicable  date  especially if it s close to a major
holiday  time of day  day of week  e g  the majority of business flight itineraries is monday to
friday 
 duration of stay  for round trip flights 
size model of aircraft  a proxy for flying efficiency 
whether the destination is international or domestic
flight distance  proxy for operating cost  and potentially for buyers  types 
competition on the same airport  market share of airline in terms of passengers  especially
whether it is the dominant carrier on the airport  competition index  e g  hhi  whether there
are any low cost competitors 
 competition on the same route  ratio of offered seats over all similar flights 
 itinerary characteristics  number of stops  layover duration 
 size of departure arrival airport  total daily passengers  total number of connecting airports 
 market size of departure arrival city  city size  population  income per capita 
as explained above  we will ignore such features  and instead focus on features that mostly affect price
fluctuation 
 number of unsold seats  and recent fluctuations on that number   as a measure of demand
 state of competing options on the same route  number of available seats on similar flights 
current price for those flights  recent price fluctuations 
 date time of booking  especially days left until departure
 recent price for the same ticket  and recent fluctuations of the price
we chose to consider only features in the last two categories  specifically the number of days left until
departure and the fare price on the previous   days  relative to the current day s price   the historical
information that bing travel recorded was the lowest fare across all airlines  so the second parameter
 competition  was irrelevant in our case  as for the number of unsold seats  besides the fact that there is
no easily accessible historical data on it  it would be of limited use for training our system  because the
number that is released to ticket reservation systems is only a lower bound on the actual value  i e    
available seats actually means at least   seats left   and the same seat may be sold as part of multiple
fares  we had hoped to use it in conjunction with the number of available seats as shown on airplane
seat maps  but this information is also inaccurate  tickets may be sold with no assigned seats  and a





fiportion of the seats may be held for assignment at the gate  so the seats shown as available on a seat
map may actually be over  or under estimating the actual number of available seats 

hypothesis
our overarching goal is to help ticket buyers make optimal purchasing decisions  in pursuit of this goal 
there are various levels of granularity we could choose for our predictions 
 predict the price of the ticket on an arbitrary future date
 predict the minimum value that the fare is going to reach from today up to the day of the flight
 or up to a number of days in the future 
 predict if the price of the ticket will drop in the future
we chose to use the third option  essentially viewing our application as a supervised classification
problem 

training   evaluation
we used the weka machine learning suite to experiment with different algorithms  and tested their
effectiveness using     hold out cross validation  among the top performing algorithms were the
following  the distribution of positive and negative instances in our dataset was

also of note is the behavior of the simple decision table algorithm  which achieved     accuracy
using only   features  the number of days until departure and the price on the previous day  the
resulting rules table was heavily weighted towards true  and as a result was excellent at correctly
classifying the cases where prices would indeed drop        recall for positive instances   but very
inaccurate on negative instances        recall for those  
it is interesting to note that getting good performance on a metric like the above might not actually
translate to good performance on the application we care about  i e  advising consumers on their buying
strategy  a more realistic evaluation strategy would be to use our predictor to give recommendations to
hypothetical buyers under various situations  then check whether following our strategy would actually
save them money  and or how close our advising scheme is to the optimal  i e  an oracle on future
prices  
such a system would work as follows  given a flight that the user is interested in booking  it runs the
predictor on said flight  and  based on the result  advises the user to either buy right away  buy   or
wait for a predicted future drop in price  wait   perhaps with an accompanying measure of
confidence  the default advice  in the absence of sufficient evidence suggesting the opposite  would be
buy  the maximum expected gain would be compared to the potential loss  perhaps relative to the
current price   to quantify whether the projected gain justifies the risk 

future work
the greatest shortcoming of this work is the shortage of data  anyone wishing to expand upon it should

fiseek alternative sources of historical data  or be more methodical in collecting data manually over a
period of time  additionally  a more varied set of flights should be explored  since it is entirely
plausible that airlines vary their pricing strategy according to the characteristics of the flight  for
example  fares for regional flights out of small airports may behave differently than the major  wellflown routes we considered here   finally  it would be interesting to compare our system s accuracy
against that of the commercial systems available today  preferably over a period of time
