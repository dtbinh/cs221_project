introduction 
nowadays  social media has become a platform for people to convey their voice to the public 
among various opinions that people share and exchange  there are a lot of comments about
consumer products  recently  it has been shown that the chatter of the consumers in the social
media such as facebook  twitter  myspace  google  and etc  correlates strongly with the
products actual financial performance in the market  this forms a beneficial database for
companies to analyze the consumers demands in order to make a quantitative prediction of their
potential customers  we were inspired by this new potential and decided to exploit our machine
learning skills in order to investigate the trends in the social media discussions and use them to
predict the actual sales of electronic devices before their release 
we chose the electronic device market  because first of all  the electronic device market has
always been very competitive  and recently with the growing variety of new products it is very
challenging to predict which brand will dominate the market  having an estimate of the product
sale before the release of the product would provide the company with prior knowledge of its
profit and also help them decide the quantity of the release in different regions based on the
request  secondly  the actual outcome of the electronic device market sales can be easily
accessed and we can use it to train our model 
in this project  we try to predict the sales of electronic devices based on the sentiment of the
comments made about them on twitter before their release  to predict the sentiment of the
comments we use a machine learning framework based on recursive autoencoders  rae  for
sentence level prediction of sentiment label distributions  this method learns vector space
representations for multi word phrases  in sentiment prediction tasks these representations
outperform other state of the art approaches on commonly used datasets  such as movie reviews 
without using any pre defined sentiment lexica or polarity shifting rules  after sentiment
prediction  we use linear regression with four features to predict the sales of the devices  we
have selected total number of comments  number of positive comments  total number of
retweeted comments and number of retweeted positive comments as the four features of our
model  we compare our prediction accuracy with a linear regression only based on the total
number of comments with no sentiment analysis and show that our method significantly
improves the prediction accuracy 

fiin the following sections  we first describe what kind of data we plan to use for our purpose and
how we have collected them  next  we will talk about the techniques that have been used to
achieve the goal of predicting the sales  and finally  we talk about the results of our projects and
come to a conclusion 
data 
for this project  we need two sets of data  first the social media content that will be used to form
the input features to our system  and second the sales revenue numbers of different electronic
device products that will be used as the target variables  together these two datasets will form
our training set 


social media content  for the purposes of this project  we decided to use twitter data 
we have collected twitter data through the http   stanford discovertext com  website  the
way the website works  is that you can provide it with a specific keyword and it
automatically fetches all the tweets that contain that keyword  it also allows for time
windowing which is very helpful for our project and enables us to focus only on the
comments that are posted in the pre release time window of a specific product  next  we
need to modify the data to have a consistent format  in particular we need to parse the
data and convert it to a readable format for our algorithm 
the format that was needed for our project dictated us to map the comments into a
vector space  basically  we stored each comment in a binarized vector  each component
being the number of that word in the comment in a predefined body of words  a
matlab function was written that reads all the comments and uses matlabs
wordmap functions to find that word in our pre stored body of words and store the vector
representation of all the comments 



product sales data  we picked   electronic devices that have been recently released and
collected the actual sales numbers from the internet

fimethods 
for this project  we decided to use the semi supervised recursive autoencoders for predicting
sentiment distributions     method  the reason being that the mentioned algorithm has several
desirable properties  first of all  it takes the whole sentence including the syntax and grammar
into account instead of just focusing on the bag of words  this is done through paying attention
to the order of words in the statement  which gives us a more accurate evaluation of the
sentiment behind the statement  second  it does not require any predefined dictionary of positive
or negative words 
after performing the sentiment analysis  we extract four features from all the gathered twitter
data for each product and try to fit a model to our data that best predicts the sales figures of the
electronic devices 
the following sections describe each of these steps 
sentiment analysis
as described above  after gathering the data  we first used the semi supervised recursive
autoencoders for predicting sentiment distributions method developed by socher et al to classify
the comments about each product into positive and negative categories  for training purposes 
we manually classified      tweets about iphone  into positive and negative groups and used
them as training data in our classifier  iphone  was chosen because it had the most number of
comments both positive and negative and so was ideal for making ground truth  
using       cross validation on this data  we found out the comment classification accuracy to
be      we then used the trained classifier to categorize the comments about other products into
positive and negative groups 
sales prediction
after sentiment analysis  we used a linear regression model with four features to predict the sales
of the products in table    we used the following four features suggested by asur and huberman
    in our model  total number of comments  number of positive comments  total number of
retweeted comments and number of positive retweeted comments 
we used the sales data for ipad   iphone   samsung droid charge  samsung galaxy nexus 
samsung galaxy s  samsung galaxy sii and samsung galaxy siii to train our model and crossvalidated it on ipad  and iphone s sales 

fiexperiments and results 
we tested our sales prediction accuracy against a linear regression model that only uses the total
number of tweets about a product with no sentiment analysis and added features  the table below
shows the results  it is seen that our method significantly improves the prediction accuracy 

conclusion 
in this project  we showed how the content of social media produced by the mass public can be
used to predict how well a product is going to do in the market before its release  in particular 
using the twitter data about certain electronic devices  we constructed a model that can forecast
the actual sales figures of a product with a reasonable accuracy  we also performed an state ofthe art sentiment analysis on the comments to determine the polarity of those comments without
using a predefined lexica of labeled words
