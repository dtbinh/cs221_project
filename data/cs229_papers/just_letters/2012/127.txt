identifying external vulnerability
zhao liu
   introduction

in economics  external vulnerability refers to susceptibility of an economy to outside shocks  like
capital outflow  an economy that is externally vulnerable is prone to currency crisis or debt crisis 
because of the grave consequences of the crisis  early warning systems  ews  have been built
by central banks and research institution to predict the external vulnerability 
in this project  we do not follow the common practice of building the system with var  instead 
we explore the possibility of using machine learning techniques to forecast the crisis from
macro economic variables  due to data availability  we focus only on the euro area sovereign
debt crisis  studying oecd countries  our study shows that  although the market lacked
awareness to the crisis before its outbreak  signals can be generated to give strong warning to
countries that later suffered heavily in the crisis 
from technical view  this problem is also highly interesting  because     unlike most other
machine learning applications  macro feature data is very scarce  missing data point is common 
and frequency is low      unlike engineering application where labels are clear  macro trend may
stay latent for many years before breakout  euro crisis is especially interesting  even when first
round of crisis broke out in peripherals  people still thought that eurozone was safe  until more
than one year later  therefore  we are especially interested at oct       the month before

   data and software package
we use   year sovereign credit default swap  sovcds  as a quantitative indicator of the degree
of crisis for each country  downloaded from bloomberg  sampled monthly  higher the cds rate 

fihigher the risk of country default  totally there are about twenty variables  available monthly or
annually  downloaded from eiu  oecd stat  and world bank database  explanatory data set
differ slightly for each method due to data availability on different frequency  we use matlab
stats toolbox and osu svm     for some functions 

   looking backward descriptive regression
before trying to predict the crisis  we start from a simple case  given our current knowledge of
the crisis  we want to see how much we can explain from       pre crisis  data  the intuitive
way of doing this is to regress cds data on macro variables  however  we found this process
frustrating because of nonlinear relationships  to avoid this  we put labels on the six countries
that suffered most in the crisis  and run logistic regression 
because of severe missing data  multi variable regression can only work in very small samples 
therefore  we used single variable logit regression for each variable and combine the results 
table   shows the result of calculating average fitted value from leave one out test  it shows
that looking backward  we can identify most of the crisis countries  with high false alarm rate 
except italy  this serves as a baseline for our prediction attempts below

   leave one out svm fitting
starting from this section  we will run backtesting and use only information up to the date of
concern  e g   in       we do not know greece will enter crisis   every month  we use k means
clustering to separate cds into two groups  and label the upper group as risky  because in the
previous test  we found svm to be more robust than the logit regression  and since we are
working on data separation  we use leave one out svm to train and test the data  if a country
labeled safe was found to be risky by svm  we will count it as a warning  normally called false
alarm   we found that counting number of warning is an effective way of identifying risky
countries

table   shows the cumulative number of warnings by oct       outbreak of greece crisis  if we
ignore the countries that have already suffered crisis  like mexico  characterized by missing
warnings and fitted crisis   the five eurozone crisis countries almost occupied the top block 
this method seems encouraging  but there is an issue with it  the signal is so scarce that people
will doubt that it is temporary noise  the reason is that labels are misleading  according to cds
data  before oct       these five countries are considered relatively safe  such information is
trained into the model  so that the model tends to indicate the countries to be safe 

   long term early prediction using clustering
the first reaction to the above mentioned problem is to use only data from risky countries  and
some countries hand picked to be safe  and run the loo svm  this failed because the training
set is too small  the second answer is to use unsupervised learning  however  crisis countries do
not form a well separated cluster  however  combining these two threads  we developed a
method that provides reasonable score for the countries risk 
we ran k means clustering  overlaying it with the current crisis information  we first find the
largest number of clusters so that all crisis countries fall in the same cluster  the cluster
containing all risk countries is dubbed as max group  if a safe country fall into max group 
it has a good match for the risky cluster  we then find the smallest number of clusters so that
every crisis country falls into different cluster  the clusters containing risky countries are
dubbed as min group  if a safe country falls in to min group  it has high similarity to a
certain crisis countries  if a safe country falls into both groups  then we count it as a risky
signal  we count the cumulative number of signals for each country as the indicator of the risk

cds

this method proved to be effective  except for greece  other countries on top of the list may
not be false alarm  poland and israel already have cds above peers  and slovakia later
experienced cds hike  up to today  there are discussions on whether france will be hit next in
the euro crisis 
the drawback of this method is that there is no clear cut between risky and safe  risk indicator
goes down smoothly in the table  the next method will provide a clearer signal in the near term 

   quickly responsive prediction using dynamic model selection and
aggregation
once market sentiment change  for example  worries about debt level   we want to capture it 
and identify all countries that may be considered risky with such sentiment  this family of
method does not provide long term identification of external vulnerability  instead  it works
right after the crisis outbreak  helping you to identify who will be hit next  therefore  it can be
separated into two parts  identifying the sentiment  and rate the country 
multi variable regression suffers from multi colinearity  which makes coefficients notoriously
unreliable  single regression  however  suffers severe bias  as a tradeoff  we use models with
two explanatory variables  since we dont know which model to choose  we maintain a large
pool of models     explanatory variables yields    models   and select them dynamically using
p value  perfect separation is considered p value of     we select the better half of the models

fiat each time  use significance to generate weights  and aggregate their predictions according to
the weights 
the result is encouraging  in oct       besides of the expected spike of greece and iceland  we
found they are followed by ireland  spain  and portugal  comparing this to figure    the warning
signal is given   months or   year earlier than the crisis in these countries

   summary and future work
our work proved the potential of using machine learning to study macro features in order to
deliver early warning signals for future crisis  comparing to the mainstream var based
economic forecasting models  our method requires least human input for model selection 
outdated model selection by hands for economic prediction may cause under reaction to new
changes  fully automatic learning system would be useful in overcoming this problem 
for future work  dynamic model selection has the potential of improvement by introducing
memories to the model  a model with memory has higher resistance to noise  and also possibly
more responsive to certain structure changes  we implement some designs of model memory
without observing significant improvement  but it is an interesting topic to work on  also  if
implemented with more historical data  our system has the potential of expanding into a fullsize
early warning system for both emerging markets and oecd  covering different kinds of crisis
