introduction

research

in the aircraft industry safety  maintenance costs  and
optimum weight are three of the most important factors
to consider in design  composite materials  such as
carbon fiber reinforced polymers  cfrps   are increasingly
used in aerospace applications due to their high strength
to weight ratio  however  there are still many challenges
to overcome in order to have full confidence in the use of
composite structures  specifically  composites have very
different failure types and modes than traditional metal
materials used in aircraft  this makes prediction of
damage initiation and propagation difficult in practical
application  

the structures and composites laboratory  sacl  at
stanford university is developing an shm technique based
on the propagation of a type of ultrasonic wave  called
lamb waves  through thin plated structures  the lamb
waves are propagated and sensed via piezoelectric sensor
networks  specifically acellents smart layers  adhered
to the structure  sacl works with laminated cfrps  which
are thin plated structures constructed of stacked plies
with unidirectional carbon fibers bonded by epoxy  the
two main types of damage in these composite structures
are matrix micro cracking and inter laminar delamination 
matrix micro cracking happens within each ply in the
epoxy between carbon fibers  and is a precursor to the
more serious damage type of delamination  delamination
is the de bonding between plies which significantly
decreases the strength of the material and leads to
ultimate failure in the structure  current detection
methods and research in sacl are geared towards
detection of these damage types and quantification of
matrix micro cracking in composite laminates  this
project will focus on quantification of delamination 
specifically prediction of the severity of the delamination 
which is directly correlated to damage size 

use of structural health monitoring  shm  would help
to solve this problem  shm  the process of implementing
a damage detection and characterization strategy for
engineering structures  enables engineers to assess realtime conditions in a structure  this would allow a
condition based maintenance strategy that would increase
aircraft safety and decrease maintenance costs by
eliminating unnecessary inspections  the essential steps
in an shm system are to first detect the damage  second
classify the type of damage  third quantify the damage 
and fourth predict damage propagation   this project is
geared specifically towards quantification of delamination
in composite laminates  a specific type of damage found in
this material  training algorithms with different feature
sets and damage size classifications will be compared to
find the best strategy for prediction of delamination
severity 

experiments
experiments to study damage propagation in
composite panels loaded in tension tension fatigue are
ongoing in sacl in collaboration with nasa ames  the
bonded piezoelectric networks generate ultrasonic signal
data to analyze for changes in the structure corresponding
to damage  two sets of six sensors are bonded to the
 

fistructure  with one set used as actuators to generate the
signal at seven different actuation frequencies          
khz at    khz intervals  and the second set used as
sensors to collect signal data  this yields a total of thirtysix diagnostic paths with which to map damage across the
coupon  figure     the tension tension cyclic loading 
simulating continued use of a structure  is provided using
sacls mts machine 
after an interval of cycles 
dependent on the current point in the lifetime of the
coupon  signal data is collected and samples are x rayed
to provide images of the real damage type and quantity 
the sensor signals from all paths can be processed with
different techniques to extract parameters from both the
time and frequency domains to use as features in training
algorithms  all sensor data is compared to a baseline 
taken before loading the sample as an example of a
healthy system  coupons are tested to failure 

data
for each cycle interval  the data from all thirty six
paths are used to create a complete map corresponding
to the current state of the structure  for which the actual
delamination width and height are measured from the xray  figure     for this project  five different features
were chosen and computed from the raw experimental
data  time of flight  amplitude change      correlation
coefficient between the baseline and new waveform   the
power spectral density  psd  overall maximum value  and
the maximum psd value at the actuation frequency  the
psd of a signal describes how the power of that signal is
distributed with frequency  each extracted parameter was
normalized with its corresponding value from the baseline
signal  previous work in sacl has shown the actuation
frequency of     khz to yield the best modeling results  so
at this stage only that frequency data was used 

classification algorithm
in classification  i attempted to classify the
delamination in a composite panel as fitting into one of
multiple different severity classes  which are dependent
on size  this would correspond in application to declaring
a known damage as either minimal  acceptable  or
critical with respect to the desired function  engineering

analysis would be used to determine the acceptable limits
for existing damage in a structure  with an appropriate
safety factor  therefore i modeled the data as a
multinomial problem using softmax regression  a
generalization of logistic regression that allows for more
than two class labels 
two types of class labels were used for the
classification  both categorized by the above mentioned
damage criteria  the first was an approximation of the
area of the delamination from the height and width
measurements  the second was the fraction of the
vertical distance between sensors  see figure    that the
height of the delamination was at each interval  in
application  these thresholds would be chosen from
physics based models that determine the amount of
damage allowed before maintenance is required 
the softmax regression algorithm i wrote is derived
from the lecture notes  and ufldl online tutorial   i
implemented a weight decay term  as suggested in     to
guarantee a strictly convex cost function and unique
solution  yielding the following cost function j   and its
derivative 

   

   
i then used gradient descent to update j   until
convergence 
in training the model i used leave one out cross
validation  loocv   iterating through all training
examples  as i have relatively little data to work with  the
generalization error of the model was estimated by
tabulating the number of incorrect predications over all
loocv cases and dividing by the total number of training
examples  tables      in the appendix show the
generalization error for different combinations of
 

fithreshold values for the classes  the best achieved error
of a case where all classes were actually predicted was
        when varying the thresholds  certain classes
were harder for the algorithm to predict  i e  the model
would predict most samples as being from the largest
damage class and not predict any in the middle damagesize class  no combination of threshold values yielded
good prediction in all three classes  figures        i
believe this results from having more data for the large
damage case  as delamination grows quickly and nonlinearly with continued fatigue  therefore it is more
difficult experimentally to capture the early delamination
stages with intermediate sizes 

feature selection
i wrote a forward search algorithm to attempt to
refine my number of features and achieve a more
accurate map of the delamination without noise from
features not contributing to the prediction  because
forward search is computationally expensive  i wrote a
hold out cross validation algorithm to select features  
where the data set was randomly separated into    
training data and     test data  once the final feature set
was selected  i used loocv to estimate the error for the
new model with the reduced feature set  i found that my
algorithm selected a very limited number of features  and
therefore ended up increasing the error in the final
implementation of softmax regression 
additionally  i attempted using only signal paths
directly adjacent to the damage area in order to reduce
the feature set  this reduced the number of paths from to
nine  see figure     again  this increased the test error 

logistic regression
finally  i regressed the softmax algorithm into logistic
regression by only using one threshold value  i did this
because the softmax algorithm was doing relatively well at
recognizing two out of three classes  so i decided to
attempt using it as a binary classifier  using the algorithm
as an indicator of delamination size greater than some
minimum acceptable value worked very effectively  with
the lowest achieved error value of         the error
values are shown in table   and a sample plot in figure   

conclusions and future work
the softmax regression algorithm works moderately
well as a multi level classification of damage size  logistic
regression is very effective at indicating delamination size
above a given threshold  the most difficulty in the
softmax regression algorithm comes from the skew of the
data towards larger delamination size 
refinement of the threshold values for the different
softmax classes may help minimize error in the algorithm 
a method is needed to systematically test different classes
and converge on the optimal threshold values  which
hopefully would coincide with physics based damage
thresholds  moreover  this classification may work better
with different algorithms and machine learning strategies 
therefore a next step would be to apply this data to other
algorithms and study their effectiveness  this work only
utilized one actuation frequency of sensor data in the
training set  and this could be expanded to use the other
six available frequencies to yield more results  sacl also
has additional composite panels of different layups and
material properties that could be added to this study to
see whether the predictive algorithm dependant on
laminate configuration
