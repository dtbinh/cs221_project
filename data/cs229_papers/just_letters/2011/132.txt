introduction

the movie industry is a multi billion dollar industry  generating approximately     billion of
revenue annually   in recent years  movies have generally become divided into two categories 
blockbusters and independent movies  studios have focused on relying on only a handful of
extremely expensive movies every year to make sure they remain profitable  it is estimated that
    of the industrys profits over the last decade is generated from just    of the films released 
    of movies have lost money of the same time period   these blockbuster movies emphasize
the spectacular  casting as much star power as possible and pairing it with high production value 
the result of this is a sky rocketing budget  it is estimated that the average movie now costs
       million after including production and marketing expenses   however  hollywood is the
land of hunch and wild guess  so its difficult to predict whether these high budget films will
actually make a profit 
as the costs of movies have gone up  it has become paramount that movies are successful to
justify such large undertakings  studios are under great pressure to ensure their movies succeed 
trying to find ways to produce movies that are more likely to be successful  however  this is
much hard said than done  jack valenti  president and ceo of the motion picture association of
america  mpaa  once said  no one can tell you how a movie is going to do in the
marketplace  not until the film opens in darkened theatre and sparks fly up between the screen
and the audience  
because of this the movie industry has attempted to employ the help of computer scientist to
create recommendation and predictive software to tackle this problem  recommendation
software is more common and attempts to make correlations between a consumers past choices
and other products they might like  the recent netflix prize competition caused a great surge in
the creation recommendation algorithms by providing    million prize to anyone that can
improve their algorithm by      predictive software is less common  and typically highly
inaccurate  prediction software attempts to predict the success of a movie using only the details
known pre release  this project attempts to employ machine learning to predict the expected
profits of a movie 
ii 

data

the data used for this project was obtained from imdb using a python script to scrape the data 
we limited the movies we used in our project to feature films released between      and      
were in english  and had a gross revenue of at least           using these search criteria we
were able to find       movies 

 

fiwe had a number of reasons for placing these restrictions  the reason for placing the time period
restriction was that we only wanted to include recent movies as it would have been difficult to
compare movies from different eras  over time  movie tastes would have changed  meaning the
characteristics of a profitable movie would have also changed  our model would be unable to
take these changes into account  this time period restriction was also placed so that gross
revenue comparisons wouldnt be significantly impacted by the rates of inflation  if this needed
to be taken into account  it would have further complicated our model  also  we only included
movies that were in english as we were only interested in u s  box office results and thus were
only looking at u s  gross revenue  foreign films were often reported in euros  necessitating that
we take the conversion rate into account  lastly  we required that all movies have a gross
revenue of at least          to reduce the number of independent movies that have a limited
amount of information available 
iii 

features

the features that we included were the genres  as classified by imdb   the user rating  the
number of user ratings  the budget  the run time  the mpaa rating  g  pg  pg     etc    the
studio company that produced the movie  the number of screens during the opening weekend 
and the time of year the movie was released 
all of these features are available pre release  with the exception of the average use rating and
the number of user ratings  the reason we decided to include these features into our model was
to determine whether they would significantly affect the projected revenues 
in kings paper  it was found that there was no apparent correlation between box office success
and critic approval   this is surprising given the fact that there are a number of movies available
for viewing and movie goers only see a select few  requiring them to rely on some source to
determine which of these movies are worth watching  because of kings findings  we were
curious to see whether user ratings have a significant impact on revenue  according to
kennedys paper  there is a fairly strong relation between user ratings and critic ratings  meaning
movie goers generally agree with a critics opinion  however  movies that had critical acclaim
didnt necessarily do any better  raising the question of whether movie goers still see movies
they anticipate them to be bad 
iv 

model

to obtain a projected revenue for a movie  we implemented a linear gradient descent algorithm 
features such as genres  seasons  mpaa movie ratings  and studio production companies are
binary classifications that can be assigned a value of   or    however  our other features such as
the budget  number of ratings  and user ratings are not binary classifications and have large
values that can be highly variable  because of this we normalized the features so that their values
have a mean of   and variance of    we accomplish this by computing the following   steps 
   set
   replace each

having calculated a predicted revenue  we will classify them into profit buckets to get an idea of
what range these values come in  for our model we have classified   distinct buckets

this is a similar approach that sharda took in his model   which seems appropriate for the task at
hand  although it would be nice to have a model to predict the exact amount a movie will make 
studios would likely be satisfied with knowing what sort of category the movie would fall in 
will the movie be a flop  hardly making any money and costing the studio company  will the
movie at least be able to at least make enough to cover its costs  or will it be a blockbuster
and bring the studio an embarrassment of riches 
we can also approach our bucketing method by a modified version of k means clustering  when
we calculate the centroid of each cluster  the buckets   the centroid will be heavily determined by
the gross revenue since all of the other values other than the gross revenue has been normalized 
then to assign each data point to a cluster  we will find the mean of each cluster and find the
cluster that is closest to each data point 
in addition to predicting the gross revenue of a movie  we would also like to determine what the
most important attributes of a profitable movie are  this is especially important since we
included two featuresuser rating and number of user ratingsthat are not available prerelease  although  pca provides a method to map our data set to a smaller subspace  it may not
select any of the components to be the basis of this new subspace  to accomplish our task  we
devised a variance minimization of the gross process  a variation of the pca method  in our
vmg process  each component is removed from the data  and then the data is tested without that
component  the most important components then are the components that have the largest sum
of the squares of the differences between the new predicted gross and the old predicted gross 
v 

results

similar to the study conducted by sharda  we used k fold cross validation rather than running a
single experiment  specifically   fold cross validation  since the number of movies we had was
not divisible by    we simply removed   movie to make our calculations slightly easier 
the result we found was that on average our estimate was off by approximately        a rather
high error  however  our model was more successful in predicting whether a movie will be
profitable of not  i e  whether the projected revenue will exceed the budget for the movie   when
determining the profitability was the objective of our model  it was able to correctly predict this
approximately       of the time  therefore  although our model provides a rather large range of

 

fiwhat the projected revenue may be  it is at least useful in determining whether a movie is worth
producing  i e  whether a movie is expected to be profitable  
when trying to assign movies to revenue buckets  when found that we were able to assign a
movie to the correct bucket approximately       of the time  additionally it was found that we
were able to assign a movie within   class of the correct bucket approximately       of the
time  when using our modified k means clustering method  we were able to correctly assign a
movie to the correct bucket       of the time and be within   bucket       of the time 
additionally  for our vmg  variance minimization of the gross  process  we found that the two
most important features were the number of screens during the opening weekend as well as the
season it was released  this would imply that our assumption that user ratings and the number of
user ratings shouldnt significantly affect the predicted revenue was fairly safe  however  we did
find that they do vary our results to an extent  they were among the top half of the components
we used   therefore it would be safer to exclude these features from future models 
vi 

comparison to other models

although our models ability to predict revenue is not highly accurate  the results are in the same
ballpark as other similar studies  in particular  sharda cited results of being able to correctly
classify a movie in its appropriate revenue bucket only       of the time and that it was within
one bucket       of the time  sharda claims that his results exceed those of other studies that
have been conducted   additionally  chen found highly variable results as well  in chens
model  he provides a wide range of revenue  for example  for the release of hannibal he
predicted a low of     million and a high of    billion  a range that spans almost    billion  
furthermore  the predicted revenues that he found were also off from the actual revenue  he
claims his prediction for joe dirt to be fairly close  but his estimated revenue was       million
while the actual was       million  a       error   because of this  we believe that our results do
not deviate much from the typical results of this sort of model 
though it is expected that our results are low  they are still lower than shardas results and there
are several attributes of our model that would suggest that our model can be improved  for one 
the models ability to accurately predict movie profitability may be affected by the fact that it
assumes that the successes of individual movies are independent of each other  this is a very
strong assumption  for example  our model wont take into account movie sequels that would
exceed typical movie expectations because of the strength of the franchise or that movies will
have lower revenues if the quality of the other movies opening that weekend is better 
additionally  we did not take into account the star power of movies like sharda did  sharda
graded each movie  assigning them a letter from an a  to a c based on the based on the
successes of the actors actresses in the movies     however  we believe that it would be difficult
to implement shardas method since it requires intimate knowledge of each movie  he assigned
each movie a grade   this may be the most lacking feature in our model since simoff and
sparrow found that their star power variable had the strongest effect on revenue out of all their
features 

 

fithere were also features that sharda included that we were unable to include because it would
require intimate knowledge of each movie  in addition to grading star power  sharda also
graded the technical effects as well as the competition from other movies   these likely
increased the accuracies of shardas results  but we were not able to include these in out model
as it would require extensive research to assess the level of competition and grade the technical
effects of each movie since we were unable to find sources that had such information readily
available 
vii 

conclusion

the film industry is a risky business  as screenwriter william goldman once said  nobody
knows anything   although it is becoming increasingly important for studio executives to be
able to accurately predict movie revenues before they are released  the consensus by most studies
is that most attempts are still inexact  the prediction is of movie revenues are still more
accurately classified as an art rather than a science with most experts predicting revenue based
on rules of thumb  hunches  and their experience   although our model isnt likely to be snatched
up by movie executives anytime soon  it appears that predictive modeling of movie revenue in
general is still a work in progress 
however  we do believe that it would be possible to increase the accuracy of our model from its
current state  perhaps the most important change that we can make is to implement some feature
to take into account the star power of a movie  additionally we could take into account other
features such as the origin country of the movie  writers  directors  and whether it was released
on a holiday weekend
