designing aesthetically pleasing web sites is challenging
for several reasons  cultural differences in aesthetic tastes
pose a significantpossibly insurmountablechallenge to
designers aiming to appeal to broad audiences      furthermore  designers must also balance aesthetic design decisions
against other design objectives  for example  designers must
make decisions about the amount of text on a page versus
the  popular  aesthetic preference for clean designs  or decisions about the load time of a web page against the quality
of graphics to include on the page  the diversity of computing platforms has also increased the need for websites that
look good not only on a laptop screen but also on a     
smartphone screen and a     tablet screen  making the job
of a web designer even more challenging

abstract

research suggests that the visual attractiveness of a website
is a strong determinant of users online behavior  however 
designing visually attractive websites is difficult  among
other challenges  web designers have to balance aesthetic design decisions against usability objectives  and account for
the increasingly diverse range of display platforms  smartphones  tablets  etc   on which web pages can now be viewed
on 
intelligent design support systems are a potential solution
to this problem  however  to intelligently assist designers in
creating attractive web pages  computer systems need to possess computable representations of human visual aesthetic
tastes  using machine extracted style based features and visual aesthetic judgements from    volunteers on    websites  we present preliminary results that suggest that such
representation may be possible 

a potential solution to these challenges are intelligent design
support tools that can assist in creating visually attractive designs  these tools should be able to provide designers with
creative inspiration through presentation of appropriate examples       directly suggest aesthetics based improvements
such as reduce the amount of text  increase the color contrast between background and text  reduce the number of
images etc   to automatically generating more visually attractive alternatives of the current design  however  a prerequisite for such systems is the capacity to represent visual
aesthetic tastes in a computable form  more specifically  in
order to offer the envisioned level of design support  computer systems should be able to represent human visual aesthetic tastes in terms of variables in the design space  using visual aesthetic judgements from    volunteers on   
web designs  along with statistical learning techniques  we
demonstrate that such representation may be feasilbe 

introduction and motivation

recent research suggests that the visual aesthetics of web interfaces is a strong determinant of users online behavior  in
a study assessing trustworthiness of online health information sites  visually unappealing sites were rejected within a
few seconds  whereas more appealing sites were scrutinized
for content before being either accepted or rejected       in
the context of e commerce  research has also indicated that
the visual aesthetic quality of websites impacts intention of
consumers to purchase products         the cited studies
suggest that visual design choices such as low color contrast

in the remainder of this paper we summarize prior work in
the area of statistical learning of visual appeal for web
designs  we then describe an experiment to investigate the
possibility of representing visual aesthetic tastes for web designs in a computable form  we conclude with a discussion
of our findings and recommendations for future work in this
area

previous work

previous research has demonstrated that rapid aesthetic
judgments of a website such as repelling vs appealing and
complicated vs simple correlate well with specifically quantized low level image based features such as color  texture 
and intensity of a web page       the authors of the aforementioned work suggest that it is possible to develop computer algorithms that can deliver quick and dirty evaluations of subjective aspects of any  image based  design  in
a different context  the same researchers also demonstrated
that a supervised learning algorithm was capable of learning
the correlation between low level image statistics  such as
spatial frequency  luminance entropy  etc   and users judgments of perceived usability and subjective appearance of
car infotainment systems       however  neither of these
papers conclusively prove that visual aesthetic tastes for web
pages can be represented in computable form 

 a  select designs from software domain

we extend this previous research in two novel and important ways  first  we learn statistical models for predicting
visual aesthetic tastes for web pages in terms of style based
features which have already been employed in engineering
intelligent design support tools          these style based
features describe a designs use of space  color  text  and
images  and are informed by interviews with designers and
principles from the design literature       figure     second 
we systematically demonstrate through careful performance
evaluation that it may be possible for style based feature
models to learnrepresent in a computable formvisual

collecting visual appeal judgements
data set of web pages

experiment

fifty four web pages from two domains were ranked and
rated in this study     of these pages were of companies
offering downloadable or internet based software packages
 figure   a   while    of these pages were of companies or
individuals offering web design services  figure   b    we

we conducted an experiment to investigate whether stylebased feature  figure    models can reliably learn and predict visual aesthetic tastes on    websites from two domains
of web page designs  design domain and software domain  
specifically  we formulated the following two hypotheses 
 

fiin the first phase  under a time limit of   minutes  participants rank ordered the    designs from the software domain
on the floor according to visual attractiveness  participants
were free to decide on the spatial arrangement of their orderings   figure     time warnings were provided with         
            and   seconds remaining  phase   was identical
to phase   but with    designs from the design domain and
time limit of   minutes  time warnings were provided with
                          and   seconds remaining 
analysis
   clustering visual appeal judgements at group level

we applied k means on the median and standard deviation
of rank position of each design to generate clusters of appealing and unappealing designs at the group level  we
considered the median rank of a design as representing its
degree of visual aesthetic appeal at the group level  and its
standard deviation as representing the level of agreement
within the group about the designs visual aesthetic appeal 
conceptually  a design with low median rank and low standard deviation is considered an appealing design with high
group level agreement   while a design with high median
rank and relatively large standard deviation is considered an
unappealing design with low group level agreement 

figure    a participant rank ordering designs from the design domain

used the web page corpus from       where all pages were
selected from design blogs and award lists   using the qt
framework in c    each page was screen captured based on
its rendering on a web browser at a resolution of approximately      x      pixels    the designs were printed using
 
a     dpi color laser printer on      x     laser printer paper 

   model building and statistical testing

volunteers

after generating group level  binary  labels  we trained and
tested three types of supervised learning models  naive
bayes      binary logistic regression     and linear kernel
support vector machines       to test our experimental hypothesis  see page    we evaluated each model using two
measures of performance 

eighteen full time u s  graduate students volunteered for
this experiment  they included    men and   women aged
between    and     all participants had normal or correctedto normal vision  and were free of color blindness  all participants had limited background in web design  participants
were offered candy as compensation for their participation

procedure

in order to measure visual aesthetic judgements on the corpus of web designs we designed a two phase paper based
rank ordering experiment  before the experiment  volunteers were informed that they would have to physically order 
according to visual attractiveness     designs for websites marketing web based or downloadable software packages software domain   and then repeat the same process
for    designs from websites offering web design services
 design domain   volunteers were also informed that they
would be working under time pressure  this experimental
design choice was made in order to prevent volunteers decisions being by swayed text and other informational content on a page and was informed by the related experiments
measuring visual aesthetic judgements for web pages       
        time limits were set for this experiment after running
  pilot subjects  to motivate our volunteers we primed them
with the following prompt 

b  transfer performance  h    test error on software domain of model trained on design domain
due to the small number of examples in both domains 
we performed statistical confidence testing on each models
performance measures  more specifically  we considered
a model to have learned group level visual aesthetic tastes
with statistical significance performance if and only if the
following null hypothesis could be rejected using a     confidence interval  p       
h    learned model error  coin flipping model error
coin flipping model error is the expected performance of
a model that makes decisions by randomly flipping a coin 
we used the exact test for goodness of fit      to test for
statistical significance

results

group level appealing and unappealing clustering
k means with squared euclidian distance was run until convergence  clusterings in both domains were linearly separable   figure   shows some results of k means  

 
resolutions of captured sites varied marginally depending on how
the web page was rendered

figure    graph shows performance of the three supervised learning
models  the within domain section shows the loocv performance
on the design domain  the across domain section shows the performance of the models trained on the design domain and tested on the
software domain  the svm model had statistically significant performance in both cases 

 d  software unappealing

figure    results of k means clustering approach on design and software domain    a  and   b  are designs that were identified by k means
as appealing and unappealing at a group level    c  and   d  are the
analogous outcomes from the software domain 

mate of group level aesthetic judgements  and furthermore
that our analysis with binary labels was ecologically valid 
our results show that a linear kernel support vector machine
has statistically significant performance on both within  and
across  domain measures  these results verify our experimental hypotheses h  and h   see page     furthermore 
the false positive and false negative rates also suggest that
the model was finding statistical structure of group level visual aesthetic tastes in terms of the style based features  further verification of learning may be pursued through feature
selection on the learned svm model      followed by qualitative analysis relating style based design features to grouplevel visual aesthetic judgements

a noticeable shortcoming of our model evaluation analysis
is its lack of bi directionality  we do not consider withinand across domain measures from the perspective of models
trained on the software domain  this analysis choice was
made given the relatively small number of examples  n    
in the dataset for the domain

conclusion and future work

we aimed to explore whether it was possible to express visual aesthetic tastes for web designs in a computable form 
the findings from our experiment suggest that such representation may be possible  given the limited scope of our
investigation  further work is required to confirm the learnability of visual aesthetic tastes for web pages 
in order to more conclusively establish that visual aesthetic
tastes for web pages can be expressed in a computable form 
it is clear that future work in this area must address obvious issues of scale  we need to understand how style based
feature models perform with larger and more diverse populations  and also to investigate how these models transfer to
more diverse domains  e g  medical websites  news pages 
discussion blogs  etc    we hope that our work lays the foun 

discussion

we observe that the standard deviation of the cluster groups
are comparable along the dimensions of degree of visual
appeal and group level agreement for both domains  this
observation suggests that k means provided a reliable esti 

fidation for more extensive research in computational techniques that can be used to engineer intelligent design support
