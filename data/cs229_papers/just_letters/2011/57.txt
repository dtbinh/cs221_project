cs     final project
introduction and motivation
automated aircraft landing systems are typically employed by commercial flights that routinely operate
at airports with poor visibility  the best systems currently in use are autopilots designed to work in
conjunction with a category iiic instrument landing system  ils   an ils is a ground based radio
navigation system that provides an aircraft with precision guidance along the approach path to an ils
runway  ils hardware must be installed at the approach end of every ils runway  and typically costs
on the order of tens of millions of dollars to install  even more for cat iiic systems   as a result  they
are usually only installed at airports with scheduled airline traffic  and are therefore not as available to
general aviation  ga  pilots  autopilots with automated landing capability are also quite expensive 
and for similar reasons  are almost never installed in ga aircraft 
the quality of instrumentation systems installed in ga aircraft has been improving rapidly in recent
years  largely due to moore s law  gps receivers with wide area augmentation system  waas  support
have become ubiquitous  glass cockpit systems  typically composed of several bright lcd screens 
provide improved situational awareness and are now offered as standard features in many light aircraft 
these systems can render simulated  d views of outside terrain with highway in the sky style
navigational overlays  it is also fairly common to see accurate inertial measurement units  radar
altimeters  flir cameras  traffic avoidance systems  and weather radars installed in new high
performance piston and light turboprop aircraft  modernized flight management and automation
systems that take full advantage of these instruments will likely play a crucial role in ga aircraft of the
future 
the goal of this project is to use apprenticeship learning to build an autopilot capable of landing a small
airplane at a specific airport from a final approach at traffic pattern altitude  relying only on instruments
installed in the aircraft  the x plane flight simulator is used to test and demonstrate the autopilot  as
testing in a real aircraft would be dangerous and prohibitively expensive  x plane is a commercial
flight simulator developed by laminar research that uses blade element theory to model aerodynamic
forces on the various parts of an aircraft in real time  resulting in realistic behavior  even in complex
aircraft  x plane is used extensively by nasa and by aircraft manufacturers to simulate real aircraft
during research and development 
apprenticeship learning
markov decision processes  mdps  provide a useful framework for finding optimal behavior using
reinforcement learning  policy exploration in systems that have large state spaces can be
computationally challenging  especially if the dynamics of the system are unknown or difficult to
model  additionally  in order to guarantee full coverage of the state space  efficient exploration policies
often tend to preferentially explore states that are not yet well characterized  there are many systems
for which this kind of exploration would be dangerous  such as nuclear plant controllers or aircraft
autopilots 
apprenticeship learning is an alternative to optimal exploration policies where a human expert guides

fipolicy exploration by manually performing a desired task  this has been shown to result in nearly
optimal performance relative to the performance of the human  and is computationally efficient     
apprenticeship learning has successfully been used to learn the dynamics of a radio controlled
helicopter  which exhibits a flight model that is arguably more complex than that of an airplane     
state variables
the primary unknown state variable when landing an aircraft in instrument meteorological conditions
 imc  is the position of the aircraft relative to the desired touchdown point  until recently  this
information was difficult to obtain accurately without complex radio navigation hardware and
expensive installations near the runway and along the approach path 
waas enabled gps receivers have a lateral accuracy specification of    ft  but have an accuracy of
about   ft in practice  the measured accuracy is more than adequate for aligning an aircraft with a
runway  and even the nominal specification would be a reasonable estimate at most airports in an
emergency 
the vertical accuracy of waas gps is specified at    ft  and measured at about      ft  misjudging
the touchdown height by    ft would likely result in disaster  either by beginning the flare too early and
stalling the aircraft at a deadly altitude  or by extending the approach and crashing the airplane into the
runway   pressure altimeters can provide an accurate differential height  but the sea level reference
pressure must be constantly adjusted  forgetting or incorrectly adjusting the reference pressure can
result in altitude variations of hundreds of feet  in this project  the simulated aircraft will be equipped
with a radar altimeter  which can easily be made accurate to within   ft  which is adequate for landing
safely 
since radar altimeters report the distance from the aircraft to the ground  it is only usable once the
aircraft is over the runway  before then  it will be affected by any buildings and trees that are directly
below the aircraft  the pressure altimeter will therefore be used on final approach to maintain the
desired rate of descent 
the remaining instruments  attitude  airspeed  rpm  manifold pressure  are accurate and precise
enough to use directly  vertical speed is calculated by differentiating the pressure altitude
measurements  as the vertical speed indicator tends to lag by several seconds 
the following state variables were measured and used by the learning algorithm for this project 
pressure altitude  radar altitude  pitch  roll  yaw  heading  vertical speed  pitch derivative  roll
derivative  yaw derivative  the actions used were  yoke pitch position  yoke roll position  throttle
position  in addition to these variables  the gps latitude and longitude were used by the planning
algorithms  i used a pc joystick to fly the demonstration approaches in x plane  but did not have
access to a set of rudder pedals  so rudder position measurements were excluded from the experiments 
training
i wrote an x plane plug in that can export flight parameters from within the simulator  when enabled 
the plug in samples the appropriate flight instruments and control positions at a rate of   hz and writes
them to a text file  this allowed me to fly multiple training approaches and experiment with various

fipost processing techniques afterwards  and perform the regression analysis and model estimation in a
high level programming language  the x plane sdk is written in c  data processing was done using
python  
i flew approximately     training approaches and landings from within x plane  these approaches
were made in a cessna     skyhawk from ten miles out to runway  l at edwards air force base
 kedw   the sample data was separated by altitude into two phases  approach and flare  the approach
phase included any portion of the state and action data where the aircraft was higher than    ft above
ground level  agl  as measured by the radar altimeter  and the remaining data was used for the flare
phase 
the state variables were finely binned in order to make the problem more tractable  the discretized
states were then linked to result states  the state sampled     second later  via the action performed in
the original state  whenever multiple actions connected an initial state and a result state  the values of
each of the action measurements were averaged  this resulted in more accurate model estimation  as
some state transitions were caused by transient effects  such as wind gusts  rather than pilot input 
training for the approach and flare phases was performed separately  the goal for the approach phase
was to learn as much about the dynamics of the aircraft as possible  in normal flight  so that arbitrary
approaches could be made to any runway at different speeds  angles  and power settings  the flare is
performed when the aircraft is in ground effect and flying at or near its stall speed  so we expect the
dynamics to be significantly different from the normal flight dynamics found during the approach
phase 
in the approach phase  the pressure altitude and radar altitude measurements were not included as state
variables  as these are not pertinent to the dynamics of the aircraft and would only serve to spread
similar behavior among a multitude of states  the dynamics do not change very much when the aircraft
is flying at      ft vs      ft  if action a  connects states s  and s   and action a  connects states s  and
s   but  s   s   and  s   s   differ only in their altitude  then the similar actions a  and a  would be
separated if altitude was part of the state  excluding altitude allows us to learn much faster  since we do
not have to wait to reach a specific altitude during the next approach in order to see another potential
action for a given state  new potential actions for a given state can occur at any time during the
approach 
in order to record control input actions from as many states as possible  the approaches were flown
with severe turbulence enabled in the simulator  as the turbulence knocked the aircraft into situations
with unusual attitudes and accelerations  the data logger recorded my response inputs to states that
would not have been explored while making an approach in calm conditions 
planning
once the dynamics of the aircraft have been estimated  a planning algorithm specifies costs for given
states  the model estimate is used to guide the aircraft to the states associated with the lowest costs 
separate planning algorithms were used for the approach and flare phases of the flight  the auto land
plug in transitions from the approach algorithm to the flare algorithm when the aircraft reaches    ft
agl 
the planning algorithm for the flare simply specifies that the wings should be kept level while power is
gradually reduced and the pitch angle is raised  the values for power reduction rate  pitch rotation rate 

fiand maximum pitch angle were determined experimentally by hand flying the approach and having the
auto land plug in take over at    ft agl  the cost for states that were not along the ideal trajectory were
increased linearly with the varying parameter 
two planning algorithms were written for the approach phase  the first was a nave local planner  this
algorithm simply keeps the wings level and maintains a constant airspeed and vertical descent rate 
again with a cost that increases linearly with the varying parameter for any non ideal states 
the second was a geo referenced planner  this algorithm computes a straight line between the initial
position of the aircraft  when the auto land plug in is enabled  and the desired touchdown point  the
costs again increase linearly for states where the vertical or horizontal distances to the path are nonzero 
the cost increases faster in the vertical direction 
results
the auto lander performed well when using the local planner and the flare planner  since this
configuration did not include any directional control  the aircraft heading would very gradually drift to
the right  this behavior is almost certainly due to p factor  asymmetric propeller thrust at nonzero
angles of attack   as a result  this system could not be used to reliably land on a runway  and was
demonstrated by landing in an empty part of rogers dry lake near kedw  i attempted to add an
additional linear constraint on the aircraft heading to keep it pointed in a consistent direction  but this
caused the aircraft to undergo divergent rolling behavior that eventually led to a crash 
the geo referenced planner exhibited a similar oscillatory roll behavior  and i strongly suspect that this
was due to the lack of rudder input in the system  since my joystick lacked a yaw axis   as the rudder
was not being controlled at all by this system  and i had no way to train it to use the rudder  i designed
a separate pid control loop to drive the rudder  the control position was set to the direction of the
straight line to runway path computed by the geo referenced planner  this resulted in some
improvement  but the aircraft would still occasionally roll erratically  adding an additional pid loop to
damp the aileron input fixed the roll problem entirely and allowed the geo referenced planner to easily
make the runway from a half mile approach  it occurred to me later that the behavior of the pid
controllers could easily be simulated using additional linear cost constraints on the roll angle  yaw
angle  roll derivative  and yaw derivative  but i didn t have time to test this before the project was due 
strong crosswinds were also problematic  this is almost certainly due to lack of rudder control  as
proper rudder technique is crucial for making a safe crosswind landing  this problem cannot be fixed
with a simple yaw damper  but would need a more complex flare planning algorithm that can
compensate for lateral drift 
during the flare  the aircraft would occasionally balloon to an altitude above    ft agl  which caused
the auto lander to return to using the approach planner  this resulted in porpoising around    ft  but
this was never observed to occur for more than two iterations  this problem can easily be overcome by
using a more complex plan transition model  but this was not tested due to time constraints 
finally  although the geo referenced planner can successfully land an aircraft on a runway  its behavior
is still fairly nave  if the auto lander is enabled on a very long final approach  the aircraft will follow a
shallow descent to the touchdown point  in reality  this can be dangerous  as obstacles such as
buildings  trees  towers  power lines  and even terrain can intersect with the planned path when the

fiaircraft gets low enough  it would be safer to maintain altitude until a specified distance from the
airport and then begin a normal descent  conversely  if the auto lander is enabled too close to the
airport  the aircraft will follow an approach that is too steep  and the aircraft will crash into the runway 
the correct behavior here is to go around and attempt the approach again from a safer distance  the
planner is also unable to fly a standard box traffic pattern if the aircraft is not aligned with the
runway when the auto lander is enabled 
there is obviously significant room for improvement in the planning algorithms for a real autopilot  but
this project has shown that the dynamics of the aircraft can be estimated using apprenticeship learning 
and that it is possible to design planners that are capable of making safe  repeatable landings
