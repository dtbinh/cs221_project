abstract  the possibility of a hit song prediction algorithm is both academically interesting and industry motivated  while several companies currently attest to their ability to
make such predictions  publicly available research suggests that current methods are unlikely
to produce accurate predictions  support vector machines were trained on song features
and youtube view counts to very limited success  we discuss the possibility that musical
features alone cannot account for popularity  given the lack of substantial findings in popularity position  we attempted a more feasible project  current research into automated
genre detection given features extracted from music has shown more promising  using a
combination of k means clustering and support vector machines  as well as a random
forest  we produced two automated classifiers that performs five times better than chance
for ten genres 

divided into ten genres  classic pop and rock 
folk  dance and electronica  jazz and blues 
soul and reggae  punk  metal  classical  pop 
and hip hop  features for each song include
loudness  tempo  time signature  key  mode 
duration  as well as average timbral data and
average timbral variance 

   data
our main source of data was the million
song dataset subset distributed by labrosa 
the subset provides pre extracted features
for       songs including song and artist
names  song duration  timbral data  mfcclike features  and spectral data for the entire
song  number of sections and average section
length  and a number of other features 
in order to measure the popularity of a
song  for each song we collected the number of
view counts registered on the video returned
as the first link in a youtube search using
the youtube api  where the query consisted
of the song and artist names  we checked by
hand the accuracy of this scraping method
and concluded that the two errors in thirty
randomly drawn songs were unproblematic
given that the errors also coordinate well with
very low view counts  i e  something unpopular enough to not return a copy of the song
on youtube ends up returning an unrelated
video with a low view count  
for genre classification  we used the million song dataset genre subset  the dataset
includes features extracted from        songs

   preliminary analysis  popularity
prediction
we first ran basic correlation coefficients
between different parts of the metadata and
also with our extracted youtube view counts 
the results were largely insignificant and included weak correlations such as one of   
between the tempo and loudness metadata
features  correlations between the youtube
view counts and the echonest metadata features loudness  tempo  hotttness  and danceability were completely negligible  less than
    in magnitude   the fact that these are
not at all correlated is interesting in its own
right because it points to no single metadata
feature being at all a good predictor of views
on youtube

as to how it is quantified  gives a very small
amount of predictive power       above the
bias  on whether or not a song will have more
     linear classification using support
than   k views on youtube 
vector machines  first we note that the
feature vectors given by the million song      string kernel  given that the mfcc
dataset are not of uniform length as the spec  and spectral data is temporal  we wanted
tral and mfcc coefficients are provided for in  to use the ordering therein to describe the
tervals of the song and thus the number of sound  motivating a string kernel support
those features depends on the length of the vector machine approach  we create string
song  to account for all of the data and features for our songs as follows 
compress it to uniform length for each song 
for each i  we take the spectral bucket
we took averages of the coefficients for each i  corresponding to a frequency aggregate
half  fourth  or sixth of the song and con  magnitude  for each spectra vector within a
catenated the result for feature vectors of range of each song  usually about    seclength         or    for each set of coefficients  onds in the middle   this gives a list of valand then normalized the resulting lists of fea  ues which correspond to the magnitudes over
ture vectors  we trained support vector ma  time of this slice of the sound spectrum for
chines with each extracted feature thinking every song  next  using a subset of this data
that some number of segments would outper   we used two hundred of the ten thousand
form others  perhaps as they become closer to songs  we compute a list of intervals  we used
the average of the actual number of segments    of them  corresponding to the characters
in the songs   we altered the cost  bias  and a through z  that uniformly distribute the
kernel  but the precision never gained more data  then using these intervals  we compute
than one percent on our bias  that is      of a string for each sequence of data obtained in
the songs had youtube view counts over   k the first step by replacing each value with a
and     were over    k  the support vector symbol or letter that represents the interval 
machines regardless of feature choice and pawhen we tried a string kernel support vecrameters never achieved more than     and tor machine on this data  it was unable to
      precision  the recall was always less complete even the first iteration towards conthan       and     
vergence  notably  string kernels are not
finally  we tried a support vector ma  guaranteed to be general mercer kernels  and
chine on spectral averages and metadata fea  our string data was so long and varied that

tions  and finally the echonests popularity aware of operations such as translation  which
measure  hotttnesss  trained on popular  can help tell that two pieces of music are simity measure of    k views  these features ilar  consider putting a silent delay at the beresulted in accuracy no better than before  ginning of a song  then the method mentioned
however  when trained on the popularity above will not recognize the songs as anything
measure of   k views  the precision rose from similar   for this reason  we conclude that
under     to over      using the same fea  this method of using a string kernel is a dead
tures without hotttnesss results in the same end and may only be helped by more genperformance as above  no better than the eral pattern matching metrics instead of the
bias of the dataset   from this we conclude overly simplistic edit distance  algorithms

structural segmentation and similarity metrics  most often used for identifying song covers   we find the possibility of research on
estimating popularity by structural segmentation to be interesting 
   popularity prediction discussion
similarly to pachet  we have concluded
that from the audio features extracted there
does not seem to be embedded the information relevant in making the song popular 
this could be a result either of feature selection  or of popularity being driven by social
forces  i e  the inherent unpredictability
of cultural markets  pachet   the effect
of cumulative advantage may help explain
this phenomenon and is demonstrated in the
curve  below  showing the declining percentage of view counts  e g  there is very little
difference between how many songs have a
view count of    k and  m   furthermore
once an artist is popular  they may later
produce works which are musically different
from those that made them popular  yet the
new tracks will become popular simply by
virtue of being created by the popular artist 

   genre classification
in light of our modest results at predicting popularity  we began to investigate another problem involving only musical features  using the million song genre subset 

 

we tried several classification algorithms including support vector machines with tenfold cross validation  k nearest neighbors  and
random forests  these were run on the entire
data set  on a uniformly distributed subset 
and also on a four genre subset consisting of
classical  metal  soul and reggae  and pop 
the results reported are after running parameter selection on the support vector machine as well as on k for the k nearest neighbor implementation  we have read of implementations of knn using kl divergence as
a distance metric  mandel   but the million
song genre subset did not have information
sufficient to compute the covariance matrix
of the timbral averages  mirex hosts a number of papers on genre classification  however 
an overview of the current literature suggests
that random forests are rarely used for genre
classification tasks 
in addition  support vector machines were
trained on individual pairs of genres  with n
songs from each genre 
   genre classification results
results for various methods on different
subsets are reported in the table below  because the dataset was not uniformly populated  we also used the uniform dataset 
the original distribution of songs in a given
genre is shown below in the histogram  average results over all four clusters are reported
for cross validation on the entries labeled kmeans   support vector machine  in addition  classification results for pairs of genre
are reported in the second table below 
results for four genres are comparable to
results seen elsewhere  but recent work on
music classification suggests that it is possible to gain more accuracy on up to ten genres 
    
notably  in all three classification scenarios  random forests perform approximately
as well as k means in combination with support vector machines  it is interesting to note
that  upon adding more trees to our random

forest  the results seem to suggest that our the out of bag error of our random forest as
support vector machines after k means are more trees are added  this result is from the
both apprach the same accuracy  this can using the entire genre dataset
