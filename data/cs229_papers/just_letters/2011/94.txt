inferring biological meaning from cap analysis gene expression data

hrysoula papadakis

   introduction
this project is inspired by the recent development of the cap analysis gene expression  cage  method 
which introduces new benets to standard gene expression techniques such as being higher throughput
and more accurately mapping the transcription start sites   building o of previous serial analysis of
gene expression  sage  methods  i aim to extract biological meaning from the gene expression patterns 
use module networks to nd modules of co regulated genes  and lay the foundations for future work in
predicting gene expression using regression trees corresponding to regulation programs  

   methods
     dataset
the data comes from cage experiments in     human cancer cell lines measuring        transcripts  it
is arranged in a matrix where the rows correspond to the genes  the columns to the cell lines  and the
values are tags per million  a count proportional to the fraction of reads in the cell line experiment that
overlapped the transcript of the gene  for the purposes of this analysis  i consider both the matrix and its
transpose  in the former the genes are the samples and the experiments are the variables  in the latter the
samples are the experiments and the genes the variables 
     filtering
since the data was accumulated from a number of sources and contained high variability  i applied a series
of lters to remove noise and produce a dataset from which strong biological signals could be recovered 
no normalization was required since the tags per million count is already normalized by the total number
of reads in a given experiment  i experimented with various thresholds for dropping genes by computing
basic statistics at each stage  and settled on the following procedure 
gene entries many of the genes appear multiple times  which i collapse by summing the values per
experiment over all copies of a gene  there are a resulting        unique genes 
missing values many values in the matrix were zeros  indicating that for a given experiment  the gene
transcript was not observed at all  this is unexpected and most likely due to anomalies in the experiments
where either the tags are inaccurate or the transcript was not tested  in order to avoid imputing values or
determining a safe cut o for number of zeros tolerated per gene  i dropped all genes with any zero values 
total reads the number of total reads in the experiments varied signicantly  i removed all experiments
with fewer than         reads  as low read count introduces uncertainty 
gene id the validation of my results depends on gene ontology  go  term enrichment analysis  where the
annotations map from entrezgene ids to functional go terms  since the dataset genes are labeled with
hgnc symbol ids  i dropped genes for which there was not a mapping to a corresponding entrezgene
id 
transformation i computed the log  transform of the data  rst coercing values less than two to two  i
then computed the log fold change log xgene exp    log meangene  experiments    i removed genes with low
variance  standard deviation

after all stages of ltering  the remaining data consisted of      genes and     experiments  to determine
the quality of this ltered dataset  i examined the basic statistics and performed correlation analysis  the
the ltered data  fig    b   has a cleaner distribution than the original data  fig    a    the experiments
include a handful of replicates for the same cell line  which are indeed highly correlated as expected  fig 
  c    similarly  genes from the same gene family should be highly correlated  in order to test this  i
overlapped my gene set with a set of     known transcription factors and used the resulting    identied
transcription factors as a proxy for genes  as desired  the genes within each family are highly correlated

     clustering of genes
the rst question i was interested in was whether or not the genes would cluster into biologically meaningful
clusters based on the expression levels across cell lines  to cluster the genes  i used matlabs version of
k means with values of k                       and correlation as the distance metric  to validate the results 
i used go term enrichment analysis  which computes the enrichment of each annotation term using the
pearson correlation coecient  terms with a p value          are considered signicant  in increasing
the value of k  i was hoping to see an increase in specicity of function in the clusters  i additionally
compute motif enrichment of known transcription factors for the clusters  this is computed by intersecting
the coordinates of the known tfs with a    kb window around the transcription start site of each gene  i
then calculate the p values using a hypergeometric test and apply the bonferroni correction  signicance
is considered as p value        

fi     clustering of experiments
i was also interested if by clustering the cell lines  the types of cancers would form distinct clusters  to
cluster the experiments  i used k means with k                   and correlation as the distance metric  to
validate the results  i consider the number of times the replicates cluster together  for smaller values of k  i
expect to see multiple types of cancer clustering together  which i can validate from the literature   and in
increasing k  i expect the clusters to become specic to one cancer type  as an annotation of the cell lines
with cancer terms did not exist  i annotated them by hand from the literature and looked for clusters with
enrichments  as the annotations were not well dened  i did not perform a stringent enrichment analysis
as in the gene clustering case 

     module network analysis
in addition to inferring biological relationships and evolution  i was interested in nding co regulated genes
 genes that are enhanced or repressed by a common set of regulators   to nd modules of co regulated
genes  i used genomica  citation   which uses an expectation maximization  em  algorithm for nite
bayesian networks 
repeat until convergence  
 e step  for each gene  determine which modules regulatory program best predicts the
genes expression
 m step  learn the regression trees for a xed partitioning of genes into modules
 

it has been previously demonstrated that this method is successful in producing modules of co regulated
genes for s  cerevisiae   to validate the resulting modules  i examine the regression trees for the regulation
programs of a subset of clusters for known regulators from the literature  future work will include go
term enrichment analysis as well as motif enrichment analysis on a subset of clusters 

   results
     clustering of genes
as anticipated  when clustering the genes using small values of k  the clusters were enriched for general
functional terms  such as regulation of metabolic process and nucleotide receptor activity  this indicates
that the gene clusters correspond to broad gene categories that each include a signicant number of genes
 table     for large values of k  however  the clusters were enriched for more specic functions or pathways 
such as sensory organ development and viral reproduction  table     using genomica  i was able to look
at the expression pattern of particular gene clusters for interesting trends  figure   shows the expression
pattern for set    for k     down regulated genes are in green whereas up regulated are in red  sft d  
one of the genes in this set  is correlated with lymphoma according to disease association studies   in
particular  it is shown to be down regulated in lymphoblastic leukemia  this is directly mirrored in the
expression data  where the cell lines for cancers of lymphocytes  aml  lymphoma   show signicant downregulation for this gene set compared to other cell lines 
the motif enrichment analysis was inconclusive due to too stringent criteria for signicance as well as
the large size of the motif dataset  of the      million transcription factor  tf  motifs  i selected         
randomizing over the motifs and limiting the number of motifs selected per tf  in the future  i will try
using a larger subset of the motifs and use the false discovery rate rather than the bonferroni correction
to report signicance

     clustering of experiments
as hypothesized  the clusters of cell lines did contain biological coherency for certain values of k  for k    
the cell lines clustered according to broad categories of cancer  with carcinomas and sarcomas generally
being split into distinct clusters  notable results include a cluster that was enriched for dierent types of
tumors  testicular  schwannoma   a cluster of acute myeloid leukemia  aml   and a cluster of cancers of
the nervous system  merkel cell  medulloblastoma  neuroblastoma   for k     the clusters became more
specic to a particular type of cancer  notable clusters included mesothelioma  cancer of the uterus and
embryo  cancer of lymphocytes  germ cell tumors  epithelial cancers  colon and liver cancers  and squamous
cancers  for k    and k      there were too few cell lines per cluster and the results became random and
uninformative  for all values of k  however  the cell line replicates were clustered together in every case 
     module network analysis
some of the modules of co regulated genes created by genomica were indeed functionally coherent  representing regulation programs known from the literature  one example of this is shown in figure    which
depicts a regression tree rooted at hsf   with a down regulated subtree rooted at sp  and an up regulated
subtree regulated by e f   the sp  subtree also contains nfkb   in the image  the leftmost columns
are the myeloid leukemia cell lines  which are known to be regulated by a network including both sp 
and nfkb   in fact  the promyelocytic leukemia protein inhibits sp   which supports the down regulation
indicated in the regression tree  
   conclusion and future work
i demonstrated that it is possible to extract biological meaning for the purposes of understanding  as well as
potentially classifying  both genes and human cancer cell lines  i additionally showed that module network
