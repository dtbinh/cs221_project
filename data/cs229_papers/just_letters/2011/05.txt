introduction

people detection is an interesting computer vision topic  locating people in images and videos
have many potential applications  such as human computer interaction and auto focus cameras  there
have been much effort on developing people detection algorithms  and among them  the dense scaleinvariant feature transform  dsift      algorithms appear to be very effective  to implement our own
people detection program  we utilized the dsift algorithm to extract feature vectors from images  and
used support vector machine  svm  and naive bayes algorithms for classification  we explored
different imaging processing and machine learning techniques  and assessed their performance 

 

algorithms

in this project  we used dsift algorithm for feature extraction  local averaging and local contrast
normalization for feature modification  and svm and nave bayes algorithm model training and

features

dsift derives from sift algorithm  which is an important keypoint based approach  given an
image  sift finds all the keypoints in the image with respect to the gradient feature of each pixel 
every keypoint contains the information of its location  local scale and orientation  then  based
on each keypoint  sift computes a local image descriptor which shows the gradient feature in the local
region around the keypoint  combining all the local descriptors  we get the complete features from the
image 

fibased on sift algorithm  dense sift makes some new assumptions   a  the location of each
keypoint is not from the gradient feature of the pixel  but from a predesigned location   b  the scale of
each keypoint is all the same which is also predesigned   c  the orientation of each keypoint is always
zero  with this assumptions  dsift can acquire more feature in less time than sift does 
based on the basic dsift algorithm  we also explored local averaging and local contrast
normalization techniques  in the local averaging technique  we averaged every   x   block of local pixels
descriptor  and got one averaged descriptor to represent the entire block  local contrast normalization
normalized the descriptors locally in a   x   block to make the descriptor partially invariant to change in
illumination 
after extracting the features in training images  we used svm and nave bayes algorithms to
learn several models  for all the testing images  we extract their features with the same method  then
putting these features into the corresponding models and making classifications  we acquired the
recognition result detection rate 

 

experiment

   

data selection

two set of datasets were used in our experiment  first  mits pedestrian database  which
contains     pedestrian images  was used as our positive samples          random non human images
from the internet were selected as our negative samples  second  a more challenging dataset called inria
were used      inria consists of over      images that can possibly contain multiple people or partial
person with various backgrounds  the size of all samples is    x     pixels  figure   is a snapshot of the
images

implementation
we generated a   x        feature descriptor vector for each sample image with the dense sift
algorithm  which is provided by the vlfeat     open source library  to explore the performance  we

fituned our algorithms with two image processing techniques separately  which are local contrast
normalization and local averaging  local contrast normalization normalizes the descriptors locally in a  
x   block  which theoretically will robustify our algorithm over different background illumination  the
local averaging technique averages every   x   block of local pixels descriptor  and gets   averaged
descriptor to represent the entire block  this way  the descriptors become less noisy and more compressed 
as a machine learning project  we also compared different training algorithms  which are svm and nave
bayes algorithms 
we assessed and compared the performance of different image processing and machine learning
techniques with   criteria  which are classification accuracy  detection rate  false alarm rate  and
computation time 

 

performance analysis

figure   shows the comparison of accuracy  detection rate  false alarm rate and computation time
over the basic dsift and the two image processing techniques we discussed above  dsift with local
averaging and dsift with local contrast normalization  here  all the three sets of data were got using the
svm algorithm for the machine learning part  from the figure  we can find that the local averaging
technique gives the best performance in terms of accuracy  detection rate  and computation time  but as a
tradeoff  it has the highest false alarm rate  the computation time of basic dsift and the local contrast
normalization algorithms increase dramatically after size of training sample reaches      due to large
requirement of computer memory

processing techniques

fifigure   shows the comparison of accuracy  detection rate  false alarm rate and computation time
over svm and nave bayes algorithms  for the image processing part  we used the dsift algorithm
with local averaging technique for both sets of experiments  comparing the performance of human
detection with svm and nave bayes algorithms  we discovered that svm out performs nave in terms
of accuracy  detection rate and false alarm rate  but the computation time for svm increases
quadratically as training sample size increases  while the time for nave bayes only increase linearly 

figure    accuracy  detection rate  false alarm rate  computation time comparison over svm and
nave bayes algorithms
figure   shows the accuracy comparison over the mit pedestrian dataset and inria dataset  we
can observe that the accuracy of classification with mit dataset remains very high even with very small
training size and it can reach         for the more challenging dataset  we can get higher accuracy with
increasing training size  which finally reaches        
from the data measured  we can find that using the dsift algorithm with local averaging
technique and svm algorithm  the accuracy of human classification accuracy can reach         the
detection rate can reach         the false alarm rate can maintain below       for the mit pedestrian
dataset  on the other hand  for the inria dataset  the accuracy of classification can reach         the
detection rate can reach         the false alarm rate can maintain below

conclusion

in this project  we implemented the people detection program with the dense sift algorithm 
different image processing and machine learning techniques were explored and assessed  which are local
contrast normalization vs  local averaging  and svm vs  naive bayes  we conclude that the dsift with
local averaging and svm algorithm yields the best classification accuracy  which is        for mit
dataset and        for inria dataset  however  if computation time is of concern  the local averaging
with nave bayes algorithm can also give reasonably good accuracy with much less computation time
