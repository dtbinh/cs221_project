introduction

genome wide association studies  gwas  have identified many single nucleotide polymorphisms  snps  that are associated with disease  gwas typically compare allele frequencies
of     k individual snps in case patients to those of control patients using single feature
statistics and hundreds or thousands of patients to gain enough power to overcome the
serious multiple testing hypothesis correction burden  the original wellcome trust case
control consortium  wtccc  paper published    high confidence snps that are associated with   major diseases in a study with        cases and       shared controls      
currently  identifying snps associated with disease is motivated by two goals  first  to
find a parsimonious panel of testable biomarkers for disease  and second  to learn about
the biology of disease by examining which dna markers are correlated with incidence 
given that the cost of genome sequencing is dropping exceptionally fast  and the cost of
genotyping tag snps on a snp chip is even cheaper  the motivation for this first goal
is waningin the future  physicians will not have to prioritize which snps to genotype 
but will have access to whole chip or sequencing data for each patient  additionally  it is
becoming increasingly clear that multiple genetic loci  and the interactions between them 
are associated with disease states  and the individual snp approach does not capture
the biological intricacies of many disorders  in this report  i suggest that we can build
whole chip classifiers for disease  with selected features and interaction terms that will
help elucidate the biology of disease  i also hope to show that using all of the data results
in a better clinical predictor than the state of the art predictors that include only the top
individually associated snps 

 

the data

i downloaded the gwas data from the wellcome trust  in my initial work  i have analyzed
the   c controls versus type   diabetes  t d  cases

featurization

for each patient  i have genotype data from         snps  to convert this genotype data
into a feature vector  i first defined the minor allele to be the allele at each snp locus
that was less common in the whole population  cases and controls   then  for each person 
i counted the number of minor alleles that they had at each position  the final feature

feature ranking

since using all         snps from the original gwas study would both result in over
fitting  and be exceptionally computationally intensive  i performed a preliminary feature
ranking  for each training set in my   fold cross validation  i examined the snps individually  and calculated the chi squared test statistic for independence  to do this  i calculated
the expected frequencies of each genotype         in cases and controls given the marginal
totals  then  i compared the observed frequencies
pto these expected values  i ranked each
the snps from largest to smallest c  where c   cells   observed  expexted    expected  
for further analyses  i used the top r snps  where    r            though i only report
up to r          in this document  these top snps represent the strongest individual
features that discriminate between cases and controls in the training set 

 

naive bayes

using the feature vectors described above  i implemented a multinomial event model naive
bayes classifier using laplace smoothing  i performed   fold cross validation  the snps
were ranked and selected on the training data   see table   for results from the cross
validation  the   error is lowest for the top    feature model        and levels off at
around     when more features are included

svm with linear kernel

after naive bayes  i implemented an svm with no kernel  u  v   i used   fold cross validation again  and varied the cost parameter from     to     by factors of    to create roc
curves for each classifier  in figure    the x axis is   specificity    t ruen egatives  t ruen egatives 
f alsep ositives    and the y axis is sensitivity  t ruep ositives  t ruep ositives f alsen egatives   
the top feature alone achieved an area under the roc curve  auc  of       adding more
features increased the auc  the top        and    features all had auc       this is a
great improvement over the single feature model implemented here and other single feature
models reported in the literature 

 

svm with polynomial kernel

to get interaction terms in the svm  i added a polynomial kernel of the form     u  v d   i
used      num features  and did not vary  during my cross validation and roc building
trials  even without optimizing   the polynomial model achieved very high area under
the curve  as is shown in figure    given the number of terms in these models  and the
relatively small number of training examples  i suspect that these models are over fitting
the data  and would not perform well on an external validation sample 

 

conclusion

the combination of smart pre ranking of the features and a support vector machine produced an excellent classifier for type   diabetes  the pre ranking by chi square test
statistic provided an o n log n  way to reduce the feature space such that it included only
the most informative snps  this reduction allowed for much faster computation of the
support vector machine  for the most part  the features selected in each round of the cross
validation were the same  regardless of which random     of the data was left out 
the next step in this project is to try the best fitting model on genotypes from a
different cohort of patients  additionally  since many of the top ranked features are snps
that are implicated in other autoimmune disorders  i am curious about whether the model
trained on type   diabetes has any predictive value on rheumatoid arthritis  crohns
disease  or other autoimmune disorders  though this application is less scientifically useful
