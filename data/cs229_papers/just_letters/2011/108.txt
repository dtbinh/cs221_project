abstract
choi and varian     propose the use of publicly available web search volume histories from google
trends together with time series regression analysis to predict  among other things  tourism rates in
specific countries  we improve upon their approach by using query specific search data  rather than
aggregate search data  to predict visitor arrival statistics  we use feature selection to determine
the most relevant search queries and evaluate the performance of the algorithm using k fold crossvalidation  we test our approach on a data set consisting of hong kongs monthly visitor arrival
statistics for the years            in contrast to choi and varian  we demonstrate that our algorithm
not only exhibits low training error  but also exhibits low test set error  our results indicate that
web search volume histories provide a useful predictor of tourism rates 

 

introduction

several authors have advocated the use of web search volume histories to make predictions              
choi and varian     present one of the first of such studies  using google trends  a precursor to google
insights      data to predict  among other things  tourism rates in specific countries  the authors
use time series regression analysis to predict visitor arrival statistics  incorporating aggregate search
volume indices as regression data 
we present an improved approach to the problem of predicting tourism rates  whereby we use
query specific search data and implement a feature selection algorithm to choose the most relevant
queries  we evaluate the algorithm using k fold cross validation and demonstrate not only low training
error as with choi and varians algorithm  but also low test set error 
predicting tourism trends can potentially help a variety of industries that rely  directly as well as
indirectly on tourism  and may enable better facilities management for the correct number of tourists 
based on analysis of the origins of tourists to a particular destination  the study may help strategize a
targeted campaign for attracting tourists from areas that do not appear to a good source of tourists 
there is an immense potential in the kind of uses this study can be put to  including applications
beyond tourism itself 

 

data

we collected tourism statistics from the hong kong tourism boards research statistics web page     
which provides data on hong kongs monthly visitor rates and the geographic origins of its visitors 
let y  i    i                 m denote the logarithm of the total number of visitors to hong kong in month i 
starting in the month of january       i      and ending in december       i   m       
 

fisince the hong kong visitor data provides information on the geographic origins of its visitors  we
also tested our algorithms ability to predict the number of visitors to hong kong originating from a
subset of the geographic regions reported  namely the americas  europe  africa and the middle
east  and australia  new zealand and the south pacific  for lack of a better descriptor  we refer
to these regions collectively as western nations in the subsequent discussion 
we collected search volume histories from google insights for a variety of search queries related
to hong kong tourism  the data provided on google insights consists of normalized search volume
indices that indicate the number of searches made on a given day by internet users for a particular
query on google 
table   contains a listing of the search queries considered in the present study  note that the list
contains not only english queries  but also chinese queries  we denote by qj the j th query under
consideration  and we let nq denote the number of queries considered   in our case  nq       
 i 
we preprocessed the search volume data to obtain monthly search volume index averages zj   i  
              m for each query qj   the data are  by googles convention  scaled to range from   to      with
    denoting the maximum search volume observed over the period of inquiry 

 

methodology

our aim is to predict  for a given temporal index i  the value of the visitor arrival statistic y  i  using
knowledge of past visitor arrival statistics y       y               y  i   as well as past search volume indices
       
 i  
zj   zj           zj
  j                 nq  
to accomplish this task  we model y  i  as a linear combination of a subset of the past visitor arrival
statistics and search volume indices  namely 
x
x x
 i 
 k 
ypred  
l y  l   
jk zj  
   
kk jjk

ll

with l  k                 i     and jk                 nq   for each k 
writing equation     for all i in a training set leads to a linear system of the form
x   y 

   

with  a vector containing the parameters k and jk   let  denote the least squares solution to this
system  for test data  xtest   ytest    let  denote the relative error in the predicted value of ytest  
 

  xtest   ytest    
  ytest    

   

we have also investigated the use of locally weighted linear regression
p for predicting visitor arrival
statistics  whereby     is replaced with a least squares system min i w i   t x i   y  i       we used
gaussian weights w i    exp   x  x i               with bandwidth parameter       for predicting
global visitor arrival statistics  and      for predicting visitor arrivals from western nations 
to estimate the generalization error of our algorithms  we used k fold cross validation with k     
in particular  for each year in the range            we trained our algorithms on four of the years and
tested on the remaining year  we then set our estimate of the generalization error equal to the average
test error observed in the five scenarios 
 

fito select features for our models  we used a modification of forward search that allows for the
addition of higher cardinality subsets of features when the addition of singletons ceases to provide
improvement  more precisely  given a default feature set f  and a set of candidate features c  we
perform the following iteration 
   initialize f   f  and s     
   while s  smax  
set      f  
let s    arg

min

sc  s  s

 f  s  

if  f  s          set s    s      else set f    f  s and c    c s 
in our studies  we used smax      and we used a candidate set c consisting of the search volume
indices of all nq search queries over the four months i     i     i     i    preceding each month
of inquiry i  our default feature set f  consisted of the visitor arrival statistics from the months
i     i     i      i     preceding each month of inquiry i 

 

results

table   lists the estimated generalization errors obtained from our weighted and unweighted linear
regression algorithms  as well as the corresponding search queries selected by our feature selection
algorithm  overall  the locally weighted algorithm performed best  exhibiting generalization errors of
      and       on the western and global arrival predictions  respectively  both algorithms performed
better when predicting arrivals of visitors originating from western nations compared to visitors from
all nations 
interestingly  both english and chinese search queries appear to be relevant predictors of hong
kong visitor arrival statistics  even when only considering visitors originating from western nations 
in fig     we show training and test set visitor arrival predictions for visitors originating from
western nations  as computed with locally weighted linear regression  the closeness of the fits lends
credence to the predictive power of search volume indices in the context of tourism forecasting 

 

conclusion and future work

we have presented and evaluated an improved approach to the problem of predicting tourism rates 
query specific search data was used  instead of aggregate search data  and a feature selection algorithm
was implemented to choose the most relevant queries  hong kongs monthly visitor arrival statistics
for the years           were used as the data set for testing  the algorithm was evaluated using kfold cross validation  along with exhibiting a low training error as with choi and varians algorithm 
our algorithm was found to exhibit a low test set error  the results indicate that web search volume
histories provide a useful predictor of tourism rates  future directions for the work include using
advanced machine learning techniques and more features to get an even more accurate estimation of
the tourism rates  along with tourism  this study is relevant to a wide variety of other industries that
can benefit from analysis of web search volume histories to predict useful trends
