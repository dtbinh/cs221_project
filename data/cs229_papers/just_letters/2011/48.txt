background  
  
approximately       million  americans  are  paralyzed  due  to  some  form  of  spinal  cord  injury  
or  neurological  diseases  that  cut  the  connectivity  between  their  brains  and  bodies   brain  
machine  interface   bmi   is  a  novel  technology  aiming  to  restore  lost  function  to  paralyzed  
patients  by  translating  neural  activity  from  the  cortex  to  control  computer  cursors   robotic  
arms  or  other  prosthetic  devices   in  the  past  decade  bmis  have  shown  considerable  
promise  in  a  number  of  studies  including  animal  experiments   and  human  clinical  trials    
preliminary  results  from  these  experiments  demonstrate  that  neural  spiking  activity   both  
single unit  and  multi unit  activities   can  be  detected  by  an  intracortical  electrode  
microarray   decoded  and  used  for  voluntary  control  of  prosthetic  devices   despite  early  
successes   the  quality  of  device  control  using  neural  signals  is  still  suboptimal  in  
comparison  to  that  of  the  native  arms  control   current  bmis  are  significantly  slower   less  
stable   and  fairly  inaccurate   the  amount  of  information  that  the  user  can  obtain  per  minute  
is  considerably  less  than  that  achieved  by  able bodied  humans   for  example   a  typical  
typing  speed  is  about      words min   whereas  the  disabled  patients  can  generate  
approximately     words min  via  bmis   hence   a  number  of  improvements  are  still  needed  
for  successful  practical  applications  in  the  future     
  
the  development  of  bmis  thus  far  focuses  on  effective  decoding  algorithm   precise  cursor  
positioning  and  velocity   however   these  are  not  all  of  the  factors  that  could  affect  the  
information  transfer  rates   typical  applications  of  computer  cursor  control  assume  the  
ability  of  the  user  to  click  and  select  the  target  of  interest  but  this  assumption  is  not  true  in  
bmis  user  population   the  current  state of the art  bmi  can  decode  continuous   cursor  
motion   states  in  real  time  from  a  population  of  motor  cortical  neurons  with  certain  
accuracy  but  still  requires  users  to  hold  the  cursor  still  at  the  target  to  be  considered  the  
selection  of  a  target    the  holding  time  in  previous  studies  ranges  from  a  few  hundred  
milliseconds  to  a  few  seconds  depending  on  the  quality  of  the  decoder   with  a  reliable  
selection  decoder   we  should  be  able  to  shave  off  time  and  thus  gain  faster  information  
transfer  due  to  higher  number  of  target  selections  per  time  period   in         kim  et  al   also  
saw  the  importance  of  the  point and click  feature  in  bmis  and  suggested  a  method  that  
could  simultaneously  decode  continuous   cursor  movement   and  discrete   clicking   states  
in  real  time   the  authors  used  a  linear  discriminant  analysis   lda   classifier  to  decode  the  
clicking  movement  from  neural  data  collected  from  the  patients  that  were  asked  to  
imagine  to  squeeze  their  hands      
  
in  this  work   i  have  developed  a  decoder  that  can  detect  the  neural  stop  state  from  the  
neural  data  that  is  collected  from  subjects   i e   monkeys   who  do  not  need  to  imagine  them  
doing  an  unnatural  task  to  them   i e   squeezing  their  hands   when  making  a  selection   in  
addition   i  have  compared  the  performance  of  a  few  different  algorithms  in  decoding  the  
discrete  state  of  selecting  as  well  as  investigate  the  effect  of  smoothing unsmoothing  
neural  data  prior  to  the  decoding   i  have  also  investigated  the  impact  of  dimensionality  
reduction   if  any   on  the  performance  of  the  stop  state  decoder

methods  
  
all  procedures  and  experiments  were  approved  by  the  stanford  university  institutional  
animal  care  and  use  committee   iacuc    experiments  were  conducted  with  adult  male  
rhesus  macaque   l    implanted  with      electrode  utah  arrays   blackrock  microsystems  inc   
salt  lake  city   ut   using  standard  neurosurgical  techniques   electrode  arrays  were  
implanted  in  the  dorsal  aspect  of  dorsal  premotor  cortex   pmd   and  primary  motor  cortex  
 m    based  on  the  local  anatomical  landmarks     
  
the  monkeys  were  trained  to  make  point to point  reaches  in  a   d  plane  with  a  virtual  
cursor  controlled  by  the  contralateral  arm   the  virtual  cursor  and  targets  were  presented  
in  a   d  environment   msms   mddf   usc   los  angeles   ca    hand  position  data  were  
measured  with  an  infrared  reflective  bead  tracking  system   polaris   northern  digital   
ontario   canada    spike  counts  were  collected  by  applying  a  negative  threshold           x  root  
mean  square  of  the  spike  band  of  each  neural  channel   neural  data  were  processed  by  the  
cerebus  recording  system   blackrock  microsystems  inc    salt  lake  city   ut   and  were  
available  to  the  behavioral  control  system  within           ms   visual  presentation  was  
provided  by  using    two  lcd  monitors  with  refresh  rates  at       hz   in  the  brain controlled  
mode   cursor  kinematics  was  predicted  from  spiking  activity  through  a  modified  kalman  
filter   in  the  offline  analysis   hold stop  state  indicator  is  identified  based  upon  the  cursor  
kinematics  data   the  indicator  is  assigned     if  the  velocity  is  zero  and     otherwise       
  
a  few  data  processing  procedures   based  on  the  state of the art  decoding  algorithm   have  
been  done  to  optimize  the  performance   first  the  neural  and  kinematics  data  are  analyzed  
in  bins  of            and     ms  width   i e   windowed  spike  count   based  on  the  suggestion  that  
much  longer  bin  widths  can  yield  higher  decode  performance  offline    to  reduce  the  
number  of  channels  used  in  the  training  and  decoding   mutual  information  is  used  to  
determine  the  top      channels  containing  highest  information  regarding  the  kinematics  of  
the  cursor   in  some  analyses   dimensionality  reduction  techniques  such  as  pca  or  
gaussian process  factor  analysis   gpfa    are  used  instead  to  reduce  the  number  of  
dimensions  for  the  model  training   processed  neural  and  kinematics  data  are  then  used  as  
training  and  testing  data  in  the  cross validation  process   the  classifier  is  selected  from  one  
of  the  three  algorithms   nave  bayes   support  vector  machines   svm   and  linear  
discriminant  analysis   lda    model  parameters  are  then  fit  to  the  training  data        of  
total  data    then   based  on  data  not  used  for  model  fitting   the  prediction  accuracy   
precision  and  recall  are  evaluated  for  further  comparison

comparison  
figure        table      in  this  
experiment   the  neural  and  
kinematics  data  were  
extracted  from  the  time     ms  after  the  target  onset    
the  time  when  the  target  first  appears  on    screen    to  the  
time  when  the  subject  holds  onto  the  target   twenty  
percent  of  trials  were  randomly  selected  to  be  used  as  
training  data  and  the  rest  was  used  for  testing   before  the  
data  was  used  for  model  parameter  fitting   the  neural  and  kinematics  data  were  first  
integrated  in     ms  bin  width  to  increase  the  amount  of  information  per  time  step  and  to  
reduce  any  noises  in  the  signal   after  preprocessing   we  fit  the  model  parameters  of  nave  
bayes   svm  and  lda   we  found  that  svm  predicted  with  comparable  accuracy  to  lda  
           vs             but  both  of  these  algorithms  performed  significantly  better  than  
nave  bayes                 to  further  compare  svms  and  ldas  predicting  performance   
we  checked  their  precision  and  recall  values  and  observed  slight  differences  between  the  
two  algorithms   svm  resulted  in         precision  and         recall  percentage  whereas  
lda  resulted  in         precision  and         recall  percentage       
  
effects  of  integration  bin  
width  
figure        table      similar  
preprocessing  steps  to  the  
previous  session  were  
performed  with  the  data  in  this  experiment  with  an  
exception  of  the  integration  bin  width  being  varied  from     to  
    ms  to  compare  the  effect  of  data  integration  bin  width   to  
investigate  the  causal  effect  of  integration  bin  width  on  
accuracy   all  other  parameters  are  held  constant  and  the  
algorithm  used   svm  with  a  linear  kernel   was  the  same  across  different  bin  width  values   
the  prediction  accuracy  percentages  were                        and            for       
     and     ms  bin  width   respectively   the  increase  in  integration  time  appeared  to  mildly  
improve  the  prediction  performance   however   the  precision  and  recall  percentages  are  
relatively  comparable  across  the  three  bin  width  values   see  table     above      
  
impacts  of  dimensionality  
reduction  
figure      to  improve  the  
prediction  accuracy   we  
implemented  two  different  
dimensionality  reduction  
techniques   pca  and  gpfa    to  
increase  the  information  
contained  in  each  feature  
dimension   we  hypothesized  that  

fiwithout  dimensionality  reduction  there  might  be  too  much  redundant  information  across  
multiple  channels   especially  those  channels  selected  by  mutual  information  method   as  an  
example  of  dimensionally reduced  data   the  top     latent  dimensions  derived  from  gpfa  are  
plotted  in  figure      it  can  be  seen  that  most  of  the  variance  are  contained  in  dimensions     
to      whereas  the  signals  in  dimensions     to     are  relatively  dormant     
  
figure        table      
neither  pca  nor  gpfa  
appeared  to  have  much  
impact  on  the  prediction  
accuracy   in  fact  the  
performance  became  worse  when  we  applied  pca  to  
reduce  the  dimensionality  of  the  raw  data  before  fitting  
the  model  parameters  of  svm   the  accuracy  percentage  
without  any  dimensionality  reduction  is            
whereas  that  when  pca  was  applied  is             as  for  
the  decoder  with  gpfa   we  observed  that  the  accuracy  percentage  in  predicting  the  stop  
state  is             which  is  not  significantly  different  from  the  baseline  value     
  
effects  of  time  period  
used  in  training  
figure        table      in  this  
experiment  we  evaluated  
the  importance  of  period  of  
time  used  in  the  
classification  of  neural  state   
the  simplest  choice  for  time  
period  used  is  to  include  time  from  the  target  onset   tto   
to  the  end  of  the  trial   end    or  we  can  discard  the  first     ms  after  the  target  onset  
 tto       with  the  assumption  that  the  neural  activity  during  this  time  period  is  not  highly  
correlated  with  either  movement  or  stop  state   another  option  is  to  include  the  data  from  
   ms  before  the  target  is  first  acquired   i e   cursor  entering  the  target   tfa       to  the  
end  of  the  trial   we  found  that  when  we  incorporated  the  information  from  the  target  onset  
or      ms  after  the  target  onset  the  decoder  could  predict  the  neural  stop  state  better  
than  when  we  only  considered      ms  before  the  target  was  first  acquired  till  the  end   the  
accuracy  percentages  of  tto      to  end   tfa      to  end  and  tto  to  end  are             
           and             respectively     
  
discussion  
in  this  study  we  attempted  to  create  a  decoder  for  discrete  neural  stop  state  for  the  
application  in  point and click  task   below  are  the  findings  that  we  have  observed     
  
nave  bayes  vs  svm  vs  lda   first  we  investigated  the  decoding  performance  of  three  
different  classification  algorithms   nave  bayes   svm  and  lda   svm  and  lda  are  chosen  
because  we  need  a  binary  classifier  for  the  discrimination  of  neural  movement  and  stop  
state  based  on  neural  activity  recorded  from  two     channel  microelectrode  arrays   from  
our  experiment   we  found  that  svm  and  lda  performed  better  than  nave  bayes  but  
between  the  two  the  prediction  accuracy  percentages  are  comparable   both  svm  and  lda  

ficompute  hyperplanes  for  classification  that  are  optimal  with  respective  to  their  individual  
objectives   hence   they  can  perform  differently  in  different  applications    however   for  our  
data   the  two  algorithms  yield  similar  results   they  differ  only  in  their  precision  and  recall  
percentages   svm  has  a  higher  precision  but  a  lower  recall  rate   in  practice  we  want  to  have    
as  few  false  positive  incidents  as  possible  because  a  false  positive  classification  could  
potentially  lead  to  an  incorrect  selection  of  choice   thus   svm  may  be  a  more  promising  
algorithm  for  neural  stop  state  decoding       
  
integration  bin  width   previous  literature  has  demonstrated  that  offline  and  online  
analyses  suggest  different  parameter  choices   online  decoding  algorithm  that  incorporates  
feedback  control  performs  best  with  shorter  bin  widths        ms     whereas  offline  
analysis  requires  longer  bin  widths            ms     in  this  experiment  we  evaluated  the  
prediction  accuracy  with  three  integration  bin  widths           and      ms   as  expected   we  
found  that     ms  bin  width  yields  highest  decode  performance            the  performance  
may  increase  if  we  integrate  the  neural  activity  with  a  wider  bin         ms   but  there  will  
then  be  a  tradeoff  between  performance  and  temporal  resolution     
  
dimensionality  reduction   it  is  neither  practical  nor  efficient  to  use  all       recording  
channels  in  model  training   to  improve  the  efficiency   we  first  computed  mutual  
information  of  each  channel  and  select  only  the  top  ranked  to  be  used  in  our  decoder   
however   we  hypothesized  that  we  could  improve  the  performance  by  using  
dimensionality  reduction  techniques  such  as  pca  or  gpfa  to  condense  the  information  into  
fewer  dimensions   see  figure       however   our  current  results  do  not  suggest  that  that  is  
the  case   in  fact  pca  seems  to  perform  worse  than  the  unprocessed  data   it  should  be  noted  
that  we  did  not  separate  different  types  of  trials   left  or  right  reach   upward  or  downward  
reach   when  we  performed  pca  or  gpfa   the  signal  in  latent  dimensions   i e   neural  
trajectory   can  be  quite  different  between  these  different  types  of  reaches   the  decode  
performance  may  improve  if  this  process  was  done  prior  to  the  binary  classification  by  
svm  or  lda     
  
time  period  used   last  but  not  least   we  decoded  our  neural  and  kinematics  data  based  
on  a  critical  assumption  that  the  cognitive  process  could  be  distinguished  into  two  
distinctive  groups   but  this  may  not  be  true   it  is  probable  that  during  the  time  when  the  
cursor  kinematics  is  zero  there  could  be  multiple  neural  states   to  improve  the  
performance   we  could  use  multi class  classifier  or  we  can  apply  other  algorithms  that  take  
into  account  the  influence  of  the  presence  or  absence  of  a  previous  state  on  a  current  state  
such  as  hidden  markov  model   hmm
