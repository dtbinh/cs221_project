introduction

data  in       researchers conducted three evenings of graduate student speed dating  during
each evening  twenty single women and twenty single men each went on a four minute date
with every participant of the opposite sex  after each date  each participant filled out a survey
indicating whether they were interested in the other person  if the other person was also interested 
the students eventually received each others emailthis was the motivation for participating in
the study  and made a subjective rating from one to ten of the following response features 
how friendly  flirtatious  awkward  and assertive they were  how friendly  flirtatious  awkward 
assertive  attractive  sincere  intelligent  funny  ambitious  and courteous the other person was 
how much they enjoyed the date  how much information they shared  and how much they felt
that the two of them clicked  for each date  from each participants perspective  we have the
outcome variable of whether they were interested  the response variables  and both audio and
written transcripts  additionally  dan jurafsky and colleagues extracted a set of conversational
features from the date transcripts which are too numerous to list  but which include instances of
laughter  interruption  questions  etc 
motivation  ranganath  jurafsky  and mcfarland have written two papers            using this
data set so far  both of which used support vector machines trained on the conversational features
to predict the response features  he told us that they were having trouble predicting the outcome
variable  especially for men  above chance  predicting whether or not a given person is romantically
interested in another is a difficult but rewarding task  we are typically reserved when it comes
to displaying open romantic interest toward strangers for social reasons  so being able to predict
interest from conversational data could reduce the number of lonely grad studentsa noble end in
itself  more broadly  while these dating situations are contrived  we think our project will offer
insight into other dating situations  like online dating websites   social networks  and perhaps even
ordinary conversation 
our novel approach to the data is to predict the outcome of a date using not just the conversation
between the two people  but also other dates involving the subject or target and similarities between
the subject and the group  in short  while jurafskys interest was primarily nlp  we are studying
the network structure of the problem  attempting to predict edges in a directed  bipartite graph 
this research is also potentially applicable to other social network problemspredicting friendships

in the model could also be useful 

 

conversational features

we separated men and women into separate groups and used linear regression and support vector
machines  svms  with linear  rbf  and polynomial kernels to predict the outcome of each date based
only on conversational features  measuring success with leave one out cross validation  loocv  
when we trained on the full dataset  there was low variance  but our training results were around
    for both genders  simply predicting success for every mans date and failure for every
womans date yields accuracy rates of       and        respectively  so we needed a more sophisticated approach 
at the other extreme  training one model for each individual on only the dates they experienced
produced the opposite problem  with    data points for each person and    features  all models
overfit the data  the averaged loocv errors over all of the men and over all of the women
exhibited high variance  fitting the training set almost perfectly  but failing to generalize 
to compromise between these extremes  we needed to preserve some notion of individual differences in dating preferences while making use of the information resulting from the collective dating
experiences  we trained individual models for each person on the entire dataset for their gender 
but weighted the dates the individual went on more heavily  weighting the individuals dates   mi  
fi           times as heavily as the other dates   mj   fj    produced error rates far better than chance 
this weighting scheme does not acknowledge that some dates between  mj   fj   may be more
relevant to a  mi   fi   based on a similarity between the mj and mi   we computed similarity
matrices between mj and mi in two ways  we looked at similarity in terms of behavior on the dates 
and in terms of liking the same people  created rankings for each other participant of the same
gender  and weighted their dates proportionally 
our most successful behavior similarity metric came from using the cosine of the vocabulary
vectors  each row indicating the number of times a given word was said  between an mi and each
mj   weighted by inverse document frequency  effectively  tf idf 
we compared different preference rankings  including simple indicators 
x jaccard index  common
   i and j agree about an
neighbors  and had best results perturbing the weights according to
fj

fj     i and j dated the same fj   

 

outcome features

outcome features intuitively contain more information about a date than conversational features 
as a subject is rating their target after the date  they have solidifed their opinion of the other
person to the point where their ratings will likely be colored by their choice of outcome  using
an approach similar to the one outlined above with normalized outcome features  we were able to
predict date outcomes with high accuracy  despite the subjective noise in these features  the figures
 

a note on notation  throughout this paper  we use  mi   fi   to denote the test date and  mj   fj   to denote
other dates not involving the same mi   we also refer to things from the male perspective  which is not an attempt
to reinforce patriarchal hegemony but merely an attempt at consistent notation

men

we attempted to reduce the noise in the ratings by representing each score as a normalized
value for each person  i e  individualized standard deviations from a mean of zero   but this did
not increase the strength of the model 

 

network features

after we found  from the weighted samples  that the date between two other subjects  mj   fj   was
useful for predicting the outcome of a date between a subject and a target of interest  mi   fi    it
seemed logical to predict the outcome of  mi   fi   without using any features of that particular date
at all  could we predict whether mi would like fi before they even met  based only on the network
of who had liked whom in the other dates  this is a specific instance of link prediction for which
numerous algorithms have been developed                 
because of the special structure of our network  bipartie  directed  and very small   many of
these methods are not applicable  in particular  widely used features like common neighbors must
be adapted for bipartite graphs  since common neighbors mi   fi     for all mi   fi    however 
because bipartite graphs turn up so frequently  modeling everything from yelp ratings to dnaprotein interactions   they have nurtured their own subclass of link prediction algorithms  ranging
from the straightforward to the exotic            we decided to develop an algorithm that was  a 
not convoluted  because our dataset was so small  and  b  potentially combinable with our other
prediction methods for conversational and outcome features  this ruled out some of the more exotic
methods  like learning psuedokernels     or learning an embedding function for network nodes     
we defined a set of features for each  mi   fi   based on the network topology and used loocv
with logistic regression and svms to predict the presence of edges 
we began by defining the features on an ad hoc basisfor example  other guys who liked date
x
i      edge mj   fi      but then  inspired by leskovecs systematic binary enumeration of feature
mj

possibilities in      decided to do things more systematically  extending      for each edge  mi   fi   
we removed the edge and then defined four projected graphs that were undirected but weighted 
notating a graph by hvertices  edge weightsi  the first projected graph was given by hmales  common
neighbors mi   mj  iintuitively  a graph where the weight of an edge between two males was how
many females they liked in common 
 

fiwe defined a second graph  m  who likes you  by replacing how many females they liked in
common with how many females they had been liked by in common  we defined the projections
for the females similarly  to normalize edge weights  we defined a second set of four projected
graphs where  rather than using common neighbors  we used the jaccard coefficient  our original
weight divided by the size of the union of the relevant edge sets   this projections generalized
those in    which were binary and not applicable to directed graphs  wex
defined two features from
each projection  for the male graphs  for example  our features were
 w ij edge mj   fi    and
mj

maxmj  w ij edge mj   fi     where w ij was the weight of the edge between mi and mj in the projected
graph  and edge was    if the edge was present
in the original graph and    if it was not  similarly 
x
for the female graphs  our features were
 w ij edge mi   fj    and maxfj  w ij edge mi   fj     we
fj

did not expect all    features to work well  but the systematic enumeration allowed us to see which
binary choices worked
better  we defined two additional features  she likes you edge fi   mi   and
x
num you like   edge mi   fj     where edge in this case was boolean  not       by training on
fj

subsets of these    features and comparing the error rates  we derived a number of results 
   whether you like someone is correlated with whether they like you 
   using sum works considerably better than using maxintuitive  since max comes from only
one edge and should be noisy 
   the who you like features were marginally more predictive than the who likes you features 
we thought that femalewholikesyou and malewhoyoulike should be most predictive for male female
edges  but this turned out not to be the case 
   jaccard and common neighbors were roughly equally predictivenormalization turned out
not to matter 
   male projection features were marginally more predictive for male female edges than were
female projection features  and vice versa  your companions evidently offer more insight than your
dates 
using all    features overfits the dataset  and since the only major performance difference between our binary choices was that sum significantly outperformed max  we threw out the max
features for a final feature set size of      an extension of this project would involve more sophisticated feature selection  whether by forward search or some adaptation of mutual information  
this produced an test accuracy of       for men and       for women with loocv svm with
rbf kernel 

 

multiple feature domains

we attempted to combine features from both the network and conversational domains to improve
predictions without resorting to looking at the outcome featureswhich we consider tantamount to
predicting how the date went after asking the person how it went  without sophisticated feature
selection techniques  we achieved best results by combining the five conversation features with
the largest absolute valued weights hate  sex  you know  question  approval  with the
network features  however  further research should consider more rigorous methods of combination

conclusion

with adjusted weightings  we were able to successfully predict date oucomes at rates significantly
greater than the baseline  we were also able to achieve extremely high performance with network
features  even higher than that attained using outcome features  without any information about the
date being predicted  however  this comparative success may only reflect our failure to construct
an effective model for learning on outcome features 
as mentioned above  we believe this project could be greatly improved with more intelligent
feature selection  forward search  an adaptation of mutual information  or some other method  
future experiments might also use deep learning to find better featues or similarity metrics from
the topological data
