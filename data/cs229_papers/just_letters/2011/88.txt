abstract
operation icebridge is a nasa funded survey of polar sea and land ice consisting
of multiple instruments installed on an airborne platform  the snow radar  leu   
instrument is a wide band frequency modulated continuous wave  fmcw  radar that
has been deployed on icebridge missions  the properties of this radar  frequency  bandwidth  etc   allow for the detection of the air snow  snow ice  air ice  and air water
interfaces in the radar backscatter return data  if these interfaces can be extracted
from the backscatter data  it will allow one to determine both the distance measured
from the aircraft to the surface  as well as the thickness of the snow covering the ice
sheet  retrieving snow thickness will yield important information about the snow pack
covering polar ice sheets  allowing for a better understanding of the state of earths
cryosphere  this paper examines the implementation of a support vector machine
 svm  learning algorithm to extract the various interfaces from the raw radar data 

 

motivation

the radar backscatter data is presented as measurements of return power as a function of
time or range  although the interfaces do show up as peaks in the radar return data  preliminary analysis of the data has shown that simple peak finding methods are insufficient in
accurately predicting which peaks are the different interfaces  noise  signal attenuation  especially by thick snow   surface topography  and other geophysical properties all contribute
to masking the interface and making detection more difficult  to add to the difficulty  an
accurate layer tracker must have the ability to distinguish the following interfaces 
  
  
  
  

air snow  as 
snow ice  si 
air ice  ai 
air water  aw 

 

fieach of the above surfaces has different backscatter characteristics that are not easily
identified by just the power of the peak in the range line  the power of nearby points  in both
range and time  must be used to adequately identify the interface  the relationship between
the peak of interest and the nearby points  however  are often very subtle and difficult to
explicitly determine  example echograms for the various interface types are shown below 

 a  radar echogram showing areas
that have no snow  the dark areas
near     km and     km  and areas
that have both snow and ice interfaces  the light areas where two interfaces are visible  

 b  individual range line of an
echogram  in an ideal case  the si
interface will be seen as the highestpowered peak  with the as interface
being of lower power and appearing beforehand 

figure    example of raw radar data 

the difficulty in determining the explicit factors that describe each interface type is to
be handled by implementing an svm supervised learning algorithm to classify the peaks of
a given range line as being one of the identified interface types  or no interface at all  a peak
caused by noise  sidelobe interference  or other factors   other instruments on the airborne
platform  lidar and digital imagery  can be used as aids in training a given data set 

 

support vector machine

as mentioned  a support vector machine  ng    will be applied to this problem  the general
method is described here  classification will be performed on the various peaks in a given
range line  in training  the   most powerful peaks of a given range line will be extracted 
this number was achieved by analysis of several radar files  where it was determined that in
general any other peaks beyond this number are either noise or cannot be readily classified 
each of these peak will be analyzed and identifed as being one of the interfaces described 
or being no interface at all  once a peak is identified  a feature vector will be formed from
the data and stored  once a certain number of peaks are classified  the svm will be trained
on the data and used to classify the rest of the radar data 
 

filibsvm  cl     a readily available software package  was employed  libsvm provides
a robust solution to this problem  with a matlab interface that allows the data to be
trained  processed  analyzed  and visualized with ease  a model for each type of interface
was created  and every peak being analyzed was predicted with each model  once predicted 
the interface classification that returned the highest decision value was used to classify the
peak 

 

feature selection

as illustrated in figure    it is clear that points surrounding each peak are required to properly
classify it  not only are the points in the same range line of interest  but so are the points in
adjacent range lines  this is because the radar footprint is sufficiently large so nearby range
lines should be well correlated in terms of interfaces they detect  however  noise should not
be well correlated between range lines  so this should aid in rejecting peaks that are caused
by noise or other undesired sources 
the ideal number of features to use was achieved by performing training and test error
analysis using different numbers of features that are processed in different ways  because
of the large amount of data  computational efficiency must be considered  a model could
be generated with a large number of features  but this would result in unacceptably large
processing times  some classification errors are tolerable  as additional filtering of the data
will be performed that should reduce error rates

figure    training and test errors as a function of the number of features  to the left
and right of a given peak   a value of     for example  means that the    points to
the left and the    points to the right of the peak are used as features for the model 

figure   shows the behavior of the model as the number of features is increased  as
expected  if only a small number of features are used  the model is not very good at making
 

fipredictions  analysis shows that little improvement is seen beyond using    data points to
the left and to the right of a peak  for this reason     features will be used  similar behavior
is seen for true negative  false positive  and false negative results  across all interface types 
in order to further improve computation efficiency by reducing the number of features in
the model  analysis was performed by averaging some features together  one motivation for
this is that because the snow depth is not constant  averaging together a series of features
will bring together various return profiles  which should both simplify the model as well
as possibly giving better performance  also  averaging points together may help with noise
rejection  it was determined that averaging would be done on a larger number of points the
further away from the peak the feature lies  also under the assumption that the further away
from the peak  the less important a feature becomes because the points start to decorrelate
more  this was performed by grouping together points by using a quadratic function f  x   
 cx     where c is the feature mean coefficient and x is the number of points away from the
peak  this gives a pattern that groups together points in increasing numbers the further
away from a peak they are

figure    training and test errors as a function of the feature mean coefficient 

figure   shows the effect of averaging the features together  training error gets somewhat
worse  but not by much  while test error remains about the same  a somewhat large increase
in error is noted after a c value of      so this is the value that is used  performance remains
good  while computational efficiency is greatly increased by reducing the size of the feature
vector from     elements     points along   range lines near the peak being analyzed  down
to    elements

results

multiple radar data files for a specific campaign were processed with the svm model trained
in the manner described  examples are shown in figure           of the         measurements were determined to have been successfully tracked  most files had better tracking
statistics  in the         range   but the overall average is brought down by some files
having substantial data dropout  for often unknown reasons   rather than poor performance
by the svm
