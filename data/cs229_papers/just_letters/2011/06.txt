abstract
proof helper addresses an important area of education  automated evaluation and assistance
with proofs  however  one important question is when to provide hints to a student  ideally 
wed like to do this when the student is judged as being sufficiently confused  we ran a study
using the odesk service to collect data on how submission histories can be used as predictors
for confusion  though we were not able to reliably predict confusion given the amount of data
we collected and the features we examined  we examine our results and analyze them to guess
how we could make a similar future experiment more successful 

 

introduction

scalability is a major problem facing todays education system  to be effective  university level
education must include methods for evaluating students and assisting them as they try to learn new
concepts  however  as we have seen from cs    s overcrowded office hours  one on one guidance
is difficult to achieve  even with traditional classroom based education  thus  enabling students
to learn without the assistance of another human being is crucial for improving the scalability of
university level education  furthermore  we would ultimately like to be capable of teaching anyone
who is interested in learning a subject  not just those fortunate enough to be able to enroll in a
certain class  the recent launch of three online courses by stanfords computer science department
is a major step in this direction  relying on online videos to teach computer science to over        
students around the world  but significant problems still remain  while disseminating information
is easy today  an effective educational experience must also provide students with both a way to
verify that they truly understand the material and some form of guidance in solving problems 
then  in order to teach a large number of people at once  this evaluation and guidance must come
through an automated tool 
proof helper is the work in progress that attempts to fulfill this need  allowing students to
enter proofs in a formalized way and providing automated verification of these proofs  however 
in light of the need for interaction between the student and a more knowledgeable entity  it will
ultimately also be necessary for proof helper to determine when to provide a student with a hint 
and what kind of hint to provide to the student  in our study  we attempt to address the first
question  by formulating a method for predicting whether or not a student is confused  based on
characteristics of the students submission history 

 

related work

although languages like prolog and metamath have allowed the programmatic representation of
formal proofs  these efforts occupy a significantly different space than proof helper  unlike these
 

filanguages  proof helper is not specific to any one domain  and its primary purpose is not only to
provide a mechanism for specifying verifiable proofs  but also to educate and evaluate a student in
an automated way 

 

methodology

we collected data using odesk  a website which allows us to hire individuals to do online tasks  for
the purposes of this experiment  we added an i am confused button to the application  which
the user was instructed to click whenever they are unsure about how to proceed with the proof 

figure    the tutorial screenshot for proof helper 
to better understand how a users confusion level varies as he or she progresses through attempting to solve the problem  we record data whenever the user submits a proof by clicking the
check proof button  or clicks the i am confused button  based on these proof submissions 
we can construct the following features to use for supervised learning 
   total number of proofs submitted
   number of syntactically incorrect statements

 

fi   number of syntactically correct statements that do not follow from current knowledge
   number of syntactically correct statements that do follow from current knowledge
   number of successful proofs  proving the goal 
these features correspond to a count of events falling within a certain timespan  separated by
user and by proof  each of these time blocks represents one data point  additionally  the target
variable  confusion  is   if and only if the i am confused button is clicked at least once during
this timespan  last  to improve the quality of our data  we also 
   include a filter question to ensure that users are sufficiently qualified  we did this in the
form of a very simple logic proof 
   emphasize that the i am confused button is not a functional hint button  i e  clicking it
will not allow the user to complete the task more quickly  and that the sole purpose of this
button is to provide the necessary information for this study 
   randomize the order of the problems presented  so that certain problems will not systematically influence performance on other problems 

 

conducting the experiment

before collecting data  we ran a short pilot study to see what roadblocks new users to proof helper
would encounter 

   

pilot study

the five users who participated in the pilot provided useful feedback on the tool  revealing some bugs
within the assignments used as well as in the parser  another crucial lesson was that individuals
who were seeing proof helper for the first time often had no idea how to go about writing proofs 
as a result  we recorded a tutorial video walking a user through a sample proof with difficulty on
par with the proofs provided  which our users said was very helpful for seeing how to begin  we
also made the tutorial proof itself and an alternate solution to the tutorial proof available 

   

the experiment

though we began the pilot study on schedule  making the necessary updates to proof helper in
response to the pilot resulted in a late start to real data collection  though many users were
able to complete the proofs quickly  often on the same day as accepting the job and within a
three hour timespan  fewer users applied to our posted job than we expected  which required us
to consider shorter timespans  ultimately  we collected data from ten users  in addition to the five
who participated in the pilot 
the users who participated in our study were mostly employed in computer science or had
graduated with computer science degrees  but they also included a couple of math majors and one
individual in education  most had seen propositional logic through computer science courses  and
a few expressed interest in the tool because they wanted to review material from their classes

results   error analysis

we tried several algorithms on our data  including svm  softmax  batch logistic regression  and
stochastic logistic regression  our most successful results came through using batch logistic regression  where the data used time blocks of length    minutes  we also considered using the fraction of
each category of proof as opposed to the absolute counts of each kind of proof  i e  what proportion
of proofs submitted during a timespan were syntactically incorrect instead of the number of such
proofs submitted  but this did not improve our results

above  we display information on the quality of results using timespans of        and    minutes 
the above training error is calculated by running the algorithm on a randomly selected     of the
data set  and testing it on the remaining      we note that as the size of our timespan decreases 
the proportion of data points with y      confused  also decreases  which encourages our algorithm
to simply predict that the user is not confused most of the time  on the other hand  we also note
that logically  confusion should vary drastically over a    minute span  and hence total counts over
   minute timespans should not be strong predictors of confusion 
additionally  in a system that wishes to produce student confusion  we believe that false negatives are worse than false positives  if the system believes a student is confused  it can always ask
the student if he or she wants a hint  while if the system does not believe a student is confused
when the student is in fact completely lost  this will result in a very negative learning experience
for the student 
one significant source of error is the small quantity of data  and in particular the lack of data
points indicating confusion  aside from decreasing the accuracy of our learning algorithm  this
meant that we also had to increase the proportion of our data reserved for testing when calculating
test error  or we would run the risk of having no points indicating confusion in the test set  as
is  we can see that there are still dangerously few points indicating confusion in the test data set 
which leads to high variability in test errors  since the data to be reserved for testing is selected
randomly 
we also note that the data from different users varied significantly  a problem which is exacerbated by the small number of participants  for example  some users were more prone to clicking
the i am confused button  and some users were more likely to submit rapidly over a short time
interval  while others appeared to take more time to consider the problems outside of the tool 
last but not least  visually plotting confusion versus each feature reveals no visual correlation
between most of the features and confusion  intuitively  while we might expect that a user is
unlikely to both indicate confusion and complete a proof within the same timeblock  this certainly
does occur  even over   minute timespans

conclusion   future work

conducting this experiment has certainly yielded interesting results  in the process  we have
discovered various factors that make it easier for new users to use proof helper  and learned about
concerns that should be addressed for this tool in the future  certainly  the ability to predict
student confusion would still be very valuable  not only because such algorithms will allow the
system to decide when to offer hints to the student  but perhaps even to decide what kinds of
hints to provide  depending on which features contribute most to the estimation that the student
is confused 
if we were to run this study again  there are several changes we would consider  first  a major
hindrance to our analysis is the lack of data collected  specifically  the lack of data where students
indicate they are confused  aside from collecting data over a longer period of time  we could also
actively and regularly poll the user for confusion  or require that the user indicate some measure
of confusion with every proof submission  in hindsight  it was not clear how often the user should
click the i am confused button  and given that the button serves no purpose in helping them
complete the task at hand  it is likely users may have simply forgotten to do so 
additionally  there exist other features that are potentially good predictors of student confusion
that we were not able to consider given the format of the data we collected  for instance  proof
history  where we consider dependencies from previous time frames  might correlate strongly with
student confusion  if a student tends to resubmit identical proofs several times  this may indicate
that the student believes the proof to be correct  and is confused because the system repeatedly
rejects the proof  in a future study  we would format the data to make it more conducive to
considering the sequential progress the student has made  including observing repeated steps 
another feature to consider is the usefulness or ease of steps  steps that are successfully proved
may be en route to a valid proof  or they may simply be gropes in the dark  using this as a data
point requires designing some metric for estimating this usefulness  on the other hand  the ability
to estimate the ease of steps and to use these as features can be beneficial because a user may be
confused after proving many easy steps  making progress   then abruptly being confronted with a
difficult step  and having that progress halted  
with the knowledge gleaned from this experiment  we believe that the above changes would
greatly increase the probability of success for a future attempt to estimate student confusion using
proof helper
