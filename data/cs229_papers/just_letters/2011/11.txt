   introduction
when buyers purchase products from an online retailer such as amazon  they assess
and pay not only for the product they want but also for packaging  delivery  and the
extent to which the product description matches the actual product  on the other hand 
the premium price a merchant can demand for a product  relative to the other
merchants selling the same product  is highly correlated to the product reviews  with
the growing number of websites such as amazon and ebay that allow users to express
their experience  costumer reviews will play a
more significant role in the reputation of the
merchants 

with fast growth of online retailers  developing
tools to quantify the semantics of product
reviews and deriving the polarity of opinions are
attracting significant attention over the last few
years  one approach to evaluate the strength
of an opinion is using reviews with numeric

firatings and training  semi  supervised learning algorithms to classify reviews as positive
or negative      however  these techniques are not able to fully incorporate the
sentiment of the reviews  in another approach in      the semantic orientation and
strength of a review is predicted by tracing the changes in the associated economic
variables of a merchant  more specifically  the scheme used in     assigns a dollar value
to each opinion phrase by evaluating the effect of the phrases on econometrics like
premium price a merchant can ask over the period of time      assigns a score to the
modifiers that the buyers used in the reviews and characterizes a merchant using a
vector of reputation dimensions representing its ability on each of dimensions  i e 
shipping  packaging and so on  

in this project  we used two different binary classifiers  i e  nave bayes and semisupervised recursive auto encoder  to predict the premium price of a product  the
sentiment analysis algorithm  i e  rae  was deployed to obtain the semantics of the
product reviews and provided a model for the premium prices  in the rest of the report 
details of the two classifiers are provided followed by the simulation results and a
comparison of the two 

   data collection
we used the data set provided by      the data set includes details of the      
transactions that took place on amazon com for     different software products  the
data set collected from publicly available information at amazon com by using amazon

fiweb services over a period of     days  between october      and march       the
data set used in this project is available at http   economining stern nyu edu 

the data set includes two parts  transaction history and reputation data  the first part
consists of transaction ids for each product and the price at which the products were
sold  the second part of data set includes the reputation history of each merchant that
had a product for sale during the period which the data set was collected  additionally 
for each of the competing listings for identical products  we have the listed price along
with the competitors reputation 

   nave bayes
first  multivariate bernoulli event model with
laplace smoothing is used to build a model for
premium prices based on the merchant reputation 
bag of words representation of the product reviews
is used for nave bayes model 
for evaluating the performance of the classifier  fold cross validation is used  the average accuracy
of     is achieved by nave bayes method 

fi   semi supervised recursive auto encoder
in order to exploit hierarchical structure of each review  semi supervised auto encoder
 rae  is used  illustration of rae architecture  which learns semantic vector
representations of phrases  is given in the following figure 
in rae method word indices are first
mapped into a semantic vector space 
then they are recursively merged by
the same auto encoder network into a
fixed length sentence representation 
the vectors at each node are used as
features to predict a distribution over
sentiment labels 

similar to the other method cross
validation method is used to evaluate the
performance of rae  as it shown in the
following figure the average accuracy of
    is achieved by rae which
outperforms nave bayes by almost     
due to the lack of time we used the same
optimal weight as in     

excellent            service                       thank                                    you   

fianother benefit of rae is that rather than limiting sentiment to a positive negative scale 
multi dimensional distribution over several sentiments can be predicted  this property
could be used to predict whether the merchant is likely to sell the product or not 

conclusion
we used different binary classification models to accurately predict the polarity of the
premium price that a merchant get based on the costumer reviews  our evaluation
shows that rae can predict these distributions more accurately than other models 

acknowledgments
we like to thank richard socher for useful discussions  he was kind of enough to
provide use the simulation code for semi supervised rae
