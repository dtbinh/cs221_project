introduction
hollywood is the land of hunch and the wild guess  litman   ahn  
jack valenti  president and ceo of the motion picture association of america  once mentioned that 
no one can tell you how a movie is going to do in the marketplace not until the film opens in darkened
theatre and sparks fly up between the screen and the audience  valenti        
movie revenue depends on multiple factors such as cast  budget  film critic review  mpaa rating  release
year  etc  because of these multiple factors there is no analytical formula for predicting how much
revenue a movie will generate  however by analyzing revenues generated by previous movies  one can
build a model which can help us predict the expected revenue for a movie  such a prediction could be
very useful for the movie studio which will be producing the movie so they can decide on expenses like
artist compensations  advertising  promotions  etc  accordingly  plus investors can predict an expected
return on investment  also  it will be useful for movie theaters to estimate the revenues they would
generate from screening a particular movie 

data
we obtained our dataset by extracting the relevant information from the internet movie database  imdb  
at first we considered using the existing dataset from maas   al  but this dataset did not contain all the
information that we needed  for this reason we deceloped a python script to go through all the movies in
the database and download two html pages for each movie  the main page  imdb com title movie
id html  and the box office page  imdb com title movie id business html   the data we needed was
spread among those two pages  specifically  the movie genre  each movie belongs to one to three
predefined genres  and release date were taken from the main page  while the total box office revenue 
opening box office revenue  number of theaters on release and budget were taken from the box office
page 
we restricted our search to movies released after january   st       and only included those having total
box office revenue greater than          at first  due to the high variability and incompleteness of the
data for the low revenue movies  we then dropped movies whose revenue was smaller than            
we also removed all movies for which some of the data was not available  typically either the budget or
the number of theaters on release was sometimes missing   our final dataset included      movies  in the
implementation of our different algorithms  we used hold out cross validation to estimate testing error  we
randomly selected     of the dataset to do the training and tested the algorithm on the remaining     
to take into account the inflation rate  and the fact that for this reason more recent movies will find it
easier to perform better  we adjusted the global box office revenue  the opening week end revenue and the
budget by dividing the values by the average price of a movie ticket on the year the movie was released
and multiplying by the current average movie ticket price  this is somewhat of an approximation for

fiadjusting the budget  since the budget is depending on real inflation and not just movie ticket inflation 
but we are taking these to be similar   for reference  the average movie ticket price has increased by more
than     between      and today 

algorithms
linear regression
we first implemented a linear regression algorithm  with the first week end revenue  budget and number
of theaters on opening week as our parameters  the output of the algorithm is the global box office
revenue 
the average testing error for this algorithm was around          
the testing error plots show that the performance of the linear regression is very good for movies having
high global revenue  and also in general high first week end revenue  number of theaters and budget   we
have error of less than      on these  for movies with low global revenue however  the testing error is
sometimes very high  more than       in cases  lower revenue movies will require more sophisticated
algorithms and more data to be analyzed better

from the plots of the training data  we also notice that while the global revenue is a strong linear function
of the first week end revenue  and also a linear function of the budget  with somewhat more noise   the
global revenue is not really linear in the third parameter  the number of theaters  we can in fact roughly
distinguish two regions from the plot of global revenue versus number of theaters  a low revenue region
and a high revenue region  therefore we decided to separate the data between these two regions and to
run a linear regression and all subsequent algorithms separately on the two datasets 

fik means clustering
we separated the data using k means clustering with two clusters  using only the number of theaters as
our dataset for this algorithm 
using this method  we find a testing error of around        for the cluster corresponding to movies
released in a larger number of theaters  and an error of around          for the cluster corresponding to
movies released in a low number of theaters

regression on the   clusters separately

weighted linear regression
although the global box office revenue has quite a linear variation with the first weekend revenue  its
relation with budget and the number of screens is not exactly linear  to account for the nonlinearities  we
decided to use a locally weighted linear regression model  in this model a separate hypothesis is made for
each test sample with higher weights attached to the training data points which are closer to this particular
test sample  the weighting factors are chosen according to

the bandwidth parameter  is chosen to minimize the mean testing error  the local weighting generally
improves the accuracy of our prediction 

polynomial regression
because the relation with budget and the number of screens is not exactly linear  we also used polynomial
regression to account for the nonlinearities  we performed polynomial regression for order     and   
from the results  we can see that overall  polynomial regression of order   provides the smallest mean
error for total dataset  and high number of movie theaters

table    prediction errors for the different algorithms

from the results above  we observe that no specific method performed well for all three types of datasets 
we observed that the higher the number of theaters  the more accurate the prediction  this is because the
correlation between revenue  number of theaters  and budget is usually much better for movies that
released on high number of theaters 

genre separation
intuitively  it is easy to see that movies from different genres will perform differently in the theaters  for
this reason we split our data according to genre  and ran our regression models for each data subset
separately

number of theaters 

figure    mean error for each genre  cluster with lower
number of theaters 

genre separation improved the accuracy for some subsets  especially for the movies which released on
more number of theaters  however for subsets which did not have enough samples  the accuracy
worsened  the third and fourth order polynomials over fit the data for some genres  resulting in high
testing errors  these outliers were excluded from the plots 

ficonclusion
by combining k means clustering to separate the dataset between low release and high release movies
and separating the genres to take into account the diversity of movies  we managed to significantly
improve the prediction accuracy using polynomial regression and weighted linear regression  in some
cases it is possible to predict total revenue with accuracy better than      however  some genres did not
have enough samples in our dataset  making prediction for these genres very difficult  moreover  even for
the genres that we could train on  the low release movies cluster failed to perform well on average in
every single case  it is worth noting that the information available for these smaller movies might not be
fully accurate  adding some element of noise to the dataset 
in order to improve the predictions  attempting to separate the data along more than two clusters might be
useful  however since this also reduces the number of available training examples for each subset  the
performance increase will be limited  also  the models can be improved by taking into account a lot of
other factors  like the movie cast  the movies release date  i e  whether the movie released during holiday
season  etc    the movies competition when it released  etc  another step further could consist of
considering the specificities of foreign movies  and of foreign markets
