abstract
this paper explores applications of machine learning to analyzing media bias  we seek patterns in event coverage
and headlines across different news sources  for headline wording  we first validate the existence of informative
trends by examining the performance of multinomial naive bayes and svm classification in mapping titles to news
sources  we then perform keyword analysis to determine which words are most indicative of certain news sources 
in event coverage  we use unsupervised clustering techniques to profiles news sources by the events covered  we vary
the scope of our analysis from global news to israel and palestine from      to      and israel during the summer
of       we were able to observe meaningful trends in both headline key words and event coverage and are excited
about this methodology as an objective lens to the analysis of media bias 

 

problem and background

in cognitive science  bias is defined as deviation from the norm  or true value      media bias can refer to deviating
coverage amounts across event types or skewed representation of the events  because news sources have authority
and influence over popular opinion  this bias incredibly important to monitor 
previous work has examined geographical overreporting  variation in event coverage promptness  differences in
writing style readability  and variation in intensity of coverage  other work examines biased adjectives and utilizes
natural language processing to understand bias in writing style  mladenic examines networks of cross referencing
between news sources and news providers to understand which voices news sources are choosing to represent  we
adopt a naive bayes model for keyword analysis   discerning the words most indicative of which source is reporting
about a certain topic  for example  leban used keyword analysis to study bias across a variety of subjects  including
the conflict in crimea 
media bias affects all stages of news publishing  because headlines most affect the general consumer  we focus
on wording and event selection  cherry picking or selection bias  

 

data

for the data for this project we use the eventregistry org api     event registry  er  collects news articles from
rss feeds of over         news sources around the world  er also clusters groups of articles into events based on
location and article content  these er clusters will be referred to as event in the rest of this paper 
most data analysis was conducted with the scikit learn python machine learning framework

headlines

for an initial phase of the project  we used the event registry api to curate over         article headlines for articles
published by the top twenty news websites  as ranked by alexa web traffic metrics  between      and       the
results of applying keyword analysis to this dataset were used as a baseline for our main goal of applying a similar
analysis to media surrounding the israel palestine conflict 
for the second phase of the project  we used the event registry api to curate over       articles  focused specifically on the israel palestine conflict  for this dataset    news sources were selected specifically for their collective
propensity to provide a wide range of opinions on the conflict 
for both the baseline and primary datasets  naive bayes and svm models were trained to predict the news organization that published an article  given the headline of the article  article headlines were preprocessed using a
combination of scikit learns count vectorizer and tf idf transfomer tools 

   

events

to study event selection bias  we gathered data for     events related to israel between june  st and september
  th        the data included       news sources  all news sources were used to normalize vector norms but only
the top      by total number of articles  were clustered 

 

methodology

   

headlines

multiclass naive bayes and svm models were trained on the dataset described in section    attempting to predict
the news organization that published a given article based on the headline of that article  accuracy of these classifiers
was used as an indicator of the feasibility of pursuing keyword analysis  under the hypothesis that the existence of
observable trends in data would lend itself to worthwhile results under keyword analysis   accuracy statistics can
be found in section     
having verified the existence of observable trends in data  we generate for each unique pairing of token and news organization a measure of indicativeness  or how representative the given token is of article headlines produced by a given
news organization  we note that the naive bayesian model generates probabilities of the form p  token   news outlet  
using these  we can calculate indicativeness for each pairing of token and news outlet 

indicativeness   log

p  token   news outlet 
p  token   not news outlet 



a summary of the most indicative keywords for each news organization can also be found in section     

   

events

we tested the hypothesis that there exists systematic event selection bias which would allow us to create meaningful
profiles of news sources 
we examined three models for news sources  coverage propensity   vector of number of articles covering each
event  event cherry picking   vector of binaries indicating whether each event was covered  and normalized propensity
vectors  a pca plotting the     most common news sources under the three models is presented in figure

gaussian mixture models and hierarchical clustering models resulted in similar outlet profiles and so we proceeded with knn

while we included traditional reputation for each news source for context  these are understandably subjective
qualities and do not reflect the opinions of the writers  these labels reflect what we believe to be general public
opinion 

   

events

we polled    stanford students with varying degrees of familiarity with the news sources and events to rank   knn
clusters of news sources based on the intergroup coherency and insight  each proposed clustering was given a score
from   to     the results  normalized per respondent mean and variance  are shown in the table below 

event frequency

article frequency based clustering was quite unpopular as it clustered local news outliers into very small clusters and
lumped together the remaining sources  this behavior also emerged  to a lesser extent  with event binomials  event
binomials with fewer clusters and normalized vectors with more clusters were the most popular 
respondents most preferred clustering normalized event vectors into   groups  which produces the following

conclusions

we believe that word counts and event coverage profiling can serve as a highly objective lens for the study of media
bias  common approaches in nlp  such as quantifying inflammatory adjectives or the readability of text undoubtedly
introduce bias and are hard to generalize across new languages  this type of analysis could hold news sources more
accountable than one fraught with subjective metrics 
the results of headline keyword analysis proved particularly interesting  and we observe that the keywords judged
to be most indicative of various news outlets display significant correlation with the established political leanings of
each outlet  additionally  the results seen here prompt new and more exciting questions and applications surrounding
this research  several immediately apparent next steps include a rigorous evaluation of the idea of indicativeness
 and an analysis how best to compute this metric   an expansion and cleansing of the dataset  which was subject to
the limitations of the eventregistry api   and an exploration of practical applications of these trends 
interesting trends emerged in events clustering  although the model is quite naive  for example  the clustering
on page   groups newspapers stereotypically geared towards israelies and jewish americans  cluster     palestinian
and irish british sources  cluster    and liberal german and american news sources  cluster     we believe that
more meaningful clusters can be generated by adding features such as event categories keywords 
much of the inspiration for this research came as a result of the authors own experiences with the so called
echo chamber effect  in which an individual consumes only media that validate his or her views  in attempting to
classify news outlets based on their political leanings and biases  one potential application of this research would be
to generate a set of news sources representing a comprehensive span of opinions on a given issue  such an application
would hopefully promote a greater awareness of the intricacies of important issues  and facililate a more objective 
productive discussion surrounding them
