abstractautomated jellyfish classification and orientation
determination can be used to improve the robustness of an
autonomous jelly tracking system  a set of training images
were segmented and augmented with orientation data  and a
feature vector was generated for each image  an svm was then
trained to estimate a jellys orientation  in simulations on unseen
test images  the approach was able to correctly determine the
orientation of a jellyfish to within    in     of cases  this
is improved to within    in     of cases on a training set 
the algorithm was successful at categorizing the  d angle of the
jelly out of the image plane  and in certain cases was also able
to distinguish between a jelly and a foreign object in the image
frame

i ntroduction

research performed at the monterey bay aquarium research institute  mbari  on gelatinous marine animals  commonly known as jellyfish  abbreviated jellies here  frequently
requires that observations be taken over a long period of time 
this is typically done using a remotely operated vehicle
 rov  driven by a human pilot  but the concentration required
to continually deliver precise thruster control can be tiring for
the pilot     a semi autonomous pilot aid for jelly tracking
has been demonstrated to greatly reduce fatigue  allowing
observation runs to last as long as    minutes     farther in the
future  a more robust tracking system could eventually allow
a fully automated autonomous underwater vehicle  auv  to
follow jellies over many hours or days  collecting valuable data
in all different environmental conditions 
the pilot aid system previously tested at mbari relies
on stereo vision and blob tracking techniques  to differentiate
between jellies and the surrounding ocean  a grayscale image
is first thresholded to detect all light colored blobs     after
filtering the blobs by pixel area to eliminate marine snow  each
jelly is tracked by the coordinates of the blob centroid  basic
target recognition is performed by monitoring the apparent size
of the blob and its distance from the camera  enabling the
system to continue tracking the target in a few cases where
other objects entered the frame     a control law uses this
information along with a dynamic model of the vehicle to
attempt to maintain the relative position between the rov and
the jelly  however  no attempt has been made to date to account
for the dynamics and motion of the jelly itself 
past experiments demonstrated that many of the tracking
failures occurred either due to the target moving out of the
camera frame  or else from a loss of target recognition when
other animals pass near the jelly          machine learning
techniques offer the possibility to improve the robustness of
the system in both areas  in the first case  machine learning
algorithms can estimate the orientation of the jelly in the

fig     sample paraphyllina image  mbari  

image  allowing the control law to account for its potential
future motion  jellyfish are able to accelerate  swim  and
change orientations  but in general at any given time will move
only in an axial direction  therefore  if a machine learning
algorithm is able to supply an orientation estimate  the rov
will be able to follow the path of a jelly even if it leaves
the camera frame  the angle of the jelly from the vertical
direction is critical to know the direction that the cameras
should pan if the target is lost  however  a  d orientation
estimate is also desired because the cameras can lose track of
the jelly if it gets too close  therefore  an angle into or out of
the image plane would help predict if the rov will need to
advance or back up  similarly  machine learning also offers the
possibility of improving the target tracking algorithms to reject
other objects that enter the camera frame  by matching the
features of the target jelly against a library of similar animals
 or the same jelly at earlier times   the system would be able
to continue following the target even after interferences that
ended previous experiments    
this project presents several new machine learning techniques to improve the robustness of the jelly tracking system 
first  machine learning can be used to improve the segmentation processes used to isolate the target in an image frame 
an algorithm to autonomously estimate the  d orientation
of a jelly is also outlined  to demonstrate the technique  a
single genus   paraphyllina   was selected due to its clear
axial features  figure     mbari supplied a set of several
hundred images from past rov dives showing paraphyllina in
various orientations  this database is split into a set of training
images and     test images  and cross validation is used to
demonstrate the applicability of the method to new  unseen
jelly images  the algorithm uses several techniques to generate
a feature vector for each image  which can then be used in a

fifig     jelly orientation  a manual estimate of the jellys
orientation is shown in red  the estimated orientation for this
example is     category    with a depth of    

fig     the orientation is bucketed into one of    categories 
     for the in plane angle from vertical  and       for the
 d out of plane angle 

standard multi class classification scheme to categorize the  d
orientation of the jelly  finally  the same feature vectors can
be used to distinguish between jelly and non jelly objects in a
frame to isolate the traget and reliably track it in a wide range
of environments 

routine that finds the centroid and area of each light region in
the image  all blobs with an area below a preset minimum are
rejected to eliminate marine snow  and the largest remaining
blob is stored as the jelly

a  image processing
mbari provided a set of several thousand images of jellies
taken from previous research dives  after sorting the images
and removing any with a target too small or out of focus 
    usable images of paraphyllina in various orientations
remained  this training set was augmented by rotating each
image by            and     to provide additional orientations on which to train the algorithm  for a total database of
m       images  orientation data was manually added to
each image by drawing an estimate of the jellys axis on the
frame  and an estimated depth angle was entered as either     jelly pointed directly away from camera                  or
    jelly pointed directly towards the camera   figure     the
angle data for each image was then bucketed into    categories
     each  plus out of frame and into frame  see figure    
and stored as a matrix showing the true orientation for the
image

two separate image segmentation methods were tested for
comparison  first  a threshold based blob detection algorithm
similar to     was implemented in matlab  the image was
converted to grayscale  and all pixels below an individuallytuned threshold were considered background and discarded 
the thresholded image was then passed to a blob detection

this technique works well for a large number of images 
such as figure    however  by converting the image to
grayscale at the start  this method effectively discards twothirds of the usable information in the frame  in certain
situations  the brightness of the jelly pixels can be very close to
the intensity of the surrounding ocean  and color is actually a
much better indicator  for this reason  an alternative segmentation technique based on machine learning was also tested 
in this method  an expectation maximization  em  algorithm
is used on the full color image to model the pixel colors as
being drawn from two separate probability distributions  one
corresponding to the jelly  and the other for the ocean   every
pixel color is treated as a point in  d space  and the algorithm
finds a mean and covariance for the two distributions  finally 
each pixel is assigned a label based on the likelihood of it being
drawn from either distribution  figure   shows the red and blue
pixel values  along with the two probability distributions found
by the em algorithm  there is still an ambiguity in determining
which of the two distributions corresponds to the jelly  this
ambiguity can be overcome using prior knowledge  such as the
fact that the ocean pixels have more blue content  or the fact
that the jelly almost always occupies fewer than half of the
pixels in a frame  finally  once the pixels have been labeled
and the background pixels discarded  the same blob tracking
method can be used to remove marine snow and isolate the
jelly  figure   shows a comparison of the thresholded and
em based segmentation methods 
b  orientation classification
to train a classifier to recognize the orientation of a jelly 
each image i must be represented as a feature vector i
that describes the elements of the image  this feature vector
can be generated in several ways  in the first method  the
images are first sorted by their orientation category  several
thousand features are then generated for each image using the

fi a 

fig     red and blue content of all pixels in a sample
image  blue points were categorized by the em algorithm
as background  and red points were categorized as jelly 
contour lines for the two probability distributions are also
shown 

speeded up robust features  surf  algorithm  however  not
all features generated from surf will be useful for orientation
prediction  therefore  the k means algorithm is used to reduce
the number of features across all categories and find the
features most highly associated with the jellies orientation 
the k means approach reduces the feature set to a     element
vector for each image 
once the feature vectors i have been generated by the
k means algorithm  an svm is trained on the data  cross
validation is used to ensure that the model is not overfitting
the training data  the set of     images is divided with    
in a training set and     in the test set  using a one vsall approach  a hypothesis function hk  x i      kt  x i   
is trained on this training set  the svm produces a vector
k for each of the    orientation categories  to make a
prediction for an image x i    the margin for each category
k is calculated  the algorithm ultimately selects the category
with the highest probability as the most likely orientation 
kprediction   argmaxkt  x i    
k

an alternative approach to image classification relies on
neural networks  for comparison with the procedure outlined
above  a neural network was trained using matlabs neural
network toolbox on the thresholded images  with no orientation data   this neural network generated a    element feature
vector i describing each image  a softmax function then
uses this set of features  along with the orientation data y
to make a classification prediction  to improve the features
generated for each image  the neural network can then finetuned with a second pass using the prediction errors from the
first softmax function  similar to the approach above  the most
likely orientation category is returned 
either method outlined above can also be extended to
other aspects of the jelly tracking system  for example  when
a second object enters the image frame  the algorithm can
estimate which of the two is a jelly by attempting to predict an
orientation for both  the algorithm will have higher confidence
for the object with features most similar to the training images 
therefore  this single classifier can serve as a rudimentary
approach to differentiating between multiple objects in a frame
simply by comparing the orientation probabilities for each

a  image processing
the em based image segmentation technique was highly
successful at differentiating between the jelly and the surrounding ocean  figure   shows an example where thresholding removed a significant portion of the jelly features  and still failed
to completely remove the background  the em approach 
on the other hand  removed all of the background without
significantly affecting the jelly  the downside is that the em
algorithm required significantly more time to run since it had
to perform up to    iterations on thousands of pixels  however 
this would not necessarily be a significant problem in practice
since the color distribution does not change significantly from
one frame to the next  the em algorithm could therefore be
run only once every few seconds to generate new estimates for
the mean and covariance  and simply use the previous values
for each frame in between 
other image processing techniques also helped increase
the classification accuracy  as figure   shows  the strongest
features generated by the surf algorithm are on the tentacles
of the jelly and not on its body  however  these tend to be
poor predictors of orientation since the tentacles can point in
arbitrary directions  removing the tentacles from the image
using matlabs imerode   and imdilate   commands on the
segmentation mask increased the accuracy of the classifier by
roughly     
b  orientation classification
the k means approach was successful at categorizing the
jelly orientation for most images  when applied to the training
data  the algorithm categorized the orientation correctly for

removed 

fig     training images confusion matrix 

    of the images  the classifier also performed well on
the test set  correctly classifying     of the images  more
importantly still  even in situations when the classifier made
an error  it tended not to predict orientations too far from the
correct class  in many cases  determining the exact orientation
of the jelly is less important than knowing the quadrant in
which it is likely to be found if it leaves the frame  therefore 
a jelly that the classifier labels as being in an adjacent category
may also be considered successful  for example  if the true
jelly orientation is in the    to    category  but the
classifier labels it as    to      the camera still knows the
approximate direction in which it should pan  so the label may
be considered a partial success  by this measure  the classifier
was successful on       of the training images and     of
the test images 
the  d category prediction was also relatively successful 
although it had significantly fewer images on which to train
since it wasnt possible to increase the data set by rotating
these images  the out of plane angle is difficult to measure
even for a human observer  so the  d classifier focused simply
on categorizing jellies pointed almost directly into or out of
the plane  such as figure    rather than trying to estimate
an exact angle  this is still useful information for the control
system  though  since the rov may need to move to the side in
situations where the jelly is pointed directly towards it to avoid
making contact and disturbing the jelly  using this measure 
the classifier was successful at categorizing the  d angle for
    of images  note that in this case the data set was too small
to split into a complete training and test set  so the accuracy
is only reported for the training set 
extending the k means svm classifier to other problems
was somewhat successful  in test cases where the orientation
svm was used to differentiate between a jelly and a nonjelly object  for example  a piece of seaweed   the prediction
confidence was significantly higher for the jelly  so the method

fig     test images confusion matrix 

would be able to reject the other object  however  when comparing an image of paraphyllina with some other type of jelly 
the classifiers confidence in the orientation prediction was a
poor indicator of which jelly to follow  many other factors 
such as lighting  view angle  and distance  tended to have more
of an effect on margin than the type of jelly  therefore  while
simply comparing the confidence in an orientation prediction
might have some value for rejecting foreign objects  a second
classifier trained to distinguish between the target jelly and
alternate marine animals would be more effective
the algorithm was also able to classify the orientation

fiusing the alternative neural network approach  in general 
though  this did not perform as well as the previous method 
a neural network trained with a softmax function and finetuned with back propagation determined the correct labeling
for     of the training set  but only     of the test set 
using the within one category criteria  the neural network was
successful at labelling     of the training set and     of
the test set  besides being less accurate than the k means
approach  the neural network also has the disadvantage that it
does not generate a useful feature vector and instead operates
as a black box that simply inputs an image and returns a
predicted class  attempts to train a classifier using a feature
vector output by the neural network were not successful  an
svm trained on these feature vectors only achieved    
accuracy  this is better than random chance       but it is
not accurate enough for practical classification  this limits the
usefulness of the approach since it can no longer be extended
to other aspects of the jelly tracking problem

the main task remaining is to fully implement the algorithm to classify jelly orientations from video frames in real
time  this is necessary before the approach can be tested on
an rov for use in a control architecture  the image encoder
can be stored  so it does not need to re run the full k means
analysis for each new image  the trained svm can also be
stored  which should speed up the process enough to take
place in near real time  while further improvements to the test
image classifier accuracy are desirable  the current architecture
offers enough accuracy to deal with the relatively rare failure
scenarios in the existing control system 
there are several avenues that could also be explored
to improve the current classification scheme  for example 
the classifier could be extended to take previous orientations
into account  since jellies usually do not move very quickly 
cases with low prediction confidence could be improved by
considering a previous estimate with higher margin and using
that data to guide the prediction  another approach would
be to attempt to directly model the orientation of a jelly
from the feature set without reducing it into discrete buckets 
this has the advantage of allowing for a loss function that
heavily penalizes orientation estimates farther from the true
orientation  following this approach could potentially improve
the number of images correctly classified in the within onecategory region 
finally  a second classifier could be implemented to help
distinguish between a target jelly and other objects that may
enter the frame  this will require modifying the blob tracking
algorithm to follow multiple objects  but otherwise the approach is identical to the orientation classification technique
demonstrated here  once a specific type of jelly has been
targeted  a classifier trained to recognize that genus could be
used to reject all other animals that enter the frame  using
this approach  a single routine will ultimately be able to take
in a new image  classify it as target other  estimate the  d
orientation of the jelly  and then pass all this information to
the controller to enable a highly robust tracking system

using a training set of images  two methods for segmenting the image to isolate the jelly have been implemented 
a grayscale threshold based approach was functional for a
majority of the images  but an approach that uses the em
algorithm to estimate the mean and covariance of the color
distributions was demonstrated to be more effective  this
method had a slower run time  but had the advantage of being
able to distinguish between the target and the background for
darker images where thresholding failed 
machine learning techniques were also effective for estimating the orientation of a jelly from an image  by training
an svm on features generated using surf and k means
algorithms  the approach was able to correctly classify the
orientation for     of training images and     of test images 
the  d angle out of the plane was also included in the data 
and the classifier successfully distinguished between jellies
pointed towards  away  and normal to the camera  finally  the
classifier was able to roughly distinguish between jellies and
other objects using the confidence in its orientation predictions 
a neural network approach was also implemented  but it was
significantly less accurate than this method and therefore will
not be pursued further 
once implemented on an rov  these improvements will
make a significant difference to the robustness of the jelly
tracking system  the new image segmentation technique could
allow an existing control architecture to get a more accurate
estimate of the position and shape of the jelly  allowing for
better tracking as outlined in      an orientation estimate
generated using this algorithm will then allow for a more
advanced control law that can take the jellys current and
projected motion into account  finally  a method to distinguish
between the target and other objects would also fix the failure
modes that ended several of the previous tracking trials  all
together  these improvements could dramatically increase the
observation time of the jelly tracking system and provide
unprecedented data for marine scientists
