introduction

political scientists have done extensive research on the mindsets of democrats  republicans  and independents 
and have developed several theories as to why individuals identify as each  for instance  they have posited
that pure independents are distinct from partisans and weak independents in their political attitudes
 magleby       
in this project  we focus on self identified independents  who comprised    percent of americans in     
and have a diversity of attitudes  our goal is to identify features that predict who is independent  we are
interested in these features in their own right  in order to understand the mindset of independents  as well
as in order to build an effective model 

 

data

we use data from the american national election studies  anes   which surveyed americans political
attitudes from      to the present  this survey is the gold standard in political science and contains       
observations and     attributes  we use only responses from       in order to have comparable and consistent
measures of each feature  resulting in a training set with       people and    attributes   please see our
github repository for all of our code 

 
   

algorithms
principal components analysis

the goal of principal components analysis  pca  is to represent the data with fewer dimensions  reducing
noise in the data and capturing directions in which the data vary  for instance  one component identified
might correspond to having a positive disposition  or distrusting the government 
we first ran pca on the data with all    numeric features  the primary two components capture a
considerable amount of variance related to political identity  that is  the first two components can be used
to separate democrats from republicans  but independents are similar to both democrats and republicans
 partisans  in terms of these components  please see the figures below  which shows individuals distribution
along the primary two components for the full data set  left  and for democrats and republicans alone  right  
we next ran pca on subsets of the data including only features relating to individuals warmth to
certain people and groups and towards certain issues  respectively  the first subset includes measures such
as how warmly individuals feel towards black people and congress  while the latter includes measures such
as support for abortion legalization and welfare spending  these components were even less effective at
capturing variation in party identity  as is to be expected 
  certain analyses use smaller subsets  due to algorithms particular constraints  for instance  principal components analysis
requires numerical features  for which reason we include only    features when conducting principal components analysis

factor analysis

in order to verify that warmth features and attitudes to political issues are two core types of features  we
ran factor analysis on a subset of the data with only these features  we confirmed that warmth features
load similarly to one another on the two factors estimated  in relation to issues features  the plot above
 right  shows how warmth and issues features loaded onto the two factors  with warmth features shown in
blue and issues features shown in red  warmth features are more positively related to factor   than are
issues features  indicating that they are a different type of feature  and that analyzing these feature sets
separately is appropriate 

   

k means

we theorized that it might be possible to split political independents into a number of different groups
based on their political ideologies  the anes dataset has two types of political ideology features  issues and
political thermometers  issues features involve questions such as when should abortion be allowed  always 
sometimes  or never  political thermometers ask respondents to rate their warmth towards groups such
as blacks  big business  and labor unions on a      point scale  we ran k means for each feature group 
 

fitrying cluster sizes between   and    and plotting their inertia  we created   clusters for each features set 
resulting in clusters displayed below using t sne 
we next identified the clusters with the greatest number of independents  for the political thermometer
k means  the cluster with the largest percentage of independents was a a cluster of people who had negative
opinions of every single group asked about     percent independent   and the second largest was a cluster
of people who mostly felt neutral towards all groups asked about     percent independent   for the issues
k means  the clusters with the largest percentages of independents were social conservatives fiscal liberals
 left christians   and social liberals   fiscal conservatives  libertarians

note that though the aforementioned clusters contained the most independents  they did not contain
overwhelming majorities 

   

hypotheses

based on these results  we theorized that independents would be relatively more likely to fall into one of four
groups  pessimists  moderates  left christians  and libertarians  we conducted a t test for each of
these criteria and compared the percentage of independents and partisans in each category  we found that
independents were more likely to be moderates  left christians  and libertarians  but not left christians 
 
in fact  we found that about     of independents fit in to at least one of the first three groups  compared
  using

a     confidence level 

 

fito     of democrats  and     of republicans  this difference is statistically significant result but does not
enable high confidence classification of individuals party identity 

   

boosting

principal components analysis and k means clustering suggest that individuals political attitudes and
warmth towards particular groups only partially explain their political identities  for this reason we
use boosting with decision stumps to sift through our data and determine which features best predict
independence  we ran       iterations of boosting with a logistic loss function on a training set with      
observations and    attributes  we specified an interaction depth of    meaning that two  and three way
interactions are included  we find that error on the validation set is smallest at     iterations  after which
the model begins to overfit  we next ran boosting with an exponential loss function  which had the lowest
validation error at     iterations 
boosting with logistic and exponential loss functions resulted in very similar rankings of features  both
identified state as the feature with the most relative influence  whose inclusion in the model most reduced
the loss across all iterations  other influential features are how interested the individual is in the presidential
election  whether he or she voted  and how warmly he or she feels towards congress 
because state seems to be highly related to political identity  we mapped states percentage of independents
in       please see our interactive map online  in which you can choose which year and political party you
would like to view  overall  it seems that a few states have particularly high proportions of independents 
including colorado and new hampshire  however  please keep in mind that our sample size is not very
large    so this relationship may be largely due to noisy data 

   

logistic regression

having identified key features that are most useful for predicting whether an individual identifies as an
independent  we build a logistic regression classifier using several feature sets  first  we estimate models
with the principal components we found  with the factors we found  and with only warmth or issues features 
next  we estimate a model with all features  as well as models with only the ten most influential features
identified by our boosting models  coefficients from the logistic regression model including the top ten
features from boosting with a logistic loss function are shown below  it seems that people who are less
interested in national elections are less likely to be independent  as are people who voted in the past national
election

fiwe compared the error rates for logistic regression models with each feature set  as shown below  all
models performed similarly poorly  severely underestimated the percentage of independents when evaluated
on the training set  this is likely because our features only explain a very small portion of the variance
in political identity  and incorrectly estimating that someone is independent is more expensive than
estimating that they are partisan  given how rarely individuals are independent  that is  the safe bet is
to classify every individual as independent and only predict independence given an overwhelming amount
of evidence

however  our models estimated approximately the correct proportion of independents on the test set  as
random noise in the new data caused our model to estimate false positives just as often as false negatives 
this is to be expected and is reassuring in a sense  as our models will not drastically underestimate the
proportion of independents in unseen data 

 

conclusions and limitations

we find that classifying independents based on their political philosophies is very difficult and prone to high
error rates  nonetheless  we find that independents are more likely to be moderate  pessimistic  and or
libertarian than partisans  and are more likely to be from certain states 
although we feel that this analysis is somewhat informative  we also feel that we must be very cautious
when interpreting our results  in addition  we feel it is important to keep in mind that analyses involving   
attributes include only individuals who answered    questions completely  in our case  that means including
only       out of       survey respondents and hoping that these       are representative of the entire
sample  and ideally the entire united states population   also  we only looked at a single year in our
study  according to professor morris fiorina  independents often change whether they classify themselves
as leaners or true independents between election years  our analysis of independents might be tied to
the specific circumstances of
