learning online dating preferences from neuroimaging data
mira nencheva

i  introduction
a  why study online dating 
what is it about a person that makes you want to approach
them  with the rise of online dating websites  for many the
approach has changed from walking across a crowded bar
to sliding ones finger across a cell phone screen to indicate
ones interest in dating  the initial question about how we
make these split second judgments about the desirability
of a partner has changed as well  as our judgments are
often solely based on photographs with minimal additional
information  while studies have shown that our judgments
on paper  from merely looking at the online dating profile
of an individual  more often than not fail to predict how
much we like them in person  finkel et al          millions
of online dating users are doing the initial selection of who
to contact precisely in this rapid fashion  since       the
population of online dating users has grown significantly 
according to unofficial reports  tinder  a popular dating
app  has over    million users  tinder reports that since
their launch in      their app has matched more than   
million people and that theirs users make billions of decisions
every day about whether they are interested in potentially
meeting someone by swiping right or left  online dating is
changing the dating world  and it is becoming more and more
important to understand the specific mechanisms of mate
selection that are in place in the unique social environment
of online dating websites 
b  goal  predicting choice in online dating from target
features and individual differences
the choice to contact a partner in online dating involves
two sets of factors  those relating to the individual making
the decisions  or individual variations in preferences  and
those characterizing the target of the decision  or target
features   one interest is in developing better algorithms for
online dating websites to recommend potential matches to
their users  if we understand how to accurately predict a
given users ideal partner choices  we could help them find
someone they like much faster  in this study  i aim to use both
target features and individual differences to predict users
choices to contact a given partner in online dating or not 
c  why is asking users what the are looking for not enough 
how does one measure a users partner preferences  one
way is to simply ask a user what qualities they would want
their ideal partner to have  ideal partner preferences   or to
state how important different traits of a potential partner are
for their decision  i will refer to this as stated preferences  
wood   brumbaugh        for example asked participants

to indicate how important a set of characteristics were in
how attractive they found people  they labeled this as direct
preference measure    then they asked participants how
attractive they found    people based on their photos  they
labeled this as revealed preferences   they found that across
all groups of participants  which included participants of
different genders  sexual orientations and ethnicities  revealed preferences were not strongly correlated with direct
preference measures 
d  neural activation as a measure of individual preferences
neuroscience may offer another individual differences
measure  namely  how the brain responds to the photographs
of different potential partners  for many years scientists have
been interested in neural processes that help us make decisions  over the past few decades  a large body of studies using methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging
 fmri  in humans  as well as electrophysiological recording 
electrical and optogenetic stimulation  and pharmacological
inhibition in animal models  has implicated the dopaminergic
system of the brain as essential for estimating the expected
value of a choice in diverse decision tasks  specifically 
research suggests that ventral striatal activity  and nucleus
accumbens or nacc activity in particular  correlates with
the value of anticipated rewards  see fig     similar to the
economic notion of expected value  breiter et al       
knutson et al         and can predict choice  e g   knutson
  greer        
consistent with the notion that the dopaminergic system
plays a critical role in initiating motivated behavior  multiple
studies have shown activity in dopamine projection areas
such as the striatum and ventral tegmental area related to
love  aron et al        cacioppo et al        ortigue et al 
      fisher et al         and sexual desire  buhler et al 
      cacioppo et al        hamann et al        hanes et al 
       both cacioppo et al         in a large meta analysis
of neuroimaging studies on love and desire  and aron et
al         suggested that in addition to striatal regions  the
insula was commonly tracked feelings of love and desire 
while there is a large body of research on attraction
and early stage romantic love  how people initially select
a romantic partner remains an open question  cooper et 
al        attempted to answer this question in the context
of speed dating  prior to attending a series of speed dating
events  participants were asked to rate the attractiveness
of and their dating interest towards a group of potential
partners  some of which they would meet during the speed
dating events  while in a mri scanner  after   speed dating
events  participants submitted their final choices  the inves 

fitigators found that activity in the anterior cingulate cortex 
medial prefrontal cortex  mpfc   and cerebellum scaled with
consensus judgments of attractiveness  based on average
desirability of a person   whereas activity in the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex  dmpfc  tracked individual preferences
and predicted choice to date targets 
ii  data collection and processing
a  stimuli
we recruited    caucasian  females between the ages
of    and    via social media and mailing lists to submit
each two identical photos of themselves  selfies   such that
their face was fully visible  on one of the photos they were
instructed to smile and one the other one they were instructed
to keep a neutral facial expression  the    photos    per
female for the    females  were cropped to ensure that the
size of the face  size of the photo and the resolution of the
photo were the same across photos  the photos were cropped
to a square  so that only the face and part of the hair was in
the photo  we also ensured that the photos were comparable
in brightness 
b  target ratings
on the qualtrics survey site  we recruited a panel of   
caucasian males between the ages of    and    who were
romantically interested in females and not in a committed
relationship at the time  participants were asked to rate how
physically attractive  and how happy each target appeared 
the ratings were on a   point scale  to a very small extent 
to a small extent  to a moderate extent  to a large extent 
each participant only saw one photo per female  therefore 
each photo was rated by    participants   the order of the
photos was randomized for each participant 
c  facial features
i then used the microsoft cognitive services face api
to obtain the coordinates of several important points on the
face of each target  i then estimated   features of the face as
follows 
 nose width  distance between the coordinated of the left
and right side of the root of the nose
 nose length  distance between the root of the nose and
the tip of the nose
 eye length  distance between the inner and outer end of
the eye  calculated for the left eye 
 eye width  distance between the top lid and bottom lid
of the eye  calculated for the left eye 
 eye distance  distance between the inner side of the two
eyes
 upper lip width  distance between the top of the upper
lip and the bottom of the upper lip

fig    

structure of the online dating task for the neuroimaging study 

lower lip width  distance between the top of the lower
lip and the bottom of the lower lip
in addition to these features i also manually scored each
photo on three additional sets of features  hair color  hair
texture  and hairstyle  the hair color feature has three variations  blond  brown and red  each target received a   for
the heir color she had in the photo and   for the other two
colors  similarly  the hair texture feature had two variations 
straight and curly  and the hairstyle feature had two features 
hair up  in a ponytail or a bun  or hair down 


d  task
the online dating task was designed to re create the experience of choosing to contact a partner on an online dating
mobile application  such as tinder while subjects underwent
scanning  during each trial of the task  subjects first saw a
photograph of a female target    s  the cue period   subjects
then indicated whether they wanted to contact that target or
not    s   see fig     the choice period   in data analyses 
negative responses  definitely not contact  probably not
contact  were combined into one category  not contact  
and positive responses  definitely contact and probably
contact  were combined into a second category  contact  
finally  subjects fixated on a cross for a variable intertrial
interval     s  
e  participants

  we

chose to only include caucasian females as targets  because of strong
effects of race on preferences documented in previous research  hitsh et
al        robnett  feliciano         including the effects of race would
have required a much larger database of photos and could have introduced
additional variability that might obfuscate the effects of smiling  which were
the initial focus of the study  we hope to replicate the study in the future
with other combinations of gender  race  and sexual orientation 

we recruited participants for a study on stock markets that
was run prior to the online dating task  twenty three males 
romantically interested in females and between the ages of
   and     average age     also agreed to participate in the
online dating task 

fif  neuroimaging data and regions of interest
magnetic resonance imaging  mri  data was acquired
with a     t general electric mri scanner  i acquired the
standardized  using z scores  mr signal from   regions
of interest  nucleus accumbens  which has been associated
with predicting choice  knutson   greer         early stage
romantic love  aron et al        cacioppo et al       
ortigue et al        fisher et al         and sexual desire
 buhler et al        cacioppo et al        hamann et al 
      hanes et al         anterior insula  which has also been
observed to track feelings of love and desire  cacioppo et al  
      aron et al          medial prefrontal cortex  mpfc  
anterior cingulate cortex  and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
 dlpfc   which were associated in partner choice in a speed
dating study  cooper et  al        and the fusiform gyrus 
which is involved in perceiving faces  mccarthy et  al       
the coordinates of the rois were determined based on
previous meta analyses  knutson   greer        
g  selecting training and testing examples

fig     comparing the effects of bandwidth on the neural  target and
combined models 

i removed all trials in which the participant failed to
respond  as well as trials in which the mr signal in any of
the regions of interest was above   standard deviations from
the average  in order to accurately estimate the testing error
for each model  i performed    iterations  at each randomly
choosing      trials as testing examples  and the remaining
      trials as testing examples  i then report the average
error in classifying the testing examples as contact or not
contact based on the input 

x i   x   measures how similar the input of the example we
are trying to predict to the i th training example  the term
 was determined using stochastic gradient descent on the
training examples  the algorithm outputs    for trials when
it predicts that the subject chose not to contact the female
and    on trials when it predicts the subject chose to contact
the target 

iii  predicting choice from neural
activity and target ratings
a  support vector machine  three models
i trained a kernelized support vector machine  svm  on
three sets of inputs one including only neural data  neural
model   one including only average happiness and attractiveness ratings of the    target photos  target model  and
one including both neural data and target ratings  combined
model   the svm algorithm was adapted from john duchi 
machine learning  cs      supplemental lecture notes  i
used a gaussian kernel function 
 
k x  z    exp    x  z      
 
the prediction for each example was given by the equation 
m
x
 
sign 
exp    x i   x      i  
 
i  

where the x i  s are given by the inputs of the training
examples and the x was given by the input of the example
we are attempting to predict  in the case of the neural model
the input was the signal change from the beginning of the
trial to   s after the onset of the trial  in the case of the
target model  the input was the average attractiveness and
happiness rating that the photo received from the raters
group  in the combined model the input was the combination
of the inputs of the neural and the target models  the term

b  finding the optimal bandwidth
i ran the three svm algorithms  neural  target
and combined  with different bandwidth values    
                                          interestingly the target
model was not significantly affected by the choice of bandwidth  whereas for the neural model the choice of bandwidth
made a dramatic difference  see fig      this is likely
because the neural data is noisier and needs more smoothing 
this is in part because biological signals tend to be noisy 
and in part because the behavioral data comes from average
ratings from    raters  the optimal bandwidth for the neural
model was        at the optimal bandwidth for the
neural model there was no significant difference between the
models  however  the neural model was slightly better  average testing error neural model            average testing
error target model            average testing error combined
model            
the lack of a notable difference between the combined model
and the other two models could suggest that activity in the
  regions of interest is simply a neural representation of the
two features of the target model 
c  removing features from the neural model
in order to see if there is a single region in the brain
 out of the   ones discussed above  that provides especially
important information for predicting choice  i tested the
neural model at bandwidth    while removing each of the

fifig    

eliminating features from the neural model 

regions of interest  removing any one of the regions of
interest did not seem to have a significant effect on the
accuracy of the model  see fig      this is possibly due to
the fact that activity in some of the regions is correlated  and
thus removing a single one of them would be compensated
by the presence of the remaining regions 

fig    

effect of adding photo features to the model 

d  effect of number of features on test error
in order to see whether adding more features to the model
would increase the accuracy of prediction  i sequentially
added one feature at a time in two different orders  the
first order started with the target ratings  followed by the
facial features  see section c in methods  and finally adding
the neural features  the second order started with the neural
features  was then followed by the target ratings and the
facial features last   see fig      adding more facial features
appeared to increase the error  features      for the teal line
and features      for the pink line   this pattern is interesting
and somewhat intuitive  while it might seem that knowing
the exact length of the nose or the size of the eyes of a target
would help us predict the users choice better  including these
characteristics might lead the model to over fit to the target
and discount the valuable information about the individual
preferences of each user  in contract  the neural response and
the attractiveness ratings would not help us to identify which
target the user is making decisions about  however they give
us more information about the preference for that target
 of the individual and of the group   information  which is
arguably more closely linked to choice  including the neural
features with attractiveness and happiness ratings lead to a
smaller testing error            compared to adding the
neural features last 
e  predicting choice  conclusions
while being able to predict a binary outcome with about
    accuracy might seem far from perfect  it is important

fig    

weighted linear regression based on photo features 

to note that we are predicting human decisions about other
humans  quite a few studies of economic decision making 
where it is possible  and in fact quite easy  to come up with
an estimation for the value of each choice  report similar
success rates  therefore  for a social psychology experiment 
where the value of each choice is noisy  and affected by
a large set of unknown individual differences and external
factors      accuracy is quite high  and perhaps as far as
we can go given the data set 
iv  predicting neural signal in response
to target
for the second part of my project i attempted to predict
the signal change in response to seeing a given target photo
using a locally weighted linear regression  i defined my
weights in two ways  in the first model the weights were only
based on the photo features  average ratings on happiness
and attractiveness as well as facial features   whereas in the

fifig     weighted linear regression based on photo features and average
pattern of neural response 

second model the weights were also based on the average
pattern of neural response for the   regions of interest for the
participant the training example came from  to determine the
similarity between the features i used the formula from the
lecture notes  where the weight of the i th training example
was given by 
 x i   x  
 
   
as in the case of svm  the model consisting only of photo
features did best under small bandwidth values  and had
similar performance for larger bandwidth values  see fig 
    again  this is likely due to the fact that photo features
are subject to less noise than the biological signals from the
brain  the model that included neural data for the prediction
did best for a bandwidth value of   for most regions  with
the exception of the dlpfc and the nucleus accumbens 
for which the prediction was most accurate at bandwidth
   overall  the predictions for the model accounting for the
similarity in the average neural response performed slightly
better  see fig     
w i    exp 

v  conclusion
using neural data in predicting choice in online dating
allowed for slightly more accurate predictions than merely
using photo features as previous prediction algorithms had
done  by doing so i was able to account for participants
individual preferences  in addition  introducing similarity
in the average pattern of neural response when predicting
signal in the   regions of interest increased our accuracy of
prediction slightly
