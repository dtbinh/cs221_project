introduction
public interest has become increasingly focused on the role of money in politics  specifically  the citizens
united v  fec supreme court ruling maintained the legality of unrestricted political expenditures by
corporate and union entities  as a result  there has been a proliferation of super pac  or political action
committee  organizations  while these organizations are not permitted to make contributions directly to
campaigns  they may engage in unlimited independent spending and there is no restriction on the amount
of funds they can accept from donors  such legal developments beg the question  can one predict generally
the influence of donors over politicians to whom they give  as the flux of money into the political system
continues to increase  this remains a critical question  our project builds largely on previous research by
poole and rosenthal and makes use of freely available databases of campaign finance information  we aim to
predict quantitative scores of political ideology using campaign contribution profiles  specifically  the input
to our algorithm is a matrix of normalized vectors of campaign contribution data  partitioned by industry 
the learning algorithm used is support vector regression  svr   and the output is a score for each candidate
in the interval        indicating a position on the political ideological spectrum 

related work
the research of poole and rosenthal has focused on quantifying the political ideology of politicians      in
particular  they actively develop methods for calculating ideal points for candidates  for example  the
dw nominate method calculates a legislators overall probability of voting yea on a piece of legislation
as the sum of a deterministic utility value and a normally distributed random error      it calculates ideal
point coordinates for legislators by maximizing the log likelihood function

t   i   j      

where pij t is the probability of voting for choice   yes or no  and cij t     if that probability accurately
predicts the vote      indexes j  i  and t sum over roll call votes  legislators  and legislative sessions  respectively  these ideal points are constrained to lie within the interval        and are two dimensional quantities 
a common interpretation of the first coordinate is that it reflects the divide between the republican and
democratic parties  whereas the second coordinate is more highly correlated with intra party division  it
is important to emphasize that these methods seek to estimate ideal points using roll call voting records 
while a full congressional voting record would be unavailable for candidates who are new to office  campaign
finance data are  ideally  readily available  thus  we think it would be helpful to be able to predict ideal
points for candidates even before they have established a congressional voting record  one could then use
these scores to predict how legislators will vote on particular pieces of legislation and to draw quantitative
comparisons between them 
much previous work has focused on connecting political contributions to specific votes cast in congress    
    furthermore  adam bonica of stanford has developed a correspondence analysis model for predicting
dw nominate scores using data at the resolution of individual contributions to pacs      we think this
approach has the deficiency of being computationally expensive compared to a coarser graining of the space
of contributions  and we posit that we can recover the ideal point of a candidate just by using a contribution
profile partitioned by sector  we have collated freely available campaign finance     and dw nominate

 

fiideal point     datasets  the original scope of our project has been narrowed due to a reduction in the size of
our group  we originally planned to investigate anomalous voting behavior and the ability to predict it solely
by examining campaign finance data  but shifted our focus to training a model to predict dw nominate
ideal point coordinates 

dataset and features
campaign finance data for     candidates  as determined by sampling from the dw nominate scores 
over years             and      were obtained using the open secrets python api      of the available
data  we chose to featurize by sector  for each sector  individual and pac contributions were combined and
normalized on a per candidate basis  this amounted to    features in total  a heatmap of the total feature
set is illustrated below 
we also include a plot of the distribution of dw nominate scores  labeling democrats and republicans using their traditional party colors  we note that the dataset appears linearly separable in the first
dimension of the ideal point coordinates  this suggests that a classification algorithm may effectively distinguish between the parties in case regression algorithm fails to quantitatively capture the distribution of
scores  finally  we note that for each party the second dimension of the dw nominate scores is not as
easily separable and instead spans the interval         this would be a natural extension of the present work

methods
the learning algorithm used in this work was epsilon support vector regression   svr   using a radial basis
function  rbf  kernel  in  svr  a nonlinear function is constructed through the training of a linear function  f  x   in a higher dimensional inner product space defined by a kernel function  k xi   xj      xi  t  xj   
the objective of the function training is to ensure all training data lies within  of all target data  without
supplementary information about a particular data set  sv learning algorithms are consider the best offthe shelf supervised learning algorithm     
given a training set  s     x    y           xn   yn   xi  r    svr can be formulated into the following convex
optimization problem  given here in its primal form

where  x  is the mapping to the higher dimension space  c determines the degree of regularization  lower
c leads to a smoother solution   and     are slack variables which allow for constraint relaxation in the
case it is required  this problem is often simpler to solve in its dual form  derived through the method of
lagrange multipliers

experiments results discussion
we chose a final model after performing a randomized optimization in the space of hyperparameters for
 svr  for multiple kernel types  this required specifying distributions over which to sample the hyperparameters  we specified a separate exponential distribution for each hyperparameter  and estimated the
decay scale of each distribution by first performing an exhaustive grid search over values of the hyperparameters spanning several orders of magnitude  in both the grid and randomized search schemes  the
coefficient of determination  r    was used as the scoring metric for ranking all sampled models and was
estimated for each candidate model using   fold cross validation on a randomly sampled set of training data
that comprised     of the data set  each randomized hyperparameter search proceeded for        iterations

figure    summary of hyperparameters and model scores
the final hyperparameters for the linear and radial basis function  rbf  kernels are summarized in the
table below alongside their corresponding training and test scores  we omit results for the polynomial kernel
because the calculation did not converge and thus results could only be obtained via a cruder randomized
search  we also note that of the best models identified by the randomized search  for each kernel type
there were several distinct sets of hyperparameters that yielded very similar training scores  for the rbf
kernel specifically  the hypermarameters we selected represent a compromise between the values of c and
 

fi  while relatively high values of c correspond to overfitting by overpenalizing large deviations from the
target  constraining c too aggressively would encourage the bandwidth of the kernel function    to expand
and potentially overfit the data  therefore  cross validation is critical in evaluating our final selection 
we find that the rbf kernel is better able to capture the nonlinearities and regional variation of the data
by virtue of its implicit infinite dimensional feature mapping  in order to characterize the performance of
the final model further and to compare it to the linear kernel model  we compute learning curves for both
showing the test score as a function of the fraction of data used for training  deficiencies of the linear kernel
are readily apparent  its score saturates at about      to      within error  while the rbf kernel acheives
    to       within error

in order to evaluate the structure of the feature data set  and gain qualitative insight into our model  principal
component analysis  pca  was performed on the full training set  the top   principal components are
depicted below  along with supplementary data regarding the per party distributions of campaign donations
by sector

it appears the financial and labor sectors specify the dimensions of largest variance  it also appears that
donations from the finance sector are heavily skewed towards republican candidates  while donations from
the labor sector are heavily skewed towards democrats  although svr models are abstract to interpret  this
analysis suggests that these two categories had the largest influence in the prediction of political ideology 

conclusion future work
we found that the support vector regression algorithm with the radial basis function kernel outperformed
all other models  achieving a score of     to       within error  we think the model would have been even
better if we had access to additionl years of data  the nonlinearity of this problem is not especially surprising
given the regional variability of both political ideology and of the contributing industries  we note that the
normalization procedure employed here likely washed out some of the variability  as some candidates surely
received greater amounts of contributions overall compared to others  however  the unnormalized feature matrix was prohibitively costly to fit to  one future direction may be to look at incorporating this variability
in the model  more time could be invested in exploring alternative and more representative normalization
methods  additionally  a way to circumvent the feature set normalization issue would be to use an unsupervised learning algorithm such as a neural network 
had we had an additional group memeber  we would have liked to explore the correlation of anomylous
voting behavior  i e  votes that are not well predicted by dw nominate scores  and a higher resolution
feature set of individual contributions  such an analysis would probably also benefit from further degmentation of donations into personal and pac contributions
