abstract
seismic data helps in better characterization of hydrocarbon reservoirs  however  seismic data is
not perfect  and it is important to measure the reliability of the data  in this project  the reliability of
seismic data is quantified by generating many stochastic realizations of reservoir properties from two
possible geological scenarios of a synthetic hydrocarbon reservoir  forward modeling the seismic data on
each of those realizations using rock physics modeling  extracting features from the seismic data  and then
using classification algorithms to classify a test set of realizations into either geological scenario and
computing the classification success rate 

  introduction
to aid in making better reservoir development decisions like choosing a well location or well
controls  many stochastic models of the reservoir are usually generated conditioned to seismic data 
however  seismic data is not perfect as it has lower resolution than the models used to characterize the
reservoir  and hence many different reservoir models could satisfy a certain seismic dataset      thus  it is
important to estimate the reliability of seismic data and quantify the uncertainty in the decision making
process 
previous work in this field has tried to model the geological scenario from seismic data using
pattern similarity techniques such as multiple points histogram  mph  and discrete wavelet transform
 dwt       however  the reliability of such geological scenario prediction from seismic data has not been
assessed quantitatively  this project aims to quantify the reliability of seismic data in geological scenario
prediction using classification algorithms on forward modeled seismic data 

  modeling the data
single normal equation simulation  snesim      was used to generate     realizations of the
reservoir property  facies  for each of two possible geological scenarios  a channel depositional system
and a deltaic depositional system  two other reservoir properties  porosity and density  were then
simulated using sequential gaussian simulation  sgsim  conditioned on each facies realization  these
realizations approximately define the uncertainty in the reservoir properties that seismic data might help
to reduce  figure     shows a few of the generated realizations for each scenario

then  rock physics modeling was used to generate the elastic properties  acoustic impedance
 ai  and s wave impedance  si   at the same scale as the reservoir properties  i e   the geostatistical scale 
more specifically  the contact cement model was used with a coordination number of    uniform fluid
mixing  cement faction      and clay content        finally  the born filter was applied to these elastic
properties at the geostatistical scale to generate the elastic properties at the seismic scale  which
approximate the data that could be acquired by inverting real field seismic data  figure     shows the
elastic properties at the seismic scale for each geological scenario

fi  extracting features and classification
to train classifiers to predict the geological scenario given the data  some characteristic features
for each scenario need to be extracted from the data  since the geological scenario influences the global
characteristics of the models  the selected features should capture the global heterogeneity in the data 
rather than the local heterogeneity such as the point to point euclidean distances  the  d fourier
transform was selected as the feature reflecting the global spatial heterogeneity  but since the  d fourier
transform of the very high dimensional data is also very high dimensional  a multi dimensional scaling
 mds  was performed on the  d fourier transform  and only the first two principal components were
selected as features for classification

the features were used to train three different classifiers  logistic regression  bayesian
classification and support vector machine classification  on a training set comprising     of the data 
each of these classifiers were then tested on the remaining     of the data  the process was repeated
many times  each time taking a different set of data as the training   test data  figure     and     show
some of the plots obtained by applying logistic regression and support vector machine classification to
the data respectively 

  results and conclusions
the average correct and incorrect classification rates of each classifier for each type of data are
summarized in the form of confusion matrices shown in figure     

figure    confusion matrices summarizing the results of classification using different classifiers on each
type of data 

fifrom the confusion matrices  it is seen that logistic regression and svm classification seem to
perform slightly better than bayesian classification  this may be due to the stronger assumptions made in
bayesian classification  also  between the two types of data  the ai data provide slightly higher
classification success rates than the si data  overall  the seismic data are very reliable as evident from the
high classification success rates
