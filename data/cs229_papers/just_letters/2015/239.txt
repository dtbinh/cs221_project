abstract
this application derives the idf  intensity duration frequency  curve if the user put the historical
rainfall data  compare to the previous methods  it applies the locally weighted linear regression 
so it comes to be simpler than the previous methods 

introduction

because of the climate change the importance of water management is regarded more
important than before  for example  california is in trouble with drought and texas got a huge
damage from the flood  therefore  to handle this problem  hydrologist predict the abnormal flood
or drought from the past rainfall data and design the hydraulic sturctures to prevent the natural
disaster occur by the rainfall 
by analyzing historic rainfall data  rainfall frequency can be derived and get the data such as    
year frequency rainfall or drought  hydrologists derive the idf intensity  duration  frequency 
curve each time period analyzed rainfall data  these data decrease by the log scale  nowadays 
they use several methods to derive the idf curve  and these methods needs to derive parameters
for each region 
this application analyzes and derives the rainfall frequency if the user puts the historic rainfall
data  moreover  this application derives the idf curve by applying the linear regression algorithm 
so it can be applied regardless of the region  without finding parameters for each region 
related work
there are several empirical equation to derive rainfall intensity  nowadays  to get more accurate
rainfall intensity  following rainfall intensity formula is used 
      ln   
      
     ln     

i is the rainfall intensity  t is return period year   t is duration min  
a  b  c  d and n are the parameters that are determined by region  other empirical equations
also need the parameter for each region

fidata set
the figure below is the plot of the historic rainfall data at suwon and icheon city  south korea 
weather station              hour   hours   to apply the hydrologic year system  the     
rainfall data is not used  this rainfall frequency and the idf curve will be derived by this
application  suwon city and icheon city south korea  data will be analyzed too for checking that
this application can be used comprehensively for other regions 

 figure    suwon   icheon city rainfall dataset 
the following figure shows the   hour duration rainfall at suwon   icheon station 

 figure    suwon   icheon city  hour duration rainfall 
according to the figure above  the tendency of the rainfall have the skewness  that the data is
not normal distribution  there are not many data close to the average  therefore  to get the
rainfall frequency  several methods are used to calibrate the skewness  this application the most
recommended method   gumbel method are used  both dataset is from k water korea water
resources corporation  

fimethods

gumbel method requires specific moment values to calibrate skewness 
probability weighted moment

gumbel distribution method  cumulative probability density function is
   
 
       


          ln  
                  
     exp   exp  

because of the skewness the positional argument and scale variable is applied  by the equation
above  rainfall by time period derived as

       ln  ln  


  
 

by the result of calibration and analysis of historical rainfall data  we can receive the rainfall
intensity of each time period  by this result idf  intensity duration frequency  plot can be drawn 
the previous methods of deriving idf curve estimate the curve by the rainfall intensity per
frequency  duration and the parameters for each region  this application applies locally weighted
linear regression

standard choice for the weights is applied for this application 
        
 
        
   
for this application the  value needs to be derived by the dataset of first region and apply this
value at the other region to prove that it is applicable to other regions 

result   discussion
to get the weights 

by the result of the above from suwon city data the  value is estimated as     and it is also
applicable for icheon city rainfall data as shown as below 

fiby applying the  as derived  the above figures are the derived idf curves of several frequencies 
by that  value 
previous methods need several parameters to derive the idf curve and rainfall intensity for each
region  moreover  more accurate method needs more complicate and more various parameters 
however  this application is independent from these parameters so it is applicable at various
regions  therefore  to derive the idf by this application  only historical rainfall data is needed 

future work
the bandwidth parameter needs to be more accurate by comparing the results of other various
regions rainfall data to be more applicable for various regions  moreover  it is extreme climate
regions such as desert  polar  tropical regions rainfall data is needed to compare and check that is
applicable for those climates
