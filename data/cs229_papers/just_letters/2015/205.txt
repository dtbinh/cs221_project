abstract
in this cs     final project  we apply several machine learning algorithms and error analysis methods
to predict the local sea level rise in the san francisco bay and global sea level rise based on recorded
local and global atmospheric and other conditions between years      and      

 

introduction

such researches yield a wide range of global sea level
rise predictions for the year      ranging from   
cm to     cm  in the most recent intergovernmental panel on climate change  ipcc  report  global
mean sea level was predicted by using different models in which isostatic and tectonic effects correction
were applied      and it yielded a result closer to the
lower range of the above sea level rise predictions 
that could be the result of not including some important features such as snowmelt  the semi empirical
model would be a practical approach if more features
are included rather than just temperature  one study
describes a somewhat comprehensive approach that
uses global coupled atmosphere ocean general circulation models in which different components such
as temperature  glacial  steric and ice sheet are included to make regional projections of future sea level
change      another study by yin is along the same
lines of the previous study in which in which land 
ocean  sea ice and atmosphere systems are incorporated within the climate model to predict sea level
rise on the northeast coast of the united states     
some of the studies mentioned above have incorporated glacial isostatic adjustment  gia  models     
all these climatic models and technical methods are
good but substantial work still need to be done in order to create a more reliable model for sea level rise
prediction 

scientists and researchers have not yet arrived at a
standard approach in predicting sea level rise due to
the many uncertainties and the availability of data 
moreover  the sea level has been rising in more alarming way since the rate of rise has been accelerating in
recent years      this aspect of climate change is critical to predict  as almost half of the worlds population
lives in coastal regions  knowing how much the levels
will rise can inform governments and other interested
entities in disaster prevention  real estate evaluation
and public safety  in addition  sea level rise varies
greatly with geography due to various global processes  such as ocean currents  estimating the sea
level rise in a specific location is the figure of merit 
which is of interest of local decision makers  we have
selected the san francisco bay area as location of
interest to our study  as it is a coastal region with
a large population  in this project we predict the
amount of sea level rise globally and in san francisco
due to climatic aspects using machine learning algorithms with different climatic inputs such as global
co    snow melt and temperature 

 

related work

most researches explored the global sea level rise predictions using yearly data  in a paper published in
the science journal  rahmstorf relates annual global
data
sea level rise to temperature      furthermore  several  
researchers have presented similar semi empirical approach where they simply relate past annual sea level after an initial research of the data  we anticipated
rise to temperature or radiative forcing first then use that all the feature and target data could be collected
ipcc projections to extrapolate through the   st      from national oceanic and atmospheric administra

tion  noaa   however  in order to guarantee a sufficient time span  we had to combine data from many
different sources  the main data resources besides
noaa were the national aeronautics and space administration  nasa   university of hawaii sea level
center  uhslc   earth policy institute  epi   and
western regional climate center  wrcc   the preprocessing that was performed on the data consisted
of importing from csv  text and grib formats to
matlab  bridging over missing values  interpolating and averaging to get monthly  seasonal and yearly
data for all features  finally  the data was normalized
by subtracting the mean and dividing by the variance  to conform with the expectation of the learning
algorithms see figure   
we had two targets for our analysis  the first is
the local sea level rise  monthly data for san francisco is available from the university of hawaii sea
level center  local and global features were both
used to estimate the local sea level rise  the second
target was the global mean sea level rise  for which
the data is available from the noaa 
besides improving our model by virtue of having
more features  we were interested in looking at which
features have the biggest impact on the prediction 

and whether the local features have any impact at
all  in the final prediction  only a subset of the available features was used 

 

yearly data     average test error   see next section
for definition of the average test error   it failed to
capture the variations associated with seasonal and

figure    normalized inputs 

all the data collected  targets and features alike 
are presented in table    it could be seen from table   that in order to take into account some of the
important features such as snowmelt  which its data
was measured by satellite  the number of our training examples reduces significantly making it a huge
disadvantage to use such satellite features 

methods

we have started with running linear regression on the
data  while this simple algorithm worked well for
 

fimonthly sea level  therefore  we decided to select
the svr optimization problem is 
the best prediction from three machine learning algo 
rithms  random forest  support vector regression and
minimize   w  
w b
neural network 
s t   c  yi  k w  xi    b  c
in order to enable prediction for year       having features from      latest  we had to look   years
where c is a cost parameter and k x  y  is the
back in our modeling  to mitigate this rather arbi  kernel function  in our analysis  we have used a gaustrary assumption  we decided to use data from a span sian kernel with parameter  
s of years from year y  s to year y as predictors for
 
the target in year y      for example  the estimate
k x  y    exp    x  y    
of the sea level rise in      was predicted using data
we have used a custom implementation by ronnie
from      through       the span was used as an additional parameter when training the algorithms and clark      which we have modified 
reducing testing error 

   
   

random forest

neural network

a neural network for regression is a collection of linear
perceptrons  where each neuron is a function  which
outputs a weighed linear combination of its inputs 
the network is then created by feeding the output of
some neurons to the inputs of others  in our case 
we have used a two layer feed forward network  the
first layer  called hidden layer contained five neurons 
parametrized by weights w and offset b  the output
layer contained a single neuron with equivalent parameters  this output layer took the outputs of the
hidden neurons as its inputs  and in turn output the
predicted value of the target variable 
in the matlab neural network toolbox implementation that we employed  the parameters w and b
of all neurons were randomly initialized and then varied  until the training error was minimized  having
a trained neural network  we could then simply feed
the features to the network and obtain a prediction 

random forest is an algorithm that can be used both
for classification and regression  it is based on a
group of ntrees randomly grown decision trees  which
output either a class for classification problems or
a continuous variable for regression problems  each
tree is created by splitting the feature set randomly
into mtry subsets based on an attribute value test 
this process is then repeated recursively on each derived subset  until the subset at a node has the same
value of the target variable  the random aspect of the
algorithm should help prevent overfitting  to make a
prediction based on a feature set  the set gets fed to
each tree in the model  and the output of the algorithm is the average of predictions over all the trees 
in our application  we have used a pre compiled
function      taking the training feature matrix  the
training target vector and the parameters ntrees and
mtry as inputs  the function output a model of the
decision trees grown  which was then used by another  
analysis
pre compiled function to make a prediction on a testing feature matrix 
when training the algorithms  we varied the parameters both by computerized iterative search and by
manual search  for example  we saw that for neural
    support vector regression
network layer sizes beyond    there was little improvesupport vector regression is an extension of the sup  ment in testing error  but the computation time was
port vector machine algorithm to continuous prob  getting longer  therefore  we have decided to use  
lems 
neurons for our neural network hidden layer 
our situation was specific in having highly corthe model produced by support vector machine
depends only on a subset of the training data  be  related data points  because they came from a time
cause the cost function for building the model does series  therefore  we could not do cross validation 
not care about training points that lie beyond the but we withheld the latest     of the inputs to be a
margin  only several data points  called support vec  testing matrix  and trained the algorithms only on the
tors  constitute the model  analogously  the model first      we have chosen this selection because reproduced by svr depends only on a subset of the stricting the training set further  to     for example 
training data  because the cost function for build  would yield relatively bad testing errors and prevent
ing the model ignores any training data close to the us from taking into account the climatic changes in
the last decades of the   th century 
model prediction 
 

fiour figure of merit  measuring the performance of
the algorithms was the average percent testing error 
which we have defined as follows

  x fifi yref  ypredict fifi
test      
fi
fi
n
yref

rise from      to      is     mm in san francisco
and     mm globally 
future extension of this project could follow multiple avenues  it would be interesting to try different
algorithms and additional features to see if it is possible to create a better prediction  especially for the
where n is the number of training samples  yref local sea level  with advancing time  more emphais the reference target vector and ypredict is the pre  sis can be put on satellite data such as heat flux and
snowmelt  especially for global predictions  because
diction given by the trained model 
we have performed feature selection by manually the reason for not using it was the lack of data points 
removing individual features to see  which ones have as the measurements started in      
the most influence on the testing error  features  that
did not change or even exacerbated the testing error
were excluded 
the random forest algorithm never predicted a
higher sea level than the highest value in the training set  this is logical  since the algorithm takes an
average of predictions of individual trees  which can
only go as high as the highest prediction that it has
seen 
initially  the random forest was overfitting  which
was solved by setting the number of trees to      the
neural network was overfitting as well  but this behavior was mitigated by specifying a validation fraction 
the training algorithm from the matlab neural
network toolbox sets this fraction of the training set
aside as validation set  and when the error relative
to this validation set stops improving  it stops the
figure    prediction of sea level rise in san francisco 
training and returns the model 
the testing error varied greatly depending on the
frequency of the data  svr and neural network
were able to capture the periodicity of seasonal and
monthly data  but random forest could not  the
performances of the three algorithms on two scopes
 local and global  and using three data frequencies
 monthly  seasonal  yearly  are plotted in table   
the best predictions were then selected for both
local and global scopes  the parameters and performance of these algorithms is seen in table    and the
predicted values  compared to the real values  including the prediction to       are plotted in figures  
and
