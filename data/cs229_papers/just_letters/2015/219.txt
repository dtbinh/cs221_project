abstractdue to entrenched methodology and a tendency
towards deep focus in domain specific knowledge  health care
operations is a field with open problems  yet relatively little
previous work in applying modern machine learning methods 
in particular  alarm fatigue in hospital intensive care units is
a major issue that could greatly benefit from the application of
even relatively simple and standard learning techniques  previous
work explores only very specific instances of and solutions to
this problem  this paper explores the application of several
standard methods to the problem of reducing false alarm rates
in the icu and discusses the relative advantages and drawbacks
to each model  we present promising results in false alarm
suppression  and identify possible extensions that could lead to
further improvement in this application  future work will include
fine tuning the models  and combining our methods with more
domain specific medical knowledge

introduction

in hospital intensive care units  high rates of false arrhythmia alarms result in the fatigue and desensitization of
attending medical staff  this false alarm fatigue causes
workers response times to slow  and leads to detrimental
decreases in the quality of patient care      excessive alarms
can also lead to sleep deprivation and depressed immune
systems among patients      we consider in particular the
alarms triggered by the five life threatening conditions of
asystole  extreme bradycardia  extreme tachycardia  ventricular
tachycardia  and ventricular flutter fibrillation  these alarms
are triggered by ecg and pulsatile waveforms recorded by
monitoring equipment  the standard alarm triggering criteria
are instantaneous thresholds on the predictor values  false
alarm rates of up to     have been reported     in pediatric
intensive care units  such high rates suggest the potential
for significant improvements by applying modern methods to
identify and suppress false alarms in real time  towards this
end  we seek to develop a model to correctly identify and
distinguish true and false alarms reported in the icu 
we hypothesize that applying statistical and machine learning techniques can achieve significant improvements in the
specificity of the alarm system  while maintaining the true
alarm sensitivity  the input to our model is a set of waveform
traces taken from icu patients who triggered an alarm via the
standard methods in practice  these traces extend   minutes
previous to the alarm trigger  and are labeled according to
whether the alarm was true or false  we extract relevant
features from the waveform according to the literature  and
use said features as the inputs to our classification models 
the four classification models considered in this paper are
    logistic regression      support vector machine      binary

random forest  and     multi class random forest  the goal
of these models is to accurately predict whether the provided
features indicate a true or false alarm  the output of our models
fills this requirement by reporting the sensitivity and specificity
 false alarm suppression rate  as the primary metrics for each
classification model

related work

cropp     played recordings of critical and non critical
alarms for a sample of medical professionals and found they
could correctly identify critical alarms only half the time  they
posit this is due to an over proliferation of alarms in the icu 
resulting in medical professionals paying less attention to the
alarms  this work partly inspired the physionet challenge  and
our collaboration with the lucile packard childrens hospital 
hagerman     found that the increase in alarms increased
patient stress  resulting in higher patient pulse amplitude in
some types of patients  these papers show the importance of
implementing a higher standard for triggering alarms 
aboukhalil     investigated reducing false alarms with a
database of more than      records  with the input of doctors
and nurses  they decided on viable ranges for each of the
features they used based on the last    second window of the
monitors  and graphed the true alarm and false alarm rate as a
function of each parameter changing  without using methods
such as stochastic gradient descent  they set many features
equal to zero for different alarms  and limited their search
space significantly  we chose to investigate what our models
would find without too much a priori input  to contrast their
work  they observed a false alarm suppression rate of    
on the asystole alarm  with no true alarm suppression  but
saw lower results on the ventricular tachycardia alarm  with a
      false alarm suppression rate at the cost of a    true
alarm suppression rate  this approach was based on medical
knowledge  and produced strong results  but we feel that using
advanced machine learning methods may ultimately produce
better results  especially when both techniques are combined 
zong     also investigated how to reduce false alarms in
the icu  they assessed abp signal quality  and if an ecg
was available  adjusted the signal quality based on the ecg 
they then adjusted the blood pressure data if the signal quality
was above a threshold  and accepted or rejected the alarm
based on this combination of data in the last    seconds of
the monitors  they performed a thresholding model on this
combination of data  manually tuning the thresholds  they
eliminated nearly all false alarms on their test set  while
suppressing only a few true alarms  they also did not use

fistochastic gradient descent but used their medical knowledge
to decide on the algorithms and criteria for thresholding  we
hope that our methods using machine learning algorithms will
produce stronger results informed by the data 
behar     analyzed qrs waves in the data and used
support vector machines with a gaussian  nonlinear  kernel
to classify the data  this work inspired us to investigate svms
with nonlinear kernels  their results are very impressive  but
they  like us  see the least beneficial results on ventricular
flutter 

looked for the r waveform spikes that represented the heartbeats  then  using these extracted heartbeats  we calculated
all of the features shown in table i  for the abp and ppg
 pleth  waveforms  we again extracted the heartbeats by
marking at what times the blood pressure rose quickly and
significantly  we did this with the assistance of code provided
by the physionet challenge      then  we used these heartbeat
times to calculate the features shown in table i for these traces 
the signal quality index was given by the provided code 

li     analyzed ventricular flutter and ventricular tachycardia alarms using machine learning methods specifically for
these alarms  they used signal processing to extract ventricular
flutter rhythms from the data  they applied feature extraction
using genetic learning to choose the features that minimized
the rmse of multivariate logistic regression  they then applied an svm to classify each alarm  in contrast to their work 
we did not use genetic learning  but we did apply regularized
logistic regression to see how the algorithm worked with fewer
features

dataset and features

a  source data and preprocessing
our training set is from the      physionet computing in
cardiology challenge  the dataset consists of records from
    life threatening arrhythmia alarms  sampled at random 
from four different hospitals  for each alarm  there are  minute traces from up to five monitoring waveforms  including
two ecg waveforms and at least one pulsatile waveform
 photoplethysmogram  ppg or pleth  and or arterial blood
pressure  abp    the data also includes a label indicating the
alarms true false status 
these samples have been filtered and resampled to remove
some noise  but still suffer from non removable noise sources 
for instance  the alarms were detected using four different
software hardware systems in each of the four hospitals  and
system parameters were tuned on an individual patient basis 
neither of these factors are included in the provided dataset 
b  feature extraction
a key component of this project is extracting features from
the time series data traces  we cannot simply train our models
on the entire time series  the points are highly correlated  and
there would be too many features compared to our sample size 
leading to a high probability of over fitting the training data 
instead  we train our models on specific features of the time
series that are indicative of the arrhythmia events the alarms are
trying to detect  we determine such features both intuitively 
and by referencing the literature 
the most important and relevant aspect of these traces is
the heartbeat  so we focus on features related to heartbeats for
all traces  to simplify the heartbeat extraction  we  like     
only considered the    second window before the alarm was
triggered  which will include any possible arrhythmias  since
an alarm must trigger less than    seconds after an arrhythmia  
for the ecg pulses  we segmented the data and  for each
segment  calculated the average and standard deviation and

fig     an example of a patient with a true asystole alarm  the red xs
represent the heartbeats extracted from the data  from which the features were
created  this data is relatively clean  for the most part  the heartbeat positions
agree across the ecg  ii  v  and abp traces 

an interesting challenge with this dataset was the asymmetry of the data  as seen in figures   and    not all of the
traces contained the same waveforms  so  when constructing
our feature vectors  there were empty values for the features
taken from nonexistent traces  since the traces provided for
a patient bore no indication of the true false alarm status of
that patient  we filled in these features by searching through
the training set for traces that had similar features to the given
patient  once we found the closest match based on the features
shared by both patients  we replaced the nonexistent trace data
from the first patient from the existing trace data from the most
similar patient 
while this method works for traces that are not provided  it
does not help with provided traces for which it is impossible to
extract a heartbeat  consider figure    this patient obviously
has a heartbeat  as evidenced by the ppg trace  so  the

the    features extracted from the various traces 

extreme tachycardia  ventricular tachycardia  and ventricular
flutter fibrillation  all patients were analyzed only with other
patients who triggered the same alarm  the response variable
for each patient was   or    with   meaning the alarm was
correct and the patient needed emergency medical attention
and   meaning the alarm was false and immediate attention
was not necessary  on these five datasets  we used   fold cross
validation on the training set to tune the hyperparameters when
necessary 
first  we ran a logistic regression model using the features
described above  we chose this model to run first as it is simple
to implement and provides a baseline of the performance of
our features  we use the formula 
h  x   

 
    et x

   

logistic regression uses gradient descent to maximize the
likelihood function 

fig     an example of a patient with a false asystole alarm  the patients
heartbeat is visible on the ppg  pleth  signal  but the ecg and resp traces
have zeroed for an unknown reason 

ecg traces should be treated as having not been provided 
ideally  we would have a normal  healthy patient with which to
compare the ppg features  and replace the noisy ecg features
with healthy ones  however  our dataset only provides us with
traces that set off arrhythmia alarms  there are no healthy  nonnoisy patient data  this was a limitation of the dataset provided
by this project  but could be overcome in a real world setting 
in the literature  this limitation was overcome through data preprocessing  which looked for the presence of other waveforms
if one waveform went to    we attempted to account for this
later through different learning techniques

methods

a  classification models
we investigated four models to classify our data  we are
motivated to try different models both to learn more about
the data and because we may find that different alarms are
classified more accurately with different models 
to apply the first three models  we first split our data
by alarm type  we looked at the data that triggered each
alarm separately with sets for asystole  extreme bradycardia 

 i 

 i  y
l     m
    h  x i     y
i    h    x  

 i 

 

   

we also ran logistic regression with lasso regularization
with tuning  which minimizes 
 i 

 i  y
l     m
    h  x i     y
i    h    x  

 i 

 

           

we chose this because it encourages different values of i
to go to    which was inspired by our literature review where
papers such as     set different feature weights to   in their
model  however  our feature removal is informed by the data 
next  we ran an svm model with a polynomial kernel
whose degree was chosen through cross validation  we chose
this model because it runs quickly even with large feature
vectors  the svm model maximizes the geometric margin of
the featrues extracted to a higher dimension with polynomial
terms with a w vector  subject to the magnitude of w being
   an svm is generated by solving the following convex
optimization problem 

min
s t 

 
 
    w

y  w x i    b      i           m

   

fithe svm problem is usually solved as the lagrange dual
of the problem shown below  potentially allowing for a kernel
replacement for increased computation speed

i  

if the higher dimensional features are linearly separable 
svm will generate a w vector such that the data is perfectly
separated  however  there are some cases in which this is
undesirable  sometimes  an outlier can skew the fit and create
a line that will perform poorly on test data  therefore  we
used cross validation to tune the svm with regularization  this
changes the optimization problem to as below  allowing the
margin to be less than    if it minimizes the overall error

we used   fold cross validation to tune the parameters c
and   as well as the degree of the polynomial kernel  using
the score function of the competition as our metric for the
tuning  shown in equation    this score function penalizes
false negatives much more harshly than false positives

third  we ran a boosted classification model  boosted tree
models work by generating many random samples of the data
by sampling with replacement in a process called bagging 
then  a tree is trained on each sample of the data using a
random sample of the features with replacement  the test data
is then evaluated on each tree  and the result is averaged 
this process reduces variance as the models are trained using
different samples of the training sets  we used this model in
order to see how a tree based model compared to the other
chosen models  and as a stepping stone to a random forest 
in order to further decrease variance  we limited the number
of features and depth of tree used with a random forest model 
this works especially well on datasets with highly correlated
data  allowing the model to see how each feature effects the
data  we also were able to evaluate which features were most
important to the tree  figure   shows the decrease in gini
impurity  a measure of inaccuracy  desired to be small  in
the tree after each feature was split  added up among all the
trees  we can see that  for the ventricular tachycardia alarm 
the ecg  high heart rate  ppg low heart rate  and abp max
rr diff resulted in the highest change in gini impurity 
last  we ran a multiclass boosted classification model on
all of the data with the additional feature of which alarm

was triggered  we used    categorical response variables  the
numbers   through   each corresponded to a specific alarm 
for the alarm that went off for a patient  the response variable
is the corresponding number    through    multiplied by   
if the alarm is correct and   if the alarm is incorrect  the
multiclass random forest model allowed us to analyze if using
the data from all patients is more informative than only using
the data from patients with a specific alarm and see the most
important features across the whole dataset

b  numerical results
for each model  we report the model sensitivity  true
positive rate  and specificity  true negative rate   a high
sensitivity indicates that true alarms are correctly identified
as such  rather than being suppressed   and a high specificity
corresponds to a reduced false alarm rate  or the false alarm

fisuppression rate  our goal is therefore to maximize specificity 
while maintaining a perfect sensitivity of    we expected to
achieve a significant decrease in false alarm rates by applying
trained statistical models to this problem  this assumption has
now been validated by the results given below in tables iii

c  parameter selection
our initial results utilized only untuned models  by using
cross validation for parameter selection  we are able to achieve
more balanced results  figure   shows the results for a tuned
vs  untuned svm model  our svm model used a polynomial
kernel with   parameters  cost  degree  and scale  these
parameters were evaluated for each point on a   dimensional
grid where cost                         degree            
and scale       for each set of parameter values  the   fold
cross validated physionet score was computed according to
equation    the parameter combination yielding the largest
cross validated score was chosen 
because of the asymmetry in the weighting of fn  tuning
on the physionet score has the effect of emphasizing  or
caring about sensitivity more than it does about specificity 
this is basically a soft version of our goal to maximize
specificity  while constrained to maintain sensitivity

  fold cross validation on a grid search of polynomial kernel parameters  using
the physionet score  or a weighted metric of tp tn as the tuning metric

conclusion   future work

a  discussion
our final results show that significant improvements in
false alarm suppression can be made as compared to the basic
thresholding model used in hospitals  this project was limited
by the quality of data we had available  as all data had triggered
an alarm of some sort  so we had no control data to work
with  we were limited by the size of the dataset  particularly for
alarms with fewer than    true positives  split random forest
achieved the highest sensitivities on most alarms  likely due
to the correlation of features  and therefore should continue to
be investigated  we are optimistic that  with data from a wider
array of patients  the data can be pre processed to produce
even stronger results with all alarms  in addition  further work
could be done with a larger dataset to tune the parameters to
a sensitivity of    while maximizing the specificity
