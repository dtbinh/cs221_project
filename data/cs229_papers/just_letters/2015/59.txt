introduction
the field of pathology is concerned with identifying and understanding the biological causes and
effects of disease through the study of morphological  cellular  and molecular features in samples
of tissue  examination of prepared tissue samples is typically performed by a pathologist looking
through an optical microscope  thin slices of patient tissue samples are stained with contrast
agents and fluorescently labelled molecular markers before viewing  which provides contextual
information useful in diagnosis 
a grading system is used to communicate the severity of the ailment present in a particular tissue
sample  where a higher grade indicates a worse prognosis      a histological grade is assigned
based on features that may be quickly identified by the examining pathologist  here  we restrict
our focus to features associated with cancerous tumors  one so called hallmark of cancer is
uninhibited cellular replication         which leads to increased mitotic activity and poorly
differentiated tissue  increased mitotic activity is indicated by counting the number of cells
undergoing the late stages of cellular division  which is indicated by the presence of additional
chromosomes in the nucleus  poorly differentiated tissue does not have identifiable structures
 like membranes or blood vessels   and instead looks like an amorphous matrix of cells  the cells
in a poorly differentiated tumor have irregular size and shape  with no clear indication of the
intended function of the cell 
the histological grade of a tumor has been associated with patient survival      as a result  the
grading system has remained the gold standard for the past    years  however  the histological
grading system has a few important shortcomings  first  the feature set available for diagnosis
and prognosis is limited  since the features must be reliably identified from a visual inspection of
the tissue sample  this leaves an enormous number of potentially relevant features unexamined 
second  the grade assigned to the same tissue sample may vary by pathologist  due to ambiguity
in the features themselves or the variation in pathologist experience  performance  etc      third 
pathology labs are under enormous pressure to analyze large volumes of slides while maintaining
diagnostic accuracy  while the time required for a trained pathologist to examine a slide depends
on the stains used during slide preparation  the standard hematoxylin and eosin stain  cell nuclei
blue  cytoplasm pink  takes a few minutes to examine  specialized stains may require fifteen
minutes or more  
the issues associated with the histological grading system may be addressed using digitally
assisted analysis of tissue samples  which is enabled by the rapid improvement in imaging
quality  memory size  and computational power over the past twenty years  digital processing of
histological data enables the examination of arbitrary features previously unsuited for visual
analysis  these new features may have diagnostic or prognostic value in the clinical setting  as
well as providing direction for basic research  furthermore  digital processing of histological

data enables consistent feature definition and analysis  reducing misinterpreted or
miscommunicated analysis results  finally  digital processing of histological data enables greater
throughput and allows pathologists to focus on higher level tasks  rather than counting nuclei  for
example  
objective
the impact of machine learning on histological analysis was recently reported by andrew beck
et  al  in science translational medicine      in this work  a model was trained to classify breast
cancer patients as high risk or low risk of death within the next five years using histological
slides from the netherlands cancer institute  nki  n        and the vancouver general hospital
 vgh  n         the binary classifier was trained using l  regularized logistic regression 
preprocessing was used to remove background and segment the image into smaller sections
called superpixels  which were classified as either epithelial tissue  forms a membrane  or
stromal tissue  forms a matrix in which epithelial cells are embedded  using a binary classifier
trained using labeled histology data  relational features between superpixels were additionally
calculated  intensity  size  shape  to form the prognostic classifier  in total      features were
used  however  only    of those features were required to produce a robust prognostic model 
the objective of this project is to replicate the work of beck et  al  to provide a personal
foundation for future work in this area  the goals are to    implement superpixel segmentation 
   identify nuclei within each superpixel     replicate the epithelial vs stromal classifier  and   
construct the top three dominant features used in the prognostic classifier  essentially  repeating
the machine learning component of     to verify my understanding  the histological slide data
used in     is located in the stanford tissue microarray database  tmad   the raw images and
images with labeled epithelial and stromal regions are available for both the nki and vgh data
sets 
results
the results shared here concern the classifier tasked with identifying regions of
background background tissue  epithelial tissue  and stromal tissue  two approaches to
implement this classifier and are outlined visually in figure    both approaches are exercises in
supervised learning  but differ in image segmentation  the types of features used  and the
algorithms used to train the models 
in method a      raw histology images are separated into background epithelium stroma using
pixel masks generated through k means operating on the images that have pathologist labeled
sections of epithelial and stromal tissue  the separated tissue sections are then segmented into
smaller objects using a watershed algorithm  which finds borders between local minima in the
grayscale version of the histology image  intensity features are calculated in each object and used
to train two classifiers through logistic regression  the first classifier separates background tissue

from tissue that is either epithelial or stromal  given the output of the first classifier predicts an
object is not background  the second classifier makes the final separation between epithelial
tissue and stromal tissue  the resulting model is tested using an addition    histology images that
were not used in training 
in method b     raw histology images are segmented into a grid of    pixel x    pixel boxes 
for training  each box is labeled as background  epithelium  or stroma using the same k means
separation as in method a  a box may overlap multiple tissue regions  so each box is assigned to

histology images

the region of maximum overlap  textural features based on     are calculated for each box in
addition to intensity features similar to those used in method a  the labels and features of each
box are used to train a multinomial classifier using the svm algorithms available through     
the models produced by method b are tested using leave one out cross validation on the   
images 
example classifications are shown in figure   for both methods a and b  qualitatively  the
classification produced by modb more closely represents the image under consideration  top of
figure     moda is a particularly poor classifier  since it predicts nearly all tissue sections are
stromal  with a few background sections even being labeled as epithelial  the qualitative results
observed in figure   are confirmed quantitatively in figure    where the classification accuracy
is shown for moda  fig   a  and modb  fig   c   the generalization accuracy of moda is better
than the training error of moda  which is attributed to the observation that background tissue

tends to be mislabeled as stromal tissue by moda  the images used to test moda have more
stromal tissue than the training images  based on histograms of labels in each set   so the penalty
for this error is less severe  the classification accuracy in either case is quite low  which may be
due to poor algorithm convergence or poor features  algorithm convergence for moda is
observed in figure  b  which is defined as when the change in the norm of the parameter vector
reduces below a defined threshold  the learning rate is reduced until reliable convergence is
achieved  high bias despite algorithmic convergence suggests that the model is not complex
enough  i e  we need more or better features  this conclusion is further supported by the fact that
the bias does not improve as the number of training examples increases  fig   a  
intuitively  we should expect high bias out of moda since the majority of the features used to
construct moda are intensity based  to enhance the feature set  haralick textural features    
were added for training modb  in addition  an svm algorithm was used for faster training  the
training error and generalization error during loocv is shown in figure  c  the average
training accuracy is      while the average generalization accuracy is      this is a significant
improvement over the classification accuracy of moda  it is interesting to investigate the impact
of the different features  in figure  a  the generalization error of models trained using textural
and intensity features is compared to the generalization error of models trained using only
textural features  the full feature set only improves the average error by     suggesting the
intensity features do not contribute significantly to the overall classifier  the ratio of the
confusion matrices produced by the models of the two feature sets is shown in figure  b  a
number greater than one indicates the full feature set improves over the textural feature set alone 
the addition if intensity features does increase the overall accuracy of the classifier  but the
dominant features appear to be textural  as a future investigation  it may be interesting to
recalculate these features on filtered versions of the image  for instance  derivatives could be
used for edge detection and integrals could be used for smoothing
