i ntroduction

todays music industry is influenced by many factors that
simply did not exist twenty years agocurrent artists are
capable of reaching out to potential fans using forms of online
media  they are no longer limited in promoting their music
by physical word of mouth or the advertising muscle of a
record label  instead  both artist who are just starting out and
who had multiple album hits are using social media to build
a presence  brand  and promote their current and upcoming
music releases  however  the mediums used to consume music
have changed as well  music can be consumed instantly via
online purchase or by streaming  more of our interactions
with music itself are online rather than on music store shelves
or the radio  this makes artists more independent of having
to physically push albums 
given metrics on social media platforms  wed like to
predict the success of an artists upcoming release  essentially 
helping artists who can produce quality music benefits the
entire industry  both on the consuming and producing side 
identifying more of these high potential artist early on
can allow labels to give more artists the opportunities and
resources to succeed sooner  with more resources  an artist
gains more recognition and acclaim  more fans are generated 
and the label maximizes their profit 
well be measuring success of an upcoming album release
by looking both at an artists track sales along with an artists
itunes album sales one week after an album release  in order
to make our predictions of album success  well be looking at
social media metrics two weeks prior to an upcoming release 
these social media metrics include facebook likes  twitter
followers  lastfm plays  myspace friends  and a few others
that are part of our dataset provided by next big sound 
social media metrics like these are generated by real people
being engaged with the music content  thus  it should follow
that with these metrics as features  we can use machine
learning methods to predict an albums success  in this paper 
well use linear regression  naive bayes  and support vector
regression to see how well we can predict an albums success
in terms of both total itunes tracks downloads and album
downloads one week after an album release

previous work on using the internet to predict album
success has yielded some initially unintuitive and contradictory

results  an early study of finding the relationship between
user generated internet content and albums sales looked at
blog posts and album reviews to see if they correlated with
album sales  the results were positive  essentially  the more
legitimate blogs and album reviews about a certain album 
the more buzz it had in the internet community  and so the
more physical album sales were sold due to the popularity  in
addition  it was found that only    of high chatter albums
were debut albums  which suggests that the biggest factor in
a successful release is having had at least one prior successful
release  this study used several linear regression varying in
which independent variables were used such as number of
blog reviews  sales rankings  and myspace friends  p values
were analyzed to make its analysis  the results suggest that
high internet content generally happens when an artist has
already had a quality release     
however  a similar study conducted a few years later had
opposite results  they found that buzz generated by blogs
tended to have no correlation with increasing album sales 
more interestingly  it was seen that having a large amount
of hype on the internet for a modest artist results in a negative
impact in track sales  rather than high buzz allowing for an
artists music to be more well known and thus have more
people buying it  it turns out that the higher amount of
recognition results in lower sales at the track level  this isnt
the case for an already mainstream artist  however  this study
attributes this finding to blogs talking about small artists that
tend to post ways to engage with individual tracks of an artist
via mp  download links or links to free streaming  thus  listeners themselves promote artists in ways that make the music
available for free  the study used panel vector autoregression
 pvar  to look at the bidirectional relationship between the
dependent and independent variables  this allowed a way to
see if they might be affecting each other and allowed for a more
comprehensive analysis of how internet media affects album
and track sales  this study was limited in that its measure of
buzz was limited to blog sites and not social network sites like
facebook and myspace     
another study took a different approach by only directly
using one social music sites data  last fm  this study created
features at the artist and track level by processing thousands
of listeners lastfm charts  features such as total amount
of listens on a tracks and total amount of listeners was
generated via scrapping lastfm  using the generated features 
the researchers attempted to predict the billboards rankings
of the tracks  they used support vector machines  naive

fibayes  bayesian networks and decision trees and got the
best accuracy result of        in predicting track placement
in billboards      this study shows that looking at a social
networks metrics can give some indicating of a track sales  it
then makes sense that a high amount of last fm consumption
of a track correlates with track purchases since it models
daily consumption on users devices  the methods used were
standard regression models common in machine learning 
from       part of the year our dataset will be from  we
see that there have been almost    billion plays and    billion
profile views across different social sites as calculated by next
big sound      this tells us that theres is clearly an enormous
amount of engagement with artists and their product online 
next big sound analyzed the metrics that they collect on artists
and concluded which social media metrics contribute the most
to an albums sales  using a granger causality test  which looks
at whether one timeseries of data is able to forecast another 
next big sound found that facebook likes  wikipedia views 
vevo plays  youtube plays  and soundcloud plays were most
significant in forcasting album sales      this suggest that it
should be possible to use machine learning methods on such
features to predict album sales at least

dataset and f eatures

the dataset that we used to test build our models was next
big sounds challenge dataset  a set containing social media
metrics along with youtube play counts and itunes sales data
for anonymized artists over the course of roughly two years 
there was data available for      artists over a total of       
artist days in the years      and      
for each artist  a variety of different social media metrics were available for facebook  instagram  twitter  last fm 
myspace  and soundcloud in addition to several other music
sites  notably  the date of album releases by artists was also
provided  allowing us to narrow our focus to the prediction of
short term album success  measured by the number of sales
made by an artist in the week following an album release 
based on social media metrics 
much of the data  however  was filled with nans  indicating that artists did not have profiles in the various social
media services  the median percentage of days for which a
metric was unavailable was a high        with only    of the
    fields containing non nan data for over     of all artist
days 
because values for most of the metrics spanned several
orders of magnitude  very popular artists  for example  could
have hundreds of times more tracks sold than average artists  
we decided to use the log of most metrics in place of their
actual values in our analysis 
we initially settled upon using the number of itunes tracks
sold in the week following an album release as our y variable
for regression  as it was the most widely available metric related to artist success  available for     of the data   however 
we quickly discovered that  for many artists  album releases did
little to change their sales counts from what they were prior to
these album releases  as a result  we decided to also look at
predicting the change in track sales following an album release

 measured as tracks   log sales af ter sales bef ore   as
a possible measure of album and not artist success  figure  
shows the distribution of the tracks variable 
this resulted in a total of      album releases that could
be used as examples for both training and testing      random
samples of the evolution of track sales per day for an artist
around an album release are shown in the figure    here  day
   the day corresponding to peaks in several of the sales paths 
represents the day that an album was released 
to deal with the presence of nans inside the data  we used
different methods that varied based on the learning algorithms
we used  for some of our models  we also imposed the
additional restriction that artist data for the   days prior to
an album release also be available so that we could use more
advanced time based predictors besides the metrics on the day
of a release 
one of the most relevant time based features was the
acceleration at of an artists track sales one week prior to
release  computed as 

at  

st   st 
st    st     

where st is the total number of itunes track sales on artistday t  this acceleration metric gives a rough sense of how
quickly track sales are either increasing or decreasing  scaled
so that its value always lies between    and

m ethods

a  linear regression
the first form of regression we tried on the data was
a simple ordinary least squares linear regression  we were
looking to predict a real valued metric based on a vector of
features at every album release  so using least squares was a
reasonable first approach  because there is no easy way to deal
with nans in a linear regression  for every set of features we
tried we had to restrict our data to only those artist days for
which all features had actual values 
we then constructed a predictor matrix x with each row
corresponding to values of the predictors on an artist days
selected by the criteria above  a column of ones was added
at the end of the x vector to include an intercept term in
the linear regression  y simply consisted of the values of
tracks at the corresponding days  predictors we tried using
included facebook likes  twitter followers  and itunes track
sales acceleration 
the least squares regression model seeks to fit a parameter
 such that predictions of a responding variable y given an
observed vector x are given by
h  x    t x
formally  we minimize the sum of squared differences between the values of h  x i    and y  i    given observations
  x i    y  i     i              m   this is done by minimizing the
cost function
m
 x
j    
 h  x i     y  i    
  i  
in our formulation  this problem simplifies to minimizing
j         x  y   with respect to theta  yielding the optimal
value  given by
    x t x   x t y
b  naive bayes
the naive bayes classifier provides a more explicit method
of dealing with nans  but in order for the classifier to be
used  both the predictors and responding variable have to first
be discretized into separate classes 
values for each metric were turned into discrete features
by first shifting all values so that the median value of the
metric was    and then bucketing the values based on the
standard deviation  of all non nan values  while it may
seem odd that we decided to center data on the median
rather than the mean  in practice using the median results in
massive improvement due to the presence of extreme outliers
in some metrics  the buckets bi were assigned in the following manner   inf          b                  
b                         b           inf     b    n an   b    
 i 

this allowed us to change each predictor x and responder
y  i  into a vector of multinomial variables  each of which has
   possible values   if we interpret the discrete output bucket
i of the classifier as predicting y to be the center ci of their
corresponding bucket  then we can also obtain a standard error
for the naive bayes classifier by comparing this center to the
actual value y  i  for that observation 

the naive bayes classifier itself is based on the strong
assumption that all individual features xi  in our case the
values of the multinomial variables corresponding to each
field  in observation x are conditionally independent given
the corresponding class y  this allows us to simplify the
conditional probability p x y  of observation x occuring given
class y into
p x y    p x            xn  y   

n
y

p xi  y 

i  

where all values of p xi  y  can be much more efficiently
computed and stored than values of p x          xn  y   using
bayes rule  we can now easily use these conditional probabilities p x y  along with class probabilities p y   k  to make
predictions 
p y   k x   

p x y   k p y   k 
p x 

the best class fitting an observation x would then be given by
arg maxk p y   k x  
maximum likelihood estimates for the multinomial variables in the naive bayes classifier are easily fit by simply
 i 
tallying up the occurrences of  xj   l  y  i    k   i  
           m  j              n for l  k              ncategories   where
n is the number of features for each x i  and ncategories
is the number of discrete categories for both the predictors
and responder  in our case      to assign reasonable nonzero
probabilities to the occurrence of all events  we use laplace
smoothing  a technique equivalent to initializing the classifier
 i 
with one occurrence of each  xj   l  y  i    k  event 
it is true that the features in our data certainly violate
the naive bayes assumption  facebook likes and twitter
followers  for example  actually show very strong correlation
despite having not much correlation with tracks   practically
speaking  however  naive bayes typically still works well even
in situations where there may be correlation between input
variables 
c  support vector regression
 support vector regresssion allows us to find a function
that tries to maintain within the boundary specified by   and
minimize the cost of errors outside   this model also maps
the features to a higher dimensional space and uses a kernel
to easily compute the inner product of our feature mapping 
 support vector regression can be posed as the following
optimization problem

we can then use a kernel and construct a lagrange function
to produce the dual optimization problem

to evaluate the performance of each of our models  we
evaluated their standard error in the prediction of tracks on
a test set after being trained on a separate training set  models
that showed promise were subjected to more rigorous crossvalidation tests  as an absolute measure of how effective each
of the methods were  we compared the percentage of variance
in tracks explained by a method 
a  linear regression
the linear regression approach we initially used was incapable of dealing with nans  so we had to narrow down
our initial set of album releases to only the     releases that
contained both artist facebook and twitter data 
its important to note that by throwing out those artists
who do not have both facebook and twitter accounts  we
inherently bias the values of tracks that we look at  artists
that have both facebook and twitter accounts typically have
better album success  as measured by tracks    indicating that
there is definite information that can be gleaned from the fact
that artists are missing a social media profile  for now  we set
aside this difference and continue to focus on those artists that
have both facebook and twitter data to see how these two
predictors factor into an artists change in track sales 
our results match up with the somewhat counterintuitive
results of     in that facebook likes and twitter followers were
actually negatively correlated with album success as measured
by tracks   the covariance matrix for facebook likes  twitter
followers  and tracks is shown in table   
the resulting linear predictor had a standard error of
        corresponding to a variance of         the additional
two features  then  explain    of the variance of the restricted
dataset           adding a small amount additional predictive
power  because this value alone was so low  we decided that
it was not worth it to further pursue cross validation tests with
these features alone 

fig    

linear regression of sales acceleration and tracks

the use of a third feature  the acceleration of an artists
itunes sales prior to an album release  computed as the
percentage change in track sales per day over the week prior
to a release   was what most improved the performance of
the linear regression model  this feature had a high      
correlation with tracks and alone was capable of explaining
    of the variance of the set of      test examples for which
this metric was available           attaining a standard error
of         a plot of acceleration vs tracks along with the
corresponding regression line is shown in figure   
to verify that this performance would hold even using out
of sample data  we utilized a variant of k fold cross validation
that averaged the out of sample prediction error of this linear
predictor over      trials  with each trial randomly selecting
    of the data for training and     of the data for testing 
the linear regression model using accelerations only performed well on this form of cross validation  we computed
the average standard error of the linear classifier to be        
corresponding to a variance of         a significant decrease
from the        variance of tracks in all examples for which
at was available 
using both facebook and twitter metrics with artist itunes
acceleration did improve the average standard error of the
classifier to        under the same cross validation scheme 
corresponding to     variance explained  the smaller datset
also had a higher variance of          however  because the
use of facebook and twitter metrics significantly restricts the
number of albums that can be classified       to       we
decided that it was not worth including these metrics despite
the slight improvement they produced in variance explained

  introduced additional variance  worse predictor than mean 

b  naive bayes
the naive bayes classifier was able to explicitly deal with
nans  allowing it to work with all      albums that had
itunes sales data  this capability also allowed us to easily
test any feature we wanted on the resulting classifier 
we tried running the naive bayes classifier to predict
tracks using several different sets of predictors  for each set 
the average estimated standard error was computed using the
same cross validation technique as linear regression  except
this time     of the data in each of      iterations was
devoted to training and     was devoted to testing  this
was designed to ensure that there was a sufficient amount of
training data for the naive bayes classifier  which requires
more data points  given the number of features it deals with 
than linear regression 
table   displays the estimated standard error of the naive
bayes classifier using cross validation  set   contained just
itunes sales accelerations  set   contained accelerations and
facebook likes  set   contained accelerations and last fm
plays  set   contained accelerations and twitter followers  set
  contained accelerations  last fm plays  twitter followers  and
twitter tweets 
its hard to tell from this data alone whether there exists
a set of features would allow the naive bayes classifier
to perform better than the     variance explained statistic
derived from linear regression using accelerations  however 
the fact that the widely available metrics of facebook likes 
twitter followers  and last fm plays all did little to improve
the error of the final model  facebook likes actually hurt the
model  doesnt bode well for classifiers using larger sets of
predictors  due to time limitations  we decided not to pursue
further variations of the naive bayes model  though techniques
such as forward search could definitely be used to optimize the
set of predictors used 
c  support vector regression
using a radial basis function kernel and support vector
regression  we mapped our facebook and twitter metrics
features to a higher dimension to account for a non linear
relationship within our features  this produced a standard error
of         producing a regression significantly worse than
linear regression 

adding the five features with the least amount of nanvalues  facebook page likes  twitter followers  myspace
friends  myspace followers  and myspace profile views  to
our regression caused a slight decrease in the standard error
          despite the improvements  however  linear regression
continued to be a better model 
to mitigate the problem of overfitting  we reduced the
number of features down to three but this time  using facebook
likes  lastfm listeners and radiowave sirius impressions 
we chose these features based on     indicating that a bigger
indicator of track sales is radio plays over social media buzz 
however  since this restricted our data to    training examples 
we restricted our training examples to just facebook likes and
radiowave impressions but interpolated the missing nan values of lastfm listeners using k nearest neighbor imputation 
this produced a standard error of         an increase over our
previous models yet still not a great model considering that
this significantly reduced our training set to     
in trying to overcome initial problems of overfitting  we
found that modifying the parameters by reducing the cost or
increasing the range of no cost errors  i e  increasing   had
either no effect or adverse effects on the testing error 

vi 

c onclusion

in the end  the original linear regression model with only
sales acceleration as a predictor was the best at predicting
values of tracks across a large range of inputs  outclassing
the discretized naive bayes regression and the svr models on
the full dataset  however  the use of svrs did show promise
for albums that had specific combinations of data availablein
this case  the combination of facebook likes  lastfm listeners 
and radiowave sirius impressions was able to achieve a lower
standard error of        
none of the models that could be applied to a large number
of albums  however  were very accurate at predicting track
growth  and those formulated purely on social media metrics
performed noticeably worse than those that accounted for a
history of itunes sales data  this is most likely caused by the
fact that there is high variance among social media metrics
even given the same amount of track sales growth  a problem
exacerbated by the fact that only a few metrics are typically
available for each album 
given more time  the naive bayes model could be further
improved by implementing a cross validated forward search
to determine the optimal features to select for prediction  the
naive bayes model is the most versatile of the three types
of models  as it explicitly deals with missing data  and could
potentially improve with an exhaustive search over all features
 as well as meta features that take into account the time series
nature of the data   robust imputation schemes that work
with sparse data could also be tested to see if they allow for
improved versions of linear regression and svr
