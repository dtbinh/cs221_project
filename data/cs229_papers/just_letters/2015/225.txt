needle tumor puncture detection using a force and position sensor
joey greer and nathan usevitch
 dated     december      

preforming a tumor ablation procedure involves precisely positioning an ablation probe in
a tumor  limited sensing accuracy and variations in tissue properties require that surgeons
often identify when they have correctly positioned the probe through their sense of touch 
in this paper  supervised learning is used to detect the point at which a needle has entered
a tumor using a combination of force and position data  a classifier is developed that uses
force data to detect a puncture event  and a bayesian network that incorporates a position
estimate to distinguish between puncture events that may occur because of tissue variations 
and puncture events that indicate the target has been reached

introduction

tumor ablation is a minimally invasive technique to
treat cancer  it involves guiding the tip of an electric
probe to the tumor to be treated and running a current
through the probe once the tip of the probe has been
positioned in the tumor  the electric current destroys
the cancerous tissue through heat  often times it is difficult for the clinician to know that he or she has successfully reached the tumor  even with the aid of intraoperative imaging such as ultrasound or computed tomography
 ct   when this happens  the clinician falls back on his
or her sense of touch to know that they have successfully reached their target  since often times the tumor is
stiffer than the surrounding  non cancerous tissue  this
project applies machine learning to the problem of detecting when the ablation probe has successfully been placed
inside a tumor  using a combination of position data obtained from imaging  as well as force data gathered from
an instrumented needle  enabling an instrumented needle to autonomously detect tumor penetration would enable robotically steered needles to be used in procedures
where puncture detection had previously necessitated a
human operator  in addition  this classifier could be used
as a tool by physicians to more confidently identify when
they have reached a tumor  ideally  the classifier making
this prediction would be able to classify tumors in materials of a variety of properties  as material properties
of human tissue can vary between people and based on
location in the body

prior work

analyzing the forces of needle insertion has been a
topic of interest in the medical robotics community for
around a decade  previous work has focused on mechanics modeling and prediction      which analyze the forces
of needle insertion in terms of tissue friction  tissue stiffness  and transient events such as membrane puncture 
which is of particular interest in this work  recently 
elayaperumal et al   designed a custom needle sensor to
measure forces at the needle tip and play these forces
back via haptic actuators to the clinician  finally  gonenc et al   recently used a custom force sensor to detect
vein puncture for retinal surgery in the eye  but relied on
heuristic to perform the detection  rather than machine
learning techniques 

fig     expeirmental setup  the needle steering device   a  is
used to insert the needle  shown in  d   at a constant insertion
velocity  two tissue phantoms were used  a cow liver on top of
a layer of ecoflex       silicone rubber  simulating cancerous
tissue   shown in  c   and a block of polyvinyl chloride on top
of silicone rubber  which was used for collection of training
data   d  shows a zoomed in picture of the ati industrial
automation nano    force sensor attached to the base of the
needle used for data collection in this paper  

in this work  we are using time series data as one input
modality for classification  times series offer a unique set
of challenges for classification and several approaches exist to using this data  which is covered well in a survey
by keogh et al     popular methods include using hidden
markov models for time series segmentation  where the
latent variables correspond to segment labels  and time
series transforms such as the discrete fourier transform

force magnitude  n 

and various forms of the wavelet transform to reduce
the dimensionality of the time series for classification 
in this work  we use a sliding window approach  where a
window of force values  centered around the point in time
to be classified are transformed by a featurization function        section iii  and used for classification  this
method was chosen due to it simplicity and effectiveness
on our data 

 

   
 
   

experimental setup and data

 
data was collected using a custom needle insertion
device  figure   a   with an insertion stage powered
by a dc motor  a straight needle  used to simulate
an ablation probe  was mounted on the insertion stage
and an ati industrial automation nano    force sensor  figure   d   and asenscion technologies electromagnetic tracker were mounted at the base of the needle 
two data modalities were collected over the course of an
insertion  axial force magnitude  f  t  and estimated distance between target and needle  d t   the goal of this
work is to develop an algorithm that can detect puncture
events in near real time using force and distance data by
estimating




p  t         f  t  w            f  t   w     d t 
using supervised learning   t      corresponds to the
event that a puncture occurred at time t  and  t     
corresponds to no puncture at time t     r w     rn
corresponds to a featurization of a window of force data
 section iv  
two types of tissue phantoms were used  the first was
for testing purposes and consisted of a cow liver  on top
of a silicone membrane  which was resting on a slab of
gelatin  figure   c    the silicone membrane and slab of
gelatin were used to simulate a tumor to be punctured 
another tissue phantom was used for training data collection  and consisted of a slab of homogeneous gelatin
tissue on top of a silicone membrane  which was on top of
another slab of gelatin tissue of different stiffness  again 
the silicone membrane and second slab of gelatin tissue
were used to simulate a tumor to be punctured  the second tissue phantom was used to collect training data due
to its greater re usability  which allowed for more data
collection 
before each test  the needle steering apparatus was reoriented to provide a different insertion angle and controlled to insert the needle into the tumor phantom at
a constant velocity between   mm s and   mm s  the
training set used in this project contains     different
puncture events in which angle of insertion as well as
insertion velocity were varied between tests  a typical
force distance time series collected from a single insertion through the liver and into a silicone membrane is
shown in figure   
force time series classification

from each time series collected in these experiments
several windows of force data were extracted to form a

fig     a typical force and position time series collected from
a single insertion through the cow liver and silicone layer  a
first puncture type event occurs when the needle punctured
the liver capsule  the tumor puncture occurs at a distance
past the estimated distance to target because the membrane
deflects before the needle punctures through the membrane 

training data set  the windows centered on the puncture along with n other random intervals were selected
as training data for the classifier  parameters to consider when designing the force classifier were feature type 
classifier type  training data weighting  to address class
imbalance   and window size  to guide these decisions 
   fold cross validation was used 
several parameters were analyzed to design the force
classifier  two types of features were considered for a
particular window of force values  raw force values that
were normalized  so as to make the classifier able to generalize  and combinations of different slope values  first
half slope  second half slope  first quarter slope  last quarter slope   in addition two types of classifiers were considered  logistic regression and regularized logistic regression  a lasso penalty was used and the penalty parameter 
  was chosen using cross validation    note that support vector machines were not considered because we
needed a probability of puncture output for the purposes
of the combined classifier explained in section v   finally  the effect of adding in quadratic combinations of
features were considered  the results of different combinations of these options are shown in figure iv  with
specificity and sensitivity as the error metrics in order
manage effects of class imbalance  the best results were
obtained using raw  normalized  force values combined
with quadratic combinations of these values  and a regularized logistic regression classifier  once these parameters were chosen  we considered the effect of window size
for force data  again     fold cross validation was used
to guide our decision process  figure     based on this
experiment  a window size of   time steps was selected

fig     in this plot  the effect of different combinations of features and classifiers were considered on classifier performance
using    fold cross validation on our data  each plot contains a label r   a  l   b  q   c where a  b  c          r     corresponds
to using slope ratio features and r     corresponds to raw force values on a window centered around the point to be classified 
l        correspond to using non regularized and regularized logistic regression  respectively  finally  q        correspond to
adding quadratic combinations of features  either slope ratios or raw force values depending on the value of r   respectively 
the x axis of these plots correspond to the weighting used on positive examples to address class imbalance  i e  an x axis value
of   corresponds to positive examples being weighted by   times over negative examples in the classifier objective function  
based on these plots  raw force values were used  with regularized logistic regression and quadratic features

in order to fit parameters      that maximize the joint
likelihood of our data  we can separately train the force
classifier and gaussian parameters  the force classifier
was discussed in section iv and the maximum likelihood
mean and standard deviation governing the distance distribution are found to correspond to the sample mean and
variance of distances corresponding to puncture events in
the training data set  as shown in figure   and given by

fig     experimentally obtained probability distributions of
distance given puncture  and distance given no puncture  a
gaussian distribution was fit to the distribution of distance
given puncture  and a uniform distribution was used to approximate the distance to the target if there was no puncture 
note that the mean of the probability given puncture is past
zero because of the elasticity of the membrane 

finally  to make a prediction using this bayesian network
structure  and optimized parameters  equation   is used 
note that  in this work  we chose to maximize the
joint probability  p   t          d t    due to the simplistic objective function decomposition that allows us
to separately maximize the force and distance probability distributions  another option is to directly maximize the conditional probability we are interested in 
p   t           d t    this trade off is discussed in
further detail by roos et al   in the general context of
bayesian networks

performance of combined classifier

to qualitatively test the performance of the force classifier on the measured data  both the classifier that uses
force only  and the classifier that incorporates force and
distance were used on the liver data  for this test  a
moving window was run across all of the data  with the
probability of puncture being calculated for each point 
figure   shows the time series along with the probability
of puncture as computed by the force only classifier and
force position classifier  the force only classifier is accurate at classifying nearly all peaks as puncture events 
even the peaks that occur before the actual puncture 
the use of the classifier that includes the position estimate prevents peaks away from the puncture from being
classified as the puncture event  the position data enabled the algorithm to discriminate between a generic
puncture event  and a puncture event that signals when
the needle has reached the target region

combine two different modalities of data  this classifier
could give physicians an extra tool in identifying when a
