every year         new cases of brain cancer are diagnosed worldwide  early diagnosis and better
understanding of the specific types of tumors of brain cancer patients can significantly increase survival
rates      we used unsupervised learning algorithms in combination with gaussian smoothing and gabor
filters to directly analyze  d mri brain images in order to discover spatial regions correlated to dierent
types of brain tumors 

 

introduction

tation file has labels for dierent parts of the tumor
    necrosis     edema     nonenhancing     enhancing   created by a medical professional for the explicit purpose of classification  all the meta image
files contain a   dimensional matrix of pixel values
representing the consolidated slices of a single mri
scan which have been co registered  that is  the value
of a pixel  x  y  z  of one brain corresponds to the
 x  y  z  pixel of another  pixel here is interchangeable with voxel    in terms of relative location in the
brain 

localized brain tumors are highly treatable when diagnosed in an early stage      according to the national cancer institute  the average   year survival
rate of people with a localized brain tumor  grade i 
diagnosed early  is          however  if the brain
tumor is diagnosed after metastasis  the   year survival rate quickly drops to less than          in other
words  an early and accurate diagnosis is essential
for full recovery  thus  it is important to develop
new methods to improve existing imaging methods 
we propose using unsupervised learning algorithms
such as k medoids clustering  and k means clustering
in combination with   dimensional gabor filters and
gaussian blur to directly analyze mr brain images
in order to find clusters related to specific types of
brain tumors  since some types of brain tumors are
less responsive to specific kinds of treatments that
are highly eective for other types  the classification
of dierent types of brain tumors can help doctors
find more eective treatments  hence  our classifications may prove to be helpful not only in early detection but also in improving cancer treatments of brain
tumors 

 

 
   

analysis and methods
classification techniques

we use dierent unsupervised learning algorithms including k means and k medoids clustering      we
cluster the described images in order to meaningfully
correlate spatial regions to tumor areas  in particular  we cluster each voxel based on its z score relative
to the mean and variance of the distribution of pixels  as a means of standardizing over several dierent
scans  both k means and k medoids are sensitive to
initializations  however  we use matlab software
which runs k means    a version of k means that
uses a heuristic to find centroid seed for k means clustering      k means   improves both the running
time and the quality of the final optimum  we use kmedoids because of both its usefulness for clustering
categorical data where a mean is impossible to define

dataset

we use the      brats dataset  containing four
types of magnetic resonance  d images  mri  of
the brain of each cancer patient  each image has
four modalities  flair  t  pre contrast  t  postcontrast  and t  weighted    an additional segmen 

gives better definition for edema and tumors  t modalities enable dierent imaging contrasts that dierentiate parts of the
tumor and normal adjacent cells 
  a voxel represents a value on a regular grid in threedimensional space

gaussian blur

we first preprocess the voxels by convolving with a
gaussian kernel  this kernel produces a distribution
of which the mean is at the kernels center         and
that then decays outwards by the euclidean norm  in
particular  we convolve our pixel values with a kernel
of the form

g x  y  z

which can be done efficiently given  t   by multiplication in the fourier domain  this generalized transform is useful and natural in the detection of features such as edges and other rotationallyinvariant features due to their similarity to receptive
fields in animal experiments      these characteristics make it a desirable choice for experimentation
in a high dimensional space which cannot be visually
inspected 
in order to decompose   dimensional images into
relevant texture features  we generate a large gabor
filter bank to be convolved with the   dimensional
image for the purpose of classification      these resulting values are then appended to each pixel vector  which is then used to classify each a priori into
k groups by the algorithms defined in the previous
section 

the resulting smoothing spatially correlates pixels in
the image according to the given  matrix      e g 
the larger the value of   the larger the bandwidth
and the more correlation induced between spatially
more separated pixels  in the current application  the
bandwidth of the gaussian convolution kernel was
found using cross validation

gabor filters

furthermore  we add features to the images pixel
values using gabor filtering by convolving with a sinusoid modulated by a gaussian curve

generally speaking  the gabor filter is a special
case of a wavelet basis in which the function that
forms the basis minimizes its standard deviations in
both the time and frequency domains       generally
speaking  wavelet transforms take the form

becomes our gabor wavelet

our analysis of the tumor using k medoids clustering is slightly better than the analysis with k means

identical to the contours of the tumor as indicated by
the doctor

our analysis of the tumor using k means clustering
and with gabor filters     filters  is better than the
analysis of the tumor with k means clustering but
without gabor filters  the resulting image does not
only indicate exactly where the tumor is located in
the brain  but it also seems to contain even more
information about the tumor than the image that was
analyzed by the doctor

conclusion

the notion that we may have general classes of brain
tumors is likely to be an extremely helpful one  not
only in the identification and prediction of their behavior  but also possibly in the treatment of such abnormalities  it is not difficult to imagine that there
may exist several types of brain tumors each with
their own idiosyncrasies regarding medical treatment

the analysis with gaussian blur preprocessing
gives a dierent result  we expected the convolution
gaussian blur preprocessing to reduce image noise 
nevertheless  the gaussian blur preprocessing significantly reduces the details of the image  and as a result the contours of the tumor as indicated in the
 

fi e g  some tumors may be less responsive to specific kinds of treatments that are highly eective for
other types  for which automatic classification and
description will greatly help patients and doctors in
treating them  overall  our classifications may prove
to be helpful not only in early detection but also cancer treatment of brain tumors  thus increasing overall
survival rates
