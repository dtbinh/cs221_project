predicting a student s performance
vani khosla
abstract
the ability to predict a students performance on a given concept is an important tool for the
education industry  it allows for understanding what types of students there are and what are key
concepts that help shape the understanding of another  these are important factors for educators
to know in order to constantly modify and improve educating tools  such as text books and
lecture plans   this paper aims to build a predictor  by finding similar students for a given
student and predicting their performance on a concept they have not explored based on past
performance 
i  introduction
education is one of the most important industries in todays world  and while it continues to
develop in meaningful ways  finding the best practices for teaching and the best evaluation tools
is still a difficult problem  this project aims to predict a students performance or score on a
concept based on how other students have performed  their own performance on other concepts 
and their own performance on any previous questions answered  this can naturally lead into the
prediction of if a student will get a question right by using the analysis provided  this is an
extremely helpful tool in the education industry to predict how a student will perform as it can
help shape educational tools to provide a better learning experience  many experiments have
already been done to show that things like location  wealth  and students who are better at math
and science will perform better than their counterparts  but this project aims to move away from
these evaluations to find more a different result  the student specific data will not be used in this
paper  and more data focused around the concepts and the specific questions will be used for
features 
ii  related work
much of prior work done in this area of interest relies on predicting student performance based
on classification and regression models  one of the most popular ways of doing so is by using
student demographics  such as wealth  location  age  to create a classifier that identifies student
performance  results from several projects indicate that there is a strong correlation between
student demographics and performance  but this information is not new and does not provide any
new insight  a different experiment built a predictor to predict the time required for a student to
answer a question and whether they would answer correctly  the features used included the
students demographics  the topic  the problem  and the time spent on the question by a student 
the model was found to be very accurate  correctly predicting the time it would take for the
student to submit a response and the likelihood of the response being correct  while there exists
some efforts of building a recommender modelnguyen thai nghe  lucas drumond  artus
krohn grimberghe  and lars schmidt thieme built a recommender model that used matrix
factorization that performed well based on similar student demographicsit is still a novel idea
for student prediction purposes  and one such model will be explored in this paper  the model
proposed in this paper will not be using matrix factorization  but instead will use similarity
measurements such as pearson correlation similarity to determine which students are most
similar based on performance on the same concepts

ii  dataset and features
the dataset is provided by ck    foundation  a non profit organization whose stated mission is
to reduce the cost of and increase access to k    education  ck    has provided their own
material on many concepts and makes this material accessible to students for free online  at this
time  several schools have been using the ck    material in their classrooms  ck    has data on
student performance on practice quizzes and quizzes for many different concepts  the dataset
chosen for this project has been specified below in table    in order to get this into a workable
format  each data point was added to a csv file  where one row represented one data point and
features as described in table   
table    the raw features provided for each data point
test score
id
encoded ids
student id
question id
level
correct
time spent
duration
created

unique id for a practice quiz
unique id for a ck    concept  eid 
unique id for a user
unique id for a question
question difficulty level   very easy    easy  
 medium    hard    very hard  
set to  true  if the user answered the question
correctly  otherwise  false  
time spent by the user to answer the
question
time spent by the user on the entire practice
timestamp denoting when the practice was
started

this current dataset is driven by the question id from each practice quiz  in addition to the data
already provided  ck    has student data like grade  school  and location for many of their
students  note this data  student demographic  is not being used for the project  for this project 
the data is parsed to include the student id  the encoded id  eid   and the students score on that
eid  as calculated by the number of correctly answered questions belonging to that eid divided
by the total number of attempts on questions belonging to that eid  
in order to filter out any noisy data  the following constraints were applied on the data  first only
eids part of the biology  sci bio  family were kept  note that the eid key is set as following
three letters to represent the overall topic  three letters to indicate the overall family  and digits
corresponding to the concept  for example one eid found might be sci bio      in addition all
students that have only taken one practice quiz  all practice attempts with less than three
questions answered  and all eids that were attempted by less than     unique students were
removed from the data  finally  for any student who has taken a practice quiz more than once the
score recorded was the average of all attempts  note that this couldve been done in several
different ways  i e  only taking the students first attempt or most recent attempt  however for this
paper the average of all attempts was taken  the original dataset has            data points

before any filtering is applied  but after filtering dataset has         data points with       
unique students and     unique concepts 
iii  models and techniques
k means clustering 
the first thing done on the dataset was to apply k means clustering to see what information could
be found about student clusters  k means clustering is done by assigning features to n data points
 students  and partitioning into k number of groups  the algorithm uses an iterative refinement
technique that works by assigning each observation to a cluster and calculating the means for
each observation by finding the distance between the observation and the cluster center  this
processes is iterated until the minimum means of distance calculation is attained  any value of
from   to the number of observations minus one is a valid k value  however for larger k values
the process takes much longer as the algorithm searches for convergence  the features selected
for this paper are the concept eids  with a score of   or    both are attempted  assigned if the
student has not taken that concept quiz 
predictor based on finding similar students 
the main technique used in this paper is a predictor based off of a recommender system  this
predictor works by finding similar students to predict what the new students score will be for a
given concept  a student is different as similar to another by comparing the concept scores for
concepts taken by both students  there were three different methods used to calculate the
similarity of two users pearson correlation similarity  pcs   euclidean distance similarity
 eds   and tanimoto similarity  ts   these three methods are explained below

d p q      qi  pi   

ts x y    i xi  yi    i xi  yi 
td  x y     log   ts x y  

this implementation is
similar to the cosine
measure similarity  the
pcs is the ratio of the
covariance to the
standard deviation
between two students
scores 

this implementation is also
commonly known as the
root mean squared distance 
it calculates the distance
between two users  where
distance is defined as the
square root is the sum of
the differences of the first
students score and the
second students score
squared  this is a fairly
common method in
calculating the similarity
between two users 

this implementation is also
commonly known as the jaccard
coefficient  the ts between two
students is calculated by the ratio of
the size of the intersection to the size
of the union of their scores  in other
words  it is the ratio of the similar
scores to all their scores  or the
percentage of similar scores they
have

for each of the three similarity measurements above  a model was created for the filtered dataset
and evaluated  the evaluation implementation used is the average absolute difference  the score
from the evaluator indicates the average deviation between the actual score and the predictors
estimate  thus for evaluation purposes  receiving a score of   implies that the predictor perfectly
predicted all the scores of the students in the test set 
iv  results
the initial analysis of the dataset can be seen in figure    this was the k means clustering of the
data by users  from first glance it doesnt appear that there is a strong set of clusters visually that
separates groups of students  however  one thing to note is that for concepts that students hadnt
taken a   was input as the score for the feature vector  this might explain why the data seems to
be clustered in one area  as many students have taken a few concept quizzes but not all of them 
thus the   fills may have skewed the clusters  note that this was also explored trying a    as the
input when a student has not taken the concept  however this tended to skew the data even more 
making the cluster of data points even tighter in the middle of the graph  as seen by the large
portion of observations clustered in the majority section of each subfigure in figure    

figure    k means clustering for n              

while the clustering seems to indicate that there are not strong clusters of similar students  it is
important to note that this doesnt mean that is true  clustering was only done for small groups of
clusters  and it is possible that there exist smaller groups of similar students  moving on to the

predictor phase is the only way to see how if there is strong enough data to properly predict
students performance  for reach implementation  similarity calculation  a different predictor
was built and evaluated to see which had the best performance  the results from the five
different implementations of the predictor are given below in table    from the results  it is clear
to see that the best performing predictor is the tanimoto coefficient similarity predictor  or
jaccard coefficient

the tanimoto coefficient similarity predictor had the best performance with a        average
deviation from the actual results  and the other four predictors showed fairly good results with
between a              average deviation from the actual results  it is interesting to note that
applying weighting to the similarity calculations  i e  weighting the most similar students score
higher than other similar students scores  did not show any change in the results of the predictor 
v  conclusions
the results in this paper indicate that there are similar students and that performance can be
predicted fairly well based on similar users  the students explored in this paper were selected
due to their activity in the biology family  as it is the most commonly explored family in the ck   dataset  its important to note that improvement in this predictor can be made as more data is
collected  since the predictor only finds similarity using the concepts both students have
performed in  the more concepts students take the more the data will be filled in  allowing for
more accurate similarity calculations between students  while the k means clustering didnt
prove to show strong groups of clusters  that doesnt mean that those clusters dont exist  in fact
the predictors performance indicates that there are strong similarities between students and that
student performances can be predicted based on past performance on different concepts 
clustering results can be explored further by changing the cluster size or finding a different way
to represent a students score if they had not taken the concept quiz  in addition more exploration
of the clustering performance can be done in future work using silhouette values 
while the recommender provided in this project gives good insight  it also shapes more questions
that can be explored and answered  in future work  it would be interesting to try and identify
which concepts are prerequisites for others based on student performance  and which concepts
are key for the understanding of an overarching category like biology
