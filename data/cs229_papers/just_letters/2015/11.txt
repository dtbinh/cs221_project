introduction

wearable devices make technology pervasive by bringing it into our daily lives  apple watch and
smart glasses introduce a new lifestyle while smart bands and wearable medical devices change our
ways of keeping track of health  the interaction between our body and the wearable device makes
the technology feasible  thus  it is critical for the device to understand human actions 
wearable devices become more popular and are usually paired with smartphones  in this work 
we explore approaches of recognizing human activities using accelerometer data from smartphones
and wearable devices  the dataset we use records acceleration signals from four positions that are
representable for smartphones and wearable devices  in real world situation  it is more likely that
one only takes one smartphone and another wearable device with him her  so our ultimate goal
is to accurately recognize human actions using two accelerometers  we apply machine learning
algorithms to train and infer human motion  the input of our algorithm is acceleration data from
sensors  we then use gda and svm to output a predicted activity class  the experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method

data

the data used is from uci machine learning database     which captures accelerometer data from
four positions  waist  left thigh  right ankle and right upper arm  these four positions represent the
common locations of our smartphone and wearable devices  waist for smartphone  and the other
three for wearable devices  each accelerometer reading includes the acceleration signals in x  y and
z direction  the dataset also includes users name  gender  age  height  weight and body mass index 
however  these features are less relevant to our problem  so we do not include them as the input 
the raw data is sequentially sampled from the accelerometers  so we randomized the data before
training and testing  we have a total of         samples  in which we take         as training data 
       as testing data  the rest data is used as an extra test set to avoid overfitting the c parameter
in svm  figure   gives an example of raw data from our dataset  table   illustrates the occurrences
of five motion classes

data scaling

the data includes acceleration signals at different body positions  in three directions  so the features
are on different scale  to make feature values comparable  we test two scaling methods to process
xi xmin
our data  zscore  f  xi     xi   and     normalization  g xi     xmax
xmin   where  and 
represent the average and standard deviation of data x  xmax and xmin represent the maximum and
minimum values of data x 
   

principal component analysis

since the feature dimension of the dataset is     it is hard to visualize the data  we use principal
component analysis to reduce the dimension to    i e  three principal eigenvectors and eigenvalues
are used  zscore data is visualized as in figure

methods
gaussian discriminant analysis

since our input features x are continuous valued random variables  we first try using gaussian discriminant analysis gda  model for classification  gda models p x y  as a multi variant normal
distribution  where y is a bernoulli random variable  we construct a binary classification model for
 

fieach class y                  by assigning y  i    y to positive class  and y  i     y to negative class 
different mean vectors       and one covariance matrix  are used 
the model parameters are calculated by the following formulas 
m
p

i  
m

using one covariance matrix gives us straight line boundary  if we use two different covariance
matrices  we will get quadratic boundary  the s are calculated as follows 
p

 x i       x i      t

when given a new input x  we classify it to h  x    argmaxy p x y p y   where y                 
   

support vector machine

a support vector machine is a discriminant classifier defined by separating hyperplane  it aims to
find the hyperplane that gives the largest minimum distance to the training examples  formally  it
tries to optimize the following problem 
m

min w b

x
 
  w      c
i
 
i  

s t  y  i   wt x i    b      i   i         m
i     i         m
cm
i   i

by introducing the
term  we allow an example to have margin less than    but at a cost of
increasing the objective function by ci   c controls the balance between our two goals of making
  w    small and of ensuring that examples have margin less than   

 

experiments and results

   
     

gaussian discriminant analysis
single covariance matrix

using         training data  and testing on         we get        training accuracy and       
testing accuracy  in figure   a   we plot the training error  red line  and testing error  blue line  vs
training data size figure  the plot shows little gap between training and testing error  and both of the
errors are higher than our desired performance  so the model is highly biased 
     

different covariance matrix

using single covariance matrix gives us a linear decision boundary that underfits our data  so we then
explore on using two covariance matrices  which can give us a quadratic decision boundary to fix
the underfitting problem  we now get        training accuracy and        testing accuracy  the
performance has been largely increased  as shown in figure   b   the improved gda still underfits
our data  we also try scaling the data  the results are shown in table    scaling the data doesnt
affect much on the performance

support vector machine

we use libsvm     to perform svm on our data 
     

all four sensors

before scaling our data  svm performs poorly on all the kernels we have tried  sigmoid  radial basis
function rbf   and  th degree polynomial kernel 
after using zscore  the lowest training and testing errors we get are around     using rbf  since the
training and testing errors are close  but still higher than our desired performance  the model suffers
from high bias  to solve this problem  we increase parameter c  the relation between errors and c
is shown in figure   
training on         data  and testing on         we get best performance on svm model using
rbf kernel  with c       we also use extra test set to verify that we are not overfitting c  the
training and testing accuracies on each class are shown in table   

figure     a  error vs  logc  using rbf kernel
     

two sensors

we combine the smartphone position waist  accelerometer data and another wearable device position left thigh right ankle right upper arm  accelerometer data as our input in our next step  as
shown in figure   a   when c is small  the training and testing errors are close to each other  but
higher than our desired performance  so we are underfitting the data  we then increase our parameter c and get best performance when c       the results are presented in table      and    with
rbf kernel 
figure   b  illustrates the confusion matrix  our model tends to confuse between sitting down and
standing up  this is likely due to the fact that our data has less occurrences of sitting down and
standing up  however  in practice  if we can incorporate the previous motion state we classify into
the model  we will do better in distinguishing these two classes  for instance  our model is not sure
 

radial basis function  exp  u  v      we tried tuning   and the default      worked well enough

conclusion and future work

in this work  we explored how we can recognize peoples activities using acceleration data  and
we achieved an accuracy of        in two sensors case  using svm  svm casts our classification
problem into a higher dimensional space  and it becomes more separable than in a lower dimensional
space  the effectiveness of our methods shows that we can accurately classify human actions from
two accelerometers  one on smartphone position  waist  and the other on common wearable device
position 
for future works  we want to incorporate previous and next action classification into current action
recognition  for example  if the previous action is confidently recognized as standing  then we can
put a higher weight on the next action of being sitting down and a lower weight of being standing
up  another future work is adding more activity classes  for instance  running  biking and jumping 
for more complicated actions  it will be helpful if we can incorporate data from smartphone gyro
sensors
