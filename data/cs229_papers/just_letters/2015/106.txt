introduction
the accuracy of private  venture capital backed
company valuations has been a recent popular topic of
discussion  between ubers summer    b valuation and
technology companies like square falling far short of their
previous venture capital valuation during recent ipos   
valuations of private technology companies are quite
disputable  even within professional finance circles 
additionally  venture capitalists admit to investing on gut
feel when presented with a decision to fund a startup   
making the practice of valuing startups seem more an art
than a science 
further  most valuation data is not publicly available 
although the absolute value of money invested in a given
financing round is usually released  it is rarely
accompanied by data about the percentage of the
company it represents at that time  how then does an
external observer who has little to no access to private
company financials and business details attempt to value
a private company 
to estimate valuations of companies  the average
technology company enthusiast relies on public indicators
to compare companies  hoping that similar companies will
yield similar valuations  with large amounts of metadata
and computing power  the next obvious step is to employ
machine learning methods to predict valuations using
data across many private companies drawn from all
industries  this allows us to consume and analyze large
amounts of data in a short period of time and take into
account the larger startup ecosystem 
the input to our algorithm is a series of features
describing various aspects of the private companies 
including funding round data  employee data  location
data and date data  described in greater detail in the
section on feature extraction and selection  we then
use a family of linear regressions to relate these features
to a companys most recent valuation  creating a model
that is able to estimate the valuation of an input company
with reasonable ballpark accuracy

most venture capitalists invest manually by analyzing a
mixture of quantitative and qualitative features  recently 
however  venture capital firm correlation ventures was
founded on the basis of statistical analysis of companies 
it touts the worlds most complete database of venture
capital financings and has decided to construct a
predictive model model using this data in order to decide
what will probably be a winning company  the data
includes financing details  investors  board members 
executive management  industry  market  business
stages  key financing terms and outcomes  however  they
do not release what kinds of statistical methods they
employ to make predictions  additionally  as a new firm
correlation ventures has not yet proved their models
yield great returns 
a few years earlier prior to the foundation of correlation
ventures  gompers  kovner  lerner  scharfstein
published a paper in the journal of financial economics
studying the link between previously successful
entrepreneurs and future success as well as the link
between previously unsuccessful entrepreneurs and  well 
future failure  they employed logistic regression to predict
a companys success based on features describing its
management team  stage and location  this study 
however  focuses heavily on one contributing aspect of a
companys success  and chooses to classify success
rather than predict a valuation 
bhat and zaelit also were successful in predicting the
success or failure of a company using the random forest
algorithm on funding round data  a contributing factor to
their successful model was a feature describing the
network available to a company  dixon and chong later
attempted a similar study  but instead decided to rank
companies in a particular industry sector  they
successfully incorporated a feature describing the
prestigiousness of an investor  they used svms to
classify a company as a future success or failure 
there was not much machine learning research about
predicting the numerical valuation of venture capital
funded company  however  which is the space we
decided to fill 

 

in       about     of private technology companies at ipo traded below the value that they last raised money from venture
capitalists   winkler  r  et al  
 

venture capitalists have been shown to be susceptible to availability bias  where past successful investments can influence future
investment decisions in similar companies   zacharakis  a     shepherd  d  a  

 

fifeature extraction and selection

methods

gathering valuation data and company metadata was
a challenge that a majority of researchers in the
discussed related works also faced  we used a mix of
quantitative and qualitative data points for a total of    
features from several databases  including crunchbases
data hub  datafox and cbinsights   we were able to
gather sufficient data on about     private  venture
capital backed companies for our training examples 
research from zacharakis and shepherd shows that
leadership experience and experience at previous
startups affects investment decisions  so we required
data about management employee backgrounds in
addition to typical company and funding rounds data 
since the top quartile venture capital firms experience
little turnover   we required data about invested parties
as well 
our quantitative features were the following  date of
valuation  total funding to date  date of first funding  date
of last funding  founding year  company headcount 
number of twitter followers  number of funding rounds
and estimated monthly web traffic  being numerical
values by default  these were easily incorporated into our
statistical methods 
our qualitative features described overall industry 
specific market  top investors  top schools attended by
management employees  top previous employers of
current management employees and whether
management employees previously attended a medical 
law or business school  these features required
processing into quantitative form to be incorporated into
our model  assigning each possible value of a qualitative
category a number seemed illogical  for example  in the
top schools category  if stanford is assigned   and
harvard is assigned    a     didnt map to anything in
particular  instead  each value in a qualitative category
became its own feature that could take on the value of   if
the company was not described by that feature and a  
otherwise 
before running our model  we normalized our feature
matrix 

our first attempt at prediction was linear regression
with only our originally quantitative data  using the
following well known hypothesis and cost function 





where x i  represents the ith training example and y i 
represents the ith accompanying valuation  minimizing
this cost function for the most part resulted in estimates
close to the actual valuation for larger companies
 approximately unicorn  status   for small companies
with valuations of around    m and under it performed
particularly atrociously  we realized this was because of
our cost function  the current function doesnt treat a
deviation of   m for a    b company like uber differently
than a deviation of   m for a   m company like plink 
even though   m represents      and     of each
companys valuation respectively  we decided that we
were happy predicting ubers valuation at    b if it meant
our algorithm predicted plinks valuation at   m  and that
in fact we cared about the deviation between our true and
predicted values in percent rather than in absolute terms 
this spurred us to change the cost function to minimizing
the squared percent difference between the predicted
valuation and actual valuation 


although this cost function solved the previous
problem  it introduced a new one  predictions were now 
on average  grossly lower than companies true
valuations  we realized then that this was because the
cost function treats an x times overvaluation of a
company and an x times undervaluation of a company
differently  for example  if a companys given valuation
was   m and it was predicted to be   m  this would have
a cost of     if it instead were to be predicted as    m 
this would have a cost of       although these values
represent the  x overvaluation of a   m company and a
 x undervaluation of a   m company respectively  the

unicorn is a term in the venture capital industry which describes a start up company whose valuation is at least   b 

 

ficosts are not symmetric  to make the costs associated
with a  x overvaluation and a  x undervaluation
symmetric  we created a new cost function 

we believed that the accuracy of our predictions could
be improved by weighing companies with similar
characteristics more heavily when determining a given
company s valuation  this led us to the following weighted
version of our previous cost function 

according to this cost function  a  x overestimation and
a  x underestimation both correspond to a cost of 
with different weights calculated for each sample
according to the formula 
to correct for negative valuations  we performed a
change of variable on theta 

this coerced all predicted valuations to be positive 
after minimizing the cost function above  our model
achieved an acceptable level of accuracy  as measured
by performing k fold cross validation using k      and
computing the empirical residual error on out set of
hypothesized valuations  each hypothesized valuation 

was calculated using a value of  determined by
regressing on a training set that didnt include that
particular sample or any others in its bucket  the order of
the samples was randomized before performing cross
validation  we also experimented with values of k besides
    the resulting residual errors are plotted in figure   
and demonstrated that k      was a reasonable value to
use 
performing    fold cross validation using this cost
function  we found that       of resulting valuation
estimates were more than  x larger or smaller than the
corresponding true valuations  an improvement over
our earlier attempts  for which the corresponding values
were       and        respectively  plotted in figure   

here  x is the testing example whose valuation is being
predicted  the resulting    fold cross validated residual
error of this method  employed on a training testing set
incorporating all available quantitative and qualitative
data  is shown as a function of   the bandwidth constant 
in figure    using       the value that minimizes residual
error        of resulting valuation estimates were more
than  x larger or smaller than the corresponding true
valuations  and       of estimates were more than  x
larger or smaller than the corresponding true valuations 
these values are identical to the corresponding values
prior to implementing a weighted cost function  see figure

fiexperiments and results

the histograms on the left side of the page depict the cross
validation error observed when testing our final weighted cost
function  on a training set that included all quantitative features
and only those qualitative features that we found to be at least
somewhat beneficial  former schools and employers 
as the bottom three histograms clearly illustrate  our model
tends to underestimate the valuations of large companies
 those with true valuations greater than   b   centers around
accurate estimates for mid sized companies  those with true
valuations between     m and   b   and tends to overestimate
the valuations of small companies  those with true valuations
less than     m  
figure   illustrates the overall progression of our predictive
accuracy as we implemented various models  the residual error
of each model was measured by performing cross validation
testing and then computing the sum of squared log differences
between predicted and true valuations  analogous to the third
and fourth cost functions implemented   clearly  the initial
switch from simple linear regression to a percent based cost
function and finally a log based cost function benefitted the
models accuracy greatly  unfortunately  the same could not be
said for adding qualitative data to our training set  many of the
categories we added  including industry  market  location  and
investors  increased residual error and were unhelpful on other
measures of accuracy  like average percent and log error of
predictions and our bucket test  measuring what percent of
predictions were less than  x   x and    x larger or smaller than
the corresponding true valuations

our final  weighted cost function using a training set in random order  with useful qualitative features included 

conclusion and future work
weighted regression using our cost function was
ultimately disappointing and did not substantially reduce
the cost compared to an unweighted version of the same
cost function  this led us to believe that  using our
unweighted cost function  we were already fitting our
model as closely to our data as we could  we were also
surprised by the effect of including categorical data in our
training and testing sets  as we proceeded to add
categories like market  alma maters  investors etc   we
watched as the addition of certain categories increased
the residual error and had little impact on the general
accuracy of our predictions  only three of our categories
arguably benefitted the model  alma maters and former
employers of a companys current employees  adding this
data to our most accurate weighted model resulted in the
following changes

more generally  our results indicate that it is difficult to
accurately predict company valuations based on publicly
available metadeta  but that ballpark predictions can be
made  at the very least  using our model to estimate the
valuation of a company whose valuation data is not
known to you  you can be reasonably confident of being
within an order of magnitude of the true valuation 
for future work  we d like to explore gathering more
data and performing clustering algorithm  we performed
k means clustering on our current data set  but it
categorized uber as the sole member of a single cluster 
more data would make clustering more robust  postclustering  it would also be interesting to perform a linear
regression on each cluster  then  for a given testing
example  we would find the most similar company and
use that cluster s regression to come to a final valuation 
we d like to compare these results with weighted linear
regression
