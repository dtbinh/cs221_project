fantasy football hasballooned during the last  yearsfromatinynichehobbyintoamassive   billiondollarper
year industry  the appeal  at  least in part  is due  to the games elegant simplicity  participants pretend to run a
football team  picking and choosing real players from thenfl  the better theseplayers perform in a season  the

but the  traditional fantasy system above seems to  have been replaced by a new kind of fantasy football  daily

than a traditional turn based draft  dfs has an auction system  where every player has a cost  in this game the

the following  paper details an  exploration of the usage of a linear regression model to project the scores of
quarterbacks for dfs  quarterbacks receive fantasy points based on five statistics  rushing yards  rushing
touchdowns  passingyards  passing touchdowns and interceptions thrown  actualdfspointsarecalculatedbythe
sum of these statistics  each weighted by known scalar values  linear regression isthus a very suitable projection
model  the input to the model changed over the course of the project  but the output remained  constant  a

the aforementioned linear regression model was  the only model explored for dfs quarterback score projections 
this decision was motivated by two factors  first  linear  regression is a natural model for the problemgiven the
calculation of dfs scores second  prior attempts tosolve asimilarproblemin stanfordsmachinelearningcourse
and beyond found linear regressionmodels to perform better than or only negligiblyworse thanothermodels the

thenextiteration of the model was to learn each quarterback statistic individually and weight the scoresbasedon

using the three previous games as shown to the left in  the initial model

the second model each individual statistic is predicted   pass yardage is

the second model performed  noticeably better than the first model in the

a feature  this was challenging from an implementation perspective due to the  difficulty in  acquiring the data 
however  what made it most difficult was determining how to use it as a statistic  because of the approach  of
projecting each statistic individually  it was impossible to simply addit as another feature  instead  an initialscore
wasprojectedbasedonprojectedstatisticsandsubsequentlyadjustedbasedonthedefensiveranking 
the second approach  was to craft a linear regression model for each quarterback individually  as opposed to for
quarterbacks as a whole  to clarify  that means that in order to predict quarterback as score  we learned
exclusively based on quarterback as prior performances and projected forward withoutany knowledge of other

 

fiquarterbacks  the approach proved to be quite  helpful and  was the  last step  in what became  the optimal

fiwhile the model performedsuitably comparedto

performance  as the model was diagnosed to

accuracy 
after the addition of defensive features was
considered itwasdeterminedthatthemostviable
next step would be to consider the
quarterbackspecific model  the motivation was
that  beyond  defensive features  few features
seemed to have the promise of dramatic
improvements   consider the types of features
which  could be added  player  injuries  weather 
stadiumtype  and perhaps others of similar ilk 
qualitative knowledge of the nfl hints that
featuring player injuries would bear the most
potential  but would still be impactful for only a
handful of games and entail obtaining very
complexdata 
from
a
qualitative
standpoint 
the
quarterbackspecific model seemed more
promisingthanthegeneralizedregressionmodel 
the generalized model relies onthe assumption
that most quarterbacks have a similar playing
style   this is a nonissue for most quarterbacks 
for  instance   the nfls top quarterbacks
typicallyscorealargenumberoffantasypointsin 
the same way   passing  however  there are also
quarterbacks with a dominant rushing presence
such as  colin kaepernick  and russell wilson 
thegeneralized model would understandablynot
generalize well to these quarterbacks  and this is
shown quantitatively in figure    russell wilson
and colin kaepernick are  two  of the most
innaccurate predictions alongside andrew luck

the new model was first evaluated within  a

thechange resultedin a     improvement in training error as the average training error was reduced from    to

theresult shown in figure  is reminiscentof the generalized quarterback approach and lessperformantthanthe
single season quarterbackspecific model  although at first surprising  such a result is sensible upon further 
consideration  one may correctly expect the performance of elite quarterbacks such as tom brady and aaron
rodgers to remain consistent across seasons  however  consider quarterbacks such as eli manning and such an
expectation is nolongervalid for instance  eli mannings average dfsscoreper gameinthe      seasonwas
     compared to       in the        season  statistically speaking  eli manning was  an entirely different
quarterback in eachseason and thustrying to model him across the two seasonswassimilartomodelinghimusing
