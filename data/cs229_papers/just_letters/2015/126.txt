introduction
attempts to obtain a universal model of facial beauty by
the way of symmetry  golden ratios  and measured
placement of various facial features fall short in explaining
the varied attraction that is actually witnessed in the world 
in this investigation  we devise an application to give a user
some insight about their type as users swipe yes or no on a
large dataset of images
there is a wealth of interesting literature attempting to
map the psychophysics of attraction  for example  johnston
and franklin        use a genetic algorithm which evolves a
most beautiful female face according to interactive user
selections  they sought to mimic the way humans filter for
features they find the most attractive 
our approach builds on kagian et  al         where it was
shown that feature selection and training procedure with the
original geometric features instead of the eigenfeatures fails
to produce good predictors due to the strong correlations
between the original geometric features 
the input to our algorithm is a dataset of face images 
each image in the dataset is labelled with a positive or a
negative rating from a given user  positive rating implies
that the user finds the face attractive  features are extracted
from these images using nmf  non negative matrix
factorization  and then a naive bayes classifier is employed
to predict whether this particular user will rate an unseen
image as attractive or not

dataset and features


we obtained access to the   k adult faces dataset     a
large and comprehensive image dataset of         face
photographs representative of the adult u s population  the
dataset was created using a random name generator on     
u s  census name distribution  for each name several

a  labelling
in order to figure out a users
type  we require the user to go
through a large number of face
images  labelling each image as it
attracts them subjectively  we
created a web interface with flask 
that serves images from the
database and records the users
associated  yes   no  preference 
at most we could get the users to
label up to             images in
this way 
b  preprocessing
we obtained a training set of images from the   k dataset
by cropping or padding the images as required so that they
are uniformly sized  once grayscaled  each image is
normalized by subtracting from the mean 
iii 
methods
a  eigenfaces
it is possible find an information rich encoding of a face
image that best captures the significant local   global
features of the face  albeit these features do not
necessarily correspond to usual facial features like the
eyes  nose  lips  hair and so on  such encoding can be
found by capturing the variation in a collection of face
images which is then using it to find a low dimensional
representation of each face  mathematically this
translates to finding the principle components of a
distribution of faces in the dataset which is achieved by

finding eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the set
of face images where each image is treated as a point in
a high dimensional space 


publicly available colored photos were scraped from google
image search 

these eigenvectors characterize the variation between
faces the faces in the   k dataset  it follows that each
individual face in the   k dataset can be reconstructed
as a linear combination of these eigenfaces

b  non negative matrix factorization  nmf 
nmf takes a matrix x  where xi j is the i th element of the jth image in the dataset  nmf decomposes x   zh  the lines
of matrix can be considered as a basis images and the
vector h j as the corresponding weight vector  the nmf
imposes non negative constraints in both the elements of z
and of h  thus only non subtractive combinations are
allowed  this corresponds with better features as images
dont cancel each other out 

b  gaussian naive bayes with nmf
features were generated using      faces from the data
base  the classifier was trained on      ratings and tested
on      ratings  we found that using top    non negative
eigenvectors yields     accuracy on predicting unattractive
faces and     accuracy on attractive faces  the table below
shows how the classifier performance shifts with the number
of eigenfaces used 

the nmf implementation in scikit learn finds a
decomposition of x into w and h  by optimizing for the
squared frobenius norm 
first    sparse components found with nmfactorization
of images in the   k adult faces dataset 

    correspond with negative and positive ratings
respectively 
c  prediction
   k nn
to predict whether a given user will like a previously
unseen face  we find a labelled face image with the
encoding closest to the face in question  it is then
possible to predict whether the user will like this face
given how they rated its nearest neighbors  these knearest neighbors are found using euclidean and
mahalanobis distance 
   gaussian naive bayes
in this approach  the continuous values associated with
each feature are modeled as a gaussian distribution and
a  naive  independence is assumed between the features  



iv 
results
a  k nn with eigenfaces

this method succeeds     of the time in identifying
unattractive faces but only shows    accuracy on
recommending faces that a user may find attractive  this
result makes sense given the structure of this data 
where the average user in our study only rated      of
the images as attractive  so most of the image points are
negatively rated 

v 
conclusions and future work
reconstructed images that represents the ideal type for our
users given how they labelled the many varied faces on our
data set  the image is generated by taking a mean of all the
weights associated with faces that the user rated positively 

attraction is subtle and difficult to verbalize  yet patterns in
attraction can be found as users swipe through tens of
images every day on the dating apps that have cropped up 
these dating services could improve the user experience
considerably by making use of this information  our
investigation shows that it is feasible to recognize such
patterns particularly in that we mimic the constrained binary
input a user might offer to an app like tinder 
there are many directions this work can take in the future 
more obviously we would like to leverage demographic
labels in a dataset so that users can choose a target age range
and gender when labelling images  this way we can hope to
have more positively rated image points that the algorithm
can learn from  having a prior distribution on features that
demonstrably indicate health could improve the prediction
step
