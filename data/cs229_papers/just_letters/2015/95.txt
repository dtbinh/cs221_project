background
imagine yourself looking out the window on a
commercial flight at the aircraft engine outside  for
four years  i worked at honeywell aerospace as
product design engineer in a research team
investigating flutter and forced response issues in
turbomachinery for aircraft engines  flutter is an
aeroelastic issue that can cause near instantaneous
and catastrophic part failure  it results from the
unsteady interaction of a structure prone to vibration
with an airflow  blade sections can tear away from a
rotating component and destroy an engine  figure  
shows british midland flight     a crash precipitated
by an aeroelastic issue in       two blades of the fan
are missing   torn away during flight

aeroelastic issue
a commercial jet cruises at about mach          ths
the speed of sound   however  due to the rotation of
the gas turbine engine fan and the increasing velocity
of the air over the surface of the fan blades  a portion
of the airflow over the fan typically experiences
supersonic flow conditions and a weak shock wave 
such a flow field is called transonic  phenomena like
transonic flutter in turbomachinery are predicted and

          
mitigated using computational fluid dynamics  cfd  
specifically fluid structure interaction modeling 
a cfd analysis is spatially local and involves
computing a differential equation on a large number often millions   of discrete points throughout a
computational domain  although cfd analyses are a
vast improvement over wind tunnel or rig testing
alone  they are computationally expensive  which is
limiting to the engineer trying to rapidly iterate and
optimize a product  optimizing a fan design while
mitigating flutter risk can take months because a full
aeroelastic analysis typically takes   days even with
modern computational tools  while methods exist to
increase the speed of a cfd analysis  no
commercially available real time methods accurately
predict the aeroelastic behavior of turbomachinery in
the region of transonic stall flutter 

introduction
in reduced order models  roms   a dataset already
exists with numerous full cfd simulations  from
that dataset  the intention of roms is to learn how to
make good predictions in the future by creating a
simple model based on what is already known  the
goal of reduced order modelling is to simplify the
complex system to run in real time  enabling
significant cpu time reductions 
in the first stage of reduced order modeling  the
solution vectors  snapshots  are split into sub regions
defined by local basis vectors using k means
clustering  illustrated in figure   below  these
clusters are formed based on thousands of snapshots
from full cfd simulations  the k means algorithm
identifies where the solution exhibits significantly
different features so that these vectors can be
assigned to sub regions  a singular value
decomposition  svd  is computed to reduce the size
of the matrices and create a local reduced order basis
 rob   using these robs  a simulation is modeled
as a combination of a much smaller number of
vectors than the number in the original cluster of
snapshots  in the second stage of the method  a
residual minimization problem completes the analysis
and can compute a solution in real time 
this methodology has been applied at stanford by
the farhat research group      and applied on a  d
burgers equation and an acceleration study of a
transport aircraft  the potential of the method has
already been demonstrated for various cfd and
fluid structure interaction problems including
aeroelastic problems     and problems involving
moving shocks

use column cluster indices to reorder the
vector v back into original matrix order

and its projection

methods
the data from one cfd simulation is placed into one
vector called a snapshot  a matrix a is constructed
with all pre computed snapshots along the columns
of the matrix  i propose a new method for clustering
the data according to procedure   
procedure    row column clustering and preprocessing steps to create a rob 
  
  
  

  

construct matrix a with pre computed
snapshot vectors along columns
apply k means clustering to columns of a
saving column cluster centers and indices
apply k means clustering to the rows of
each submatrix formed by the column
clusters of a
perform svd on submatrices and save the
desired number of right singular vectors

the procedure only applies to matrices with single
variables saved  velocity for example  but can be
expanded to matrices with multiple cfd variables 
additionally  its not necessary to run a reduced order
model to determine whether the rob constructed via
the procedure is accurate  a representative vector can
be chosen from the original snapshot and projected
onto the rob built by the procedure  by plotting this
projection and or calculating the rms error between
the original vector and its projection into the rob 
the quality of the reduced order basis can be
ascertained 
procedure    additional steps for projection of a
representative snapshot vector v onto its rob 
  
  
  
  

use column cluster indices to determine
which column cluster contains the vector v
use column cluster indices to reorder the
vector of v to correspond to its submatrix
use row indices to split vector along each
row cluster of a
perform projection within rob subspace

the implementation of k means clustering was done
in python using cluster k means contained in the
sklearn library      k means clustering was
implemented twice on the matrix  once on the
columns  followed by the rows  because all terms of
both the rows and columns of the original matrix are
rearranged to construct the submatrices  the method
involves considerable bookkeeping  but is otherwise
simply an application of k means twice  it could be
categorized as a form of biclustering 
to emphasize  the end goal of this procedure is not to
analyze the dataset  the procedure is a starting point 
this pre processes the data to create an improved
reduced order basis that models a complex cfd
simulation  which you can use to run previously
computationally expensive simulations in real time for the purpose of either better understanding of the
parameters or optimization 

related work
biclustering and co clustering are well known
procedures for a variety of machine learning
applications  most notably gene expression      other
work has combined k means clustering with linear
discriminant analysis      however  biclustering
algorithms do not appear in literature that output
center vectors like those output by the row column kmeans procedure described in the methods section 
and these mean vectors are required to complete the
reduced order model computation 
also  different forms of domain decomposition are
common in fluid mechanics  the domain is often
split along mesh lines evenly for parallel computing 
typically the split for a given domain is determined
manually by the engineer considering the particulars
of a given design      in this case  what makes it
possible to compute sub domains more generally and
independent of mesh is that this procedure is not
computing full cfd solutions along mesh lines  the
results of cfd simulations are givens  roms are
computed  off the grid   therefore  there s more
freedom in how to create sub domains  making the
application of machine learning algorithms for
domain decomposition for roms full of possibilities 
in sum  k means has been used to cluster subdomains
     and it has been used to cluster snapshots      but
little or no research has been done to combine the
benefits of the two

importantly  one problem encountered consistently in
reduced order modeling for cfd is that shock waves
are not well modeled by robs  a shock wave occurs
when a wave moves faster than the local speed of
sound  it is characterized by an abrupt  nearly
discontinuous change in pressure  therefore  svd
implementations suffer from unphysical gibbs
oscillations near the shock wave discontinuity     
capturing the discontinuity and reducing the gibbs
oscillations is difficult without a full order model in
the region of the shock  some     have applied
domain decomposition  but they resort to
implementing a full order model in the region of the
shock in order to resolve it 
while initially the intention of this project was to
research and implement adaptive clustering
algorithms  i had an interest in clustering along the
rows of the cfd domain  when the susceptibility of
roms to gibbs oscillations became apparent  the
goal of the project was changed  the row column
clustering procedure was conceived as a form of
domain decomposition in order to improve the
modeling the shock wave discontinuity  figures  
and   demonstrate how the shock wave splits the
solution into distinct domains of supersonic and
subsonic flow

in supersonic flow

dataset   and features
the row column clustering procedure was applied to
two test cases  a simple  d burgers equation and an
oscillating airfoil case 
for a full three dimensional cfd solution  the data
could contain millions of points  at each point in the
mesh  many variables are saved  if      snapshots
are generated  each containing the variables for all

          
points in the mesh for an analysis  this creates a very
large matrix to analyze  therefore  the first step is to
find a simplified problem that can be used for testing 
but implement it in a way that allows it to be scaled 
the solution of a one dimensional burgers equation
is such a case 

figure    burgers equation solutions for test case
the one dimensional burgers equation test case is a
fluids application of an initial boundary value
problem  ibvp  that models the movement of a
shock wave  figure   shows the velocity w vs 
location x as a shock wave moves from left to right in
time across the domain  working with matt zahr in
the farhat research group  i obtained a burgers
equation dataset and a python code that runs the onedimension burgers problem and implements column
clustering using the cluster k means function from
the python library sklearn  there are      points in
the mesh  and one variable  velocity  is saved per
coordinate  x  i used a set of      snapshots  because
the problem is much simpler than a full navierstokes simulation      s of snapshots can be
generated in a few minutes  each column represents a
different time or different initial or boundary
conditions 
figures   and   show the results for a simple columnonly clustering procedure that splits the data into two
clusters  figure   shows the two cluster centers
generated for the snapshots  a look back at figure  
reveals that the clustering has captured two patterns
that characterize the snapshots in time  figure  
shows the results calculated for a representative
snapshot and the vector projection of that snapshot
onto the first basis

the implementation of row column clustering was
found to substantially improve the quality of the
robs for the burgers equation in the proximity of
the shock wave discontinuity  figure    shows the
damping of the gibbs oscillations for the case of a

number of row clusters from    column only

dataset   and features
the second test case for implementing the rowcolumn clustering code was a  d unsteady cfd
solution of an airfoil twisting and flexing in time  a
 d airfoil simulation models a slice of a full  d cfd
simulation of  for example  a wing or turbomachinery
blade  the twisting and flexing of the airfoil in time
is analogous to the twisting and flexing of a vibrating
turbomachinery blade  figure   shows the response
of a fluid to the unsteady motion of a blade over time

dataset

figure     reduction of gibbs oscillations due to
row column clustering
additionally  because these oscillations are the
primary source of the error in the rob  represented
by the rms difference between a representative
vector and its projection onto the rob   the error is
greatly reduced by applying row column clustering 
figure    illustrates the reduction in rms error as
the number of column clusters are increased  given a
fixed number of row clusters  figure    illustrates the
reduction in rms error as the number of row clusters
is increased  given a fixed number of column
clusters  row column clustering is clearly an
improvement for both conditions

included in this snapshot matrix  and the procedure
has not yet been expanded to accommodate this 

figure     rms error reduction with increasing row
clusters given fixed number of column clusters
additionally  row column clustering was run on the
second dataset  because of the  d nature of this type
of simulation  the row clustering for a given cluster
was possible to visualize  figure    visualizes the
row clusters  colored by number  of the particular
column cluster for a representative vector  this
example in particular may show a case of overfitting 
given the multiple clusters used to model a single
vortex  yet it also demonstrates that the clusters are
partially aligned with flow structures  in this plot  for
example  typical flow structures like the free stream 
vortices  boundary layer  and stagnation point are
captured by the clustering

conclusions
the main achievement of this project has been to
establish a proof of concept for future work in
applying machine learning algorithms like k means
to both snapshot clustering and domain
decomposition for reduced order modeling of
computational fluid dynamics results  the ability of
the row column clustering method to capture shock
waves is a novel contribution  while results are
currently limited to the simple  d burgers equation
case  the method can be implemented easily on far
more complex models 
the potential implications are many  cfd for
transonic and supersonic flow is used in the design
process of many aerospace products  for example 
aircraft  engines  and spacecraft  this improvement
can have wade ranging impact across the industry 

future work

figure     row clusters colored by number
finally  a representative snapshot and its projection
onto its row column clustered robs were visualized 
figure    shows the representative snapshot  its
column only projection and its row column
projection  while there is only slight visual
improvement in the modeling  this is to be expected
because the dataset does not contain any shock
waves  future work will involve obtaining additional
datasets and testing row column clustering on  d and
 d datasets with shock waves  most likely  the
benefit was slight also because multiple variables are

next quarter i will continue the project as an
independent study course with the farhat research
group  and potentially submit the work to nips  kmeans is a very rough form of domain decomposition
for cfd solutions  so there is much room for
improvement  one limitation is that this
implementation of k means row column clustering
does not take into account the locations of the
features in actual space  one proposed improvement
is to weight k means according to the spatial
locations of the points 
also  the row column clustering procedure must be
expanded to accommodate multiple variable types in
the original snapshot matrix
