introduction

there are nearly        private foundations in the united states that manage approximately      billion
in assets  give nearly     billion in grants each year  and benefit from large tax breaks      despite their
importance in the social sector and their favorable tax status  private foundations have very little external
accountability  control over private foundations is highly concentrated among the founding members 
and is not influenced by shareholders  customers  or even competitors      theories in organizational
behavior suggest that  given the lack of external oversight  private foundations might not be particularly
effective vehicles for the funding of charitable services  for instance  the initial charitable purposes of
a foundation might become secondary to administrative concerns over time  resulting in fewer grants
distributed and increased overhead 
we apply unsupervised learning methods to better understand the landscape of private foundations
in the united states  using the financial information of all private foundations submitted to the irs from
           using dimension reduction techniques such as pca  we look for a compact way to summarize
the universe of foundations  using clustering methods such as k means and gaussian mixture model  we
then find groupings of foundations that have similar financial positions  we discover that foundations
can be split into three clearly separable groups in just two dimensions based on either their expenses or
their asset composition 

 

related work

the foundation movement is a relatively new phenomenon in american philanthropy      unlike public
charities  private foundations tend to contribute to charitable work solely by making grants      which
reflects a larger shift from participatory activism to checkbook activism        
the concern that the foundations might accumulate or misuse their money instead of distributing
them resulted in a tighter regulation of foundations spending in the tax reform act of       b  marx  
marx uses regression to analyze the foundations finances before and after       as marx finds  the
regulation indeed discouraged donors from giving to foundations for the purposes other than charity 
however  it also increased administrative costs to run a foundation  which repelled donors from giving
charitable donations 
the      law also required foundations to spend at least    of their funds to qualify for tax breaks 
sansing and yetman     examine whether this minimal requirement affects the spending of foundations
using regression analyses  they discover that only about half of foundations adhere to the    benchmark 
but the ones that spend more tend to grow faster and attract more donors  moreover  deep and frumklin
    suggest that the    grant policy has not provided foundations with the right incentives to distribute
their wealth to non profits 
although foundations are of growing importance in the united states  the      policy has remained
mostly unchanged      at the same time  to our knowledge  there have been no studies applying unsupervised learning to foundations  our analysis seeks to add to the discussion on the regulation of
foundations by grouping foundations by their financial behavior 

 

dataset and features

by law  private foundations are required to report key financial information to the irs via an annual
filling of form     pf  required disclosures include information about sources of revenue  operating expenses  financial assets  major program activities  and charitable purposes  this information is digitized
 

fiby the irs and made available to the public  the national center for charitable statistics has collected
the full set of form     pfs for the years                
in total  this dataset contains    financial features as well as numerous categorical variables describing
the charitable purpose of the foundation  annual counts of organizations vary over time from about
       fillings in      to around        fillings in       we focus initially on       as it is the most
recent year with good coverage  after grouping foundations in       we also examine the development
of those groups over time 

figure    distribution of administrative expenses       
we faced a few challenges in getting this data in a form that could be easily analyzed  the size
distribution of private foundations is highly skewed  a few prominent organizations  most notably the bill
and melinda gates foundation  are much larger than the typical private foundation  to correct for this 
we identified two possible scaling methods  the first strategy is to use the log function to scale variables 
this resulted in data which look to have a gaussian component  as well as a large point mass at zero  the
second strategy was to transform totals with log  and turn component variables into percentages  for
example  total revenue would become log total revenue   while revenue from contributions would become
 revenue from contributions   total revenue   the advantage here is that we think these transformations
might meaningfully distinguish foundations from one another  the downside is we had to drop around
    of the data because of negative values  unrealistic percentages  etc  an example of the unscaled 
log  and percent distributions for administrative expenses is shown in figure    since the log scaling
resulted in higher granularity  we mostly used log scaled data 

 
   

methodology and results
pca

some of the features in the data are linearly correlated  e g  different types of revenue and total revenue  
which suggests that the data has fewer dimensions than the number of features  therefore  our first step
was to perform principal component analysis in order to reduce the dimensions of the data for better
data visualization  using r  we applied pca to the scaled      data  we summarize our output by
looking at the percent of variance explained by each pc in figure   
in the log transformed data we see a dramatic amount of variance explained by the first pc  upon
examining the factor loadings  we observe that they are all of the same sign and of similar magnitude 
we interpreted this to mean that the first pc was picking up a general foundation size  the plot suggests
that at most five pcs are needed to summarize the data  and perhaps as few as two would be sufficient 
we find a similar  less dramatic result for the percent transformation  again the first pc explains a lot
of the variance  additionally  we see elbows after the first three and six pcs 

   

k means

our first approach to discover structure in the data was to apply k means clustering  we fit the model
with multiple choices of k  using twenty starts to avoid getting stuck in a local optimum  the ratio of
between cluster sum of squares and total sum of squares provides a good approximation of the variance
explained by the model  we present output for both the log and percent scaling in figure    in the log
 

fifigure    percentage of variance explained vs  number of principal components       
scaling  we see an elbow around    clusters  in the percent scaling  there is a much less noticeable elbow
around    clusters 

figure    k means output  cluster sum of squares   total sum of squares vs  number of clusters
we next plot the resulting clusters against the two principal components  the plot with five clusters
is shown in figure    at this point  we identified two challenges in moving forward  first  the principal
components are difficult to interpret  as they were derived from a multitude of variables  second  k means
does not seem to be able to pick up on the gaussian looking data structure that appears in figure

mixture of gaussians

to capture the gaussian looking distributions  we moved to a gaussian mixture model  using pythons
scikit learn module      to address the challenge of interpreting the pcs  we further subset the features
of the log scaled data into separate categories  expenses  revenue and assets  we also attempted to
eliminate the colinearity from the data by tossing out variables which are linear combinations of other
variables  as we are mostly interested in how foundations manage their endowments  we focus on only
two groups of variables  expenses and assets  pca on these subsets of variables results in the principal
components shown in table

table    principal components in log transformed data  expenses and assets subsets  for     
as before  the first principal component has loadings of similar magnitude and the same size for
both expenses and assets subsets and explains more than     of the variance  the second principal
components of the expenses subset suggests that the second dimension is the log of the ratio of a
foundations officer compensation to the contributions the foundation has distributed in grants  for
assets  the second principal component is the log ratio of government bonds to corporate stock 
applying the gaussian mixture model  gmm  to expenses and assets gives us visually apparent and
easily interpretable clusters  figure     we were mostly interested in the clustering based on expenses 
on the left plot in figure    as the size of the organization increases  the green colored group spends
relatively more on grants and less on compensation  while the blue and red groups exhibit an opposite
relationship  the larger the size  the more they spend on compensation as compared to grants  for assets 
we identify three main clusters that correlate with the riskiness of their asset portfolio 
interestingly  it appears that there is no correlation between the clusters in the expenses gmm and
the clusters in the assets gmm  as seen in figure    in which the same labels were applied to clusters for
expenses and assets  foundations from all three expense clusters appeared in each of the asset clusters 
this indicates that the riskiness of a portfolio has little to do with how a foundation uses its money

development of clusters over time

next  we look at the years           to see if there were any trends in cluster development  as figure
  shows  all clusters have grown in size over time  surprisingly  we discovered that the red cluster  high
compensation relative to contributions  began emerging only in       sansing and yetman     identify
the period from      to      to be the period of significant asset appreciation for foundations  which

 

fimight explain the emergence of the red cluster  however  the exact reasons are not certain and require
further research

conclusion and future work

while there is a clear split between three categories of private foundations both in terms of expenses
and asset allocations  we still cannot conclude with certainty which group  if any  is more efficient in
managing their funds and has greater community impact  while it is tempting to assume that foundations
with greater overhead  ratio of officer compensation to grant contribution  are fiscally irresponsible  the
corresponding clusters could also indicate different types of foundation purposes  i e  health vs  arts  
as well as quality over quantity foundations  what we can conclude with high confidence is that the
portfolio composition of a foundation is not indicative of how it spends its resources 
further analysis would require a more micro level approach  the first step would be to identify
specific foundations in each of the aforementioned clusters  with the goal of determining what qualitative
traits are shared among the foundations in a particular cluster  further research can also focus on
understanding whether foundations migrate from one cluster to another over time  what specific events
cause such movement  and what factors cause the foundations to allocate their funds in different ways  by
incorporating micro level analysis  we could get closer to discovering one or more metrics for evaluating
a foundations true effectiveness and impact 
nevertheless  our results are an important step towards understanding the foundations spending
behavior  given that we have identified three distinct groups  policymakers may want to consider more
customized regulations rather than a one size fits all approach
