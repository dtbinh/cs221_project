introduction

rate of a patient with breast cancer changing over time based on some related genomic
data 

background

cancer is more of a severe health issue than
ever in our current society  as severe as it is
lethal in general  there are many factors that
may affect a patients survival  it is not easy
to find a clear pattern to predict the survival
outcome of a cancer patient  which could be
a complex process involving different biologic
conditions  based on previous studies  many
features are considered to potentially affect a
survival event  cancer type  age at diagnosis  treatment pathway  time since diagnosis 
and some specific genome patterns that may
relate to the progression of the cancer disease  while some of these features  such as
cancer type and age at diagnosis  are relatively explicit and have more direct relations
with the survival outcome  some other features  such as gene mutations and methylation levels  seem more complicated and require more effort to analyze the potential interactions among these features  in this paper  we mainly focus on the pathological conditions of the patients without examining different treatments of cancer 

   

our first step is to understand how genomic
data is influenced by different factors  such as
gene expression for different rna  copy number value  and the methylation level for different dna  by doing feature correlation analysis and feature selection in genomic data  we
identify cancer related genes and their targets  the most challenging task here is to
distinguish the driver mutations  as a subset that truly contributes to the tumors progression  from a large number of neutral passenger mutations that characterize the cancer  based on some previous studies  we guess
that a support vector machine method might
be helpful during this process 

at the second stage  we have relatively
fewer features for genomic data that may affect the cancer survivals  so it could be easier
for us to conduct a merge based on the patient id in the survival dataset and the sample id in the genomic dataset  this would
help us to relate all the genomic information
to the survival results so we could combine
them with other potential features and start
to train our model  after that  we would estimate and compare the performance of the
models by using some cross validation methods 

goal and outline

in this paper  we want to understand a
patients survival rate given his her genome
pattern and time interval since diagnosis 
our ultimate goal is to predict the survival

data

large compared with others  so we believe its
more likely to get valuable results when trainthe data of our project is from ing on this dataset 
nih national institutes of health  project 
and we obtained them from professor olivier
gevaert  the data are all pre possessed   
methods
log transformed  and well separated based
on cancer type into    dataset 
    feature selection
the whole dataset is comprised of two
for most of our datasets  the numbers of
parts  first part is a dataset of patient id 
features
are much larger than the numbers of
cancer type  time since diagnosis  timetolastcontactorvisit in days   and his her sample  p  n   which can cause some diffisurvival status  normally   alive    dead   culties when training the data  for instance 
second part are some large lists about ge  the sample size of the gene expression dataset
nomic data  each cancer type has one for breast cancer is only      while the correlarge list  in each large list  there are   sponding feature size is        which is much
datasets which separately contain gene ex  larger than the sample size here  a potential
pression data  copy number data  and methy  problem that can be caused by this is overlation data  all the data are pre processed so fitting  to avoid this problem  the first thing
there can be some negative values in these needed to be handled is to reduce the number
of variables in these datasets 
charts 
the first step we did here is to find varithe first genomic data we used in this
ance
of each feature and get rid of the features
project is the gene expression data  basically  for each sample  a high  large positive  with low variance  for example  the variance
gene expression value for a specific gene code range of gene expression features for breast
means the information encoded in this gene cancer is from      to       and we find most
has been highly interpreted  while a low of these features have relatively low variances 
value indicates that most of its information we assume that the low variance predictors
has been hidden  the second genomic data have less predictive power  which is not alis called copy number variations data  this ways true  we just use this simple method
data represents the structural variation of a to obtain a first impression of the data   so
specific gene  a larger copy number implies we tried removing some predictors with small
that the gene might be duplicated so that it variance and use    fold cross validation to
becomes more than the normal number while see how this process may affect the model
a smaller copy number denotes a deletion in performance  table   shows the model pera specific region so that the number is less formance based on different variance threshthan the normal number  during these years  olds 
  of selected
methylation also becomes an important confeatures based on
    
    
   
  
  
cept in the cancer research  so our third
the threshold
 
 
 
  
  
dataset records the pattern of methylation for variance threshold
                                            
each sample  an aberrant dna methylation svm
naive bayes
                                            
pattern  such as hyper methylation or hypomethylation pattern  can usually be associ  table    error estimations of svm   naive
ated with many types of human malignancies  bayes using    fold cross validation
in this project  due to time limit  we would
only focus on breast cancer brca   the
as we see  for an svm model  theres no obsample sizes of the brca dataset is relatively vious improvement by reducing feature size 
 

fitimetolastcontactorvisit as a continuous feature variable and trained svm models on it  however  the performance of these
models seems unfavorable  which may be explained by us not handling this term in a right
way  an alternate method to deal with it is to
treat this term as a part of response instead of
a predictor  we will discuss why it could be
important to correctly handle this term later
when we analyze our sample results 
based on previous study  a common way to
combine the timeline and status of an event
is to create a new type object  usually called
surv or survival object  which is a small
data matrix that contains comprehensive information of an event  in this project  we
used cox model to fit the survival data  the
cox model has the form 

however  for a naive bayes model  the smaller
the number of variables is  the better accuracy is achieved  one possible explanation for this is that the actual model  with
raw data  violates the conditional independence assumption of the naive bayes model 
which means some genes may work together 
and their expression values can probably be
highly correlated  the accuracies for both
svm and naive bayes model are close to   
percent  however we dont think these models are actually good at this point since we
found that all of them tend to predict   alive 
rather than   dead   and the corresponding
roc curves imply that the models are uninformative 
to solve this problem  we decided to improve our feature selection process and use a
more reliable method to pick important features  according to previous studies  training
logistic regression models on each feature separately and ranking them by lowest cv error
can be a good method to find valuable features  we picked the top     genes with the
best performance on individual training  and
then ranked them again by using cox model
to reduce the final feature size to be     details in next section  

 t x       t  exp   x          p xp  
     t  exp x    

we used functions survfit and coxph in
the survival package in r to train the models with cox model and then fit the survival
object the next problem we met in this part
was the large time cost of fitting cox models
on hundreds of features  to improve the efficiency of our models  we ran cox models on
each feature individually and pick the top   
    survfit and cox model
cox ranked genes to be our final features in
our model  after training a cox model on the
after significantly reducing the number of    features  and predicted a survival curve
feature variables  we then combined all the for each test sample and calculate the cross
important features to the survival dataset  validation error for our model 
one important point to notice is the feature
variable timetolastcontactorvisit  it indicates the number of days from a patient was  
results and discussion
first diagnosed breast cancer to his her last
visit date  if the patient is dead  this vari      interpreting
survival
able represents the duration to death  if not 
curves
this variable becomes a censored data  as we
different from other types of response  surdont know actually what the patients current status is  we only know this patient was vival objects cannot be directly compared
alive x days after the beginning of study  x   with the original test data  therefore  we
timetolastcontactorvisit   in previous need to find a way to transform our predicpart  to simplify the model  we treated the tions back into two level       factors to cal 

ficulate model errors  figure     and   are several examples of survival curves that can help
to illustrate this transform process  each plot
represents one patients survival curve 

the first patients survival curve is much flatter and higher than the second one  however 
since we are looking at different timeline  the
two patients are both predicted dead at their
timeline  respectively

figure   compares two examples with status   at last contact  although the two surfigure   gives us an example of two patients
vival curves look very different  they can have
with similar timelines and different survival
the same event status based on different timecurves  since at the     th day  the first
lines  the survival curve of the  st sample
patients survival rate is around      while
seems much better than the curve of the  nd
the second patients is around      we predict
sample  so we may predict that the survival
the first patient alive and the second patient
rate of the  st person is higher than the  nd
dead 
person  however  after considering the time
from the example of three comparisons of
information of the last contact  its easy to
graphs 
we can see that both survival curve
find that the survival rate of the  st person
on the     th day is around      while the and and timeline determine how we predict
survival rate of the  nd person on the    th the living condition of a patient 
day is around       which is higher than the
survival rate of the  st person in this case 
this example clearly illustrates that time      comparing models on diftolastcontactorvisit is a crucial term that
ferent datasets
can affect our predictions to a great extent

currently  we set the threshold as     in the
cox model to predict the cancer patients survival status  in the future  we could raise the
threshold so that we will increase the specificity while not decreasing the sensitivity too
much 
moreover  we hope to find a way to combine
gene expression and methylation data and use
combined dataset to have a better prediction
on cancer patients survival status 
other than breast cancer  we could broaden
our research on other cancer types as well
