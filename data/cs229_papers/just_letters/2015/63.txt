    introduction  
as   one   of   the   leading   causes   of   mortality    coronary   artery   disease    cad    is   a   complex   disease  
influenced  by  both  genetic  and  environmental  risk  factors   numerous  genome wide  association  and  
epidemiological   studies   have   shown   that   environmental   factors   such   as   exercise   and   consumption   of  
fatty  food   and  genetic  makeup  both  influence  the  risk  of  developing  cad   however   little  is  known  
about   the   interactions   between   genetic   and   environmental   risk   factors    in   this   study    we   aim   to  
discover  genes  and  genetic  variants  that  interact  with  artery  inflammation   we  use  coronary  artery  
smooth  muscle  cell   casmc    constituting  more  than       of  atherosclerotic  plaque  mass   to  model  
coronary  arterial  tissue   casmcs  switch  between  a  synthetic  phenotype  when  stimulated  with  serum  
 disease   state    and   a   contractile   phenotype   when   resting    healthy   state     we   therefore   use   serum  
media   and   serum free   media   to   model   inflamed   and   normal   casmcs    we   use   generalized   linear  
models  to  detect  interaction  effects   the  inputs  to  our  model  are  two  vectors  of  integers  representing  
total   expression   and   allele specific   expression    either   maternal   or   paternal    of   any   given   gene    in  
addition    the   model   requires   a   vector   of   binary   environmental   factors    the   model   uses   a   likelihood  
ratio   test   to   output   a   binary   prediction    which   takes   value       if   the   given   gene   interacts   with   serum  
stimulation     

    related  work  
two   methods   exist   to   detect   gene by environment   interactions    knowles   et   al    proposed   a  
generalized  linear  mixed  model  framework  to  detect  interactions  with  both  discrete  and  continuous  
environmental   factors       however    since   effect   sizes   for   interaction   effect   are   usually   smaller   than  
main   effects    the   model   is   underpowered   with   small   sample   sizes    in   fact    the   proposed   procedure  
was  tested  on       samples  to  ensure  enough  power  in  detection  of  moderate  interaction  effects   an  
alternative  approach  is  to  stratify  samples  by  environmental  conditions  and  analyze  each  condition  
separately          expression  quantitative  trait  loci   eqtls   fig       are  mapped  using  total  expression  
information  in  each  condition  separately   and  the  difference  between  two  sets  of  eqtls  is  considered  
environmentally  interactive   this  model  is  well  powered  for  moderate  sample  sizes           but  it  is  
only  able  to  model  binary  environmental  factors   moreover   both  methods  seem  to  be  underpowered  
for        samples   we   obtained   for   this   study    section         a   previous   attempt   used   fisher s   exact   test   on  
the   gene   level   to   increase   power    unpublished   data     this   method   successfully   detected        
environmentally  interactive  genes   but  lost  the  ability  to  detect  associated  interaction  eqtls   in  this  
study    we   leverage   recent   methodological   advances   in   eqtl   mapping   to   jointly   models   allele specific

interact  with  serum  stimulation   
    dataset  and  preprocessing  
we  have  obtained      casmc  samples  collected  under  two  environmental  conditions   eleven  samples  
are  cultured  in  serum free  media   sf   to  emulate  the  contractile  phenotype   another  ten  samples  are  
treated   with   fetal bovine   serum    fbs    to   induce   the   synthetic   phenotype    we   performed   rna  
sequencing    rnaseq    and   whole genome   sequencing    wgs    on   all   samples    we   aligned   rnaseq   data  
to  the  human  reference  genome  v    using  star   and  wgs  data  using  bwa   we  called  wgs  variants  
using   isaac   and   quantified   total   expression   using   htseq   and   allele specific   expression   using   custom  
scripts    we   correct   known    age    sex    ancestry    batch    and   latent   covariate   of   total   expression   using  
peer    self reported   ancestry   is   confirmed   using   pca    figure   not   shown     we   imputed   missing  
variants  and  phased  haplotypes  using  impute   with        genomes  reference  panel   for  each  gene 
variant  pair   the  input  to  our  model  is  a     by     matrix    each   row   of   the   matrix   represents  a  sample   
and  the     columns  are  paternal  allele  read  count   maternal  allele  read  count   environment  variable   
and   test   variant   genotype    fig          since           genes   are   testable    and   on   average   each   gene  
associates   with          test   snps    there   are        million   matrices   in   total    we   do   not   have   a   test   set  
because   there   is   no    ground   truth     however    our   statistical   test   controls   the   false   discovery   rate   to  
         

    methods  
     binomial  generalized  linear  model  
we   model   the   allele specific   count   given   the   total   count   as   a   binomial   random   variable    this  
modeling  choice  naturally  leads  to  a  binomial  generalized  linear  model   the  binomial  distribution  is  a  
member  of  the  exponential  family

     bglm  to  detect  gene by environment  interaction  
our   null   hypothesis   states   that   environment   factors   do   not   influence   allele specific   expression    the  
ratio  between  allele specific  read  count  and  the  total  read  count  is  captured  by  an  intercept      
                  
our   alternative   hypothesis   states   that   environmental   factors   will   influence   the   ratio    or   p

denotes  the  total  expression   the  intercept    accounts  for  mapping  bias  and  other  unknown  global  
factors    and      represents   the   environmental   variable    we   use   likelihood   ratios   to   test   the   significance  
of  the  environmental  term

     generalized  linear  mixed  model   glmm   
the  generalized  linear  mixed  model  is  an  extension  of  the  generalized  linear  model   in  this  model   we  
decompose  the  mean  effect  into  a  fixed  component     and  a  random  component      
                     
                           
we  model  the  random  effect  as  a  gaussian  random  variable   
                   
the  variance  of  the  random  effect  is  chosen  to  be  conjugate  distribution  inverse  gamma   the  hyper 
parameters  a  and  b  are  estimated  by  pooling  information  across  all  genes   
     linear  model  to  test  variant by environment  interaction  
interactions  between  genes  and  environment  are  usually  driven  by  genetic  variants   we  use  a  linear  
model  to  test  for  significant  variant environment  interactions   
                        
                               
in   the   above   models    n   is   the   total   expression    and      and      are   the   genetic   and   environmental  
influences   on   gene   expression    respectively    the   null   hypothesis   states   that   the   genetic   and  
environmental   effects   are   additive    whereas   the   alternative   hypothesis   states   that   they   can   be  
multiplicative   we  again  use  likelihood  ratios  to  test  the  significance  of  the  interaction  term   
     jointly  model  total  expression  and  allele specific  expression  to  increase  power  
we   use   the   software   package   wasp   to   map   eqtls       wasp   gains   power   by   combining   total  
expression   and   allele specific   expression    in   brief    wasp   models   the   total   expression   using   a  
betanegativebinomial   distribution   and   allele specific   expression   using   betabinomial   distributions   
betanegativebinomial  is  an  overdispersed  poisson  with  two  hyper parameters   and  betabinomial  is  
an   overdispersed   binomial   distribution   with   two   hyper parameters    the   use   of   overdispersed  
distributions  effectively  controls  type  i  error  rate   
     simulation  
to   quantify   the   number   of   samples   needed   to   identify   true   positives    we   simulated   total    n    and  
allele specific    y    read   counts   using   overdispersed   poisson   and   binomial   models    respectively    all  
hyper parameters  are  estimated  from  real  data  using  the  generalized  linear  mixed  model   
                 
                                                            

    results  
     interaction  testing  is  underpowered  for  small  sample  size  
we   restrict   our   analysis   to   chromosome        to   reduce   computational   time    after   filtering   for   bi allelic  
loci    we   found          loci   that   have   at   least       heterozygous   individual    after   further   filtering   for   loci  
with   larger   than        heterozygous   samples    we   are   left   with         testable   loci    we   performed  
likelihood   ratio   tests   using   the   binomial   generalized   linear   model   described   in   section         for   all  
testable   loci   and   observed   marked   enrichment   towards        indicating   presence   of   environmentally

interactive   genes    figure   not   shown     however    we   observed   patterns   of   overdispersion   when  
comparing   glm   with   permutation   test   p values    as   shown   in   fig         the   red   points   lying   above   the  
diagonal   is   indicative   of   deflation   of   likelihood   ratio   p values   and   increased   type   i   error   rate    we  
think   the   overdispersion   is   caused   by   latent   data   structure   such   as   pcr   duplicates   during   the  
sequencing  process   adding  a  random  effect     corrected  for  overdispersion   section         in  fig       the  
black  points  lying  below  the  diagonal  indicate  conservative  estimates  of  p values  of  the  mixed  model   
under  the  null  assumption   the  p value  distribution  is  uniform  so  we  compared  glmm  p values  to  a  
uniform  distribution   fig        the  black  points  lying  close  to  the  diagonal  suggests  little  evidence  for  
presence   of   environmentally   interactive   genes    further    the   black   horizontal   line   corresponds   to   p 
values  of      which  is  typical  of  an  underpowered  study   we  hypothesize  that  setting  total  read   depth  
threshold  would  prioritize  testing  of  significance  genes   indeed   the  number  of    s  decreased  as  the  
threshold  increased   however   the  study  is  nonetheless  underpowered  as  clearly  shown  in  fig       for  
completeness    we   carried   out   interaction   eqtl    iqtl    mapping   on   the   list   of   genes   with   nominal  
glmm  p value  less  than        using  a  linear  model   section         not  surprisingly   we  did  not  discover  
significant  iqtls  after  multiple  hypothesis  correction   figure  not  shown    
     simulation  reveals  glmm  requires  larger  sample  size  
we   hypothesize   that   increasing   the   number   of   samples   will   salvage   the   power   issue    to   test   this  
hypothesis    we   performed   simulation    section          using       different   sample   sizes   and       different  
interaction   effect   sizes    with        samples    the   true   positive   rate   is   below        even   for   a   large   effect  
size  of        controlling  type  i  error  rate  at          on  the  other  hand   a  large  sample  size  of       can  
recover   more   than         of   true   positives   for   medium   effect   size   of          fig          we   conclude   that  
binomial  generalized  linear  mixed  model  is  underpowered  for  our  study   
     joint  modeling  of  total  and  allele specific  counts  improves  power  
a  recent  study  shows  that  joint  modeling  of  total  and  allele specific  expression  can  improve  power  to  
detect   eqtls    section              we   adopted   this   strategy   to   map   eqtls   for   two   environmental  
conditions   separately    concordant   with   their   observation    joint   modeling   is   well   powered   for   small  
sample   sizes   of        and         fig          interaction   eqtls   are   subsequently   defined   using   a   two step  
procedure   in  step      we  obtain  a  list  of  significant  eqtls  in  our  condition  of  interest  using  a  stringent  
fdr  of       in  step      we  obtain  a  list  of  eqtls  for  the  other  condition  using  a  lenient  fdr  of        
the  difference  between  two  sets  is  taken  as  interaction  eqtls  for  the  condition  of  interest   this  two 
step  procedure  is  conservative  as  only  eqtl  with  significant  difference  between  two  conditions  are  
selected   figure     shows  an  example  of  iqtl  chr              this  snp  regulates  rrp a  in  opposite  
directions   under   two   environmental   conditions    other   genes   found   includes   thoc     a   regulator   of  
cholesterol  metabolism  and  has  been  implicated  in  cardiovascular  diseases      and  a galt   another  
metabolic  regulator  that  has  been  previously  associated  with  obesity  and  heart  diseases      

    conclusion  and  future  work  
leveraging   both   total   and   allele specific   counts    we   discovered   several   environmentally   interactive  
variants   and   their   associated   genes   despite   small   sample   sizes    currently    we   only   analyzed  
chromosome        for   the   sake   of   computational   efficiency    we   hope   to   scale   up   to   the   entire   human  
genome   in  addition   we  will  compare  iqtls  with  relevant  gwas  variants  to  test  for  enrichment  in  
overlapping    last   but   not   least    we   will   perform   weighted   tests   by   incorporating   epigenetic  
information   obtained   from   atac seq   assays    the   result   of   this   project   shows   promises   for
