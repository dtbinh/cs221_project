this project presents a machine learning based fatigue crack sensor
evaluation scheme without using a physical model  a supervised binary
classification problem is defined to distinguish damaged steel specimens
from intact specimens  sets of time series wave propagation data collected
by the fatigue crack sensor are utilized for the proposed scheme  in order to
apply supervised learning methods  different feature sets are defined based
on the sensor data using discrete fourier transform  dft   two third of
collected data are used as the training set while the rest are used as the test
set  the preliminary analysis shows that the features consisting of amplitude
distribution in frequency domain and the quadratic kernel function yield the
most desirable performance  the trained svm model  however  performs
not very well for the test data set and needs to be improved  especially with
larger data sets to reduce high variance  nevertheless  the proposed learning
scheme implies that the wave propagation data has some trend reflecting
damage state of a specimen  which shows a great potential of machine
learning techniques for fatigue crack analysis 

  
  

 

introduction

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

as sensor technologies mature and become economically affordable  the use of sensors for
the health monitoring of infrastructures  such as bridges  will continue to grow     
developments of advanced sensing materials and devices  e g  piezo lead zirconate titanate
 pzt  and fiber bragg grating  fbg  sensors  can also provide measurements for detailed
and precise structural evaluation         together with routine maintenance and inspection
reports  the collected sensor data is expected to enable the diagnosis of potential structural
problems and the prognosis for the need of structural strengthening and repairs  while
current research trends of fatigue crack sensor mainly focus on the physical model based
analysis to find cracks in infrastructure  little efforts have been spent on the machine learning
based scheme  which has great potential with increasing amount of sensor data  the data
analysis issues need to be dealt with to reduce the computational cost of the model based
analysis as well as to find data patterns that has significant correlation with the level of
damage 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

in this project  a data driven crack evaluation method based on the machine learning
techniques is proposed to better support the decision making process of bridge owners  first
of all  i defined a supervised binary classification problem to distinguish damaged and
undamaged specimens  to develop and validate the proposed method  i prepared wave
propagation data sets collected using a fatigue crack sensor developed by lim et al      and
divide the data into training set and test set  a few dog bone steel specimens whose true
damage status are already known are used for the wave propagation test      the raw sensor
data is pre processed using discrete fourier transform  dft  so that different features that

fi  
  
  
  
  

might represent the damage pattern can be extracted  four different feature combinations are
defined for preliminary training stage to find the most promising feature set for crack
evaluation  in addition  different kernel functions for support vector machine  svm  are
implemented to reduce the training error  lastly  the trained model is evaluated based on the
test data set 

  
  

 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

research efforts on bridge monitoring and damage evaluation mostly focus on the traditional
physical model based approaches  while little research efforts have started to attempt to
implement machine learning method for the bridge management  many studies on damage
detection method proposed probabilistic model updating schemes based on finite element
 fe  model of a structure         for example  iman and babak conducted probabilistic
identification of a simulate damage on the dowling hall footbridge using bayesian finite
element  fe  model updating based on markov chain sampling      while this approach
works well for the very significant damage of a simple bridge  but it is not appropriate to
catch the onset of a damage and to evaluate complex structures involving very large degree
of freedom followed by enormous computational cost 

  
  
  
  
  

to overcome such limitation and to detect the onset of damage  advanced sensing materials
and sensors are developed and utilized            a fatigue crack sensor proposed by lim  for
example  shows great performance to catch very tiny crack on a specimen based on the
ultrasonic features collected by sensor      however  this method requires many different
combination of excitation to detect a small damage followed by long sensing duration 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

on the other hands  some studies have started to implement machine learning methods for
bridge management applications  oconnor et al implemented gaussian process regression
 gpr  to find the environmental impacts on the behavior of telegraph road bridge  mi  and
suggested that there is a bilinear correlation between temperature and the natural frequency
of the bridge      green et al also suggested machine learning based system identification of
dynamical system scheme and showed that the proposed method performs well to predict the
tamar bridges traffic dependent behavior      however  the machine learning applications
in bridge management are still very limited  and especially researchers rarely spent research
efforts on the application of machine learning techniques to evaluate structural damages 

  
  

 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

the fatigue crack sensor system consists of two exciters and sensor s   and the exciters
creates high and low frequency wave  respectively      once the exciters creates wave
propagation  the sensor measures time series vibration data as described in figure    a   the
sampling rate is     mhz and the sampling duration is     second per an excitation event  for
excitation  six frequency values ranged from     khz to     khz are used for high frequency
 hf  excitation  while a single frequency     khz  is used for the low frequency  lf 
excitation  nine steel specimens are prepared where five of them are intact and four of them
are damaged  in addition  two sensors are installed for each specimen  as a result  i have    
data sets as calculated by equation

in this project    data sets serve as the training set and the rest    data sets are used for
testing trained models 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  

i prepared four different feature combinations that have potential to represent damage state
of specimens  and pre processed the data to extract those features  for the first feature sets 
the raw time series data is discretized into          and    buckets  and the mean  standard
deviation  maximum  and minimum amplitude are calculated for each bucket  the time series
data is also transformed into frequency domain  as shown in figure   b   to extract features
from the distribution of frequency contribution for the second  third and fourth feature
combinations  the selected feature combinations are described in table

the problem defined in this project has exactly two target classes  intact and damage   and it
means that a supervised binary classification method is needed to solve the problem  support
vector machines  svms  are one of the most powerful supervised learning algorithm
classifying labelled data  for the separable data set  svms find the best hyperplane that
separate all data points into the currect classes with the largest margin       finding the best
hyperplane can be descirbed as an optimization problem as equation      whose solution
gives the optimal margin classifier

where   is lagrange multipliers  by minimizing equation     with respect to  and   we
can obtain the dual optimization problem as described in equation      which is

instead of using the input attribtues      in equation      we can map the attributes to some
new set of quatities          which called feature mapping  given a feature mapping  
we define the corresponding kernel to be 
            
   

   
   
   

note that computing the kernel takes only    times  while computing the feature
mapping    explictly take       this is called kernel trick  and it makes applying
svms in high dimensional feature space very efficient

for the non separable data set  svms can use a soft margin that permits some data point
have functional margin less than    in other words  the hyperplane now do not necessarily
separate all data points currectly       the optimization problem for the non separable case
is described in equation      where   is slack variable and  is a penalty parameter

due to the lack of prior knowledge of the relation between features and target  i tried
different kernels including linear kernel  quadratic kernel  and gaussian kernel  since the
given data set is not guaranteed to be separable  the box constraint c is defined  i firstly set c
as a large value  e g      and continuouly decrease it to get better training accuracy  the
result shows that the training accuracy is highest when c is    the k folds validation is
implemented to prevent over fitting  i used k    folds which is a typical choice for k  the
primary metrics in the training stage are the high training accuracy as well as small
false negative ratio  because the ultimate goal of this project is to evaluate damage of bridge
structure  where a certain level of safety margin is desirable while false negative evaluations
may lead very disastrous result along with a great loss to the society 

   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   

firstly  the data point distributions of each feature set are plotted in figure   to choose the
most appropriate feature set  figure   shows that the feature set   has significant trend that
divides the damaged set from the intact sets  the training accuracy for each feature set can
also be found in table    figure   shows the roc curves and confusion matrices of svms
using linear  quadratic  and gaussian kernel with the feature set    and the corresponding
training accuracy can be found in table    the training results indicate that the svm with
the quatratic kernel has the best results in terms of the defined metric   training accuracy and
false negative ratio

in the test stage  the trained svm model using the quadratic kernel and feature set   is
evaluated based on the test data set  figure   describes the distribution of data point of entire
data set and the confusion matrix for the test set  unfortunately  the test accuracy is much
poorer than the training set and the false negative ratio is also unacceptable  one of the main
reason of this high variance problem would be the insufficient data points  since only    
data points are used in this project  another typical way to settle the high variance problem is
to reduce the number of features  but the number of features used for the test is not very large 
so that the feature reducing scheme is not applicable here  rather  it might be worth a try to
define different feature sets based on the additional prior knowledge about the correlation
between wave propagation properties and damage states 

   
   

 

   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   

in this study  a machine learning based fatigue crack evaluation method is proposed  sets of
wave propagation data collected by fatigue crack sensor are prepared for the training and test
data  and dft is performed to extract meaningful information from the raw data  svms are
applied to solve the classification problem distinguishing damaged and intact specimen  and
the quadratic kernel function shows better result than other kernels  the proposed method
performs well for the training set  while the trained model result in an inaccurate
classification result for the test data set  in the future work  i will prepare more data set and
try different features to reduce high variance  and thus  improve the proposed method
