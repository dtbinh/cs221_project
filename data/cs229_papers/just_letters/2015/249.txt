abstractin this paper  we compare two approaches to feature
selection and three different supervised learning algorithms in the
classification of volcanoes from a regions elevation profile  the
best approach found was a support vector machine used on the
raw elevation values from a region  finding an optimal classifier
for the existence of volcanoes is important as it can help geologists
identify regions of interest in hard to access areas such as the
ocean floor and mars

i ntroduction

a  motivation
the presence or lack of volcanoes is useful in determining
the geographic history of a region  especially for unexplored
regions such as the surface of mars or the ocean floor 
identifying and studying volcanoes present in the region is
crucial to develop a full understanding of planetary evolution 
this project explores the possibility of using features derived
from elevation data to identify the presence of volcanoes  a
model trained on known united states volcanoes could be used
to identify areas of interest for geologists or volcanologists in
areas that are hard to systematically explore  but have easily
attainable elevation data using remote sensing 
b  related works
statisticians  geologists  and geomorphologists have been
attempting to classify primary topographical features of different types of landforms for decades  in       prima et al  used
elevation data and raster maps of regions in japan to identify
different landforms  mountains  volcanoes  alluvial fans  by
extracting ten morphometric parameters from their data  their
classification scheme ended up being based primarily on
standard deviation of slope and topographic openness  their
approach had an     accuracy rate overall  however  they
reported having the highest error rate       for volcanoes  as
a large number of volcanoes were mistakenly classified as nonvolcanic mountains      dymond et al  established an algorithm
for splitting an image of a landform into land components
 regions of uniform slope  for polygonization of a landscape
using elevation alone      this method was successful in
deriving useful information directly from contours  however 
the report  published in       cites insufficient computing
power as a barrier for future research on the project  with
no follow up readily available that may have been performed
later  more recently  rathnam et al  performed a very similar
analysis to what this paper wants to achieve  their team
attempted to identify the location of volcano hotspots using
sattelite imagery of the earths surface      their approach
used an artificial neural network and standard back propagation
learning on color satellite images to develop a classification
scheme  this approach had an     accuracy rate and specifically a false positive rate of      bohnenstiehl et al  took a

very different approach to volcano classification and applied
it to the sea floor  their closed contour model operated by
selecting the lowest elevation contour with a quasi elliptical
shape that completely encloses a topographic high      this
approach is similar to ours in that it attempted to make a
classification based on elevation contours alone  however  the
learning scheme is quite different  finally  as an interesting
template for what we hope our model may achieve  head et
al         analyzed data from the magellan satellite to extract
key features of volcanoes on venus and make a rudimentary
clustering classification based on size and shape      our
project touches on aspect from all of these works  it attempts
to classify regions into volcanoes or non volcanoes  with hopes
of applying the model to regions such as other planets and the
ocean floor  and aims to do so using remotely sensed elevation
data alone 
c  project goals
in this project  we aimed to answer two main questions    
what is the best way to choose features for this problem  and
   what is the best supervised learning model for classifying
volcanoes using elevation data

data acquisition and p rocessing

elevation data was acquired for     volcanoes and    
non volcano regions using the usgs bulk point query service
 bpqs   the latitude and longitude of the center of each
region were run through a script to generate a   x   grid
of coordinates centered around the input point and spanning a
width of     this grid was then submitted to the bpqs to fill
in the elevation at each coordinate  this resulted in     total
examples each consisting off     latitude longitude elevation
triplets  examples of the positive and negative examples can
be seen in figures   a  and   b  
in general  qualitatively  the positive examples tended to
look more sharply peaked and radially symmetric  while
negative examples tended to be either relatively flat  or only
be sloped along a particular direction  these observations
motivated the feature selection 
iii 

f eature s election

two approaches were taken to extract features from the
data  raw elevations and scores 
a  raw elevation approach
the raw elevation approach was to let all     elevation
measurements be the     features for each example  with
location   on the grid being the first feature  location   the
second  etc 

fiprofile  in particular  we saw the rotational symmetry as a good
way to distinguish between ridge shaped mountain ranges or
cliffs and volcanoes  as such a distinction would not be able to
be caught using the elevation difference alone  to obtain this
score  four vectors were extracted from the training examples
grid of coordinate elevation pairs  the center column  the center
row  the forward diagonal  and the backward diagonal  the dot
product of each of these vectors with its mirror image were
averaged and reported as the rotational symmetry score

note that this score results in a higher number for a higher
degree of rotational symmetry and normalizes all scores to a
scale from   to    other measurements were initially tested
that assigned a higher score to regions with a lower degree
of rotational symmetry  for example  one such version of this
method was as such

training examples
 a  datapoints plotted by scores  red points are positive examples  blue

b  scores approach
the other approach  in an attempt to quantify the key
qualitative characteristics of a volcano  extracted two scores
from the data to use as features 
   elevation score  the goal of the elevation score is to
get a sense of the slope of the region  in particular  it aims to
distinguish between flat regions that may have a high rotational
symmetry simply because they are flat and non flat features
that also have high rotational symmetry  the elevation score
was calculated as follows 
scoreelevation   elevationmax  elevationmin

   

other methods were tested as a way of determining the
elevation score that were less effective  namely  we attempted
to use a method that compared the average elevation of the
center ninth of the region to the average of the outer part
of the region  hoping that this would mitigate the effects of
outlying elevations  however  in the positive examples  this
only exacerbated the problems that occurred when the region
was not perfectly centered around the peak of the volcanoes 
   rotational symmetry score  the goal of the rotational
symmetry score was to measure the roundness of the volcano

clustered points

plane
unfortunately  this method resulted in scores that blew
up for too symmetric regions  and the normalized dot product
approach was chosen for the final model testing  a plot of

a  logistic regression
our initial baseline model was logistic regression  i e  we
attempted to fit a vector such that the hypothesis took the
form

    et x

 a  raw elevation

with x including an intercept term  we used matlabs
glmfit function to do so  this resulted in a test set error of
    for the raw elevation features and     for the contrived
scores  see model comparison section for more details   figure
    depicts the   feature fit using logistic regression and figure
    depicts the confusion matrices for the raw elevations and
scores approaches  respectively  in particular  we noticed that
the raw elevation method seemed to overwhelmingly predict
a volcano classification  resulting in a large number of false
positives

we wrote the required code to accomplish this ourselves  this
resulted in a test set error of     for the raw elevation features
and     for the contrived scores  see model comparison
section for more details   again  this method tended towards
many false positives  see figure     for confusion matrix  
c  support vector machine
the third classification method used was a support vector machine  svm  with an rbf kernel using matlabs
fitcsvm function  with a feature space twice as large as the
training set  this method resulted in nearly     error without
regularization  so we chose to enforce l  regularization  thus 
this method fit a weight vector w that solves the following

we empirically chose the box constraint c by comparing accuracy  precision  and recall measurements for varying
values of c and choosing the value that maximized our
performance matrix  performance vs  box constraint plots are
depicted in figure      optimized box constraints for the svm
were found to be      and      for the   feature and    feature models  respectively  this resulted in a test set error
of     for both the raw elevation features and the contrived
scores  see model comparison section for more details   the
svm did not suffer the same false positive problem as the
other two models did for the raw elevation features  see figure
    for confusion matrices

for all feature model combinations are in table  i   figure

and recall results listed are testing error found using a        train test data split 
a  feature comparison
using the raw elevation values as features rather than the
contrived scores resulted in a marked tendency towards false
positives  see figure    for a closer comparison between the
two feature methods for logistic regression and gda 
this result was not entirely surprising  we anticipated
that using raw elevations  while technically retaining more

information about the data  would not accurately capture the
characteristics of a volcano without being mapped to a higher
dimensional  not for the sake of increased dimensionality  but
for the sake of more complexity  feature space  the scores
reduced the amount of raw information fed to the model 
but allowed the logistic regression and gda models to learn
on the interactions between different points elevations  since
the contour of a volcano is clearly related to the relationship
between neighboring points above all else  it makes sense

a  conclusion
the score approach to feature selection  perhaps due to
its more nuanced interpretation of what constitutes a volcano
and its lower likelihood of causing overfitting  outperformed
the raw elevation approach using logistic regression and gda 
however  for the most successful model  the support vector
machine  the two approaches had similar performance  each
obtaining a testing accuract of

that the scores  which made claims about these relationships 
outperformed the raw elevation approach  in addition  with
a total data set of     and a training data set of      the
raw elevations approach had an n on the order of and slightly
greater than m while the scores approach had n an order of
magnitude smaller than m  this means that the raw elevations
approach was much more prone to overfitting than the scores 
because of these advantages of the scores using logistic
regression and gda  it makes sense that using the support
vector machine  which both mapped to a higher dimensional
feature space and reduced overfitting through regularization 
equilibrated the performance of the two feature approaches 
interestingly  this also makes a comment on the choice of the
contrived scores  their comparability to the raw elevation using
the svm indicates that they were a decent choice of extracted
features in the first place 
b  model comparison
the svm far outperformed logistic regression and gda
on testing accuracy  precision  and recall  this was in accordance with what we expected  the svm potentially expanded
the feature space of the scores approach while tackling the
shortcomings of the raw elevations method 

given more time and a larger team  we would have liked
to do a more formal feature selection analysis of features 
when fitting the various models to our data  we noticed that
the parameter vectors were quite sparse  indicating that the
dimensionality of the data could probably be reduced  as such 
running pca on the raw elevation data would be desirable  it
would have also been nice to develop a few more contrived
scores and do a more in depth analysis on the effect of the
different scores on the final model  it would also be interesting
to see if our trained model could work on data from mars and
the ocean floor to identify areas of interest
