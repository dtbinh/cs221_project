i  introduction
nine percent of those aged    or older and about
one third of those aged    or older have
alzheimers disease   the incidence of
alzheimers is expected to triple from      to
            of american adults are
schizophrenic   currently  both of these diseases
are diagnosed primarily through a clinical mental
health exam  however  alzheimers disease and
more recently schizophrenia have been shown to
have a strong neuroanatomical footprint that
appears in a magnetic resonance  mr  scan    
figure   shows a healthy brain along with one
afflicted with advanced stage alzheimers
disease  both from the oasis dataset  described
later   severe tissue loss and important structural
changes can be seen in the latter  this guides our
intuition that machine learning models based on
structural features should prove very effective 
our objective in this research project is to
develop tools to automate  or at least assist 
diagnosis and screening of these diseases using
structural mr brain scan features 

survey of machine learning algorithms on the
datasets we use here  their work is helpful in
providing benchmarks for the kinds of prediction
accuracies that can be achieved for each diseasealgorithm combination  however  their work
does not include robust feature selection or
hyperparameter fitting  which we carry out 
orru et al   perform a review of the current state
of research in using support vector machines
 svms  to identify biomarkers for various
psychiatric diseases  and conclude that  although
harder to implement in a hospital setting  the tools
show promise  their work provides us with some
of the top benchmarks for svm classification
 including the possibility of predicting
alzheimers disease with upwards of    
accuracy   allowing us to gauge the quality of our
results 

then in a hospital setting  a brain mr scan could
be obtained  its structural features automatically
generated as we will describe later  and then fed
into the models we develop in order to assess
whether a patient has schizophrenia or
alzheimers disease

iii  dataset and features
our data was provided by the athinoula a 
martinos center for biomedical imaging   it
consists of schizophrenia data from mind
clinical imaging consortium  mcic  and
alzheimers data from open ended series of
imaging studies  oasis   the oasis data
consists of case    a mild alzheimers  defined
by a clinical dementia rating       and case   
advanced stage alzheimers  clinical dementia
rating     

 
  
 
   

furthermore  for each  we consider two sets of
features  f  contains the volumes of   
anatomical structures  e g  cerebral cortex  lateral
ventricle   as well as    thicknesses of cortical
parcellations  e g  anterior frontal   f  contains
       values of cortical thickness smoothed
with a gaussian kernel  f  and f  were each
extracted from     three dimensional brain scans
for each disease using freesurfer computer
vision software  this feature extraction was
carried out by     

          

  
  


   

 

                   

          

  

  

    
    

  
 

because our feature are continuous we need to
discretize them in order to apply nb  we do this
by splitting features at their median value  we
investigated splitting at the mean  and we also
investigated splitting into more intervals and
taking the features conditional distributions to be
multinomial  however  we found splitting at the
median to give highest accuracy using crossvalidation  splitting at the median was likely
particularly effective because we had balanced
datasets with an equal number of examples in
each class 

both f  and f  contain features that differentiate
between the left hemisphere and right hemisphere
of the brain  f  contains  for example  metrics for
left and right brain white matter  whereas f  is a
less preprocessed
concatenation
of
left
hemisphere and right hemisphere brain data  one
thing we intended to examine is any major
differences in the usefulness of left and right
brain features  given that alzheimers disease is
reported to more strongly affect left brain
structures than right brain structures  

as an alternative to needing to discretize features
we could instead modify nb to model the
conditional distributions as gaussian rather than
bernoulli multinomial  this modification results
in gaussian nave bayes  gnb   our maximum
likelihood estimates of the parameters of the
conditional distributions then become
  
  

  
   
  
   
      

  
  

     
             
 
  
   
 
      

  

iv  algorithms
we employed various algorithms in our attempt
to develop the most appropriate model for each
disease 

where k is the label  intuitively we are simply
taking the average mean and average variance of
feature across examples 

as a first attempt  we consider nave bayes  nb  
nb assumes the conditional distributions of the
features with respect to the label to be
independent  and predicts labels as

we also consider the support vector machine
 svm  under a gaussian kernel  that is  we take
the following primal optimization problem



   arg max ff    ff

with the kernel

for the purposes of evaluating our algorithms  we
use five fold cross validation  since this was the
standard set by the machine learning challenge
      which used a subset of the dataset we
consider here 

 

                exp bcd         d e  
this optimization problem attempts to separate
test samples with the disease from those without
the disease in an infinite dimensional feature
space   we can see that we are using infinite
features by noticing that the kernel itself is an
infinite sum over polynomials   we decided that
a gaussian kernel would be better suited to
separate brain scan features than a linear one 
since especially in the case of f   which is a
rawer  almost voxel level dataset  there is no
reason to expect that the data would be linearly
separable in its initial dimension 

where computationally feasible we use full
backwards feature search with cross validation 
when choosing features for the huge f  set 
however  we use a variance thresholding
approach  first  we rank all        features in
descending order based on their variance across
all samples  we then run the algorithm first on the
highest variance feature  and then move in steps 
adding the next    highest variance features at
each step  we chose    experimentally  by
observing that with such raw data  predictive
ability didnt increase substantially by adding one
feature at a time  finally  we choose the number
of features that achieves the highest predictive
success across all tests performed 

we also consider the  svm  an alternative
formulation of the svm presented above  again
using a gaussian kernel   parametrizes the
fraction of allowed errors and minimum number
of support vectors  the parameter  is restricted
to        whereas the c in the standard svm can
take any positive value  the primal optimization
problem is as follows 

table   reports the top results found for each
algorithm and dataset  first of all  we notice a
predominantly higher performance when
predicting alzheimers rather than schizophrenia
 scz   this makes sense since alzheimers takes
a much higher toll on brain structure  we also see
almost exclusively stronger performance when
running on advanced stage alzheimers  ad   as
compared to mild alzheimers  ad    which is
intuitive since the former is expected to have a
noticeable effect on physical brain structures

finally  we also consider random forests  rf  
a decision tree classifier classifies an input
vector by traversing a tree where each node is a
feature and each edge one of the possible values
of the preceding node  usually the tree is learned
by splitting greedily  random forests extend
decision tree classifiers to make them less
susceptible to fitting  this is done by having
multiple trees  providing each tree only a random
sample of the training examples  requiring each
tree to only consider a random subset of the
features at each split  and finally having the trees
vote to determine the overall result 

nave bayes had unusually high prediction
accuracy throughout when running on five fold
cross validation  it also performed consistently
better than gaussian nave bayes  the fact that
ordinary nave bayes consistently outperformed
its gaussian counterpart suggests that the gnb
assumption that the features follow a gaussian
conditional distribution is not accurate 
when comparing svm and the  svm we see
that we are able to achieve better fitting when
using the  svm  however  both models lead to
high prediction accuracy  which would suggest

 

fithat the data becomes highly separable when
using the gaussian kernel 

we observe that we get no false positives  which
means that a positive output from the algorithm
carries a lot of weight  at the same time  we do
note that the  svm results in a small number of
false negatives  in a clinical context  this implies
that when the algorithm provides a negative
output  we should take care to further assess the
patients condition 
svm with a gaussian kernel is prone to
overfitting on features since we are operating in
an infinite dimensional space and are trading off
an increase in variance for a reduction in bias  we
try to control for this in mainly two ways  firstly
we make sure that our feature selection curves are
not very noisy or oscillating near our choice of
number of features  this smoothness criterion is
a more qualitative metric  but serves to show that
the result is consistent  and not one that shoots up
and down when single features are added  figure
  shows the feature selection curves for running
 svm on ad  f  and ad  f   as we can see
one peaks and the other is fairly constant  yet both
are generally smooth 
another way in which we try to alleviate the risk
of overfitting in svm is that after completing
feature selection  we split the dataset into training
and testing subsets  train the testing set on the
smaller number of features and ensure that its
performance remains strong 

we note the confusion matrix for the  svm
operating on ad  f   total instances averaged
out over the five folds of cross validation

it is interesting to note that feature selection using
variance thresholding  used with svms on f  
led to much greater gains in accuracy for the
alzheimers datasets than for the schizophrenia
dataset  for ad  f  and ad  f  we saw
accuracy gains of   to    percent  whereas for
scz f  the gain is zero  and projecting the

 

fifeatures onto the right singular vectors of the data
matrix does not help   we interpret this as the
features that contribute to better prediction being
more clearly separable on the basis of greater
variance from features that introduce background
noise for the ad data  this is reasonable  given
that alzheimers damages brain structures more
strongly  we would expect for the smoothed
voxels in the affected structures to have a much
higher variance resulting from greater variation
between healthy and diseased brains compared to
background variation in the smoothed pixels
independent of the ad classification

vi  conclusions   future work
we are able to obtain very high prediction
accuracies using the features extracted from mr
brain scans  of particular note are  svm
achieving     accuracy on schizophrenia f  and
    accuracy on alzheimers f   both of which
improve on results found in previous papers  as
well as the      results of nave bayes on ad  
our results suggest it is possible to diagnose
schizophrenia and alzheimers with high
accuracy using machine learning applied to
structural brain mr scans  our results confirm
prior findings of the significant neuroanatomical
footprint of theses disease  our work also
suggests that further increasing diagnosis
accuracy is a promising direction for future work 
even if automated mri based diagnosis of
alzheimers and schizophrenia is not used
standalone  the technology could assist doctors
making a diagnosis or flag at risk patients  in
fact  implementing a machine learning system
that examines structural mri data along with
additional clinical data could be another
promising direction for future work 
for
example  including age would likely greatly
increase prediction of alzheimers  what is
remarkable about these results and those of
related studies is the ability to achieve high
accuracy from just the images 

in regards to our hypothesis that left brain
features would mores strongly predict
alzheimers  we find no considerable preference
for left hemisphere features in our feature
selected models  when running on f  the features
chosen when running our variance thresholding
algorithm are consistently about half right brain
and half left brain  the same seems to hold for
f   where if a left brain feature is selected  its
right brain analog is usually selected as well 
these results suggests which structure a region of
the brain belongs to is far more important than
which hemisphere it belongs to in relation to its
connection with alzheimers 
random forest  rf  had moderate performance
compare to the other algorithms  since the results
of rf are inherently random we averaged several
trials in reporting results  testing on the same
training data we were able to achieve over    
accuracy with as few as   trees and consistently
     accuracy with    trees  as seen in the
table   the accuracy with   fold cross validation
was significantly lower  however  for cross
validation we saw improvement of accuracy
increasing the number of trees up to around     
for further orders of magnitude  further gains
were minimal and computation time increased
dramatically  all these results suggest that rf
has very low bias but continues to struggle with
the high variance inherited from decision trees
despite randomization  increasing the number of
trees reduces variance but has diminishing
returns 

for future work  we would certainly like to
expand this study to other datasets we found 
including one for adhd  we would further like
to contact doctors in order to see how this kind of
method could actually be employed in practice
