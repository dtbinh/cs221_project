introduction
project 
based models of teaching and the
use of maker spaces is becoming an
important trend in modern education  but
how to assess how well a student is doing
on these activities  one hypothesis is  that 
the set of gestures and time a student
applies in solving tasks is a predictive of
how much expertise he acquired  these
kinetic and kinematic variables could
suggest how long a student takestosolvea 
problem  how long he spends in analyses
before testing a tactic or if he is trying a
number of random strategies   when
watching
a
student
performing
problemsolving tasks  an experienced
teacher could infer the signs that his
apprentice is evolving  this skill could be
scaled if we were able to evaluate the
performance of a student automatically 
helping other teachers to identify the
effectiveness  of educational activities in
several maker spaces  in this project  i
apply machine learning to evaluate
participantsinaworkshop organizedinthe
stanfords fablab  by comparing them with
graduate engineering students  experts 
using data from a kinect sensor  the data
consists of the coordinates from    body
points  taken every      seconds  i used
supervised learning algorithms  logistic
regression  svm  to evaluate the
possibility of recognizing expertize using
thisdata

previous work used data from kinect
sensors toseparatepatternsofgait begg 
r    kamruzzaman j       parajuli m
et al         on these works  the  authors
aimed to distinguish young from old
participants by their gait pattern  they
reported good results using svm  what
motivatedmetotestthesealgorithms 
in their study  begg   kamruzzaman
extracted features like range of
movement  kinect features  and angles
for ankles and knee  kinematic features  
the former had  more positive influence
on the results  indicating that kinematic
analysis might be a good choice of
features for these kindofdata 
zafrullaet

reduce the dimension of the dataset 
though noimpactonthelearningefficacy
wasreported 
parajuli et al         reported using
kpca  an algorithm that performs pca
using a kernel  getting better results than
using the usual pca algorithm to select
features for gait recognition  those two
last studies motivated me to test pca on
mydataset

the data used was extracted fromakinect
sensor during the execution of an
experiment at  stanfords fablab  in this
experiment     high schools seniors
 novices  participating in a workshop
performed six assembling puzzles  three
of them were took place before and three
after the workshop  three participants
dropped the workshop and their  data was
excluded  as a control group

the puzzles were executed in the same

besides optimizing the results  iexecuted
feature selection  to identify which

the level of expertise  the best results
were achieved with the following nine

i also performed pca  finding k

  methods
   leaveoneoutcrossvalidation
for each algorithm  i tested the accuracy
on the validation set  i first splitted  the
data in     for training and     for
testing  but due to the small size of the
sample the results were very low  under
   ofaccuracy 
i then chose a leaveoneout cross
validation method  training on the whole
data except for one example at a time and
testing on this remaining example  the
accuracy would then be calculated as the
averageresultofeachtest 
    modelselection
my goal was to separate  experts from
novices  thus i used a       label to the
data  to select the best model for this
classification  i applied the following
classification
methods 
logistic 
regression  svm withlinear polynomial
andgaussiankernels 
logistic regression is a classification
algorithm that only allows valuesbetween
 and  usingthesigmoidfunction 

 

g z     ez


   

this classification chooses     for
g z        and for g z        
svm was used aiming to find an optimal
separating hyperplane in a higher
dimensional space  transforming the data
by means of a kernel function  in this
project  i tested the learning with the
followingkernels 
linear 
k  x  y    xt y    

polynomial degree   
k  x  y     xt y          

gaussiankernel 
k  x  y    exp    x  y        

      datascaling
i my first trial with svm  i hadnt scaled
the data  and the results were indeed very
poor  i then executed data scaling before
training and testing  which gave better
results  as this approach did not seem
very accurate for me  i then executeddata
scaling on the training and test sets
separately  it improved the results even
more 
      choiceofcandgamma
to calibrate the svm algorithm  i used
gridsearch for determiningcandgamma
for the gaussian kernel  testing values for
c                         and gamma  
                        then  i refined the
intervals 

     forward search for feature
selection
because of the small amount of data and
large number of features  the dataset was
prone to overfitting  indeed  i was getting
    trainaccuracy andaround   of

fi
validation accuracy  also  it was
interesting to determine which of the
featuresaremoreindicativeofexpertise 

    pca
principal component analysis is a
statistical procedure that reduces the
number of variables influencing an
observation by selecting  the ones with the
largest variance  although it is not
indicated for feature selection and
optimization  some studies used versions
of pca to extract features from kinect
data  thus  i decided it would be worthto
test it  to select the number of
components  k   i used the following
criterium  k

threshold

where i s are the elements of the
diagonal matrix in the singular value
decomposition

  results
the table   summarizes the results i
obtained using the initial features i
extracted  thus  i was getting the best
results with svm using a gaussiankernel 
which was giving        mistaken
predictions  as i mentioned in the
methods section  i used a gridsearch
algorithm to select c and gamma  finding
the optimum values for c     and gamma
      
to optimize the results  i performed a
forward search algorithm for feature
selection  it selected nine features 
described in the dataset and features

section  with the new  features  i runned
themodelselectionagain reachingthe
i also tested the results for applying pca

the best performance         on test
accuracy  was achieved using a gaussian
kernel  the optimum values  for c and
gammawerec  andgamma

  futurework
the classification results were somehow
satisfactory  although the small size ofthe
dataset  and consequent  difficulty in
performing test plus crossvalidation
instead of only the former as  i did  might
have influenced the results  more and
different data in future work can improve
theconclusions 
an important factor to  advance the use of
machine
learning in educational
applications and assessment  is to identify
which gestures  postures and execution
factors  like speed  are related to good
problemsolving  an interesting follow up
to this project would be to perform the
same analysis substituting the average of
speed and angles  like i used  for the
standard deviation  maybe this would
identify better the divergences that are
indicativeofsolvingapuzzlelikeanovice
oranexpert 
another possible improvement is to use
unsupervised learning algorithms to
extractfeatures
