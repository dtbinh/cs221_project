abstractthe nba draft poses a unique challenge in that
predicting a players future success in the nba is incredibly difficult  we seek to use machine learning techniques to
quantify the attributes that tend to indicate a college players
playing ability in the nba  using historical data from players college careers in combination with their nba career
data  we have developed a model to predict where a player
should be drafted  if at all  in the nba draft  while predicting the exact number of win shares per season that a
player will contribute was difficult  predicting whether a player
would be successful  or what discretized level of success that
player would attain in the nba was easier to predict withwheeler  kevin  predicting nba player performance

i  i ntroduction
in june       forbes reported that the number one draft pick
of the      nba draft  karl anthony towns  is contractually
guaranteed             over the first two years of the contract
with the potential to make             over its entirety of four
years  subsequent draft pick values decrease to just above
a    million    year contract guarantee at the end of the
first round of the draft    th draft pick   such non trivial
investments indicate the high value placed on these players
by general managers who are ultimately looking to improve
the production of their organization  it is thus extremely
valuable to an organization to be able to accurately estimate
the production of a particular player before making such an
investment 
for many years  general managers made these predictions
based on scouting reports  college production  and other objective and subjective criteria  the input to our algorithm  unlike
with general managers  is purely objective data   a players
college statistics  we then use a svm to output whether a
player will be successful in the nba and linear regression to
predict how successful the player will be  thus  we aim to turn
a subjective process of evaluating a players nba prospects
into an objective process and therefore able to make better
draft choices and investments in nba players

while the nba draft is an interesting problem in terms
of predicting a players future success  not many attempts
have been made at quantitative solutions  a former cs   

student used linear regression on nba statistics in order to
predict how many points a player would score given a specified
opponent team      this is somewhat similar to predicting
future success  like we are attempting to do  with the main
difference being that the feature space in this situation includes
past nba data  which would not be available prior to a
player being drafted  furthermore  predicting a players point
total is not exactly the same as predicting a players level
of success  while a player like allen iverson was a prolific
scorer  he was notorious for being an incredibly inefficient
scorer  ultimately hurting his teams chances at winning in
some cases  therefore  classifying success based on win shares
is more accurate 
another cs    project involved predicting a players success from year to year      this group created their own success metric  which was a weighted average of a combination of
statistics to create a canonical player success average  and then
taking the l  norm of a players given statistics for a specific
year to determine that players yearly success  then  the group
classified all players in their dataset into clusters based on
their career trajectories  their methods were interesting  as
they came up with a cluster that contained predominantly
star players  another cluster with average players  and another
cluster with below average players  however  like the above
project  their methods predicted future nba success based on
previous nba data  not previous college data  in this sense 
our project is unique for attempting to classify players into
different groups based off of their college statistics 
iii  dataset and f eatures
a  data collection
it was difficult to collect the data due to lack of easy availability  innacurate sources  and a lack of organized basketball
statistics for both college and nba players  after searching
through many sports websites  we found that basketballreference com had all the data we needed and the easiest html
code to parse 
we programmed two scripts in python to download and
scrape thousands of nba player html files from basketballreference com  these players only included those that had data
recorded for both college and the nba  so some players before
     were not included due to a lack of college data  players
like kobe bryant or lebron james went straight from high

fischool to the nba   a rule change in      prevented this
practice   once downloaded  we parsed through each html file
to extract the basic and advanced statistics for each season the
player played in the nba  and stored the data in the respective
basic and advanced tab separated data files  the downloading
and parsing scripts combined were about     lines of code 
and the scraping took about   hours total to complete 
b  win shares   an nba success metric
in order to quantify how successful or useful a player in
the nba is  basketball reference developed a metric known
as  win shares  this metric is a measure of how many
wins a player is responsible for during their nba career  for
example  during a given game  lebron james might perform
at a level to produce     win shares while his teammates
combine to produce     win shares  assuming their team wins  
for a total of    team  win  basketball reference computes
win shares based off of several advanced basketball metrics 
including modified points  attributing the number of points
scored by a player minus his teams contributions to the point
total   modified shot attempts  league averages for modified
shot attempts  a players defensive rating  measure of how
many points allowed by a player over     possessions   and a
measure of his teams defensive ability  essentially  win shares
provides information on how effective a player is at increasing
his teams point total  offensive win shares  as well as stopping
the other teams point total from increasing  defensive win
shares   win shares were our metric for an nba players
success and our goal was to determine whether there were
certain attributes from college players that accurately projected
their nba win share total 
c  college and nba features
in order to classify or predict a players success based on
win shares  we used data collected from their college careers 
these features included games played  minutes played  points
scored  field goal percentage    point percentage  free throw
percentage  assists  and rebounds  among others  each players
college data was taken as an average over their career  so
certain statistics which were cumulative  like points scored
or games played  were somewhat skewed dueto some players
playing as few as   college season all the way to   college
seasons  we also had access to each players nba data which
we used for comparison with our linear regression method on
college statistics for predicting nba win shares 
iv  m ethods
a  svm
support vector machines are a widely used machine learning
technique for classification problems  although the technique
can also be extended for regression problems   svms work
by attempting to find separating hyperplanes between data
classes that maximize the geometric margin between the data

and separating hyperplane  this gives rise to the following
optimization problem 
 
min kwk 

 w b  

s t y  i   wt x i    b     i           m
in the above equations  gamma represents the geometric
margin between each training example and the support vector
is w  to solve this problem  it is transformed into a convex
optimization problem by solving the dual equation     
b  pca
principal components analysis is an algorithm for reducing
feature space by identifying the axis of highest variation for
the feature space  typically  pca is performed on data that
is normalized to have zero mean and unit variance  pca
then identifies the axis of the data with the highest variance
 and subsequent axes  by computing the eigenvectors of the
datas
matrix in order to maximize the quantity
pmcovariance

 x
u 
 
under the condition of kuk       this
i  
m
pm  i   i t
 
amounts to finding the eigenvectors of    m
 
i   x x
finally  the data is then projected onto a k dimensional subspace  to reduce the feature space dimensionality  by choosing
the projection vectors to be the first k eigenvectors of the data
    
c  linear regression
linear regression is a method used for generating predictions on continuous data  the
goal is to determine the relative
pm
weights  theta  of h x    i   i xi of each feature  x  so
as to minimize the given cost function 
m

j

 h  x i     y  i

this cost function gives rise to least squares  where the
objective is to minimize the mean squared error between the
model and data

a  baseline win share expectation
in order to determine a baseline expectation for our models
performance  we looked at historical data from the previous
   nba draft classes to determine the average win share
total by draft position  using an exponential regression  we
determined a baseline prediction for win shares game for each
draft position  summarized in figure   
while this data was useful for understanding the success
of general managers at predicting player value  predicting
exact win shares was somewhat difficult and thus this baseline
was difficult to apply to our algorithm  therefore  we needed
another way to determine how successful gms were in
predicting a players nba success 
one way to measure success for the nba draft is to better
understand the point of the draft  out of all the players in the

nba currently  approximately     that are starters came into
the league through the nba draft      therefore  one might
simply have the goal of drafting a player capable of starting
in the nba  in order to determine players that were starting
level players  we took all players who averaged greater than
   minutes played per game  over half of an nba game 
over their career and then compared their win share per game
metrics  using our draft class data  roughly        of players
surpassed the mean median  use of median in order to control
for outliers  win share per game metric  implying that general
mangers are succesful at drafting a starter level player only
       of the time  therefore  in predicting whether a player
will be successful based on their college data  we aimed to
beat this mark of        accuracy in classification 

b  multi class support vector machine  svm 
we implemented a multi class svm using libsvm     in
order to classify players in our data into a different numbers
of classes  we tested on three different setups    classes   
classes  and   classes  the classes are based on win shares
per game and are roughly broken down into the following
classifications proportional to the number of players in each
class in the nba     mvp candidate players  top    of nba  
   all star players     players each year      of nba     
consistent starters              bench players         and
   non contributing players           we are looking to use
features that pertain to their playing abilities before playing in
the nba  i e  statistics from their careers in college  height 
weight  draft position  etc    the results were encouraging  as
we were able to improve significantly over both chance and
the baseline of        success rate for general managers 
table  shows the results of our multi class svm classification
attempts 

after developing this algorithm  pca was applied to the
features to reduce the feature space  after applying pca  our
feature space was reduced down to   features  games played 
points scored  field goal percentage    point percentage  free
throw percentage  and assists  we then attempted classification
on the same classes and compared the accuracy to the original
classification efforts  the results of this updated model can
be seen in table    it can be seen that with fewer classes
pca yielded worse results  but with   classes  pca improved
classification accuracy slightly  in all cases  however  it could
be seen that classification predictors were far more successful
than strict chance as well as current general manager predictions

d  linear regression
general managers have often admitted to only analyzing
college players basic statistics  e g  fg    p   ast  during
the scouting process  so performing linear regression on
players basic college statistics and their nba win shares can
create the idealized gm predictor 
we were curious to see whether it is able to significantly
outperform the idealized gm by analyzing college players
advanced statistics as well  e g  bpm   so we performed
linear regression on players advanced college statistics and
their nba win shares  we then computed the absolute win
share errors of the basic and advanced predictors to see if
the advanced predictor outperforms the idealized gm  the
results are shown below 
as seen in the boxplots  the advanced predictor produces
essentially the same error as the idealized gm  which
indicates that the basic college parameters  fg    p   ast 
are the most valuable ones used when predicting college
players future nba success 
there are far more advanced statistics available for nba
players than for college players  real plus minus  value over
replacement player  etc    so for a further study we performed
linear regression on basic nba statistics and nba win shares 
and on advanced nba statistics and nba win shares  we then
graphed the absolute win share errors below

while predicting win shares via linear regression was difficult with sufficient accuracy  classifying players by discretized
success levels yielded much more success  the information
yielded from these models could be used to inform general
managers  owners  and coaches when determining whom to
draft at what position  these models are useful not only on
an individual teams basis  but could also prove to be useful
to the league as a whole  currently  even very low draft picks
are paid large sums of money  the fact of the matter is that
some players are statistically unlikely to perform successfully 
being able to determine this likelihood will enable the league
as a whole to more accurately negotiate contract values for
different draft positions 
future attempts at improving these methods would primarily
focus on expanding the feature space to include more relevant
features  our features did not include phyiscal measurables
such as height  weight  wing span  etc  an additional feature
that would be interesting to study would be the university that
each player played for  some nba draft experts conjecture
that better players tend to come from college basketball
powerhouses such as duke and kentucky  whereas a player
