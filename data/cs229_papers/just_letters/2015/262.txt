independent squat component classifiers  e g  a depth classifier  a kneesovertoesclassifier  and soon tooutputindependent binary

we also expand our classification  pipeline to include basic support for pushups in order  to demonstrate the ease with which our

the kinect has already been used for form detection in rehabilitation patients withreasonablesuccess  suchexperiments
have classified exercises and  served as automated data collection tools by mapping skeletal coordinates afforded by the kinect to
expected physical characteristics      however  this form of data  collection does not  provide realtime feedback by analyzing the
correct and incorrect  characteristics of exercises and merely enables postprocessing of rep features in bulk  recent collaboration
between nike and  microsoft led to the development of the nike  kinect training exercise gamededicatedto improvingform by
scoring workouts monitored by the kinect  while this platform accounts for a variety of user sizes  it appliespatternmatching on 
scaled kinect skeletal datato a specific formidealratherthangeneralizingfromasetofexamplesofgoodformacrossvarioususer

methods
after experimentationwith several different learningmodels  we settled on using one of twoforeachcomponent classifier 
logistic regression or decision  trees  logistic regression works by squashingthe output of a linear regression model into the range
      with the logisticfunction  where for binary classification any output of the logistic function above    isclassified aspositive
and outputs are negative otherwise  we use l  regularization with logistic regression to prevent overfitting  which performedbetter

we used decision trees for two component classifiers  kneesovertoesand bend hips and knees at the same time  decision
trees learn by recursively splitting data into subsets based on attribute valuesat eachnode  whenthe remaining data in a subset all
have the same valueat a particular node  the recursion is complete and thatnodebecomesaleaf attesttime dataflowsthroughthe

there are several interesting takeaways we can draw  from our experimental results  for one  we  observe that for  most
component classifiers  test error is distinctly lower than trainingerror thisreflectssomeofthechallengesof ourdataset namely  we
are extremely dataconstrained  in several of the graphs  such as kneesovertoes and simultaneoushipsandknees  it seems that the
f testperformanceisnotyetclosetolevelingout suggestingthatmoretrainingdatawouldnoticeablyimproveperformance 
overfitting was a consistent challenge throughoutthis project  for example  svms even with a heavy regularization penalty  often
overfit so thoroughly to our trainingdatathatthesvmtestresultscouldnotpresentf scorescomparabletodecision treesorlogistic
regression  knowing how sensitive the regularizationconstant can be forsvms  it might be possible that we did not do agranular
enoughsearchacrossconstants 
we tried severalapproachestocombatthisoverfittingproblem weexperimentedwithbothl andl regularizationforour
logistic regression models for each classifier and found that l performed bestin severalofthemlikelybecausewehadsomewhat
sparse feature vectors  whereas we originally used every feature foreachcomponentclassifier welatertriedremovingmostfeatures 
for each component classifier toconstrain thehypothesisclassofeach  thisworkedwellfortheclassifiersofstatebased components
like squat depth  whichis determined almost entirelyby the bottom frame of the rep  for others likekneesovertoes we foundthat
keeping in  all features produced better performance  our hypothesis for this difference is twofold     statebased  components are
simpler and generally determinedbytheinstantaneouspositionsoftherelevantjointsintherelevant frames whereascomponentsthat
depend on consistency  like simultaneous bending  of hips and knees  are determined over time and usually require fullbody 
involvement    performance on some components will influence others  by basic rules of anatomy and physics for example it is
nearly impossible to keep your backverticalthroughouta squat whichis badtheback shouldbeangled  down withoutbending
your knees past your toes  also bad   you would almost certainly fall backward if yourknees were correct  thus  features that we

thisanalysisis oneexampleofthevalueofourdomainspecificknowledgethroughoutthisproject bystudyingtheexercise
literatureplusthe quirks of our datasetclosely  wegainedseveraladvantages inimprovingperformance asan example knowing
that we  were dataconstrained led us to rethink the states we were using for feature extraction  we originally only considered
extracting features with resolution r     butafter running initialexperiments and concludingthatweneeded moredata weobserved
we  could multiply our effective amount of contributing data considerably without any new recordings by simply increasing the
resolution size and no longer throwing out so many frames  per  rep  experiments confirmed that higher resolution is better for
componentsthatoccurovertime andlowresolutionexcelsforsimplercomponentsthatdependlessonmotionintimeseries 
however  westillhave significant room for improvement weranseveralof theaboveexperimentsforthepurposesoferror
analysis  and we can see different components may require different adjustments to improve forexample ourtestf  scoreis rather
low in elbow angle and simultaneous hip knee bending  welookedatourtraininglabelsforthesecomponents andobservedthatthey
also tended to have the fewest nonzero labelsinthetrainingset this suggeststhatgettingmoreexamplesof poorformwouldhelpus
improve in these areas  the problem may be particularly acute due toour use of loocv for performance measurement  forelbow

data scarcity wasnt our only  issue  unlike the clear overfitting problems already discussed  our squat depth classifier has
relatively consistenttraining versus testperformance  but its trainingperformance is the lowest in the groupbyanoticeablemargin 
why  upon closer inspection  we realized that squat depth was  the hardest component for us to label consistently  there were so
manyborderline cases where wewere unsure ofthecorrectlabel maybeasquatwasalmost deepenoughorjustbarelydeepenough 
that our dataset likely contains several incorrectlabels  this would make trainingaccuracyimpossibletogetnear    withalinear
classifier and thefeatureset we chose even a nonlinear classifier wouldnt be able toachieve      training accuracy without rote
memorization  thus forfutureimprovementswewouldexperimentwithmorerobustlabelingtechniques likemakingsureeachsquat

anothersource of error was due to noise from ourrecordinginstrument thekinect  inspectionoftherawskeletalrecording
data revealed that oftentimes  the kinectrecords joints asjumping several inches tothe sideandthenbackagainoverthecourseofa
few frames  despite such behavior being anatomically impossible  we originally had varianceofjointpositionasafeatureinseveral
of our component classifiers  because when people shake during their squats or pushups it indicates they are having trouble 
oftentimes a corollary of bad form  after our discovery  of this error source we removed variance from most featuresetsand saw
improved performance  which also suggests overfitting  if joint variance primarily reflected noise from the kinect and not a
meaningful indication of bad form   we would expect the  feature to be weighted nearzero and thus not notice a  performance
improvement after removing it  thefactthatwe did observean improvementsuggestsitwasnot and thusthatwewerefittingatleast
in part to random kinectnoise  sensor noise was especially challenging for pushupclassification  as thekinect is not designed to
predict skeletonsfrom a side angle and so the joint coordinates are particularlyunreliable  we had to discard entire componentswe
originallyintendedtouseforbothsquatsandpushupsbecauseofhowinaccuratetheheadjointisfromthekinect 
surprisingly  we also observed increasedtest error when using random forests in place ofdecision trees for the component
classifiers where we report decision trees as the bestmodel  we did not expectthis result  as randomforests rely on decisiontrees
internally but incorporate avoting mechanism among several treesto correct for theirtendencytooverfitwhenusedinisolation we
