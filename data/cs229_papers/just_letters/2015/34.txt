we develop a generic model of voting behavior in the house of representatives  election cycles
           without the use of individual vote histories  allowing for generalization to future congresses with new members  we find that these representatives nearly always vote in line with their
political partys collective decision  and that greater than     prediction accuracy is possible when
the minority partys collective vote can be perfectly determined  using logistic regression with party
information for bill sponsors  cosponsors  and voters  and further information about how controversial a bill is from a list of topics relevant to it achieves a prediction accuracy of      comparable to
state of the art methods  more complex models which try to account for party specific preferences
by topic showed no improvement 

introduction

voting on bills in the house of representatives is one
of the primary steps required for creation of a new federal
law  but what influences an individual representatives
vote is not always transparent  high profile bills such
as the patient protection and affordable care act    
highlight partisanship in the voting process  suggesting
that political party is a primary driver of voting behavior  particularly in recent years  moreover  movements
such as occupy wall street     have brought the idea
of a wealthy few buying a disproportionate amount of influence into the minds of americans  raising the question
of how influential election campaign contributions and
lobbying efforts are in affecting a representatives votes 
this work attempts to both accurately predict individual votes in the house of representatives and elucidate
the primary influences on voting behavior  in addition 
it does so in a way that is easy to programmatically evaluate and to generalize to a future congress with new
members who may not have a voting history to train on 

prior work

much of the past work in this area involves training
a separate classifier for each representative  and hence
requires voting history information  making it difficult
to generalize to future congresses  some attempts have
been made to determine whether a bill will survive being
referred to a congressional committee  using both unsupervised clustering of bills by textual content     and
logistic regression on features like sponsor party  committee chairman party  and state of origin      there is
ample evidence that a representatives party is relevant
for predicting voting behavior         as one might expect 
the evidence for campaign finance data being relevant is
mixed  with greater influence seen for votes on special
interest issues  where contributions from interest groups
are most likely to be salient and accountability to constituents may be lower      there is more evidence that

lobbying efforts can affect voting results      however 
gathering lobbying information can be costly  such as
through directly reaching out to representatives   limited  only the number of lobbying appeals for a given
bill is public   and unreliable  some lobbying is done offthe books   making such data outside the scope of this
work 
a meta analysis of older studies suggests that the best
models reach roughly     accuracy in predicting individual votes  though all methods reviewed rely on using
individual past voting records      a more recent model
takes a baseline ideology score for each representative
 on the conservative liberal spectrum  and adjusts it according to past voting record on topics relevant to the
bill  as determined by a programmatic study of the most
common associated keywords  assigned to bills by an outside group      
this work is unique  to our knowledge  in that it does
not use the past voting records of representatives  instead creating a single generic model which can be applied to any future representative  and hence which can
be used to glean information about general voting behavior patterns  state of the art models seem to cap out
at roughly     prediction accuracy for a wide class of
models  even with voting records  so we hope to achieve
roughly similar performance 

dataset characterization

this work focuses on votes in the house of representatives for congresses          election cycles            
congresses         were used as training data  while
congress     was set aside for testing  each example
consists of a bill representative pair  with the representatives vote on that bill as the result we wish to predict 
we restricted the data to roll call votes  the results of
which are publicly available  further  votes were only
considered if they concerned the passage of house bills
 which  if also passed in the senate  would become law
and are hence of most interest to the general public   if

the feature vector for example i and m is the total number of examples  and choosing the k eigenvectors with the
largest eigenvalues  where k is the desired number of reduced dimensions  to maximize the variance of the data
while still allowing it to be easily visualized  we chose
k    fig     

pca          va

there were multiple votes for the passage of one bill  we
considered only the first such vote  for simplicity  we
excluded abstentions and votes by members of a third
party  so that both the vote result and each representatives political party are binary 
several different input feature lists were considered 
and can be separated into features associated with representatives and with bills  for representatives  the
features considered were the representatives political
party and campaign contributions  obtained from opensecrets org as bulk text files containing a list of all contributions from both political action committees  pacs  and
individuals for each election cycle  each contribution is
assigned to a sector identifying the donors industry or
ideology  more information on all thirteen sectors  such
as agriculture  health  and finance  can be found on the
opensecrets website           we processed the contribution files to obtain the total contributions to each representative for each sector  for bills  the features considered were the billss sponsor  party and campaign contributions   the number of cosponsors from each party  the
congressional committees the bill was referred to  and a
list of tags describing the topics related to the bill  each
no more than a few words  these bill features  as well
as the roll call votes for each bill  were obtained from
govtrack us       the result for each example is the vote
 yes or no   the vote of each of the     representatives on     bills provides         examples for each
congress  totaling to         
in order to better understand the structure of campaign contributions  we tried several ways of clustering
the campaign contribution data by sector for representatives from all congresses  for this step  we normalized
the campaign contributions for each representative to
sum to    since otherwise the clustering was dominated
by a few representatives with very large contributions
 such as john kerry  when running for president   however  the results were not very informative  aside from
indicating that the three largest sectors in terms of campaign finance are finance  health  and labor unions in
that order  because of this  we chose instead to visualize the campaign finance data using principal component analysis  or pca  this algorithm  and all others
described  unless otherwise mentioned  was implemented
using the python machine learning package      
pca reduces the dimensionality of the data by finding
the linear combinations of the initial feature axes along
which the variance is maximized  this is done by finding
m

the eigenvectors of the matrix
x i  x i t   where x i  is

fig     campaign finance data  reduced to three axes using
pca  with republicans in red and democrats in blue  the
fraction of the total variance of the data explained by each
axis is given in the axis label  note that the two parties
are fairly clearly separated by the second pca axis  which is
dominated by contributions from labor unions 

these three axes accounted for     of the total variance of the campaign finance data  the pca results
suggest that representatives do not naturally separate
into distinct clusters  which could be related to the lack
of insights from clustering  however  they do show a
clear separation by party according to the second pca
axis  which largely  anti  aligned with contributions from
labor unions  this accords with the expectation that
labor unions contribute primarily to democrats  while
other sectors are less ideologically aligned with a particular party  the principal axis was largely aligned with
the candidate committees sector as well as the ideological single issue pacs sector  suggesting that much of
the variance may come from separating out high profile
politicians who get a substantial fraction of their campaign funds from dedicated election committees  the
third principal axis was primarily aligned with the finance sector  though it also was a significant component
of the other axes  hence  while both finance and health
contribute substantially  the finance sector seems to be
more politicized  while representatives across the board
receive donations from the health sector 
significant effort was also devoted to understanding
the average voting behavior of representatives  with particular attention paid to their political party affiliations 
an analysis of bill votes for a sample congress is given in
fig     for all congresses in this dataset  the majority
party sponsors most of the bills and its members vote
yes nearly unanimously on most bills  in contrast  minority party members vote yes nearly unanimously on
bills it sponsored  but votes bimodally for bills sponsored
by the opposition  this is true regardless of whether the
majority party is republican or democrat  this can be
distilled into two main features of this dataset     rep

fig     scatter plot of bill votes by party for congress     
with each bill colored according to the party of the bills sponsor  the results are projected onto a histogram on the minority party vote axis  again with bars colored by the sponsor
party  the majority party sponsors most of the bills and votes
yes nearly unanimously  while the minority party votes
yes nearly unanimously on bills it sponsored  but votes bimodally for bills sponsored by the opposition 

resentatives largely vote according to party  herd mentality   and    bills can be separated into a large class
of uncontroversial bills  which pass with an overwhelming margin  and the remainder which are controversial 
in fact  roughly     of votes in this dataset were yes
votes  indicating that the result classes are quite unbalanced  and further establishing a baseline accuracy of
    with which to compare the performance of any prediction method 
this is further illustrated in fig     this demonstrates
that most members of the minority party vote the same
way as their party  as determined by the majority of
votes  greater than     of the time  with an average
agreement of about      hence  since representatives
cast roughly equal numbers of votes  very high prediction
accuracy        can be achieved by determining how
the minority party will vote on any given bill  without
any further distinguishing information about any representative than their party 

analysis

given the characterization of this dataset  most of our
prediction efforts went toward determining whether a
bill would be controversial  meaning that the minority party as a whole would vote against it  our primary
algorithm of choice for doing this was logistic regression 
logistic regression consists of finding a coefficient vector
 of the same length as the input feature vectors x i   
 
as the
and returning the quantity h  x i     
 t x i

fraction of times voter s vote matched the rest of the party

fig     histogram of the fraction of votes which agree with
the collective vote of the party  by minority party representative 

coefficient vector  is determined so as to maximize the
likelihood of  given the training data  using gradient descent  specifically  the gradient descent rule
 for updating
 is given by         y  i   h  x i    x i  where  is
a parameter  the learning rate  which determines the
speed of convergence  this step is repeated  either for
one x i  at a time  or with a sum over all x i  in the
training set  until  converges to within some tolerance 
initial tests of this method used the following features 
   voter and sponsor party
   features from   plus bill features  described below 
   features from   plus campaign contributions for
both voter and sponsor
originally  party was encoded as   for republicans and
  for democrats  but we found that the generalization
error for training on congresses         and testing on
congress     was worse than when training and testing
on any single training congress  which we interpreted
to be due to changes to the party in power from one
congress to the next  when the party was instead encoded as   for the minority party and   for the majority 
this discrepancy went away  so this encoding was used for
all results shown  unless otherwise noted  the bill features include the number of cosponsors from the majority
and minority parties  as well as vote fractions for the
bills tags and congressional committees  for any given
tag  committee   the vote fraction is calculated by taking
the fraction of all training votes on bills containing that
tag  referred to that committee  which were yes votes 
hence  this is an indicator of how generically uncontroversial  to either party  bills with that tag  referred to
that committee  are  this attempts to capture the intuition that there are many generically uncontroversial bills
related to topics such as naming a new post office  and

that some tags  or committees  could identify such a bill 
note that while most tags present in bills for congress
     test data  were present in the training data  none
of the actual votes or bills were  so that there is no way
for the algorithm to cheat by knowing in advance how a
given bill will be voted on 
given the list of tags  committees  for a bill  the feature used as input to logistic regression was the simple
mean of the vote fraction for all the tags  committees 
present  hence  there are only two additional features involving vote fractions  inspection of the tag vote fractions by eye suggests that they do capture generic uncontroversiality  tags with low vote fractions include controversial topics such as terminal illness and the draft  while
tags with high vote fractions include topics all representatives are likely to agree on such as nature  radioactivity 
and nazism  campaign contributions were not normalized by individual  as they were for pca   but were left
as absolute contributions  in thousands of dollars  from
each of the thirteen funding sectors 
the results of performing logistic regression on these
feature subsets are shown in fig     we choose as our
performance metric the overall accuracy of classification 
as there is no particular reason to penalize false negatives
over false positives  though we also report the precisionrecall curve for yes votes for completeness  where precision is the fraction of predicted yes votes which are
correct predictions  and recall is the fraction of true yes
votes which are correct predictions  note that due to
the high precision for much of the graph  the area under the curve is near   for all classifiers  making it less
sensitive as a metric than accuracy  the results indicate
that inclusion of the bill features does improve the accuracy  from     to      comparable to methods of other
researchers  however  such a comparison is at best suggestive  as the datasets are different  it seems plausible
that more recent polarization of the house would make
voting behavior more easily predicted  for example  
the further inclusion of campaign finance data
smoothed out the curves  but did not provide any substantial improvement  suggesting that any relevant information it might provide was already captured by the
other features  this agrees with the expectation  from
dataset characterization  that a representatives party is
the only distinguishing feature needed to predict her or
his voting behavior  in addition  the training and test
errors were very similar in all cases        training accuracy versus       test accuracy for the best performing
classifier  i e  using the bill features   this is to be expected  as the models are all fairly simple      features 
and the dataset is reasonably large  nearly   million examples  
because the models above did not show evidence
of overfitting  we chose to include additional features
that might better capture the content of a bill  beyond
whether it is generically controversial to both parties  to

do this  we included as features the presence of tags  encoded as   when the relevant tag was absent  and   when
present  since there are over      unique tags in this
dataset  too many to include as features  we reduced the
tags to the     most useful  as determined by their mutual information with the vote outcomes from the training dataset  the mutual information between tag ti and
the vote result y  both binary  is given by

including these top     tags  or fewer  in the logistic
regression model as additional features  however  did not
improve the accuracy  switching the party encoding back
to republicans and democrats  rather than majority and
minority   to try and better account for party specific
differences  did not improve the model 
another attempt to determine whether a bill is contro 

fi 
versial or not was to use the naive bayes method on the
tags  for tag ti   the probability of the tag being present in
a controversial  uncontroversial  bill  ci  ui    is given by
the number of controversial  uncontroversial  bills containing that tag divided by the total number of controversial  uncontroversial  bills  this was modified slightly by
the laplace smoothing method to account for tags which
appeared very rarely  by adding   to the controversial
 uncontroversial  count for each tag and also adding the
total number of unique tags to the denominator  number
of controversial or uncontroversial bills   the probability
of a future bill with tag list t being controversial is then
calculated as 
  
u y ui
   c

ci
ti t

where c  u   is the fraction of all bills which are controversial  uncontroversial   in this context  a bill was determined to be controversial if      of minority party representatives who cast a vote on it voted no  any tag
which was not present in the training dataset was ignored
for this calculation  a small fraction of total tags   to
try and better determine party preferences  since some
topics may be more likely to be voted down by republicans than democrats or vice versa   the training was
done only on republican majority congresses           
and       and tested on congress      which also had a
republican majority  this method achieved       accuracy in predicting which bills would be controversial in
congress      however  including the naive bayes probability of being controversial as an additional input to
logistic regression did not improve the models accuracy 
this suggests that all of the information in the naive
bayes output which might help classify bills as controversial was already present in the tag vote fractions 
as a final step  the same features were used to train a
support vector machine  svm   with the thought that
its increased complexity might reduce the bias of our
model  because the svm method relies on defining a
distance metric between examples  and the inputs are
measured in different units  we first scaled the features
so that each feature from the training data had a mean
of   and a variance of    then applied the same scaling to
the testing data  the svm algorithm works by finding a
coefficient vector w  and bias term b  so as to maximize
the minimum distance  over all examples  to the decision
boundary defined by wt x b  hence  its goal is to choose a
decision boundary using the examples nearest to the true
boundary between classes  support vectors  as a guide 
because real data is rarely perfectly separable by such a
linear decision boundary  the constraints are loosened to
allow examples to be on the wrong side of the decision
boundary  with a corresponding penalty in the maximization term determined by the regularization parameter c
 larger values of c mean a higher penalty for such mis 

classified examples   this problem can be mapped onto
the following constrained maximization problem

the results of this approach  with different feature subsets and with c      are essentially identical to the logistic regression results  with the highest accuracy of    
achieved with the simple list of bill features  adding the
top     tags or the naive bayes controversiality probability did not improve the classifier  and in the case of
the raw tags  led to overfitting  a training accuracy of
    was achieved  while the testing accuracy was      
adjustments to c did not improve upon the best result
of     testing accuracy 
conclusions

campaign contributions to members of the house of
representatives were analyzed via pca  finding that
the health sector gave to representatives across the
board  labor unions donated primarily to democrats 
and contributions from finance and candidate committees showed the highest variation independent of party 
hence  donations from these last two sectors are ideal
for distinguishing between representatives  however  it
was determined that votes are primarily the result of a
collective party decision  so individual features  including
campaign finance data  have limited value  furthermore 
many bills pass with a high margin  and members of the
majority party almost always vote yes  as they sponsor
the bills being considered   so most of the improvement
in accuracy over the     baseline  from predicting all
yes votes  comes from correctly predicting which bills
will be controversial to the minority party 
using logistic regression with party information for bill
sponsors  cosponsors  and voters  and further information
about the bills controversiality from its tags improves the
accuracy to      comparable to the accuracy of state ofthe art methods which use representatives vote histories  albeit on a different dataset  making such direct
comparison difficult   more complex models which try
to account for party specific preferences showed no improvement  this technique could be improved by a more
complete topical model  sorting bills into broader categories  or the addition of lobbying information  it would
also be interesting to learn more about the    of representatives who do not vote with their party  by looking
more into individual features  such as by analyzing outliers in the campaign contribution data
