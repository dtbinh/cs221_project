introduction

on the assumption that they would have little information about the author  and most of them were
products of typing errors and occurred only once
or twice in the whole list  this resulted in a set of
around       unique words in the vocabulary 
using this dictionary of       words  the blogs
were converted into feature vectors for small storage and fast retrieval  these feature vectors were
subsequently used for training the naive bayes and
the svm classification algorithms 

the text content of a large set of weblogs was analyzed along with its associated metadata  containing information related to the url  authors gender  age  interests  location  etc  to classify blogs
based on the gender and the age of the author using machine learning techniques  in particular  the
following approaches were investigated 
   multinomial naive bayes classification 
   support vector machines using libsvm 
   feature improvement through

 

implementation

analysis 

the python programming environment was used
due to its strong text processing capabilities  the
wordnet dictionary python port was additionally
data set preprocessing
used for recognizing words from the english lana data set of about   million blogs was obtained guage as well as for stemming purposes 
from prof  sepandar kamvar icme  stanford  
and around       english language blogs were
stemming and vocabulary
filtered out from blogger and livejournal which
contained the complete author information includ  instead of only using the wordnet dictionary
stemming function  morphy  we implemented a
ing age and gender 
combination
of porter stemming algorithm along
the text from each of these blogs was extracted
using python and an initial dictionary was created with the wordnet dictionary stemmer  this gave a
which contained around         words  with help better stemming result than just using either of the
from wordnet dictionary  during the extraction  methods 
a standard list of stop words  which occur frequently but have low classification value  a  an 
after filtering low frequency words from this
the  of  etc   were eliminated and similar words stemmed vocabulary  blogs were converted into
were stemmed to a common root  from this initial variable length vectors  figure   shows the reladictionary  words occuring rarely were eliminated tive frequency  log scale  of the various extracted

the data was then divided into    sets of

age classification

  

  

the naive bayes approach was extended to classify
blogs based on the authors age  first into   classes
and then into   classes  in the first case  the two
classes were chosen as the age groups            
and in the second case the five classes were the age

ficuracy is encouraging and our analysis show that
there exist distinguishing features  across gender
