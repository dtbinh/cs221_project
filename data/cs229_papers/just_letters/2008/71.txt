background
automating the calibration of   d to   d feature correspondences is at the forefront of
image processing research  the challenge behind this problem is  given an image of a scene and
scan data from a   d laser scanner from a slightly different perspective  to find a perfect
mapping between the two  at the present  point and line features from a   d image must be
manually specified to correspond to   d sensor scan data  each mapping requires that a person
select a small number of corresponding points  n      from the two sources  this current
standard requires more human input and time than is feasible on a large scale  and it is also prone
to error 
automated feature correspondence can be used  for example  in   d reconstruction of an
image  our project could also be applied to pose estimation  a method of deducing the vantage
point from which an image was taken  it can also be used for object recognition by using
relative depth information to identify element contours  the process of segmenting images by
objects at different distances  such as separating the foreground from the background of an image 
would also benefit from this work  this particular project was completed in the context of
augmenting a calibration toolbox that currently uses manually specified   d to   d
correspondences and would greatly benefit from speedier computer automation 
methods
  d and   d source data was collected in the form of an image and a depth map from several
complicated scenes containing an unobstructed rectilinear calibration target  the camera and
laser scanner were mounted in a rigid setup such that point correspondences are fixed across all
pairs of scene data  a preliminary mapping between the two sources was calculated based on
this distance 
points of interest are selected from the   d data via a proprietary algorithm developed by
paul baumstarck  this algorithm identifies likely rectilinear regions by clustering the   d data
into planar segments  fitting hulls to these segments  converting them into best fit rectilinear
hulls  and finally preprocessing the results to identify good planes and points  the algorithm
identifies a subset of rectilinear hull corners that are most likely to be hard corners  and these
points are used for developing correspondences 
potential rectilinear object corners are selected from the   d image harris corner map  which
provides a confidence level for every pixel in an image representing the likelihood of that pixel
being a hard corner  otsus method  a thresholding algorithm  is then applied to this confidence
map to identify an optimal minimum cutoff for selecting high confidence corners  blob analysis

fiwas used to remove regions over crowded with points  as these regions present too many degrees
of freedom of matching 
potential correspondences between   d and   d points are identified using the ransac
method  the algorithm begins with the preliminary mapping  each trial chooses a subset of
three to five   d points of interest at random and matches each one to a random one of its most
likely corresponding harris corners based on the preliminary mapping  each trial produces some
calibration between the two data sources based on these correspondences  the quality of this
calibration is then determined based on some heuristic function  because the preliminary
mapping is within a small margin of the ideal mapping  if the rotational and translational values
are far from the preliminary values  the calibration is filtered out  a large number of trials are
performed  and correspondences that produce good heuristic values are noted  once several
valid correspondences are identified across all sets of data  they can be combined to generate an
optimal calibration 
in order to test potential correspondences  a heuristic function must be developed to evaluate
the quality of a given calibration  a proper heuristic function should give a good value for an
accurate calibration and a poor value for an arbitrary invalid projection  the integrity of the
heuristic is tested via a method called bootstrapping  in which the value outputted after applying
the heuristic function to our preliminary projection is compared to that of random projections 
finally  the heuristic undergoes testing on a proper manually chosen correspondence between   
  and   points to determine whether the heuristic value improves for a proper mapping 
for each calibration  the heuristic function finds the best one to one mapping between the
projected   d points of interest and the filtered harris corners and then sums the distances
between each pair  for any   d points that do not map onto the image  the maximum possible
distance between a point on the image and its nearest harris corner is used  the smaller the
value produced by the heuristic function  the higher the quality of the calibration 
results
applying harris corner selection to the image  and then thresholding the resultant
confidence matrix  produced a reasonable set of      corners to work with  however  there
were several problematic regions that contained multiple nearby corners  after applying blob
analysis these regions were successfully identified and removed  leaving only      corners to
work with  it is worth noting that many of these corners appear in clumps of pixels around a
single element corner

once a reasonable set of   d and   d points of interest had been established  the heuristic
function was implemented as described in the methods  bootstrapping the heuristic by
evaluating random projections produced promising results  while the preliminary calibration
had a heuristic value of        a test of     random calibrations produces an average heuristic
value of        with a standard deviation of        the best random calibration had a value of
       significantly worse than that of the preliminary calibration

after successful bootstrapping  the heuristic was further tested by manually identifying
proper correspondences between   d hulls and   d objects  these tests produced mixed results 
the manual calibration based on three proper correspondences produced a calibration of low
quality with a heuristic value of        a manual calibration based on   correspondences was
moderately successful and had a value of        a manual calibration based on  
correspondences was also reasonable looking and had a heuristic value of

based on the performance of the heuristic  the ransac algorithm was performed for   
iterations of      trials  trying to find four proper correspondences between our    interesting  d points and our      harris corners  for each randomly chosen interesting hull corner  we
examined its ten nearest harris corners and chose one at random  if there was exactly one proper
correspondence for each of the   d points of interest  and if this point was one of its ten closest
harris corners  then the likelihood of a random correspondence succeeding would be       
however  as not every interesting   d point has a corresponding   d corner  i e  the top right
corner of the easel   and as the corresponding corner might not be one of the nearest ten  in
actuality the likelihood of success is significantly lower  in our test  the algorithm did not find a
superior calibration  although more extensive testing may have led to positive results 
future research
one possible extension to our   d corner selection may be to consolidate pixel clusters
around single element corners  this would provide many fewer points and greatly increase the
chance of success via the ransac method  additionally  as even manually corresponding a
subset of points between the two data sources does not necessarily improve the mapping  it may
be reasonable to develop a more sophisticated heuristic function that can evaluate the validity of
just the corresponded points  rather than the projection as a whole  furthermore  alternatives to
the ransac method  such as prioritizing certain correspondences based on distance  might
improve run time and allow for more extensive testing
