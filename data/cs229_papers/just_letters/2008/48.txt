motivation

many religions advocate the study of a canonical text on a regular basis  as a consequence there are many
study aids available to the religious student  serious scholars have identified important passages that the
the more casual student should focus on  they also provide explanations and historical details as notes to
accompany study  it is often recommended to the student that he she study the text by topic  rather than
simply reading straight through  to this end topical guides and indexes are available  these guides allow a
student to quickly find passages of interest in the text 
more recently  software packages have been developed that provide easy access to large amounts of
published study materials and research related to the bible    this project shows how machine learning could
be included in these software packages to further aid study  in particular  it demonstrates the capabilities
of machine learning to perform automatic index generation 

 
   

training set
source text

the source text used for this project was the king james version of the bible  the bible is composed of
over        small passages referred to as verses  the verses are organized into chapters and the chapters
into books  the source text was obtained from project gutenberg    the text was prepared by removing
punctuation  converting to lower case  and assigning each verse a unique id  a stemmer  was used to reduce
each word to its stem  finally  the vocabulary was extracted and each word replaced by a unique id  there
were a total of        verses and       unique words 

   

topic index

the labels for the training set were obtained from bible topics    a website containing a topical index for the
bible  it supplies a list of relevant verses for almost     different topics  a representative subset of    topics
was chosen for this project    in order to convert the html index files to sets of labels they were first modified
slightly to be readable xml files  from there the verse references were extracted and converted to the same
unique verse ids used in the source text  note that the same verse may appear under multiple topics 

 
   

initial implementation
training

training was performed using svms by applying a multivariate bernoulli event model to the data  the
presence or absence of each word in the vocabulary was viewed as a separate feature  a separate classifier
for each topic was trained by applying a different set of labels to the same training set  to significantly speed
up training the training set was limited to those verses that were referenced at least one time in any topic

this limited the training set to       verses  this also limited the vocabulary to        the verses referenced
under a topic were given positive labels and the rest in the limited training set were given negative labels 
this was done under the assumption that the other verses were considered and rejected for classification
under the current topic 
the training was done using pyml    a machine learning library for python 

   

testing

the most important metric for measuring the success of a classifier was the false negative rate  which will
be referred to as simply the error rate  this refers to the verses that were originally listed under the topic
but not recognized during testing  false positives were not considered an issue  first  the assumption under
which the negative examples were labeled was questionable  some negative examples may in fact be positive
ones  in addition  as the purpose of this project was to discover additional positive verses  it was desirable
that the classifier was biased towards positive assignments 
the initial classifiers were tested using    fold cross validation  the average error rate for the topical
classifiers was        the best error rate was        however  the error rate when training and testing
using the entire training set was     indicating low bias but high variance 

 

improvements

in order to bias the classifiers towards positive assignments more weight was given to positive example errors
than to negative example errors  this was done by setting two different values for c in the svm  as described
in     this improved the average error rate to        the best error rate increased slightly to       
to avoid over fitting the data  feature reduction was applied to the training set before training by recursively eliminating the features with the smallest corresponding weights in the classifier  this reduced the
number of features from       to      on average  after feature reduction the average error rate was       
computed by leave one out cross validation  the best error rates  however  were just                   and
     
these results are summarized in table   

 

qualitative results

although the above numbers give an idea of the performance of this system  its real performance will be
determined by the subjective opinion of the user  here are presented some of the qualitative results 

   

key words

after training a particular topic  key words can be identified by by choosing the features with the highest
corresponding weights in the classifier function  table   shows some random examples 

 

fitable    key words
topic
prayer
faith
atonement
creation
sin
peace

   

key words
prayer  prai  holiest  pour  ask
believeth  believ  faith  thoma  lot
aton  sheep  blood  foreordain  reconcil
creat  visitest  new  morn  calleth
sin  sinneth  forgotten  destroy  rebel
peac  quiet  peacemak  desireth  depart

verse discovery

as already stated  the purpose of this project was to discover additional verses that belong to a given topic 
the most likely verses may be found by comparing the output of the classifying function for each verse before
the class decision is made  see the appendix for some examples of the most likely verses 
a limited subjective survey showed that the identified verses are relevant to the topic  it is difficult to
assess  however  whether these are the most relevant verses in the entire source text 

 

conclusion

this project showed how machine learning may be applied to expand existing topical indexes of the bible 
it was successful at finding related verses that were not already listed in the index  however  there are
still many ways in which it could be improved  a different model of the data could be tried  such as the
multinomial event model  additional features could be added  such as proximity to other verses with positive
labels  a separate classifier could be trained to identify interesting versus non interesting verses in order to
filter the additional results found  an improved stemmer could be used to take into account archaic suffixes
such as  eth and  est 
performance also suffered from a lack of enough positive training examples for some topics  this project
would benefit from a careful analysis of the number of training examples needed and then improving the
existing index to meet that requirement

most likely verses

prayer daniel        now when daniel knew that the writing was signed  he went into his house  and his
windows being open in his chamber toward jerusalem  he kneeled upon his knees three times a day 
and prayed  and gave thanks before his god  as he did aforetime 

 

fifaith   peter        who by him do believe in god  that raised him up from the dead  and gave him glory 
that your faith and hope might be in god 
atonement isaiah         and the ransomed of the lord shall return  and come to zion with songs and
everlasting joy upon their heads  they shall obtain joy and gladness  and sorrow and sighing shall flee
away 
creation isaiah        i form the light  and create darkness  i make peace  and create evil  i the lord do
all these things 
sin   corinthians        flee fornication  every sin that a man doeth is without the body  but he that
committeth fornication sinneth against his own body 
peace   chronicles        behold  a son shall be born to thee  who shall be a man of rest  and i will give
him rest from all his enemies round about  for his name shall be solomon  and i will give peace and
quietness unto israel in his days
