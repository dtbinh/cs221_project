reconstruction of ca   dynamics from low frame rate ca   imaging data
cs    final project  submitted by  limor bursztyn
introduction
active neurons communicate by action potential firing
 spikes   accompanied by transient increases in the
intracellular ca   concentration   ca   i   fluorescent
proteins that bind to ca   allow to observe dynamic
changes in  ca   i in vivo via fluorescent microscopy
techniques  such as two photon laser scanning
microscopy  tplsm   tplsm is an optical sectioning
method   simultaneous interaction with   photons is
required to excite a fluorescent molecule and thus
excitation effectively occurs only in the focal spot of
the laser beam  as the laser beam is scanned over a
plane within the tissue  emitted light from every spot
within the plane is collected and used to reconstruct
an image  compared with electrophysiological
measurement techniques  tplsm offers the advantage
of allowing to observe activity in large populations of
identifiable neurons  svoboda and yasuda        
however  the time resolution is limited by the
requirement to collect sufficient fluorescence energy
per pixel to obtain a high signal to noise ratio  given
the properties of photon shot noise  vogelstein et al  
       with this low time resolution it is difficult to
determine exact spiking event times that are of
interest  ozden et al          standard analysis of
tplsm images consists of marking a region of interest
 roi   corresponding to the location of a neuron  and
then treating the average of pixel intensities in the roi
as a sample of the signal of interest  thus  the signal is
represented via samples taken at the low frame rate
of acquisition  in this project  an attempt is made to
extract a representation of the signal of interest with a
higher time resolution than that given by the frame
rate  and thus facilitated a more accurate
identification of spike times  in order to allow the use
of every pixel within a frame for an accurate
reconstruction of the signal  it is required to exclude
redundant pixels from the roi  which do not reflect
the neuron activity but consist of noise alone  to
achieve this goal  a mask refinement method 
separating signal and noise pixels  was applied 
methods
data acquisition  imaging was performed in
anesthetized mice cerebella using a custom designed
two photon micropscope  mpscope software was

used for data acquisition and control of the
microscope  nguyen et al          a single movie 
acquired at a frame rate of   fps and size        
was used to test the refinement and interpolation
methods  a movie acquired at a rate of   fps was
used to validate the simulated signal quality 
simulation  the following characteristics were chosen
for the simulated signal  a firing rate of  hz and
exponential ca   decay with time constants varying
between     and     msec  slightly lower than the
reported times of         ms but typical for our
dataset   a spike train corresponding to the chosen
average firing rate was simulated as described in
dayan and abbott        by dividing the time axis into
constant interval bins and randomly assigning spikes
to bins with a probability of t    firing rate   then 
the ca   signal was constructed as a superposition of
typical exponential decay responses to the fired action
potentials  with amplitudes and decay time
coefficients randomly chosen from the sets           
         and                            respectively

gaussian random noise with     standard deviation as
well as sinusoidal noise with frequencies     and    
hz and amplitudes      and   respectively  were
added to make the signal waveform less ideal  figure
  demonstrates the similarity between the real and
simulated signals  data acquisition with tplsm was
simulated for a neuron with realistic dimensions
residing in a         or         frame  the mask
used to define the region was formed using the real
data set   taking into account the scanning waveforms
used by our microscope control software  a vector of
samples that would have been acquired if the

fisimulated signal represented the activity of a neuron
in the roi was formed    fps was used as the highest
acquisition rate   fps as the lowest  for mask
refinement testing  pixels containing noise alone were
added  and noise was added to the signal pixels as well
when testing various noise conditions  see mask
refinement results  
interpolation  locally weighted logistic regression
 lwlr  was used to predict values of the signal of
interest at a rate of   fps  based on samples of
simulated acquisition or real data  acquired at  fps  or
at   fps  respectively 
spike detection  the correlation between the
interpolated signal and   samples of the typical ca  
response to a spike  centered at the current timepoint  was calculated at every time point  the
response used is given by

where k         and t          the multiplication by
the sigmoid is used to smooth the exponential rise and
exclude values for t   t   to detect a spike  a threshold
was applied to the result and maxima points above
the threshold were chosen as detected spike times 
mask refinement  assuming that the intensity in every
pixel is either a sum of signal and gaussian noise or
noise alone  a gaussian mixture model consisting of
two  d  or  d gaussians was used to classify the pixels
covered by the initial mask into signal and noise
groups  based on their different characteristics  model
features were pixel intensities when a spike was fired 
and at the next one or two frames  for signal pixels 
the mean and variance is expected to be different at
each frame  and the values are also expected to be
correlated  for noise pixels  the means and variances
are expected to be the same in all frames  and the
values are expected to be independent  accordingly 
the following model equations were used 
       
                 
 
   

    
               

     





               
 

 
 
                      
   
    

where z  the latent variable  is equal to   for a signal
pixel  and to   for noise  x  is the intensity at the spike
time and x  is the intensity in the same pixel at the

next frame and x    x  x  t  model parameters were fit
using the expectation maximization  em  algorithm 
with the following equations

similar equations were used for the  d case 
after the em algorithm converged  signal pixels were
chosen as pixels having values of w  higher than    
 i e   pixels having a probability larger than     of
being signal pixels   and the rest were chosen to be
noise pixels  removed from the mask 
to validate the quality of the resulting mask  and
choose between masks fitted to different frames 
linear regression was used to fit  d polynomials to the
resulting samples acquired by averaging over lines in
each frame  the mask yielding a minimal mean square
error  mse  of fit was chosen as the optimal mask 
preprocessing of real data  frames were represented
as normalized differences in fluorescence   f f   f  
where f is the current fluorescence intensity image
and f  is the intensity averaged over    frames  a
neuron residing within the field of interest was
manually identified according to its typical activity
pattern and spatial shape 
performance analysis  for quantifying interpolation
performance on simulated data sets  the mse
between estimated and true samples was calculated 
then  event detection was performed using both
interpolated and uninterpolated data  showing that
the rate of spike detection at a high time resolution
was increased  thus  a correct spike detection was
defined as a difference smaller than     sec between
estimated and true spike times  tp   failure to detect a
spike within a time window of     sec around a true
spike was counted as miss detection  fn  and a

fidetected spike that is more than     sec away from
any real spike was defined as a false alarm  fp  
results 
interpolation of simulated data  the results of using
interpolation with lwlr are presented in fig     since
using all the samples within a frame and using
averages taken over lines yielded similar results  we
used the latter  which is easier to implement  the
lowest mse for a small         frame         with
respect to the true signal  is similar to the mse
reached by averaging over frames acquired at   fps 
       the red line in the figure   which was calculated
as a reference for performance quality  the bandwidth
parameter used was       corresponding to averaging
over    lines per prediction  since there are    lines in
a frame  this means information was extracted out of
more than one  but less than two  frames  with a large
        frame  the lowest mse reached was       
unfortunately  this constitutes only a minor
improvement compared to the lowest mse achieved
with interpolation based on averages taken over the
entire  fps frames         the black line in fig

           the red line indicates the mse error for averaging over
the roi in frames acquired at a rate of   fps the black line is the

spike detection in simulated data  the results of
spike detection at a time resolution of     sec are
presented in fig

figure    spike detection results  simulation    a  comparison of
signal based detection and correlation based detection   b 
comparison of interpolated  fps detection rates and
uninterpolated  fps    fps detection rates 

figure   a  shows that using the correlation with the
typical response yields a more accurate detection of
the spike time than using maxima points of the signal 
this is probably due to the fact that the sampling by
scanning might miss the exact peak time  and thus the
maximum value in the sampled signal is not the actual
maximum value of the true signal  however  by using a
few more samples to better describe the shape of the
response  a more accurate identification of the exact
spike time can be reached  figure   b  shows that
interpolation improves the detection rate  compared
with detection based on uninterpolated frame
averages  but does not reach the level of accuracy
which acquisition at a fast rate yields  further
optimization of the method  e g   by adjusting the
typical response parameters or changing the number
of samples of the response used to calculate the
correlation  may yield further improvement of the
results 
mask refinement in simulated data  refinement
quality was verified under various noise levels  in real
data  since the most significant noise source is photon
shot noise  it is expected that the variance of the noise
for the higher mean signal pixels will be high as well 
with respect to the lower mean noise pixels  in
accordance with a poisson distribution   however 
since it is unclear what the exact statistical properties
of the real data are  it is unknown which pixels
correspond to signal and which to noise and thus is
impossible to calculate the corresponding statistics  
we concluded it will be useful to know what algorithm
parameters work best at each of many possible noise
levels added to the signal and noise pixels 
the parameter space which was explored to find the
best configuration at each noise level  consisted of  
initial mask sizes  including          and     pixels
     of which are signal pixels     initialization
methods  random  based on thresholding over x 

fivalues  and   or   features  intensity in a frame with a
spike and in one or two consecutive frames  specificity
was chosen as the criterion for comparison  as the
objective is to refine the mask and remove noise pixels
from it  however  we also mention sensitivity values 
as a drop in these means only a few signal pixels
remain to be used for interpolation  and this should
be avoided  the best results achieved in every noise
condition  averaged over   trials  are shown in table
   initialization using a threshold always yielded better
performance than random initialization  thus all
results reported are based on threshold initialization

it can be seen that a large initial mask size yielded
better results than a small one in almost all cases  it
could be that a large enough amount of noise pixels is
required for model parameter estimation during
training  for the choice of the number of features 
however  it is not clear why the   feature model
sometimes better performed than the   feature model
and sometimes did not  one possibility is that the
number of samples used for training is small for a  
feature model and thus performance is inconsistent 
in addition  using   features sometimes yielded an
improvement compared with   features  but not
consistently  for high noise levels       when keeping
in mind signal amplitudes are no larger than     the
sensitivity dropped significantly  it is possible that in
such high noise cases  it is better to use a threshold
lower than     for assignment of signal pixels as such 
even though this choice will inevitably cause a

decrease in specificity  in addition  the methods
performance is dependent on correct identification of
events used for mask refinement  which is more
difficult when the noise levels are high  large events
allow for a more accurate mask refinement  whereas
refining a mask with a frame that was wrongly
identified as consisting of an event yields very poor
results  running refinement on the same frame with
different configurations showed that higher likelihood
values correspond to a better refinement result  this
is encouraging as the resulting likelihood can be used
as a performance measure in real data as well 
mask refinement in real data  in real data  it is
impossible to quantify the performance of refinement
as in simulation  since the true identity of the pixels is
unknown  however  a correctly refined mask should
yield line averages having a clear trend  being
samples of the same signal taken at close  yet
different  time points  qualitatively  this result has
been achieved for     out of every    frames over
which the algorithm was run  some qualitatively good
refinement results are shown in fig    

figure    line averages in real data frames before and after the
mask was refined using gmm fitting 

frames in which refinement clearly failed were easy to
detect since they consisted of very few pixels
identified as signal pixels  when fitting a  d
polynomial to the refinement result  the mask yielding
a minimal mse was also one that qualitatively seemed
to have been successfully refined  when this optimal
mask was used to interpolate the data  as shown in
fig     the resulting signal seemed noisier than the
original frame averaged signal  but also consisted of

fisharper peaks corresponding to spiking events  spike
event times detected based on the interpolated signal
were not identical to those detected based on the
averaged signal  whether this indeed constitutes a
better representation of the signal and more accurate
determination of spike times cannot be verified at this
point

interpolating it to a sampling rate of   hz  compared with
averages taken over the entire roi  at the frame rate 

discussion 
simulation results indicate that given the properties of
the dynamically changing signal of interest and the
method in which it is acquired  averaging over the roi
in each frame may cause loss of information that can
be retrieved via a more careful signal interporlation 
using lwlr we in effect still perform averaging over
information  thus  suppressing noise   however  since
acquisition time is taken into account and the average
is weighted accordingly  a better representation of
how the signal changes over time is produced 
in addition  mask refinement results show that fitting
a gmm to a manually selected mask can improve the
identification of signal pixels and prevent noisy
samples from affecting further analysis  further
testing is required to find an optimal way of applying
this method to real data  since the imaging is
performed in vivo motion artifacts may affect the
correct selection of pixels in various frames 
accordingly  for real data it may be required to fit a
different mask for every event  or divide the signal
into short time windows fitting a different mask for
each  when doing so  it is possible that using a
previously fit mask  from a previous event or window 
to initialize the refinement procedure for the next

event or window  will yield better results than
initializing using a threshold 
in order to further validate the results of mask
refinement  interpolation  and spike detection on real
data  as well as identify and optimize the most critical
parts of the process  it is required to use a data set
that consists of simultaneous electrophysiological
measurements that allow accurate identification of
spike times
