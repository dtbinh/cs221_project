abstract
a support vector machine  svm  was used to attempt to distinguish favorable
buy conditions on daily historical equity prices  the svm used a gaussian
kernel and was optimized over sigma and the margin classifier using cross
validation  although encouraging results were initially obtained through
optimization  applying the results to obtain a single trading classifier was
unsuccessful  variation in the data made it impossible to find a useful setting for
sigma and c that would produce consistent results  the results are a
confirmation of the weak efficient market theory that predicts there is no
information within the market that can be used to predict future prices 
introduction
support vector machines  svm  are supervised learning algorithms for classification of data 
they have been used successfully in a broad range of purposes from detecting email spam to
hand writing recognition  svm s have become popular because of their ease of implementation
in problems requiring classification of data  svm s separate highly dimensional training data
with hyper planes that maximize the margin between the classification of the data set  then 
from the determination of the best hyper planes  new data can be classified  in this way  svm s
are a maximum likelihood estimation of the classification 
method
in this study a svm was used to attempt to classify equity prices to form a successful algorithmic
trading system  the problem consists of creating a training data set   x   x    n   along with a
corresponding set of data classification  y   y         used to train the svm algorithm and
then test its recognition error rate  the training data set was composed of historical price data
from      to       and included    day and     day moving averages along with their standard
deviations  the data was classified as being in a favorable buy condition if the price increased by
    within the next    days  this classification works well when the underlying equity has at
least an average volatility  the graph below illustrates in red the favorable buy points of a sample
data set created from this classification 
an error rate function was chosen to
count the percent of the buy
recommendations that were incorrect in
all the buy recommendations  in other
words  an error was counted when the
svm predicted a buy but the data set
was really classified as don t buy  the
opposite condition is not as important
because it only represents a missed buy
opportunity  not a potential loss of
value 
for accurate test results  it is essential
that no future data points creep into the

calculation of the svm  to prevent this  a test was developed with a dummy set of data that had
a step function at one point in the data  looking at the resulting output  it was confirmed that the
data formatting algorithm was correctly allied without fence post errors 
this study used the svm 

kmtoolbox  written for
matlab to perform the svm
calculations using a gaussian
kernel  the data was segmented
into eleven sections of     data
points for cross validation
training  training was
performed on section n  then test
performed on section n   for ten
steps  a grid search was
performed across the margin
classifier  c   and sigma to see if
an optimum setting of the svm
parameters could be found 
promising results were obtained
with many points having an error
rate of less that     
problems
one initial problem was that at
points with low error rate  there
were not many trades attempted 
as the number of trades
increased  the error rate rose
steeply  tests were made on
different settings for sigma and
c  with training sets of           
      and      data points  but
the results varied erratically  from
having zero trades predicted to
having greater than     error
rate  in effect  the location of the
steep edge of the error rate
function varied erratically in
time  yet there were two distinct
regions of interest  sigma       
corresponded to the peak error
rate  this also corresponded to

 xt x for this data set  which is where the gaussian kernel would have its greatest
m
discrimination  the other region of interest was when sigma    where a flat point in the
error rate occurred below the     level 

further testing
next  the svm algorithm was
reorganized to model real world
conditions  a set of data was used
to train the svm and a prediction
was made on the next data point 
this was repeated  shifting down
the data to produce a set of trade
predictions  the graph on the right
shows the correct predictions in
green  incorrect predictions in red 
and missed predictions in yellow 
this test was performed with    
and     training samples with
sigma      and       the best
results were obtained with sigma  
    the number of training samples
did not have a significant effect on
the results 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  
    

    

    

    

    

    

the predicted data was incorporated into a trading model that bought on the buy
recommendations and sold on a fixed set of trading rules  the annual rate of return
obtained was     which was too good to be true  further analysis explained the hidden
source of error 

hidden source of error
the hidden source of error in the
model above came from the fact that
the classification data of the training
data set relied on future information 
the spectacular results were a result
of svm having indirect knowledge
about the future  although this
simulation was faulty  it
demonstrates the svm algorithm
was implemented correctly and
could classify data that contains
useful information about the future 

  

  

  

  

  

to remove the source of error  a   
day gap was added between the
training data set and the predicted
data  the second graph shows the
results when a    day data gap is

introduced  there is a significant increase in errors and missed buy points  when the new
trading predictions were incorporated into a trading model  the resulting rate of return was within
one percent of the return on a portfolio of random trades  there was no significant benefit from
the svm decisions 

conclusion
it was my hypothesis that statistical fluctuations in prices could be taken advantage of by
using a computerized trading algorithm  the use of an svm algorithm  in an effort to
find information in market data that could be useful for predicting profitable buy
conditions  failed  according to the efficient market theory  building a computerized
trading system should not be possible  this is because all information that is publicly
available that could affect the market has already been taken into account  this study is a
confirmation of this theory that the market is a martingle
