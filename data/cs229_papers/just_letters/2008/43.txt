introduction

disciplinarity  or the negative average mutual information of pairs of mesh headings associated with
each scientist  and the average of that of their advisees and collaborators  fifth we investigate scientific productivity as a function of interdisciplinarity 
finally we build a web based interface to our dataset 
the web based interface displays the unique identifier computed for each scientist  and provides permanent hyperlinks using this identifier 
we show that a scientists productivity increases
exponentially with their interdisciplinarity and that
of their collaborators  but in contrast correlates poorly
with that of their advisees  we conclude that high
interdisciplinarity is an advantageous strategy for senior scientists  whereas low interdisciplinarity is optimal for young scientists 

traditionally the path to scientific success has been
a road of intense focus and specialization  over the
last few decades  an alternative model of scientific
success has emerged  that of collaboration and interdisciplinary exchange  it has remained unclear  however  which strategy is optimal  and at what times
during a scientists lifetime 
separately  over the last several years  the demand
for unique digital author identifiers which accurately
link scientists to their publications  has exploded  in
the last year  six articles published in nature advocated the creation of a comprehensive digital author
identifier system which transcends non unique scientist names  misspellings  and inconsistent transliteration  the demand for digital author identifiers is
strongest in the chinese and indian scientific communities which suffer most from inconsistent transliteration and non unique names 
first  we propose a solution to the digital author
identifier problem  and create a dataset of scientists 
the professional relationships among them  and their
publications and grants  second we use our scientist dataset to investigate how interdisciplinary research impacts a scientists productivity  defined as
the numbers of publications a scientist has authored
and grants they have won 
we solve the digital author identifier problem by
   learning scientists from the nih publication and
grant records  and    assigning unique and stable digital identifiers to each learned scientist  second we
learn adviser advisee and collaboration relationships
between scientists  third we compute the distribution of pairs of mesh headings over publications and
scientists  next we calculate each scientists inter 

 

materials and methods

below we discuss the eight steps of the digital author identifier assignment scientist dataset construction algorithm illustrated in figure      we use the
algorithm to identify  among the        author names
in a corpus of       publications and       grants 
the scientists responsible for each document  the
algorithm was implemented using a combination of
mysql  php  and matlab 

   

primary data

first we obtained a corpus of publications and grants 
and the names of their authors from pubmed and
crisp  the nih publication and grant databases 
specifically  we obtained       publications and      
grants with the keyword computational biology 
we also obtained the nih journal database  and the
pubmed and crisp keyword ontologies  mesh and

scientist inference

      distinct author names
to infer the set of scientists  as distinct from author
names  which authored each of the       publications and       grants  we first computed the set
of distinct author names and the publications and
grants associated with each such name  first we
compared author names pairwise and created a graph
over author names where each author name was a
node  and author names differing only by the presence absence of full names versus initials  insertion
of space characters in the middle of names  and or
the presence absence of accent characters were connected by edges  next we recursively partitioned
each subgraph of connected author names into smaller
subgraphs by    finding the most connected author
name  and    classifying each of the publications and
grants associated with this author name by their
nearest neighbor among the bag of stemmed words
of publication and grant titles and abstracts of the
publications and grants of the remaining author names 
stemming was performed using the porter algorithm 
we investigated several methods for performing
the latter including k nearest neighbor  knn  and
multinomial nave bayes  mnb   we did not consider
svm classification because it would be prohibitively
slow on the full pubmed and crisp datasets  we
used leave one out cross validation to create training
and tests sets of publications contained publications
from multiple authors  where we knew the true authors of each publication  we compared the accuracy

 

and runtime of the methods  and for knn for various
k  we found knn accuracy highest with k    additionally  we found similar accuracy between knn
and mnb on groups of publications with two     
knn      mnb  and three authors      knn     
mnb   we choose neighbor neighbor classification
because the method is faster  and does not depend
on our current labels of the publications 
      publication grant clustering
next we clustered the publications and grants corresponding to each distinct author name  this provided the number and identity of the scientists contributing to each distinct author name  we created
initial clusters by grouping together documents with
overlapping coauthors  second we expanded clusters
by adding documents with similar bag of stemmedwords of the title and abstract  finally we computed
each scientists name from their associated author
names 

   

professional relationships

      adviser advisee relationships
to infer adviser advisee relationships we first classified each author of each publication as either a junior
or senior author  we began by computing an upper
bound on each scientists age  year of first publication   initially we defined a scientists age to be the
minimum of the year of their first publication  year
of their first last author publication minus five years 
and year of their first grant minus five years  next
we defined junior authors as those authors of documents within three years of their age  finally we
iteratively computed the number of junior authors of

fieach paper  and recomputed the age of each scientist
by computing the minimum of the year of their first
publication  year of their first non junior  or senior 
author publication minus five years  and year of their
first grant minus five years  until convergence 
next we computed each scientists adviser by finding the scientist with the most co publications  of
publications with at most two senior authors  within
three years of the each scientists age  in cases of ties
among multiple potential advisers  we linked scientists to multiple advisers  and illustrate our lower
confidence in these adviser advisee relationships in
the web based interface using dashed lines and asterisks 

this quantity 
      scientists
similarly  we computed the interdisciplinarity of each
scientist  first we computed the most frequent mesh
headings for each scientists as described above  next
we computed the frequency of each mesh heading 
and of each pair of mesh headings over the set of
scientists  finally we computed the negative average of the mutual information between all pairs of
mesh headings for each scientist  and defined the interdisciplinarity of each scientist to be the negative
of this quantity  additionally we defined the interdisciplinarity of each scientists advisees and collaborators to the average of that of their advisees and
collaborators 

      collaboration relationships
we assigned collaboration relationships to all pairs
of scientists with at least   co publication where both
scientists were senior authors  furthermore  we noted
the confidence of each collaboration relationship as
the number of such co publications  we display this
confidence as the opacity of edges in each each scientists collaboration graph 

   

   

scientist digital author identifier

   

we assigned each scientist a unique and stable digital
identifier equal to the smallest pubmed id of their
publications concatenated with their position in the
author list of that paper  each time we synchronize our primary dataset with pubmed and rerun our
analysis  this identifier points to the same scientist 
finally we use this identifier to provide permanent
links to our web based interface 

   

web based interface

finally  we built the web based interface illustrated
in figure      the web based interface summarizes
the basic properties and education of each inferred
scientist  displays a visualization of each scientists
genealogical tree and collaboration relationships  and
list each scientists publications and grants  the
web based interface was built in php  and uses mysql
to store the dataset  graphviz to layout the genealogy and collaboration graphs  gd to display the genealogical tree  and jpgraph to plot the number of
publications and grants of each scientist versus time
 not shown  

scientist profile

we computed each scientists email and title as that
associated with their most recent grant or last author publication  second we computed each scientists research topics to be the most frequency mesh
headings of their publications  next we computed
each scientists current department and institution as
that associated with their most recent  in decreasing
priority     single author grant     multiple author
grant  or    last author publication  we similarly
computed each scientists graduate department and
institution 

   

productivity

we investigated scientist productivity  defined as a
the numbers of publications and grants authored by
a scientist  as a function of their interdisciplinarity
by plotting histograms of scientist productivity versus scientist  advisees  and collaborators interdisciplinarity  as shown in figure     

 
   

results
scientists

using the machinery described above we clustered
       author names into        scientists  for the
few instances where we knew a scientists true publication record  such as for the scientists illustrated in
figure      we found the results to be highly accurate  for example  we correctly clustered all    publications written by the scientist bernhard  palsson published under the author names b o palsson 
bernhard  palsson and bernhard o palsson into
a single scientist  we found the computed profiles
of our inferred scientists equally accurate  for example  we correctly identified that nathan price is
a professor of chemical and biological engineering
at uiuc  that he attended ucsd a bioengineering

interdisciplinarity

      publications
first we computed the frequency of each mesh heading  and of each pair of mesh headings over the      
publications  next we computed the minimum of the
mutual information over each pair of mesh headings
for each publication  finally we defined the interdisciplinarity of each publication to be the negative of

professional relationships

we identified        adviser advisee and       collaborator relationships  for the few instances where
true adviser advisee and collaboration relationships
were known we found the computed adviser advisee
and collaboration relationships to be highly accurate 
for example  each of the high confidence  genealogical relationships shown in bold in figure     from
bernhard palsson to his advisees are correct 

   

interdisciplinarity

perhaps most interestingly we found that the average
number of publications and grants per scientist correlates very strongly with our metric of a scientists
or their collaborators interdisciplinarity  but does not
correlate with the interdisciplinarity of a scientists
advisees  we believe this suggests that the best strategy for a scientist  that is to maximize their productivity  is to participate in interdisciplinary work as a
senior scientist  but to focus on particular topic as a
student  first trying to master a single field

discussion

we describe several significant advances  first we
automatically inferred the identity of real scientists
from the nih database of author names  and provide
a unique and permanent digital author identifier for
scientists using the pubmed database  second  we
automatically inferred adviser advisee and collaborator relationships among scientists  we believe that
both results will help senior scientists identify and
network with potential collaborators  as well as help
junior scientists understand the research interests of
their new colleagues  and the professional relationships among them 
third  we created a metric of a scientists interdisciplinarity  applied it to each scientist  and found
that a scientists productivity correlates strongly with
their interdisciplinarity and that of their collaborators  but correlates poorly with that of their advisees 
this suggests that the optimal strategy for a young
scientist is to focus their research interests and master a particular field  furthermore  this suggests that
the optimal strategy shifts to broad collaboration as
a scientist establishes him herself  we hope this provides valuable insight for both young and old scientists in setting their research goals and planning their
careers 
in the future we plan to apply the method described here to the all    million publications and  
million grants indexed by pubmed and crisp
