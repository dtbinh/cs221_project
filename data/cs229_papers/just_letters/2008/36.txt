a contemporary problem in data analysis is understanding the nature of high dimensional data sets  given
a set of points in a high dimensional space  a key question is to determine its topological characteristics  one
potential route toward topological classification would be through the standard machine learning methods 
however  this approach is too inefficient due to the tremendous variability in the possible examples  two
surfaces that are topologically equivalent may be completely different as subsets of euclidean space  in other
words  the set of point clouds that are topologically equivalent  i e  homeomorphic  to a given surface is so
vast that it would be computationally infeasible to approach the problem in this way  on the other hand 
the theory of persistent homology developed by gunnar carlsson and his collaborators presents a tractable
method for topological classification of point clouds  more information on the subject can be found in     
and      there is one catch  however  in that the point cloud must have a well defined metric  in this paper
we propose a variation of this method to allow for topological classification of point clouds in spaces where
there is only a probabilistic notion of a metric 

 

background

recently  data set analysis has become more and more important  to deal with high dimensional datasets 
carlsson et al  developed a method in computational algebraic topology  referred to as the theory of
persistent homology  this method is used to detect topological features present in point clouds  the idea is
to generate something called a simplicial complex  which is an object constructed by gluing together points 
line segments  triangles  and higher dimensional analogues of triangles  called n simplices   from there
the simplicial complex is used to compute a sequence of betti numbers which characterize the estimated
topological features present in the data set  examples of some common shapes with their betti sequences
can be seen in figure   
in persistent homology theory the betti sequence associated with a complex is also referred to as a
barcode  informally  a barcode constitutes a topological signature of the underlying simplicial complex 
however  complexes are constructed using an arbitrary notion of proximity given by a parameter   that is 
depending on  the generated complex can exhibit varying topological features  the method constructed by
carlsson et al  handles this problem by considering a sequence of complexes generated by varying   for each
complex an accompanying barcode is generated and only the topological features that persist throughout
the sequence are considered representative of the underlying point cloud  for a rigorous definition and
theoretical justification of this method see         for more information about the underlying theory see     
the tools of persistent homology can therefore generate a reliable topological barcode of the point cloud 
however  the theory relies on a clear metric  or notion of distance  between points to construct simplicial
complexes  in many data sets distance must be inferred probabilistically  for example  let  x  d  be a metric
space consisting of a set of points x and a distance function d  for the purposes of this paper x   r  and
d x  y  is euclidean distance  let s   x    x    x         xn be a collection of points drawn from x  for each
pair of points xi   xj define dij   d xi   xj    now define u xi   xj     zij   where zij is a random variable drawn
independently from a poisson distribution with mean      dij  
here is the main idea of the project  suppose that the distances dij between points in x cannot be
obtained  but that the random distances zij can  this paper presents a way to construct a metric on the
point cloud data in such a way that the topological structure of s in  x  d  is preserved

application area

using these ideas we wish to create test data sets with only a probabilistically notion of a metric  informally 
suppose we have a set of people distributed on the surface of a sphere  and these people make telephone calls
to their friends  the idea is that they call geographically close friends with a much higher probability than
they call friends that are far away  we can create a weighted graph from this data by using the number of
calls as a weight  in this space we do not have a metric since the only data we are given is the frequency of
calls between different people  to deal with this problem we can embed the data into a higher dimensional
topological vector space to help us infer more about the data set 
for the actual simulation we distribute points uniformly on a surface  e g  a sphere  and create a matrix of
pairwise distances between nodes  then we compute the probabilistic similarity between points as a poisson
random variable with a parameter proportional to the distance between points  the proportion parameter
is lambda and it controls the variability of call frequency  probabilistic distances between nodes are then
generated as the reciprocal of call frequency  next we compute kernel distances by mapping the nodes into
a higher dimensional space and computing l  norms  at the last step in this process we use the kernel
distances to compute the topological characteristics of the data set using plex  which is a software library
developed by professor carlssons group for calculating the persistent homology of data sets in euclidean
space 
let the set of callers be c    c         cm    where m is the number of callers  in our simulation  we generate
m points on a surface  from these points we generate a distance matrix d  where dij is the distance from
point i to the point j  from this physical distance information we then generate a probabilistic similarity
matrix  to do this we create a new matrix w such that the i  j th element is determined by a poisson random
variable with parameter  mean  given by        dij    for w to be a consistent measure of similarity  we
symmetrize the matrix by setting w      w   w t    intuitively  the elements of w represent the number
of telephone calls between two points  if the points are far apart the number of phone calls will be low 
whereas if they are close the points are more likely to call each other  note that after this point we completely
discard the original physical distances  our aim is to recover the topology of the original space from the
probabilistic call information  without any knowledge of the actual locations of the points 
from the call frequency matrix w we can generate a probabilistic distance matrix p by setting pij  
  wij   although the original points were elements of rn for some n  we can no longer use this information 
instead we can consider these to be elements of the high dimensional space rm   where m is the number
of points on the surface  this can be accomplished via the mapping    cj   pj   where p    p         pm  
 i e  pj are the columns of p    in other words  for each point our representation of it in rm is given by its
corresponding column in the probabilistic distance matrix p   this suggests that we can use the standard
metric derived from the   norm on rm as a distance measure for points on the original unknown manifold 
thus we can use k ci   cj     k ci     cj  k  rm   this mapping into a high dimensional vector space is very
similar to the idea of using a kernel  however  instead of using the kernel as a measure of similarity  we are
using it as a measure of distance between two points 

 

fifigure    flow chart of calculations
once we have embedded our points into this high dimensional vector space  we can compute the distances
between each point using our selected metric  given this pairwise distance information we can construct
a filtered sequence of simplicial complexes  each parameterized by  n     n   is a monotone sequence that
discretizes the interval we wish to compute simplicial complexes over  in practice  these will actually be
approximated complexes in order to improve the efficiency of the calculations  using these complexes it is
then possible to calculate the persistent homology to characterize the topological properties of the set c 
the expected results of our method are the correct betti sequences for each tested surface  in our example
with the telephone calls on the surface of a sphere  we expect to obtain the same barcode as for a sphere 
the sequence of betti numbers                      a flow chart of this process can be seen in figure   

 

results

we have completed some simulations and tests of the ideas presented in the previous paragraphs  our
first approach was to simulate random points on a sphere and then create a random adjacency matrix
using these points  this produced a graph with random weights given by a poisson distribution  we
represented the weighted graph as an adjacency matrix  then mapped it to a distance matrix with elements
k ci   cj     k ci     cj  k  rm  
several tests were completed which verified whether it was possible to recover the correct betti sequence
of the surface given only the probabilistic information  table   shows the success rates of calculating the
betti sequences at three points along the execution of our algorithm  the sequences were computed in plex
using the actual physical distances  the probabilistic distances and the kernel distances  small values of 
amplify the number of calls made  from the table it is evident that the method works better for lower values
of lambda and higher values of the number of points
figure   shows histograms and scatter plots for the call frequencies  probabilistic distances and kernel
distances in the case of the   sphere  the histogram in the top left corner shows that most of the calls are
to places that are close  the scatter plot in the lower left demonstrates the inverse relationship between the
actual physical distance and the call frequency  finally  the lower scatter plots in the center and the right
show that the probabilistic and kernel distances are good approximations of the actual distance 

 

discussion

the results in figure   show the accuracy of our method compared to the correct topological characterization
of the underlying distance data generated from the circle  the flat sphere and the   sphere  the flat sphere
is a space that is topologically equivalent to the conventional   sphere in r    it is a square with all of the
edges collapsed to a single point  thus two points that are close to the edges are actually close together

even though the interior distance between them may be large  since our goal is to recover the topology of
the data set  the rate of success on the original physical data serves as a reference 
the results show that for values of  larger than     the method breaks down  what is interesting is that
this limitation does not seem to change when the number of points double  for values of lambda an order
of magnitude small the method works with a much higher degree of confidence  recovering the correct betti
sequences for the circle  the   sphere and the flat sphere 
we have identified several potential avenues for future work 
 the size of the distance matrices grow proportionally to the square of the number of points  which
prevented us from studying the impact of the number of points on the threshold value of   this
suggests the need to develop more efficient algorithms in order to reduce the spatial complexity and
consider much larger data sets 
 our method was tested with only a small number of surfaces  in order to test the robustness of our
method other surfaces could be considered as future candidates 
 in all of our examples the probability distribution we used was a poisson distribution  perhaps this
method could be extended to utilize other distributions
