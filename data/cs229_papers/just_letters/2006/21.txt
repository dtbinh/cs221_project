introduction
rna splicing is a critical step in eukaryotic gene expression provides the basis for the variety of
proteins expressed by an organism  splicing  the removal of intronic regions and the consequent joining
of neighboring exons in a pre mrna  involves recognition of and cleavage at splice sites located at the
exon intron junctions by a complex of numerous rnas and proteins  collectively denoted as the
spliceosome  splicing is often constitutive  that is  identical pre mrnas are always spliced in the same
manner to form identical mature mrnas  but can also be alternative  splicing identical pre mrnas
differently to generate unique mature mrnas  as many as        of human genes undergo some form
of as  and is not only directly responsible for protein diversity in eukaryotes  but also plays crucial roles
in the regulation of gene expression  as is a critical regulator of the physiology of the human heart 
skeletal muscle  brain  and other tissues  and has been identified as crucial in fruit fly development 
recent efforts have applied machine learning to computationally predict alternative splicing events from
sequence features  and have shown that the presence of short cis regulatory elements  most notably short
    nucleotide rna binding protein binding motifs  are crucial for determining the alternative splicing of
a given exon        it is therefore not surprising that the tissue specificity of as events would be heavily
regulated by rna binding proteins through these intronic and exonic elements  and this has been verified
to occur through the activity of a variety of rna binding proteins  however  the lack of large scale
genome wide tissue specific as information has limited the ability to computationally predict the tissue
specificity of as events 
at the present time  there have been three major attempts to determine as events on a genomewide scale  in       johnson et al  used exon junction micro arrays in which array probes were localized
to the junctions of neighboring exons to identify exon skipping events across    tissues and cell lines     
in addition  in      sugnet  et al  described a smaller set of exons specifically included or skipped in
mouse brain and human tissues  as found by micro arrays with probes targeting known or predicted
tissue specific splicing events      however  the most high quality data currently available was published
by affymetrix  who performed exon micro arrays in    human tissues      which have been used to
define as events specific to different tissues      using these datasets  i set out to define features which
would define these classes of as events  and which could be used to predict the tissue specificity of as
events in silico 
generation of training data   feature selection
to determine a set of tissue specific alternative skipping events  exon specific micro array data
for human brain and muscle was downloaded from affymetrix      each exon in the human genome was
defined as consisting of one or more probe set regions  each of which consists of multiple  up to   
individual probes  for the set of probes in each probe set region  the normalized expression values in
brain were compared to those in muscle  and this was then compared to the equivalent ratios for all exons
in the gene  thus  while constitutive exons will show an approximately equal ratio of expression in brain
vs  muscle across an entire gene  an exons alternatively skipped in brain compared to muscle will show
dramatically lower expression in brain compared to the other constitutive exons      by performing this
comparison across all exons in the genome  it is possible to obtain a score for each exon that describes the
confidence with which it can be identified as skipped in muscle  included in brain   or skipped in brain
 included in muscle  
setting the cutoff for calling an exon alternatively spliced to a value of   standard deviations
above or below the median expression value in the gene yielded     muscle skipped exons  the  
training set  and     brain skipped exons  the   training set   or      and     respectively for  
standard deviations 
as a first approach  i trained a nave bayes model on these two training sets 
using counts of all      possible   nucleotide long elements    mers  in the exon  as well as in the

fiflanking    nt of the upstream and downstream introns  in addition  using alignments of these exons to
orthologous exons in the mouse  rat  and dog genomes      i counted the number of   mers in the exon
and flanking introns that were conserved across all four of these genomes  giving a total of     
conserved and non conserved   mer features 
using filtering based feature selection  i next turned to using only those k mers which differed
significantly between the two categories  i initially implemented two approaches to identify these
informative features  first  the mutual information  mi  of each   mer in each location was calculated
with respect to the positive and negative training examples  and second  three different   enrichment
values were calculated  for each   mer  i calculated the   value from the  x  table of each specific   mer
against all other   mers in the human sequence of the    vs     class  the similar  x  table for counts
of conserved occurrences across the   mammalian genomes of a specific  mer against all other   mers in
   vs      and the enrichment of conservation of the   mer relative to its frequency in the human
sequences as compared to the typical conservation rate for all other   mers  for this study  only   mers
were used due to the relative scarcity of positive training examples  which would make it difficult to
obtain statistically significant results for sequences larger than   mers  both approaches were used to
calculate information both for   mers in the human sequence  as well as for the set of   mers that are not
only present in the human sequence but are also conserved in sequence in the mouse  rat  and dog
orthologous sequence  as the mi strategy gave a similar list of   mers as did the simpler   test for
enrichment  i chose to focus only on using features based upon the   tests  which also have the advantage
of easier biological interpretation  to avoid over fitting  i chose my set of   mer features to consist of  mer counts in the human sequence for the subset of   mers which were significantly enriched  p         
corrected for multiple hypothesis testing  either in the human sequence or for conservation relative to the
human sequence  and   mer counts in conserved aligned sequence for those which were significantly
enriched for conservation or significantly enriched within conserved sequence overall 
i also used additional non k mer features in developing the classifiers described below 
specifically  conservation of the exon  upstream intron  and downstream intron were each used as
features  as these have been previously found to be characteristic of alternative splicing events  in
addition  i chose to use splice site strength      as well as overall g c content of the exon and flanking
introns as features which should help lower the generalization error of this model  the overall expression
of the gene containing each exon was also tested as a feature for both classifiers described below  but did
not provide enough additional classification power to make its inclusion valuable  after considering that
such data was only available for      of transcripts  
prediction of novel tissue specific skipping events
using the feature selection described above  i first considered the problem of classifying brain
skipping events as compared to exons not tissue specifically alternatively spliced in brain  using the    
  mer features that were significantly enriched or depleted  p          corrected for multiple hypothesis
testing  in the set of     brain skipped exons  i first trained a nave bayes model using a randomly
selected set of     non skipped exons as the    control set  using    fold cross validation  i found that
either with or without the use of the additional non k mer features  the nave bayes model had     
generalization error  with such high error  i next turned to a svm approach  which typically has greater
success in classification problems with reasonably highly sized set of training examples   as the svm
implementation developed in class took far too long to train on the set of       training examples  i
turned to utilizing the svmlight publicly available svm implementation  which not only had the benefit of
faster run time  but also easily allows differential weighting of inaccuracy on    vs     training
examples 
using    fold cross validation  the training set was used to build an svm model using typical
parameters  c   and termination criteria of         and it was found to have      accuracy  however 
there are two main flaws in only considering generalization error for this problem  first  it is possible that
there are improperly labeled    examples in the    set that were simply missed by the micro array
analysis  and second  it is more important to have a low false positive rate than to accurately identify all
positive training examples  thus  by setting a cutoff such that examples are only classified as    if they

fiare at least l above the hyper plane defined by the support vectors  i was able to check whether the
algorithm was able to classify a smaller subset of positive training examples with higher confidence 
unfortunately  this approach was met with limited success  using a cutoff of    a default svm
implementation   there were     accurate positive predictions as compared to     inaccurate positive
predictions        accurate   whereas at a cutoff of      corresponding to an overall false positive rate of
      there were     accurate as compared to    inaccurate predictions          thus  i was only able to
gain      accuracy at a tradeoff of losing over     of the positive data 
by implementing the corresponding procedure for muscle specific skipping events  using the    
k mer features as described above  and training an svm using similar parameters  it was found to have
only      accuracy  similar to the brain specific classification attempt  at a cutoff of   there were    
accurate positive predictions as compared to     inaccurate predictions  whereas using a cutoff of    
gave a     increase in accuracy to     to     accurate to inaccurate positive predictions 
although these results are discouraging  it is clear that there is some amount of predictive power
in the features being used  and furthermore that the most trustworthy predictions  those furthest from the
separating hyper plane  are more likely to be accurate than those which are less clearly separated  as the
tissue specific training examples are from the first generation of exon arrays  and the algorithms to
identify these events are currently very basic  with better array technology and more accurate algorithms
it should become possible to generate a larger set of more confident tissue specific events  by using these
events  it should be possible to implement this procedure with even greater success 
classification of brain  vs  muscle specific skipping events
as a secondary question  i set out to develop a classifier that  when given a list of exons that are
known to be tissue specific as events in either brain or muscle  could accurately predict which tissue the
as was specific to  although this is perhaps less informative for genome wide identification of novel as
events  it is nonetheless interesting from a biological perspective to both be able to identify the features
common to each class of events  as well as to identify tissue specificity for as events de novo  and to
help annotate the specificity of events that were either not tested or are experimentally difficult to test by
the current high throughput approaches  using the set of     brain specific and      muscle specific
skipping events  i extracted the set of      mer features that were significant at p       after correcting
for multiple hypothesis testing  figure     along with the other features  such as g c content 
conservation  etc  as described above  using these features  i again trained an svm using svmlight  with
the parameter that training errors on brain specific events      would outweigh errors on the musclespecific events      by a factor of                  this was done in an effort to utilize all possible
training data  while avoiding an algorithm that simply predicted    for all feature vectors 

fifigure      mer features used for the svm  elements are grouped by their location relative to exons  with
elements enriched in brain  as compared to muscle  in red  and depleted elements in blue 

using    fold cross validation to train and test the classifier  it obtained      accuracy with a c
value of    modification of this c value did not significantly alter the accuracy of the classifier   in the
hopes of increasing classification accuracy  i again tested the effect of requiring that the margin of an
example be more than a certain cutoff  testing different cutoffs  i determined that at an optimal cutoff of
       the examples predicted to be in the    or    class were over     fold more likely to be accurate
than inaccurate  corresponding to an accuracy over      whereas without such stringent cutoffs there was
only a      fold enrichment for accuracy  figure    full svm line   to test the effect of different feature
sets  i completed the same analysis for an svm using only k mer features  i e   not using conservation 
g c content  etc   which achieved fairly similar accuracy with low cutoff values  but was not able to
achieve over     accuracy at any cutoff  figure    svm with only k mer features line   after retraining
this model over the entire training set  i predicted the tissue specific splicing for all         exons in the
full exon micro array dataset  and obtained       predicted brain specific and        predicted musclespecific events  although most of these events are likely to be false positives  since they are likely not
alternatively spliced in any tissue   it would be interesting to experimentally test a subset of these exons
using more stringent methods than the exon micro array to determine if many of these exons do in fact
show a tissue specific splicing pattern 
as an additional test  i attempted to use the ratio of overall expression of the gene in brain vs 
muscle as an additional feature  based upon the geneatlas publicly available gene level tissue expression
      using only the subset of training examples for which this data was available  i trained an svm on
this      of the full training set with the additional gene expression feature  perhaps as a result of this
smaller training set  training an svm using this additional feature resulted in far lower accuracy  figure
   full svm with gene tissue specificity added line   retraining the algorithm using different parameters
 c  stopping criteria  as well as using different kernels  including polynomial kernels of different degree 
gave similar or worse accuracy  indicating that the results in figure   are approaching the limit of
discriminatory power within this training set 

fifigure    svm accuracy with various margin cutoffs  multiple variants of the svm were trained and
compared for their ability to make correct predictions above different margin cutoff values 

conclusion
gaining knowledge about the mechanisms behind tissue specific alternative splicing is a critical
step in the understanding of what distinguishes different tissues in mammalian organisms  using genomewide tissue specific as information from recent exon micro array analyses in human brain and muscle
tissue  i was able to achieve moderate success in classifying exons according to their tissue specific as
pattern  using sequence information alone  i was able to achieve over     accuracy in distinguishing
between brain specific and muscle specific events  a level of success that could enable further
experimental analysis to verify predictions of novel brain specific or muscle specific events that are either
not covered by the current micro array technology  or are simply differences that are too small to identify
using current micro array analysis tools  with the continual availability of splicing micro arrays from
additional tissues  it will be interesting to apply this approach to events observed in other tissues  in the
hopes that the use of additional data will allow better identification of as events  and thus make possible
better classification tools
