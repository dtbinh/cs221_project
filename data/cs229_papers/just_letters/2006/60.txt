overview
rna is a nucleotide polymer transcribed from dna  once thought of as only a
messenger molecule  rna is know recognized to be essential to a wide range of cellular
processes including transcription  translation  and gene regulation  rna sequence
alignment has applications in rna structure prediction  phylogeny building  and the
detection of unknown function non coding rna  ncrna  sequences in the genome 
consequently  accurate rna sequence alignment is an essential tool needed to
understand basic biological and evolutionary processes 
rna sequence alignment remains a challenge for computational biologists since
ncrna can evolve by compensatory mutations  which maintain nucleotide base pairings 
but mask sequence homology  an rna molecules pattern of base pairings is called its
 d structure  or folding  figure    simultaneous sequence alignment and structural
alignment leads to more accurate alignments because both structure and sequence are
evolutionarily conserved at some rate  the superiority of this method was demonstrated
by the sankoff algorithm which simultaneously predicts rna sequence alignment and
 d structure  yielding higher quality alignments than previous algorithms  the downside
of this algorithm is that in runs in o n   time with respect to sequence length making it
useless for many common alignment applications 

figure    rna  d structure or folding is
the pattern of nucleotide base pairings 
as a compromise  the stral algorithm proposed in      performs rna alignment
using a condensed representation of rna  d structure  it performs the standard o n  
algorithm for sequence alignment  however the scoring function takes into account

sequence similarity as well as up stream and downstream pairing probabilities  a
weakness of the algorithm is that the relative importance of structural versus sequence
alignment is hand tuned by the authors 
supervised machine learning can be used to improve the performance of
structurally informed o n   rna alignment algorithms such as stral  the parameters
that determine the relative importance of structure and sequence can be optimized  as
well as the parameters for the sequence substitution matrix  the goal of this project is to
develop the best performing quadratic time rna alignment program  this work will
hopefully lead the development of higher quality rna structural prediction  phylogeny
building and gene finding 

methods 
step    complete implement the viterbi algorithm for finding the optimal alignment
based on the parameter set  the program uses a modified needleman wunsch algorithm
for global sequence  string  alignment  with affine gap penalties  this program is based
on a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the best scoring sequence  viterbi parse 
based on a gap opening penalty  gap extension penalty  and nucleotide substitution
matrix  the dynamic programming is based on the following recursions 

in the above recursions m i  j  is the match score at position  i  j   i is the insertion score
at position  i  j   s xi  yj  is a score for substituting the nucleotide at position i of sequence
  with the nucleotide at position j of sequence    the value from the sequence substitution
matrix   d is the gap opening penalty and e is the gap extension penalty

the alignment is then reconstructed based on pointers from the dynamic programming
matrices  an example matrix and constructed alignment

step    complete  learn nucleotide substitution matrix  gap opening penalty and gap
extension penalty using the perceptron algorithm  the highest likelihood parse is the
result of step    correct alignments are taken from the hand curated rfam database of
rna family alignments  this step also involves creating a representative training set
based on a random sapling of the hand curated alignments in rfam 
step    complete  add structural information into the viterbi algorithm  the
program will use contrafold  a probabilistic rna folding algorithm to fold each of
the sequences  it will then represent the output of contrafold as a matrix of basepairing probability vectors as described in the stral paper 
step    in progress  learn the structural substitution matrix and structure sequence
tradeoff parameters  the perceptron based algorithm created in step   will be modified
to include the structural information from step   
step    in progress  experiment with different feature representations  the length and
extant of this section will be determined by time constraints and may be done after the
conclusion of the course 
step    perform formal testing  benchmark performance of developed program against
stral  clustal  sankoff based algorithms and others

conclusion
the program  starting from randomly assigned feature weights  was able to learn
parameters for making accurate sequence alignments  the weights reflected known
evolutionary phenomenon  more specifically  matches were rewarded  whereas
mismatches and gaps were negatively weighted  unfortunately  there is nothing to
benchmark this program against since modern sequence aligners use richer feature sets
than the one currently used by the program  furthermore  many of them  such as
contralign do you use machine learning approaches to optimize their feature weights 
so there is no reason to expect superior performance from the developed program 
the integration of structural elements into the feature vector is currently under
development  the perceptron algorithm should learn these feature weights just as they
learned the weights of features derived from sequence elements 

discussion
i plan to continue this work throughout the next quarter  first of all  i am
interested to see how much of an advantage the introduction of structural features can
confer on alignments  in addition  experimenting with different feature representations of
the structure as well as seeing the consequent change in learned weights may provide
insight into the functionally aspects of rna secondary structure  for example  it may
demonstrate which features are important and which features overlap  i also hope to
experiment with different machine learning algorithms to see which one works best for
this particular problem  hopefully  implementation of a wide range of these algorithms in
the same setting will give me a better understanding of their differences in terms of
implementation complexity  accuracy for this type of problem  and specific run time 
finally  i hope the project will demonstrate the superiority of the learned approach over
the approach utilized by stral  it is my opinion that a machine learning approach will
allow me to integrate and optimize a more complex feature set than strals  leading to
better alignments  i hope that the final product will be of direct use to biologists and be
integrated into future bio computation tools
