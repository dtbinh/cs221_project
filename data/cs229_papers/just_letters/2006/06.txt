   introduction
the goal of this project is to explain some of the illusory phenomena using sparse coding and whitening
model  instead of the sparse coding method proposed by olshausen in      transient invariant sparse coding
is used  transient in variant sparse coding can learn larger bases compared to ordinary sparse coding 
which can help a lot in studying illusion phenomena  using small bases implies using small images  which
in turn might diminish illusory effect that we are looking for in the image 
in this report we first briefly explain image processing system in human brain  then the selected models
for modeling retina and v  part of the brain are discussed  part   of the report explains some of the illusion
effects that are going used for experiments  part   contains the experiments performed and results  finally
the last part describes the future work 

   human image processing system
as we know  mammalian visual system begins from the eye  eye can be considered as the lens of a
camera that transmits the light it receives from the world objects to the retina  retina consists of a large set
of photoreceptor cells that polarize the bipolar cells  bipolar cells in turn pass information to gangolian
cells which are the outermost layer of the retina  this information is then passed to lateral geniculate
nucleus  lgn  part of the brain 
the neurons of the lgn relay the visual image to the primary visual cortex  v   which is located at the
back of the brain  neuron responses in v  distinguish between orientations  spatial frequencies and color in
the image  the third step of information processing takes place in v  area of the brain  v  neurons respond
to contour stimulus and are not sensitive to phase changes in the image 

   sparse coding model for v 
for modeling v  part of the cortex  transient invariant sparse coding     model is used  the reason of
this selection is that transient invariant sparse coding can learn larger bases  which will help us in studying
illusory phenomena  in ordinary image sparse coding  each patch of images forms a column in a matrix  x 
the goal is to find a matrix a  in which each column is a basis  and matrix s where each column
corresponds to the activation of bases relative to each patch  ordinary spars coding tries to minimize the
reconstructing error by achieving the highest possible sparsity  the problem can be formulated as bellow
    

x  as      s

    for all i

fiin translation invariant spars coding  images  bases and activations are represented as two dimensional
arrays instead of vectors  in this algorithm  convolution and point wise product is used instead of matrix
multiplication  applying these changes the new problem can be defined by the following formula  which
tries to solve for a by minimizing the sum

the rest of the algorithm is similar to ordinary sparse coding  the first step is learning the bases and the
second step is reconstruction of the image  this process is continued until bases are converged 

   optical illusion
according to literature  an optical illusion is any illusion that deceives the human visual system into
perceiving something that is not present or incorrectly perceiving what is present      studying illusion
phenomena would help us to understand the visual system in the brain  while there are lots of different
types of visual illusion  this project focuses on brightness illusion  orientation illusion and watercolor
illusion 

brightness illusion
watercolor illusion

illusory contours

zollner effect

different types of optical illusion may correspond to characteristics of different steps in the visual
system hierarchy  for instance  brightness illusion might be explained by lateral inhibition in retina and v 
receptive fields  there is also lateral interaction between neuron activities in v  area  which may explain
orientation illusions such as zollner effect  orbisons and ehrenstein illusions  the third type of illusion

 

fithat is possibly explained by these hierarchical models is illusory contours  according to neuroscience
literature  illusory counters causes activation of neurons in v  area of the brain  therefore we expect to
explain them by v  models  since we only use v  model in this project  we are not considering illusory
contours 

   experiments
two different experiments have been performed in this project  the first experiment tries to justify
zollner illusion and second experiment concentrates on brightness and watercolor illusion 

     zollner illusion
as shown by the figure  in zollner effect  parallel lines seem to become closer to each other  the reason
of this effect might be misjudgment of the value of the angle between horizontal and diagonal lines  which
could be explained by lateral inhibition between v  neurons  the steps of our experiment are 
   learn bases from natural images
   observe bases activation for illusory images
   study bases activation considering what might causes illusion in v  area
in order to observe illusion in the image  we need a set of bases such that the difference between their
orientations is very small  bases learned from natural images do not have this characteristic  therefore     
hand made bases that have     degrees difference in the orientation are used instead 
unfortunately  the result of the experiment could not explain the illusory phenomena  since all the
activations corresponding to a horizontal line had a degree of orientation between   and    the expected
result would be activation values with   to   degrees of orientation  at least 

     brightness and watercolor illusion
the goal of the second experiment is to explain brightness and watercolor illusions  our hypothesis is
that whitening is performed by the early visual stages  but brain itself does a form of inverse whitening
operation in lateral visual system in order to compensate the whitening of the early stages  the steps of this
experiment are 
      

learn bases from natural images
reconstruct a group of natural images with transient invariant sparse coding using natural bases
learn inverse whitening filter for this group of images
reconstruct illusory images with transient invariant spars coding  using natural bases
apply learned inverse whitening filter to the reconstructed illusory images

       learn inverse whitening filter
in this stage  the goal is to minimize the error between the initial image and the reconstructed image
from the sparse coding  by applying a filter to the reconstructed image  the inverse whitening filter is
learned in frequency domain  the objective is to minimize the following equation 

min  x j  z j  g
j

 

 
 

fiwhere x j is equal to fft of jth image in the training data set  z j is equal to fft of the jth
reconstructed image and g is the inverse whitening filter which we are going to learn  assuming that there
is no dependency between frequency response of each filter  we can rewrite the above formula as the
following 

min   x j  s  z j   s  g s  

 

j

s

where s corresponds to each pixel of the image 
linear regression method is used to solve the above problem  parameters that should be learned are
different components of filter g  the closed form solution is calculated by taking the derivative according
to each component of g  and setting the derivate equal to zero

g s  is the first component of the g filter  other components of g are calculated with the same formula 
   images with    x    resolution were used in order to learn the inverse filter  the learned inverse
whitening filter has the same dimension as the training images  figure   shows amplitude of different
frequencies of the learned filter  as shown  the filter has larger values at lower frequencies  therefore
amplifies lower frequencies and can be considered as the inverse of whitening filter

       results
to do the experiment we needed to reconstruct the illusory images by the sparesnet code and then
convert them to frequency domain  in frequency domain  we can apply the learned g filter to the
reconstructed images  the next step is to apply inverse fourier transform and bring the images back to the
spatial domain  figure   illustrates one example of performing these steps on a sample image in the training
data set 
 

fifigure    left  input gray scale image   center  reconstructed image   right  reconstructed image after
applying inverse whitening
as shown in figure   left   inverse whitening tries to make the image smoother so it spreads out white
and dark borders  we were expecting to be able to demonstrate brightness and watercolor illusion by this
smoothening  the same test has been performed on brightness illusion and a group of watercolor illusions 
figure   shows brightness illusion image reconstructed by the sparse coding before and after applying
sparsecoding  as shown in the figure  before applying inverse whitening we can see a lighter and a darker
bar  but what we expected from inverse whitening was to make the left part of the image light with a lighter
bar at the center border and the right side darker with a darker bar at the same place  as shown in figure
  right   the expected result is not obtained 

figure     left  before applying inverse whitening   right  after applying inverse whitening
the same test was performed on a group of watercolor illusion images  expecting to see spreading of
the inside color or detecting the illusory contours  unfortunately the reconstructed images did not have
either of these characteristics  to make the experiment more accurate the same test was performed on
   x    images  which had the same result as    x    images 

   future work
there are two suggestions for future research  the first is to study other models of whitening which can
also help learning and parametrizing inverse whitening filter  the second suggestion is to re learn the bases
according to the un whitened images  meaning that the coefficients are derived based on old bases and
whitened images  and then bases are re learned for the un whitened images and obtained coefficients
