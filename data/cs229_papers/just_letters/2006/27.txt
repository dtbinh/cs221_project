i  introduction
after genome sequence is revealed  it becomes the significant issue to discover the
function of genes  the transcriptional regulatory network  trn   which describes
interactions between genes  is the key point to reveal the function of genes  the trn can
be constructed from the experimental data such as gene expression microarray data 
many computational and statistical methods using various resources have been studied to
construct the trn  but none of them is quite successful because biology system is very
complex and its experimental results are affected largely by environment and noise  for
example  supervised learning approaches using svm by qian et  al  qian      is robust 
but it does not consider network features by multiple tfs  bayesian network approach by
friedman et  al  friedman      finds network structure  but it is based on joint
probabilities which are hard to be obtained from small number of training sets 
in this project  we would like to provide network learning model using svm and
compare it with the previous svm approaches 
ii  data sources
collecting data
we used     microarray expression data sets for yeast
db
chip
which were collected and pre processed by stuart et 
al  stuart       we collected      confident
   
    
    
regulatory pairs from proteome database proteome  
since this database is based on literatures and curated
by human  it is highly confident  for biological
validation  we used the most recent chip chip
experiment data by harbison et  al  harbison       we collected      binding pairs with
p values less than       
processing data
we excluded genes which have missing data points more than      we only considered
     genes among total      genes  for      genes  there are missing data points of
      since it is statistically low enough  the missing points are set as zeros 
considered transcriptional factors
since the database has more tfs which are not considered chip chip experiments  direct
comparison between the database and chip chip experiments is not fair  therefore  we
only considered     common tfs of the both sides 
iii  classification using svm
training sets
we chose      confident pairs  which have common tfs with chip chip data  from the
database as positive training sets  negative training sets are chosen randomly excluding

fipairs of the database  because of the imbalance problem  it is common to choose    times
more negative sets than positive sets qian       but considering computing time  we
chose   times more negative sets 
features and kernel
qian et  al  concatenated data points of the tf and the target gene and made a feature of
double data points  to model co expressed patterns and reduce the dimension of a
feature  we made a feature vector by multiplying data points of the tf and the target gene
of the same experiments  then  we used a simple linear kernel  let e gi be the expression
level of the gene g at the experiment i   then the feature vector and kernel is like below 
    ptg       e t  e g         e tn e gn  
   
k  ptg   psh         ptg  t     psh  

   

iv  learning transcriptional factors using svm
review of previous approaches
as shown before  the pure supervised classification does not work well  one of the
possible reasons is that it cannot model regulations by multiple tfs  to model multiple
tfs and complex networks  bayesian network learning with posterior probabilities is
commonly used friedman       but the bayesian approach is not successful because
there are not enough data sets to get posterior probabilities confidently  we need to
combine robustness of svm and network learning of the bayesian networks 
modeling multiple tfs  features and kernel
let a gene g be regulated by tfs t         t n   tg   to model regulations by and and or
operations  we need to consider all co expression patterns 
   
e gi  
e t k i   sk    all subsets of tg  
t k  s k

it is hard to get the exactly same expression with the above  but we can get the similar
expression easily like below 
   n
 n
   
e t k i e gi  
 
  k  
 
let   i  g  be a feature at the experiment i for the gene g which is regulated by tfs
t         t n   then 
  i  g      e t  i e gi         e t n i e gi  
   
by taking a kernel

k i  g  g         i  g   t   i  g    
we can get expressions like the equation      finally 
k g  g        k i  g  g   
n

i

   
   

if two genes have different number of bound tfs  we can match the dimension by
repeating average of other tfs 
learning classification boundary using svm
using the above kernel and training sets of iii  we can learn classification boundary  the
prediction function with learnt parameters can calculate a confidence score for a test
sample 

filearning tfs using svm
tfs bound to a gene can be learnt using a greedy algorithm  let p g t  be the prediction
function for a gene g with a set of tfs t  
   initialize score      tg      
   get maxscore  

max

for all possible tfs

p   g tg    t i     t i   tg and tf t   which

maximize the score 
   if score       maxscore   update tg    tg    t      score   maxscore   and
repeat the step    otherwise  the algorithm is finished 
it is the similar approach with works by friedman et  al   but there are two different
points  one is that we are using confident scores instead of posterior probabilities  and
the other one is the reduction factor     it compensates effects of multiple tfs which
regulate genes independently

in the pure svm       pairs are chosen from the database as positive training sets and
     pairs are chosen randomly as negative sets         candidate pairs between    
common tfs and      genes except self regulation are tested  as results       pairs are
determined as true regulation pairs  among them      pairs are included in chip chip
data  its true positive rate is        svm network learning is used for up to   tfs 
positive training sets are chosen from the database  if a gene has more than   tfs   
mostly correlated tfs with the gene in the sense of gene expression are chosen  negative
training sets are chosen randomly with similar distribution as the positive sets      
genes are tested  as results       genes have one tf       genes have two tfs and    
genes have three tfs  among total      pairs      pairs appear in chip chip data  its
true positive rate is       
for both methods  the true positive rate is too low  it is mainly because chip chip data
and the database dont show a good correlation in the view of the gene expression
profiles  as shown in figure    score distributions between chip chip and random pairs
are similar  another reason is the gene expression profile used as features does not
indicate clear difference between positive and negative training sets  as shown in figure
  and    correlation coefficients of positive sets and negative sets have similar
distribution  even though their average is slightly different  it is not enough difference for
genome wide prediction  one possible reason is that the gene expression data is old 
they were measured in      and      with old method  which has lots of noise

vi  conclusion
as shown before  three data sources  the knowledge base  gene expression data and chipchip binding data are less correlated  for those uncorrelated data sets  the supervise
learning does not show good performance  for future works  we can test other machine
learning methods for gene expression data and compare with chip chip data  it will
verify the performance of machine learning methods
