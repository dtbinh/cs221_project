abstract
different types of bacteria have different cell shapes  in particular  caulobacter
crescentus is a crescent shaped bacterium that undergoes asymmetric division to give a
motile swarmer cell and a sessile stalked cell  however  when some genes are mutated 
its morphology may be affected in a variety of ways  for example  the bacterium may
grow filamentous or become rod shaped  our goal was to write a program that could
decide whether a given image shows wild type or mutant cells  we used the discrete
cosine transformation  dct  and its principal components as the feature space to
differentiate between wild type cells and mutant cells in general  we found that the
projection vectors of abnormally shaped cells to those of wild type cells had different
distributions  we also used locally weighted linear regression to successfully classify
wild type crescent shaped cells and mutant lemon shaped cells  future work includes
extending the program to automatically identify protein mislocalization mutants from
both phase contrast and fluorescence images

caulobacter crescentus is an aquatic  non pathogenic bacterium that has a distinct
crescent shape  it serves as a model organism for studying both the prokaryotic cell cycle
and how bacteria establish and maintain cellular asymmetry  as it progresses through the
cell cycle  it elongates and pinches off in the middle to give two daughter cells   a smaller
motile swarmer cell and a larger sessile stalked cell  figure  a   since the bacterium

 

filooks different under the microscope at different stage of the cell cycle  figure  b   we
can use its morphology as a means for us to track its life progression 
we can use morphology to determine if the cells are normal or abnormal  wild
type caulobacter cells have a stereotypical crescent shape and size  figure  a   in some
mutants  cell division cannot occur  instead  they grow filamentous and look abnormally
long  figure  b   in other cases  the deletion of certain genes or the mislocalization of
certain proteins causes polar defects  figure  c   furthermore  when intracellular
structural proteins are disrupted  the cells can lose its crescent shape and look like lemons
 figure  d   hence  we aimed to write a program  based on machine learning  that
could take in phase contrast images and tell us if the image contains wild type or mutant
cells

results and discussion
pre processing of images

figure    how we obtain individual cells from a phase contrast image 

 

fiwe pre processeed phase contrast images  each of which was    bit and of size
     by       to obtain segmented cell images  figure     we used a matlab built in
function called weiner  for noise reduction   we also tried the canny edge detector  but it
did not work very well on the input images   each image was segmented by thresholding 
cells were copied to individual boxes and oriented  so that the crescent side of each cell
faced the right hand side  the brightness and contrast level were adjusted  so that the
maximum brightness was   and the background level was   
classification by principal components
we first tried to use zernike moments to represent the segmented cell images 
zernike first proposed the zernike polynomials in       the moment formulation
appeared to be very popular for image analysis and was able to outperform several
alternatives in terms of noise resilience  information redundancy  and reconstruction
capability  teh and chin          however  we found that computation of the orthogonal
zernike moments was very slow 
instead  we used the  d dct to represent our segmented cell images  like any
fourier related transform  dcts express a function or a signal in terms of a sum of
sinusoids with different frequencies and amplitudes  ahmed et al          the dct is
often used in signal and image processing  especially for lossy data compression  because
it has a strong energy compaction property  most of the signal information tends to be
concentrated in a few low frequency components of the dct  indeed  we discarded all
the higher frequencies from the dct to reduce the original matrix of size     by     to a
   by    matrix  the error from discarding the higher frequencies was found to be
insignificant   then we calculated the principal components  pcs  of the feature vector 
figure   shows the first three pcs  the first pc seemed to be able to capture progression
along the cell cycle fairly well 

figure    the first three pcs of wild type cell images 

we projected the feature vectors of both wild type and mutant cells to the first
few principal vectors of wild type cells  the scatter plots of those projection vectors were
different between wild type and mutant cells  for example  the distribution of mrec
cells was clearly distinguishable from that of wild type cells  figure  a   cells
expressing plec gfp were usually shorter than wild type  thereby resulting in a larger
first pc  figure  b

however  we were unable to use these principal components to classify
wild type and mutant cells successfully  although the first few pcs represented the cell
shape of wild type cells quite well  they did not represent different types of mutant cells
adequately  since the calculated pcs were optimized for expressing the cell shape of wild
type cells  figure   shows that the residual errors of the mutant test set are much bigger
than those of the wild type test set

classification by locally weighted linear regression
we decided to focus on classifying wild type crescent shaped cells and mutant
lemon shaped cells  clearly  the width distribution along the cells long axis was different
between the wild type case and the mutant case  figure     this formed the basis of our
feature vector  which consisted of width measurements at    positions along the long
axis  we also divided cells into two types  those that had started to pinch  swarmers and
stalked cells  and those that were pinching  pre divisional cells  

 

fifigure    how the cell width varies along the long axis for both wild type and mutant cells 

we used locally weighted linear regression  so that the correct choice of features
became less critical  specifically  we wanted to minimize

fiwe performed hold out cross validation  our training set consisted of     wild
type cells and     mutant cells  the results are given in table    which shows that the
program can differentiate between wild type and mutant cells  furthermore  figure  
shows that crescent shaped cells and lemon shaped cells have different fits

future work
this research is still work in progress  firstly  we want the program to be able to
successfully classify other types morphology mutants  as shown in figure    secondly 
we want to extend the program  so that it can automatically identify protein
mislocalization mutants from both phase contrast and fluorescence images  a bacterial
cell  although small  has well defined compartments  for example midcell or the poles  
over the course of the cell cycle  different proteins localize to different positions in the
cell  figure     if we fluorescently tag the proteins  we can follow their localization
patterns over the course of the cell cycle  we can then compare the pattern seen in wild
type cells with the pattern in mutant cells
