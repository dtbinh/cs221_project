introduction
in server based video streaming systems  the content provider transmits a video stream to each client  e g 
pc  pda  set top box  etc   however  peer to peer  p p  streaming systems provide a more efficient
alternative  utilizing the uplink bandwidth of each participating peer  in server based streaming systems the
number of media servers required to serve an audience grows linearly with the number of viewers 
however  the p p approach is self scaling  since each peer acts as a media server 
in our p p video streaming system  multiple multicast trees are constructed as a distribution structure  a
video source  or the server  is the root of all trees  while other participating peers at either intermediate
nodes or leaf nodes  when a new peer joins a video multicast group  it needs to find parents  i e  nodes
from which it will be receiving its video input 
the join stage of connection establishment protocol  each joining peer contacts the server to obtain a list
of randomly chosen connected peers  the joining peer contacts all the members of the list and waits for
replies  from the replies  peers which report to have enough throughputs to support an additional peer are
considered as parent candidates  several additional criteria  discussed below  can also be considered in the
process of selecting a parent  once the parents are chosen for each tree  the joining peer sends out
connection requests to them and waits until it is accepted as a child 
so far  in many literatures  the number of peer nodes separating a peer from the video source has been
extensively used a parent selection metric  thus well balanced trees are constructed  minimizing the
likelihood of connection disruption due to loss of one of the intermediate peers  however  congestion 
bandwidth utilization and connection quality can be neglected in such tree construction scheme 
to develop a new parent selection algorithm  we propose a connection prediction method based on several
additional connection related parameters as a preliminary work  this method will predict connection
quality from peers  and shows the best connection that minimizes the likelihood of video packet loss  which
should correspond to better perceived video quality  we will use supervised learning to devise such a
metric  which will be used by each peer for selecting its parent  since peers run in real time  we operate
under complexity and memory usage constraints 

system
simulation
we have developed our peer to peer video streaming system as an extension module in the ns   network
simulator  since simulations can be run at our disposal  it is rather easy to create data sets from many
different point of views  in other words  adding or removing features is simple in the sense that we run a
new simulation by modifying the code and produce or suppress relevant observation values in the
simulation output

table    bandwidth distribution

each simulation consists of one video source and     peers  peers have heterogeneous bandwidth
described in the table    multiple multicast trees are constructed to distribute video packets from the source
to all other peers using our distributed p p protocol  the network topology used in the simulation is
depicted in the figure    the simulation length is    minutes  we ran several simulations to obtain raw data 
then  post processing is done to generate the final training data sets by evaluating the performance
statistics of each selected parent  as peers join and leave the group randomly according to poisson process 
we collect data from session lengths larger than    seconds to reduce the effect of different length of
sessions  also  we removed the sessions from the initial period when peers only join and none of them
leave  here  we define a session as a block of time in which a child peer is connected to a parent peer 
when disconnect from existing parent peers occurs  the child peer starts a new session with a new parent
peer  the following figure   shows the cumulative distribution of the session lengths obtained from the
simulation results

input features
we obtain the following measurements for data sets 
 connection time  session time for which the parent child connection is active
 hop count  number of peers in the logical path from the source to the peer
 number of children  total number of immediate children of the potential parent  i e  on all trees 
 bandwidth  peers uplink bandwidth
 network jitter  jitter in video packets inter arrival times
 rtt  round trip time to the parent at the time connection was established
 input video stream quality  number of received packets divided by the number of packets sent
out from the source over t seconds  t is set to    seconds 
 output video stream quality  number of transmitted packets to a specific peer divided by the
number of packets enqueued into the output queue

fioutput of the learning algorithm
evaluation of each peer  in other words  to predict connection quality that will be given by the peer is based
on the features obtained from the peers as input and the label we put on such features  since the timely
reception of video packets is critical for real time video streaming  we define in time packet reception rate
as the label 
while loss probability estimation seems to be a regression problem  using regression techniques can result
in several problems  it has been shown that randomization of parent selection is important for maintaining
balanced multicast trees  moreover  reducing the subtree size makes the system more resilient to peer
disconnections  on the other hand  the degree of precision of a regression technique will lead to a very
deterministic performance  since all peers will try to attach to the same  best  parents  moreover  the
training data might have a certain amount of outliers if not discretized  in order to avoid this case  we chose
to define the problem as a multi class classification problem  where     discrete classes of loss probability
might be defined  however  due to the way the quality values are distributed  where more than half of peers
report          quality   we reduced this further into a binary classification problem 

experiment  results and discussion
the p p system and the data loggers were implemented as plug ins for the ns   network simulator  the
generated data was preprocessed using a c   program  which modeled the system from the log data
generated on ns    the program summarized the data  so that a single training record reflects a single
parent child relationship   rescaled it  and calculated few statistics 

feature selection using logistic regression
we used logistic regression for feature selection  to see which feature is the most important  we filtered
out the unnecessary features based on their correlation with the ground truth values and between
themselves 

figure    training error with different feature sets

several stages of filtering brought the number of features down to the following three  with a negligible
increase in training error  as can be seen from the picture above  
 mean number of immediate children
 hop distance to the source
 uplink bandwidth

fione reasoning behind this result is as follows  the more peers register as children  the less resources will
be left to a child  which will cause a fan out effect  when all the peers will be equally starved  the
influence of the logical hops from the source can be easily explained by the fact that the probability of a
i  d

packet arrival is

      p

loss

 i     for distance d  where i is the link label 

i   

the most of the training sets we used showed significant correlation between the number of children and
hop distance  however we are unsure whether this would also be the case in significantly larger  several
orders
  of magnitude  data sets that we are unable to simulate  we tried all possible subsets of the three
latter features  while in most cases the performance suffered immediately 

binary classification using svm
using the features selected by the previous method  we utilized svm for a binary classification to
distinguish good peers and fair peers

table    bandwidth distribution  bw stands for peer uplink bandwidth  nhops for number of logical
hops to source  nchild for number of immediate child peers  last for the last report from peers
we tried several different combinations of features and the results are shown in table   above  if a peer
wants to use only one metric to predict a connection  the table suggests the uplink bandwidth of the parent
peer can act as the most influential single factor 
when the combination of the features suggested by the logistic regression results is used  it achieves the
lower testing error  but the difference is negligible  whereas  when we try the last combination  it
outperforms the other cases  including all possible choices of the features not shown in the table  in fact 
this leads us to a further investigation with a larger feature with similar characteristics of peers  in other
words  sampling the same feature from the peers can be a good measure for predicting connection qualities 
in the table  last means the last report from the parent peers

fifigure   shows the optimal gamma and c values used in svm  we adopted the gaussian kernel with the
l  regularization  using the optimal kernel parameters  about    of the error rate can be reduced 

conclusion
we have seen that connection quality can be well predicted using the statistics of its potential parent peers
at the time of connection establishment  the most important statistics were the peer bandwidth  number of
immediate children and hop distance from the source  i e  depth level   our prediction performance is fair 
but not excellent  however  it is good enough for our purposes  the algorithm provides a child a relatively
large list of parents  thus  the probability of selecting a misclassified parent is still relatively small  also 
getting the same features over time can lead to better prediction on connection qualities  it is also inferred
from the fact that the relatively high errors both in the training and testing sets may result from high bias in
the mode selection  with further investigation  this work may lead to develop a new method of parent
selection algorithm using connection prediction supported by this learning algorithm
