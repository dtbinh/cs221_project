abstract
the system identification of uav  which is the estimation of the parameters of the
equation of motion  is crucial for implementing the autopilot  the system identification especially with noisy data is challenging problem  in this report  we will
estimate parameters of equation of motion for dragonfly uav from stanford hybrid systems laboratory in aero astro department via baysian estimation  the
basic idea here is that the most probable coefficients of the equation of motion 
which is set to the unknown set  can be found by maximizing the probability of
that unknown set given the data  furthermore  from bayesian rule  the conditional
probability is proportional to the product of the likelihood function and the prior 
by properly defining the likelihood function and the prior  we will be able to find
the most probable unknown set of parameters  identifying the system of uav  the
performance of the estimator will be evaluated by cross validation and in particularly the benefit of the bayesian estimation will be highlighted by comparing it to
the general least square method 

 

bayesian system identification

the system identification is the first and crucial step for the design of the controller  simulation of
the system and so on  frequently it is necessary to analyze the flight data in the frequency domain
to identify the uav sytem  our approach  in this project  uses the data from the flight test of the
uav in time domain thus does not require to excite every mode of a given system  this approach
is beneficial in terms of the simpleness and computational efficiency as bayesian estimator can be
performed with less computational cost than frequency domain least square method  in addition  the
theoretical derivation is not limited to the linear system thus it can be easily extended to the nonlinear
system identification when the assumption imposed on the following theoretical background works
well 
suppose the system  which is linear or nonlinear  is given 
x t   
y t   

f  x  c    u t     t 
x t     t  

   
   

where x  y  rp   c  rk are state variable  system output and unknown coefficient vector to be
determined  also the dynamic noise and measurement noise are assumed as white gaussian noise
which satisfies the following property 
e   t       
e   t       
where     rp  

cov   t     d 

cov   t        i 

   
   

fianother assumption we will use through this report is that the full states were measured  thus  t 
can represent both the dynamic noise and the measurement noise  from this assumption our unknown set is reduced to m    c  d   the purpose of this paper  which is to find out the most
probable unknown set given the time series of data  can be achieved by choosing the unknown set
that gives the peak value of posterior probability  pps  m y   from bayes theorem 
pps  m y    r

p  y m  ppr  m 
 
p  y m  ppr  m  dm

   

the basic idea is to update the posterior of the unknown set by using the time sequence of data and
replace the prior by the posterior probability distribution  the theoretical detail and the application
in the case of the stochastic system driven by only white gaussian noise is well provided in      but
the application of bayesian inference to the practical system identification is meaningful task  the
noise property has a key role to construct the probability density function for the state variable  that
is time series of data  in our report 
   

maximum likelihood estimation

the midpoint euler discretization scheme is used to construct the discrete system 
xn  
yn

 
 

xn   hf  xn   c    hun   zn
xn  

   
   



where e zn   ztn    h  dnn    the last equality came from the assumption about  t  which is
previously mentioned  from this point  the state variable  xn   and the system output  yn   are set to
be identical  the procedure toward the most probable unknown set is as follows  the likelihood
function  p  y m  is obtained by transformation of the probability density function of zn to the
function of the output  yn   along the given data  adding initial guess for the prior distribution of the
unknown set gives the posterior distribution of the unknown set which has to be maximized 
the probability density function of zn along the given data is

p   zn

 h  n

n  
     h  d 

   

the transformation of the probability function from zn to xn is related by jacobian matrix 
p   xn     
jacobian matrix is

where  xj   j    j and ij  x  c    fx
  this assumption here is crucial to make the
j
objective function be a convex problem even in the case of the nonlinear system  thus a relatively
simple system such as lorenz system can be identified quite accurately     

substituting eq     and      into eq     and the probability of the initial state produces the probability density function of the state variable yn along the given data

where  yn   yn  hyn   now  f and c is the equation and unknown coefficients including input
signal and input coefficients 

fiwith the initial guess of gaussian in c and uniform distribution in d  the posterior of the unknown
set  which is the objective function is explicitly expressed 
 
  c  d    log l c  d    log p  m y    d    ct  d   ct  d c

the unknown set  m  maximizing the objective function can be obtained by iterating the maximization until the convergence  for the first iteration  cpr is used as the first guess for c and the unknown
set is updated subsequently while pr is updated as  d   the maximum likelihood estimate of d

cross validation and comparison with gls

the cross validation of bayesian system identification was performed by utilizing different flight
data from different dates and computing the averaged sum of squared error  to emphasize the
benefit of bayesian approach the sum of squared error of each state variable was compared with
one from gls generalized least square  method  table     represents the comparison of sum of

  conclusion and future work
combined with the simulated trajectory using the estimated model and comparison of sum of
squared error the conclusion can be drawn that the estimated system using bayesian approach tracks
the measured data quite well and beats least square method in time domain in terms of the averaged
sum of squared error  in addition  the pure system property can be obtained as bayesian system
identification can extract the information about the measurement noise  in other words  bayesian
approach is more appropriate when it comes to the system identification from very noisy measurement 
other advantage of this approach is that bayesian approach can be extended to nonlinear systems 
although the extension to the nonlinear system equation was limited because some of coefficients
depend on state variables  bayesian approach can be applied to the identification of nonlinear systems whose coefficients are constant 
it is well understood that the best way to test the performance of the system identification is to
implement the controller based on the identified model  this method was impossible due to various
reasons such as the limitation of time and cost  we would like to say that  however  the controller
execution to the real dynamic system is interesting and valuable future work
