final project  on the use and abuse of collaborative tagging data
paul heymann
 dated  december          
many applications could benefit from labeled metadata of the sort which collaborative tagging
systems produce  i looked at the data produced by one of these systems  the social bookmarking
system del icio us  to determine whether or not the tags produced by these systems are useful
externally to other applications as opposed to internally as a means of navigation  i found that due
to a variety of factors  the tagging data created by users tends to be much less well distributed and
has much more easily predictable information than systems like those of luis von ahn which are
specifically engineered for the purpose of leveraging users to create metadata  however  i also found
that the subjective  intrinsic information that users create may be more valuable than objective 
extrinsic information that they might be forced to create because of its difficulty of prediction

introduction

collaborative tagging systems have recently emerged
as a good way to leverage large numbers of users to
help organize very large  rapidly changing corpora which
would be difficult to organize automatically  ranging from
user contributed audio  photos  or video on a single web
site to the web as a whole  often  this works because
users are working in their own self interest as they mark
an object with a particular tag  and when all of these
tags are aggregated together  the system can make assumptions about objects based on the aggregate activities of hundreds of thousands or even millions of users 
much recent work has looked at what sort of norms arise
from collaborative tagging communities  whether a coherent taxonomy or folksonomy can be built from user
contributed tags  and what can be inferred about objects
and about tags based on a collaborative tagging dataset 
meanwhile  there are many cases in which large labeled datasets organized by thousands of users would be
immensely useful  one of the most obvious is search  an
area where advances in the fundamental methods seem to
have slowed  and emphasis now lies on how to gather increasing amounts of information about a given web page 
either contributed by the page creator  a trusted source 
or by users  luis von ahns work         has shown that
thousands of volunteers  if enticed by an entertaining
game  will be willing to label data for use in image search 
vision research  or logic based on a knowledge base  a
natural question is whether the data being generated by
collaborative tagging systems designed for user information retrievalin addition to luis von ahns explicitly
controlled systemscan also be used to learn  reason  or
retrieve information about a domain 
in this paper  i describe my experiments investigating
the extensibility to other tasks of one of the oldest types
of collaborative tagging systems  the social bookmarking
system del icio us      i chose del icio us because it is one

 electronic address  heymann cs stanford edu  many thanks to
hector garcia molina  my advisor  and daniel ramage for their
advice during this project 

of the largest collaborative tagging systems and because
the objects that it annotates  urls  should be of immediate use to the search problem  however  in the case of
many of my experiments  i believe that my observations
are likely to be true of any tagging system  for the most
part independent of its users and the objects that they
annotate  ultimately  it seems that the most valuable
information in social bookmarking systems  and perhaps
in collaborative tagging systems in general  may be the
temporal and personal qualities of tags  rather than their
organizational qualities

preliminaries

in the course of this paper  i will use the following conventions  when a user annotates an object in a collaborative tagging system  in my case  a social bookmarking
system   i will call this a post  a single post will consist
of one or more triples of the form   ti   uj   ok   where
ti is a tag  uj is the user making the post  and ok is
the object being annotated with the tag ti   in my case a
url  when there is a triple containing tag ti and object
ok   i say that tag ti annotates object ok   finally  i say
an object ok is a positive example of a particular tag ti
if that tag annotates the object  and a negative example
otherwise

del icio us dataset

my dataset consists of          unique urls 
            posts  and          unique tags  i gathered
my data from the del icio us site over the course of several weeks in october       i used a crawler which
started at the tag web and expanded outwards  treating del icio us as a graph where each user  tag  or url
has outlinks to other users  tags  or urls  my initial
del icio us crawler found             distinct urls and
             posts of which i was able to download and

get page text for            if there is any bias in my
results due to my methodology for gathering data  it is
most likely that it is biased towards tags or users closest to the web tag  there are relatively few published
statistics on the size of del icio usa recent article    
put the number of posts at    million and the number
of distinct urls at    million  so my dataset is probably a substantial portion of the total posts  but probably
under represents the number of distinct urls substantially  because these are harder to reach using my crawling method  
the number of triples per tag is distributed according to the power law distribution shown in figure   a  
there are              triples in the corpus  so each url
is annotated on average with about    tags  because of
the power law distribution  more than half of the tag instances in the corpus are annotations of urls with tags
that are among the top     tags  likewise  the top     
tags on del icio us comprise over     of the triples in
my corpus  the     th most common tag  debugging  occurs        times and is     times less common than the
 nd most common tag  software   appendix a contains
a list of the top     tags in my dataset 
one difference between collaborative tagging systems
and systems like those created by von ahn is that the
latter meticulously control the data that users contribute 
specifically  von ahns systems both make it difficult to
add poor metadata  often because the metadata must
match another  random user who the current user cannot
communicate with  and predetermine which objects any
given user is allowed to annotate  by contrast  users of
del icio us and other collaborative tagging systems can

usually add whatever annotations they desire to whatever
objects they desire 
this turns out to be problematic  because for an equal
number of users  systems which are explicitly designed for
gathering metadata like von ahns will produce orders of
magnitude more usable metadata about the objects in
the system  the reason for this is that there exist power
laws over the distributions of tags to urls and urls
to tags which are the direct result of users being able to
annotate what they desire  rather than what is unlabeled
in the system  see figures   a  and   b    the result is
that if we consider our unit of work to be one post by a
user  one half of the work in the system is concentrated
on the top      urls  three quarters on the top     
and nine tenths on the top       and    percent on the
top       urls  put another way  about    percent of
the effort by users of del icio us goes in to labeling less
than     percent of the data 
arguably  most of the    percent of effort dedicated to
the top     percent of urls is wasted effort   furthermore  as a result of the neglect of the less popular urls 
we have much less information over which to aggregate
and reason about these urls and determine which of
the metadata generated by users is good  and which
is bad   however  this is not a completely hopeless
situationit may be possible to leverage agreement with
others on the most popular urls to determine the trust
or level of confidence we have in the quality of tags that
a given user uses to annotate less popular urls  

iii 

i also found that the act of tagging seems to lend itself to certain types of behaviors that make the tags less
valuable as organizational metadata  the primary advantage of tagging is that it can be done very quickly as
a free association based on the object being tagged   as
a result  users can be bothered to tag and do not need
any training to do so  unlike determining where in a complex hierarchy an object belongs  or what keywords out
of a specific predetermined vocabulary might apply to an

 
 
 

 

 

the unused pages were primarily either inaccessible or were not
classical web pages  being either rss feeds  binaries for download  or otherwise 

tagging bias

in theory  each post could have different tags for the same url 
but in practice this is not the case 
i leave these notions intentionally vague  though bad could
mean anything from meaningless to noisy data to spam 
one reason i did not pursue this task is that while this might help
with determining quality of the contributions of non adversarial
users  e g   non spammers   without a social network or other
mechanism  this metric would be relatively easy to exploit to
increase ones trust according to the system 
arguably  the features that collaborative tagging systems are
non hierarchical and that their vocabularies are determined by
the evolving needs of their community are very important as well 
but i believe that the fundamental reason that these systems
work is because the ease of tag creation overcomes whatever free
rider effect there might be

table i  java tag example 

object  however  i found that in practice this free association seems to often be biased by what the user has
most recently seen  and that some of the most obvious
terms that users have been primed to use as tags may be
determinable automatically

bias due to location

i found two somewhat surprising things regarding the
url of a web page and the tags that are applied to it 
   users will tag an object with the location of that
object  for instance  when users bookmark an interesting photograph on the web site flickr  they
will often tag it flickr 
   often  a popular site will be dedicated to a very
small set of closely related topics that all fit under
a single tag  for instance  for the   th most used
tag  video  two sites entirely dedicated to video content  youtube com and video google com  make up
      of the urls which are annotated with the
tag  and        of the urls at those domains are
tagged with video 
these two observations may be specific to social bookmarking systems  but i believe that the first might apply
to any system which has areas or topics for objects 
and the second might apply to any system for which there
is an easy way to determine a set of tags which automatically follow from facts about the object  for instance  a
user who always posts photos of cats to a collaborative
tagging system for labeling photographs  
to get an idea for how prevalent these activities are 
i calculate the percentage accuracy i would have for the
given tag on positive or negative examples of that tag if i
just classified pages as positive if they are from a domain
with greater than   percent of the domain annotated
with the tag  and negative otherwise  figure   shows the
accuracy on positive and negative examples respectively
for different values of   while table ii shows the average
accuracies over the top     tags for different values    
and table i shows an example of the phenomenon for the
tag java 
overall  of the top     tags which make up more than
half of the triples in my dataset  i can recover between
  and    percent of the positive examples with a false
positive rate of between   or   per      and   or   per

accuracy on negative examples

      respectively  as a result  with some very conservative methods  one could probably obviate the need for
a large proportion  though not the majority  of triples
that users create with a relatively low false positive rate 
one interesting aspect of behavior where users add
obvious tags that can be predicted by location is that
it actually may help aid in recall for the user  but it only
aids the community if the system cannot automatically

on what the tag describes  and marlow et al s which identifies
the purpose of the user when applying the tag 

detect pages at a given location and filter by them  and it
does not aid people who would use the dataset for other
purposes  while other researchers have noted that some
tags  for instance  personal  do not really add any information  i think that the use of location based tags
is an odd and remarkably frequent case where users are
perhaps actually trying to explicitly help organize and
annotate the corpus  but are failing to provide valuable
non obvious information 

others  while a user who chooses a tag that occurs in
the page text gives less information to someone trying to
learn the general categories that the page pertains to  it
may emphasize aspects of the page that the user thinks
are more important

intrinsic and extrinsic tags

bias due to page text

i found some preliminary data to suggest that users
may be primed to some extent by the page text when
they tag  while this is not a strong enough signal to
classify just based on the tag  or a few derivatives of
the tag  i did find some surprising things when i applied
feature selection methods to the page text of tagged web
pages 
the two feature selection heuristics i used were mutual
information and   which are both commonly used in
text classification  i found that very often  even in what
would seem to be unlikely cases  the tag is one of the
most correlated terms in page text  table iii shows the
two sets of results for mutual information and     the
high rank of the tags in the list of correlated terms for
most tags means either or both of two things 
   users are primed with the page text when tagging 
so they often choose tags which are in  or appear
prominently in  the page text 
   any properly named category should have a high
correlation with its contents  and users just happen
to be good at choosing category names 
i believe that a little of both is probably occuring  we
should expect to see the words tags represent highly correlated with themselves  but i also found evidence of tags
like interesting which are highly correlated with themselves  according to     that one would not expect to
find as a highly correlated term 
if users do in fact tend to choose words from the page
text when tagging  then this may be as much of an advantage to some applications as it is a disadvantage to

various researchers have suggested different ways of
grouping the fundamentally different classes of tags in
tagging systems  golder and huberman     group tags
by whether they are extrinsic or intrinsic to the user 
and hence to what extent other users will agree that a
particular object should be tagged with the tag  in contrast  marlow et al      group tags by whether their intent
is organizational or social  and focus on the intent of the
user when creating the tag  rather than whether the tag
has meaning independent of the user  table iv shows
the two sets of types of tags 

a 

text classification with tags

in order to explore the predictability of tags  and hence
the amount of information that different tags were adding
beyond page text  i set up a series of text classification
experiments on a per tag basis  i did a set of experiments using support vector machines  and specifically
thorsten joachims svmlight package  as binary classifiers for tags  for each tag  i created two sets of positive and negative examples  one training and one test
set  the positive and negative examples in both sets  because i had many more negative examples than positive
examples  were artificially set to be in a ratio of one positive to two negative examples  i did not modify any of
the parameters of the svms i trained based on the test
set results  so i did not do a second level development
set test set split

classifying results

my goal in performing classification was to see which
tags provided more information  or more difficult to predict information  than others  for the purposes of this
paper  i avoid touching on the complex questions of what
distribution of data should be trained and tested on  and
what sort of false positive rate would be reasonable if one
wanted to predict tags at the scale of the web  figures   
   and   show best k versus precision graphs for several
example tags 
what i found was that in terms of classification  golder
and hubermans classification of tags as extrinsic versus
intrinsic  seems to correlate well with the relative difficulty of tag prediction of a given tag  for the most part 
the relative precision of my binary classifiers for each tag
fell into three categories  by decreasing precision  
   extrinsic tags describing topics or subject matter with very well defined vocabularies  like programming languages  php  java  seo  and fields or
specialties  seo  fonts  typography  recipes   as well
as tags which act in this way by virtue of other
factors  like the common domain result discussed
above  google  
   extrinsic tags describing topics or subject matter
which are inherently vague  like media  management  and tutorials or intrinsic tags for which the
community has some common standards  for example wishlist and funny  the latter of which is largely
synonymous to humor   
   truly intrinsic tags which only have meaning in relation to the individual who applied them  like interesting  inspiration and cool 
interestingly  the community seems to play a large part in
the extent to which a particular tag will be predictable 
both in general  e g   if the community only chooses a
small subset of web sites for pages tagged with java  and
specifically when dealing with intrinsic tags  furthermore  this means that intrinsic tags which have meaning
to a particular community may be predictable  but may
not transfer meanings between communities  

v 

termine if tagging data may be useful for other applications as well as internally to improve a collaborative
tagging system  what i found was neither that the data
is or is not useful  but rather that collaborative tagging
systems have some qualities which make them useful for
some tasks and not others 
specifically  i found that collaborative tagging systems
are very inefficient for objectively labeling data as a function of effort from the users      of the effort expended
on tagging web pages in del icio us in my dataset is dedicated to the roughly two percent of pages which already
have     or more bookmarks  much of the labeling that
is done includes tags which are either obvious from the location of the page  flickr or google  or arguably might be
extracted from the page text   compared especially to
systems designed for the purpose of using many users to
label data  like the esp game  del icio us appears to be
producing orders of magnitude less descriptive information per url than a system which through constraints
on user behavior could force the users explicitly to tag
particular web pages with certain types of descriptive information 
however  on the other hand  i found that collaborative tagging systems may in fact produce a large amount
of data which while not the objective labeling of objects
with descriptive labels that cannot be predicted  may be
more useful than that data would be  specifically  intrinsic rather than extrinsic tags may help give opinion
information not available elsewhere on a particular object  and data that results from the continuous  temporal
nature of tagging systems may help provide a clue as to
what is important and what topics users currently view
as important 
ultimately  it seems that the extrinsic  descriptive information in a collaborative tagging system is useful for
internal navigation within the system because most users
will probably be interested in the most popular items 
while the intrinsic information and the information generated implicitly by users may be the most useful for
external applications 

conclusion
 

i studied a large subset of the data in one of the most
popular collaborative tagging systems  del icio us  to de 

 

 

and to a lesser extent marlow et al s designations to the extent
to which social versus organizational mirrors intrinsic versus extrinsic 
for example  one imagines that the relatively highly predictable
wishlist tag might not cross over from the largely technology
based community of del icio us to the general public 

my work classifying tags using svms has left me all the more
uncertain about what a truly relevant measure of success is when
attempting to automatically predict the tags on pages  specifically  i wonder about the following issues in order of difficulty 
 a  what is a reasonable distribution of positive and negative
examples for a given tag to approximate the real distribution on
the web in order to produce proper precision  recall  and f  numbers   b  when predicting tags  do we care much more about
our predictions on some pages  like the most popular or authoritative pages  than others   c  if we try to predict tags on the web
in general  will our results necessarily be flavored by the nature
of the community from which we gathered our training data  is
this the case for some tags and not others
