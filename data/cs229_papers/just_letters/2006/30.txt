introduction

weblogs are personal  journal style internet entries that provide a glimpse into the bloggers life
or his opinions regarding a matter of interest  following its debut in       the rapid growth in the
number of blogs has also led to an increased interest by both the academic and business
community  some examples of ongoing research in this area include social network analysis and
the mining of information and product opinions  our research focuses on a combination of mood
classification and the effects of age and gender on blogging  our goals include    the prediction of
age and gender using feelings alone and    the clustering of feelings and location based
respectively on co occurrence in people and feelings

data pre processing

the data for the project is taken from the website http   wefeelfine org   presently  there are a
total of       valid feelings present within this database  if a sentence within a weblog contains
the phrase i feel x or i am feeling x and the feeling x corresponds to a valid entry  the
sentence and the associated feeling is extracted from the database  together with other information
such as the url  authors age  gender  geographical location and weather conditions at the time
of the weblog post 
instead of using all the valid feelings in the database  we first reduced the list down to the most
commonly occurring valid feelings  this was done by counting the number of times a valid
feeling occurred in a google query feel x or feel like x  where x denotes the feeling  if a
feeling occurred more than      times in a google query  the feeling was marked viable  this step
resulted in a final list of     viable feelings  the next step was to use a script to obtain all the
information  age  gender etc   corresponding to the viable feelings  after we extracted the
required information from the database  we clustered the information according to the url 
thus  each unique url is an entry in the extracted dataset and the values corresponding to a
feeling are the total number of occurrences of the feeling in the weblog  for example  if a blogger
expressed the feeling happy only on two occasions  the feeling happy will take the value of  
for that entry  given this implementation  a person with more than one weblog will thus appear as
multiple separate entities 
the extracted data was found to be skewed and relatively noisy  various research studies indicate
that the majority of bloggers are teenage girls and that the mean age of bloggers is approximately
   years  our data substantiate this claim as most bloggers in our dataset fall between the age
ranges of        and females bloggers account for     of all teenage bloggers  bloggers within
the age of          refer figure   
as we are interested in predicting the age and gender of a blogger  we next removed all entries
that did not contain any of this information  we also removed entries in which the age listed was
greater than     the likelihood of a person having a weblog decreases with increasing age and
entries with an age value greater than    are likely to contain spurious age data 
 

this website was chosen as we are working with professor sep kamvar  one of the co originator of the
website  on this project and we inform him of the results obtained from this research

after performing the pre processing steps  each entry in the final dataset consists of a count of the
number of occurrences of a feeling within a weblog  for all viable feelings  as well as information
relating to either the age or gender and other information such as the weather condition and
geographical location  a check of the data revealed that not many people expressed feelings
within their weblog  as a result  the feature vector of the feelings was relatively sparse 

iii 

feature selection

using this dataset  we next applied feature selection techniques to extract the feelings that allow
us to distinguish between different age groups and gender 
we first examined the dataset to obtain the list of common feelings for each age group and
gender  examining the list of top ten common feelings by gender did not give us further insight as
we found that the list was the same for both genders   next  we repeated the procedure for the list
of salient  feelings  amongst the     viable feelings  not many feelings appeared to be salient
towards men or women  similarly  there were not many salient feelings towards people in the
different age ranges of              and        however  we came up with a number of
interesting observations for bloggers in the age range of       and         figure    for
example  it appears that bloggers in these age ranges tend to feel more claustrophobic as
compared to the entire population  the proportion of people who expressed this feeling in their
blog was   times over the normal rate  for age range        and    times over the normal rate
 for age range        
two feature selection techniques     were used to obtain the set of feelings that distinguished
different populations   the   statistic and the information gain  the   statistic measures the lack
of independence between a term t and a category c  a natural zero of the   statistic indicates
independence of term and feeling  the given measure is

 

the top five common feelings of both genders include better  bad  good  right  sorry 
feelings are salient to an age group   gender if they occur with higher frequency in the age group   gender
than in the whole population

where n  total number of documents  a  number of co occurrences of t and c  b  number of
occurrences of t without c  c  number of occurrences of c without t  d  number of times in which
neither t nor c occurs 
information gain is a common feature selection technique in machine learning applications  the
information gain of term t is defined as

implementation of these two algorithms gave us two additional separate sets of feeling feature
vectors for input into the classification algorithms  each entry xi in the feature vector corresponds
to the number of times the i th feeling occurs within a specific weblog  as mentioned previously 
most of the entries in the feature vector are either  s or  s as not many feelings are associated
with a specific weblog  when feelings are expressed within the blog  the same feelings typically
do not occur multiple times

comparison of classifiers

we compared the performance of a number of classifiers in predicting age range and gender
given a set of feelings  in addition  we applied the method of hold out out cross validation in our
experiments  using     of the data for training and     for testing  the nave bayes classifier
with the multinomial event model was chosen as a baseline classifier  in addition  we
implemented the classifier with laplace smoothing so as to avoid the cases when the probabilities
ks are approximately zero  that is

prediction of age range using feelings
we are interested in predicting age range  y  using feelings  x   since there are five age ranges 
we expect a human to be able to predict the correct age range by chance     of the time  for this
section  we compared the performance of the nave bayes classifier versus the support vector
machine  svm  classifier  for the svm classifier  we initially considered a regularization
parameter c    subsequently  we used      training examples to obtain a regularization
parameter c     
table   contains the classification results of the various classifiers  we note that the classification
accuracy is similar for the two classifiers

we note that the classification accuracy is lowest for the case when we considered only entries
with more than    feelings expressed  this is due in part to an insufficient number of training
examples with more than ten feelings in the feature vector  in addition  the results also indicate
that knowing the gender does not significantly improve the classification accuracy 

prediction of gender using feelings
our next model of interest is to predict gender  y  based on feelings  x   since there are only two
classes  we expect a human to make the correct prediction by chance approximately     of the
time  in this section  we considered the use of the nave bayes classifier  with laplace
smoothing   decision tree and the multi class real winnow  mcrw  algorithm

from table    we observe that the nave bayes classifier gives the best performance for the
dataset in which individual feature vectors contain more than ten entries  however  as noted
previously  it is difficult to find a big dataset that fit this criterion  thus  we next compare the
performance of the various classifiers using the dataset in which each feature vector contains
more than five feelings  in addition  instead of using all     viable feelings  we consider only the
features obtained using the   statistic  results are shown in table    we note that there is a slight
improvement in classification accuracy for the nave bayes classifier      as compared to    
previously   thus the feature selection method was able to choose good  feeling  features that
better distinguished the genders

secondary analysis  clustering and co occurrence

a secondary investigation involves the determination of similarity between different locations
and the clustering of similar feelings  this was done using the similarity measure

and the co occurrence matrix of feelings  in our experimentation

we noted that the countries that were similar to the united states  in terms of proportion of
individual feelings expressed in weblogs  include japan  similarity measure        germany 
france  ireland        and sweden         another observation pertains to clustering of similar
feelings  a person who expresses the feeling of unwell in one weblog is also likely to express
the feeling of better  the most commonly expressed feeling  better  also co occurs
frequently with feelings of good  bad  right  sick  down and guilty

conclusion

given a set of feelings  we used feature selection to obtain those feelings which allow us to
distinguish between different gender and age ranges  the feature selection algorithm using the  
statistic also returned a suitable set of features that allowed for improved classification accuracy 
we also compared the performance of various classifiers in predicting gender and age range
based on feelings alone  in both instances  the nave bayes classifier gives the best performance 
in addition the classification accuracy improves with more feelings expressed within the feature
vector  the second part of our analysis is dealt with in lesser detail in this paper as information
regarding the characteristics of the population and the similarities or differences between various
cities and countries are statistics pertaining directly to the data available on the website
http   wefeelfine org and as such  are useful mainly for publication on the website
