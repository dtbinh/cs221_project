introduction

the optimization of subsurface flow processes is important for many applications including oil field operations
and the geological storage of carbon dioxide  these optimizations are very demanding computationally due
to the large number of flow simulations that must be performed and the typically large dimension of the
simulation models 
in this work  reduced order modeling  rom  techniques are applied to reduce the simulation time of
complex large scale subsurface flow models  the procedures all entail proper orthogonal decomposition
 pod   in which a high fidelity training simulation is run  solution snapshots are stored and an eigendecomposition is performed on the resulting data matrix  a clustering procedure to reduce the size of the
eigen decomposition problem and the resulting number of degrees of freedom is also implemented  extensive
flow simulations involving water injection into a geologically complex  d oil reservoir model containing       
grid blocks are presented 

 
   

modeling procedure
reservoir simulation model

oil reservoir simulation involves the solution of equations governing the flow of reservoir fluids  oil  gas and
water  through porous subsurface formations  more general formulations track individual components  e g  
methane  ethane  etc   and or include thermal effects  for simplicity  here is considered oil water flows in
the absence of gravity  the simulator into which the rom is implemented is quite general  so more complex
systems could be considered with relatively slight modifications 
the governing equation for flow of oil  gas and water in a porous media is determined incorporating
darcys law and mass balance      the fully implicit solution of the reservoir simulation model is given by 
tn   xn    d xn    xn    q   r

   

where t is a block pentadiagonal matrix for two dimensional grids and a block heptadiagonal matrix for
three dimensional grids  d is a block diagonal matrix  q represents the source sink terms and r is the
residual vector  the time level is designated by the superscript n or n      the tn   xn   term represents
convective effects while the d xn    xn   term represents accumulation  the matrices t  d and q depend
on x and must be updated at each iteration of every time step 
equation     is nonlinear and is solved by applying newtons method  j   r  to drive the residuals
to zero where j is the jacobian matrix given by jij   ri  xj and i   xn   k

proper orthogonal decomposition

proper orthogonal decomposition  pod  was developed to identify coherent structures in dynamical systems 
the basic idea of the pod technique is to project a high dimensional model onto a low dimensional model 
to generate a pod reduced order basis a time simulation of the high dimensional flow model is performed
and the states of the system are saved by recording s snapshots for the primary variables oil pressure and
water saturation for all nc grid blocks 

 

fithe reduced order basis generated for the pressure state will be different from the one generated for the
saturation state because each represent unique physical processes  therefore  the rom must be applied
once for the pressure state and once p
for the saturation state  after the snapshots
are obtained  the mean
of


s
the snapshots is computed as x   s  i   xi and the data matrix as x   x   x       xs  x nc s  
then  a correlation matrix c is determined applying the method of snapshots      with this method 
instead of computing a matrix of dimensions nc  nc   a much smaller matrix of dimensions s  s is computed
as c   xt x and a small eigen decomposition problem can be solved as c    where  represents the
eigenvectors and  the eigenvalues of c  respectively 
ps
next  the pod basis vectors can be written as a linear combination of the snapshots
 j   i   i jxi  
after s basis vectors are computed the basis matrix of dimension nc s is given by             s n s  
c
moreover  the eigenvalues are related to the energy of the system and  after arranging the eigenvalues
in decreasing order  this energy can be used to classify the eigenvectors  consequently  some of them can be
removed from the basis matrix because they have very low energy and do not have significant
information
ps
about the model under study  i represents the energy of each basis vector  et   i   i and  is the
fraction of the total energy et that will be retained  also   can be different for the oil pressure and water
saturation states  the number of basis functions retained  designated l  is simply the first l eigenvalues
necessary to provide e  et  
now the reduced state vector for the oil pressure or the water saturation is given by the transformation
equation z   tl  x  x  
as indicated above  for an oil water system two transformation matrices will be created  lp and ls for
the oil pressure and water saturation states  respectively  where lp represents the number of retained basis
vectors for the pressure state and ls for the saturation state 
a key aspect of the reduced order modeling process is the generation of snapshots  the information
embodied in the snapshots is used to compute the pod basis and therefore impacts strongly the ability of
the reduced order basis to represent the states of the system  the predictive capabilities of the model are
important because our target application is production optimization  this means that we require the rom
to be predictive for a variety of different flow scenarios  and these scenarios are not known in detail when
the snapshots are generated 

   

reduced order reservoir model

the intent is now to introduce the reduced state z into the discretized flow equations  this will allow to
solve for only lp   ls unknowns rather than  nc unknowns  by inserting the transformation equation into
the discrete model equation   and premultiplying by tl   the reduced form of the residual equation for the
fully implicit solution is given by 
tl tn    l zn     x   tl dl  zn    zn    tl q   tl r   rr

   

tl j l  

similarly  the reduced jacobian can be computed as jr  
finally  newtons method can be
applied to the reduced system of equations as jr r   rr where  r  i   zin   k    zin   k  

   

clustering snapshots

although the pod basis is optimal in the sense that it captures the most information in an average sense  the
number of snapshots needed to capture all of the necessary information to construct a reliable reduced order
basis can be substantial for complex reservoir simulation models  as a consequence  the eigen decomposition
problem can become very time consuming  in addition  although large snapshot sets may contain the information needed to construct the reduced order basis  they also contain redundant information that could be
removed without affecting the quality of the rom 
one option to address this problem is to apply a technique that clusters a large set of snapshots
 x         xs   into a smaller number of clusters  in our approach  the target number of clusters c is specified
and the cluster centroids            c are initialized  this can be accomplished by choosing randomly c snapshots  the algorithm then computes the distance between every xi and all  j as di   arg minj k xi   j k
and assigns each snapshot xi to the closest cluster centroid  j   the cluster centroids are then shifted so that

 

fip
each centroid is the mean of all of the snapshots assigned to it given by  j   s j kj xk   where sj is the
number of snapshots in cluster j 
this algorithm is not guaranteed to converge to the global minimum  the clustering procedure is therefore
several times using a different set of initial cluster centroids  the solution with the lowest
ps repeated
i
i
i   k x   d k is then used  applying this procedure  s snapshots are reduced to c centroids  then the
pod procedure described earlier is applied to the c centroids  resulting in a smaller eigen decomposition
problem 

   

implementation in general purpose research simulator

stanfords general purpose research simulator  gprs   originally formulated by cao      has evolved into
a modeling package containing many advanced capabilities and features  all of the simulations presented
in the following sections were performed using a new version of gprs which is able to handle the pod
procedure described above 
the rom described previously can be separated into off line  pre processing  and in line portions  the
off line portion  executed just once  contains all of the computations needed to construct the rom  this
entails first running a training simulation and recording snapshot sets for pressure and saturation  then 
following the procedure given in section      the snapshots can be clustered and the basis functions generated
 section      
the in line portion of the rom can be applied for a variety of different simulation scenarios  the basis
functions  as determined from the off line procedure  are inputs  then  within the newton loop  the standard
jacobian matrix and residual vector are generated  after which the reduced jacobian and residual are formed 
then the reduced vector of unknowns  z  is determined by applying newtons method  after which the full
state vector  x  is reconstructed  the model initialization and time stepping are exactly as in the standard
simulator  the reduced order models generate small but full matrices  we therefore apply direct solution
techniques for these linear systems 
in the following section  the performance and timing of the rom will be compared to full gprs simulations  so some discussion of the linear solvers applied in gprs is appropriate  the linear system of equations
arising in the full simulation model is very sparse  for this solution  gprs employs the iterative generalized
minimum residual  gmres  solver along with various preconditioners  the constrained pressure residual
 cpr  preconditioner is the most advanced option  this preconditioner is specially designed for the reservoir
simulation equations  it takes full advantage of the elliptic character of the underlying pressure equation 
and is therefore highly efficient  most comparisons will be against full simulation models that use cpr  so
the comparison will be against what is believed to be  essentially  the best current procedure  more generic
preconditioners  such as ilu     are also available within gprs and will be considered 

   

reservoir simulation results using reduced order modeling  rom 

the application of rom to a realistic reservoir simulation model is illustrated and the ability of the rom to
provide accurate predictions for cases that differ from the initial training simulation will be demonstrated 
the simulation model  shown in figure    is a portion of a very large geological model developed by
castro      this model was developed based on a fluvial channel system  the model is three dimensional
and contains a total of        grid blocks  with nx      ny      and nz     where nx   ny and nz designate
the number of grid blocks in the corresponding coordinate direction   five production wells and four water
injection wells drive the flow 
to extract the information needed to reproduce the behavior of the system  a full run  referred to
as the training simulation  was performed  as indicated earlier  the conditions applied for this training
simulation impact the quality of the reduced basis  so they should be selected with care  here we apply a
heuristic procedure in which we vary the bottom hole pressures  bhps  of the production wells randomly
and independently over their expected ranges  between       and       psia   these bhps are changed
every     days and the resulting schedule is shown in figure    the injector well bhps are held constant
at       psia  this bhp is maintained in all runs   a total of     snapshots for the oil pressure and water
saturation states were recorded

figure    eigenvalue variation for pressure and saturation matrices

applying the pod approach provides the eigenvalue spectrums for pressure and saturation shown in
figure    it is evident that the maximum eigenvalue for the pressure state is almost      while the minimum
is around       which means that the pressure eigenvalues vary over around    orders of magnitude  for
the water saturation state this variation is also substantial  about    orders of magnitude 
then a basis is formed such the fraction of energy in the pressure state ignored is very low  around       
and the fraction ignored in the saturation state is around       this requires that the first    eigenvalues
for the oil pressure state and the first    eigenvalues for the water saturation state are retained  therefore 
the transformation matrix l  rnc l   where l   lp   ls has              basis vectors  meaning that
while the standard reservoir simulation model needs to solve j   r for  nc            unknowns  the
reduced order reservoir simulation model needs to solve jr r   rr for only    unknowns 
implementing the clustering technique presented in section      the number of snapshots for each state
was reduced from     to     ignoring the same amounts of energy as before  the number of basis functions
required for the oil pressure state decreases from    to     while for the water saturation state it decreases
from    to     thus the reduced order reservoir simulation model now requires only    unknowns 
the ability of the rom to reproduce the training simulation will be tested using both roms  pod and
clusters   pod   next four different flow scenarios are used to evaluate the predictive capability of both
roms  the results for the training simulation and schedules i  ii  iii and iv are presented in appendix a 
an important point is the quantification of error using roms  errors arise from the rom simulations
for two main reasons  these are     a large number of basis vectors are discarded which  although less
important than the basis vectors retained  do carry some information  and     the rom is in general applied
to models that differ from the training simulation used to generate the reduced basis 
this error quantification could be accomplished in a variety of manners  here a very simple procedure
focus on error in oil rate  which is the most important output for this application  for each simulated time
step i  the oil production rate in the reference simulation  qio f ull   and in each rom simulation  qio rom  
is taken for each well w  the error is then computed as the average of the absolute differences  normalized

where nt is the total number of time steps  the average error computed using this equation for the training
simulation and the four schedules are presented in table   
it is evident that the training simulation case results in the smallest errors  which is not surprising because
the basis vectors were generated using snapshots from this case  in addition  the rom generated with only
pod has the smallest error for all examples  presumably because a greater number of basis functions are used
in these cases  while the other rom perform well  it can be observed that  although clustering snapshots
decreases the number of basis functions  it increases the error by a small amount  for all simulations the
errors are small  less than     when quantified in this way   we note that there is a tradeoff between
speedup and accuracy  as further speedup could be achieved by decreasing the dimension of   though this
will result in increased error

computational speedups for the roms using pod and clusters   pod are evaluated relative to fullorder gprs simulations using a specialized solver and preconditioner combination  gmres solver and cpr
preconditioner   as shows on table   the maximum speedup obtained was      for schedule i  however  the
comparison to a full order gprs simulation using a much simpler preconditioner  ilu     showed a speedup
of about      this highlights the fact that the rom procedures considered here are very well suited for
situations where the linear solver occupies the great majority of the computational time  otherwise  the
maximum speedup attainable is more limited

figure   compares the oil flow rate for all producer wells using both procedures  the reference flow rates
from the training simulation  blue circles  are very well reproduced using pod only  red line  and clustered
snapshots   pod  green line   these results are very encouraging and indicate that the snapshot set contains
sufficient information to reproduce the training simulation  as a consequence  the pod method selects the
most important directions and ignores the least important  also can be observed that the clustering approach
reduces the number of snapshots without losing significant information

schedule i

the schedule for the bottom hole pressures  bhps  of the production wells using schedule i is shown in
figure   a   the overall range is the same as was used in the training simulation  though the detailed
schedule is quite different  in this example the bhp is changed every     days  while in the training
simulation it was changed every     days  as in the training simulation  the injection wells are kept at a
constant pressure of       psia 
figure   shows the oil flow rate for all producer wells using both basis matrices  the flow rates from the
standard  reference  solution  blue circles  are  in general  well reproduced using both roms  relatively
small mismatches can be observed  however  in some of the results  e g   producer   between       and      
days   taken in total  these results are very encouraging as they demonstrate the ability of the rom to
provide flow results for scenarios that differ substantially from the training simulations  this is important if
the rom is to be used within the context of optimization

schedule ii

figure   b  shows the bottom hole pressures for the production wells for schedule ii  for this example the
overall bhp range  between       and       psia  and the frequency for changing the bhp  every     days 
are different than in the training simulation  figure   shows the oil flow rate for all producer wells using
both basis matrices  as was the case for schedule i  the reference flow rates are again closely matched by
the two roms  the bhp variation in this case is over a smaller range than in the training simulation 
so this example demonstrates the ability of the roms to predict the reservoir dynamics for interpolating
conditions

schedule iii

the producer bhps for schedule iii are shown in figure   c   in this case the overall bhp range is between
      psia and       psia  a slightly greater range than in the training simulation  and the frequency for
changing the bhp is every     days  figure   shows the oil flow rate for all production wells for both
simulation runs  consistent with the previous results  the flow rates are closely matched by the roms  we
can  however  observe some slight mismatches  e g   well p  at around     days   overall  this example
demonstrates the ability of the roms to extrapolate  at least to some degree  outside of the range of the
training simulation  this is a useful capability  as it suggests a degree of robustness with respect to the
settings used in the training simulation

schedule iv

the goal here is to demonstrate that the roms can also reproduce much simpler reservoir dynamics  thus
now the bhps are specified for all production wells to be constant        psia  over the entire simulation 
figure   d   flow results for the five production wells are shown in figure    the performance of both
roms is quite good  this again demonstrates the ability of the roms to simulate the dynamics of the
reservoir model for conditions very different than those used in the training simulation
