fiintroduction
structural health monitoring  shm  for civil engineering applications involves
the use of sensing networks in order to diagnose damage in large scale civil structures
such as buildings or bridges  health monitoring will result in large savings in
maintenance costs as well as improving life safety by providing a real time updating of a
structures integrity  recent events such as the bridge collapse in minneapolis as well as
aging infrastructure illustrate the need to improve structural monitoring 
recent research has shifted towards using statistical algorithms and time series
modeling to detect damage      statistical methods are advantageous  because they do
not require the user to create a structural  usually finite element  model for the whole
structure  this results in significant savings in power consumption as well as data
transmission  making them ideal for use in low power wireless networks  interest in
using wireless networks for shm has increased due to the lower cost and ease of
installation     
damage diagnosis is divided into three categories  damage identification 
measurement of damage extent  and damage localization  extensive work has been done
in the area of damage identification and localization  in particular  nair et al        
show that an algorithm based on autoregressive time series modeling of a structures
acceleration response to ambient vibrations is capable of detecting and measuring the
extent of damage on a structure  however  the damage localization problem remains
unsolved  localization is important  because it will allow responders to streamline
efforts in repair and maintenance 
this paper examines the use of pattern classification techniques in machine
learning to solve the damage localization problem  following  nair et al         
autoregressive coefficients from a structures acceleration response are selected as the
feature vector  data is collected by simulation using the asce phase i benchmark
structure      it is shown that using established pattern classification techniques  it is
possible to localize damage in a structure  further work is shown in examining the
optimal number of parameters and number of training examples for this problem 

time series modeling by autoregressive coefficients
nair et al         show that the autoregressive  ar  coefficients from a
structures accelerations under ambient vibrations are directly related to the structures
natural frequency and by extension its stiffness      the autoregressive time series model
can be represented as a linear difference equation with a transfer function  with the
locations of the poles given by the ar coefficients  thus it follows that ar coefficient
values will be a function of the structural stiffness  thus changes to a structures stiffness
matrix as a result of permanent damage will change the structures ar coefficients  for a
more complete derivation of the ar algorithm  see nair et al         
the ar algorithm is performed according to the following steps as was
previously done by sohn et al         and nair et al         
the acceleration time history is normalized and standardized according to the
following equation 
 x t    
 
x t  


 

   

fiwhere x t  is the acceleration time history at a point t in time   and  are the mean and
standard deviation of the time history  and x t  is the normalized and standardized time
history 
let xi t  be the normalized and standardized acceleration signal from the ith sensor 
in order to increase the number of features  xi t  is divided into n chunks  each chunk is
an independent feature  more specifically  nair et al         show that if the acceleration
time history can be shown to be stationary  then the acceleration signal of each chunk will
be independent and identically distributed  although this has been done  it will not be
shown here for brevity  the ar model is given by the following equation 
p

 
xij  t       ijk  
xij  t  k      ij  t  

   

k   

where xi j t  is the normalized acceleration signal of the jth chunk of the ith sensor  ijk is
the kth ar coefficient from the jth chunk of the ith sensor  p is the ar model order  and
ij t  is the residual term  the burg algorithm  brockwell and davis        is used to
estimate the ar coefficients  in this study a model order of   and a chunk size of     
are used  the optimal ar order p and optimal chunk size n can be determined according
to methods proposed by nair et al          again for brevity  they will not be discussed 

asce phase i benchmark structure
the asce phase i benchmark structure is a standardized simulation problem for
the development of structural health monitoring algorithms for civil structures  the
benchmark structure is a matlab based simulation of a structures response to ambient
vibrations  damage can be specified according to   predetermined damage patterns or
user defined on any combination of beams  columns  and braces  output is given in the
form of    acceleration time histories  representing acceleration from   different sensors
in the x and y directions  extensive data can be gathered by specifying the random seed
for force generation  the model is based off of an existing structure which was
constructed and tested at the university of british columbia  the structure is a two bay 
four story  rectangular steel braced frame  it is modeled as a     degree of freedom
system with various loading options  the phase i benchmark is chosen instead of a more
recent benchmark  because the ability to assign user defined damage patterns is critical in
order to build a suitable training and test data set required for the implementation of
pattern classification algorithms 

pattern classification
once the ar algorithm is performed on the acceleration time histories  the ar
coefficients are assembled into a feature vector  previous work done by nair et al        
and confirmed by this study show that the first ar coefficient is sufficient to pick up
changes in structural stiffness resulting from damage  for this reason the feature vector
x is chosen to be a vector of the first ar coefficient from all the sensors available

fiwhere n is the number of sensors  and j is the index of the current chunk  for the
benchmark structure n       representing   accelerometers each recording acceleration in
the x and y directions  the training set size m is equal to the number of chunks per run n
multiplied by the number of runs  a run is defined as one single output gathered from
simulation by subjecting the structure to one ground motion and subjecting it to one
damage case 
damage location is discretized according to the floor on which the damage has
occurred  this results in   possible classifications for damage location  undamaged   st
floor   nd floor   rd floor  or  th floor  thus this becomes a multi category classification
problem  one way to solve this problem is to use binary classification methods and
implement them in a one versus all   va  or one versus one   v   approach  duan et
al        
in this study two binary classification methods are used  regularized logistic
regression using newtons method to solve the gradient ascent problem and support
vector machines  svm  using sequential minimal optimization  smo  with a linear
kernel  the smo algorithm is used as derived by platt        
gradient ascent attempts to maximize the following log likelihood function 

 map   arg max   y  i   log h  x  i            y  i    log    h  x  i        
m



 

   

i   

where map is the estimate of the model parameters  y i  is the ith class label  either   or   
x i  is the ith feature vector  and h x  is the signoid function given by 

h  x

    e   x  

   

      is the bayesian regularization term   is assumed to be  n     i  

 

 
   

   

 is chosen using cross validation  the log likelihood function is maximized using the
newton raphson method 

  t         t    h   l

   
the parameters  are updated according to the previous equation until
convergence has occurred or until some specified maximum number of iterations has
taken place  l is the log likelihood function  h is the hessian matrix of l with respect to 
and  l is the gradient of the log likelihood function 
svm attempts to solve the dual problem  the problem simplifies to a
maximization problem given by the following expression 
m

such that 

  m m  i     j

this maximization problem is solved using smo as derived by platt         a
description of that algorithm is beyond the scope of this paper  for further details see
platt        
both the  va and  v  approach for multi classification are used with a winnertakes all  wta  and a max wins voting  mwv  strategy  duan et al         in
addition  each algorithm was performed with the dimension of the feature vector reduced
using principal components analysis  pca   the feature dimension n      for the
benchmark structure is manageable    sensors measuring acceleration in the x and y
directions  however  for a larger structure such as a suspension bridge or skyscraper  n
may grow into the thousands  especially if the z direction of acceleration is also
considered  pca provides a way to make computations manageable  for this study  the
dimension of the feature vector was reduced to the first two principal components 
the following damage patterns were introduced to the benchmark structure 
table    damage patterns and class labels

   runs are generated for each damage state  each with different random seeds  each run
is divided into    chunks according to the algorithm described above  therefore the size
of the total data set m is      two damage states are considered  damage to beams and
damage to braces  in order to determine the feasibility of localizing multiple types of
damage even though the damage is labeled only according to location  it was found in
the analysis that the damage localization algorithm trained on brace damage data alone
was incapable of localizing beam damage  the data are labeled strictly according to
which floor the damage took place on 
all algorithms were trained on     of the data  with the other     reserved for
testing  the size of the training set is      the size of the test set is      through cross
validation  it was found that an optimal value of  for gradient ascent is      and an
optimal value of c for svm is     the results of each algorithm are compared in table   
figure   shows the distribution of features when plotted according to their first two
principal components  a test cased was determined to be correctly assessed if the
algorithm predicted the floor on which the damage occurred  or no damage   an
incorrect assessment was recorded as an error

the pattern classification algorithms used are able to predict with high levels of
accuracy the location of damage in the benchmark structure  as expected  pca increases
the amount of test error  because information is lost  nevertheless  even with the
dimensionality of the feature vector reduced to    the  v  smo algorithm is able to
predict with     accuracy the location of damage in the structure 

conclusion
a pattern classification approach using supervised learning shows excellent
results when tested on simulated data  svm based multi classifier algorithms are able to
achieve almost      success rate in identifying the location of damage  the advantage
of this approach is that once a training data set has been built  testing is relatively simple
and low in computational complexity 
the problem with implementing this approach in practice to monitor existing
structures is the lack of and difficulty in acquiring a large enough training set  because
acquiring a training set experimentally would be prohibitively expensive  future research
work should examine whether a training set created using simulated data can be used to
predict the location of actual damage on an experimentally tested structure  in addition to
this  future research may consider less sever damage states  other types of damage  other
ways of discretizing damage location  and whether training data for one type of structure
can be applied successfully to similar structures  however  despite the difficulties with
applying this approach in practice  supervised learning approaches offer a great deal of
potential in solving the damage localization problem
