abstract

ages being the primary  and often singular  form
of input data      in cases where images are not
available as sample input  it not possible for such
systems to perform face recognition  our system 
fida  uses general facial descriptions as input to
retrieve images from a database  users may utilize
fida to identify images by just entering general descriptions  removing the constraint of input images
for face recognition and identification purposes 

generic face recognition systems identify a subject by comparing the subjects image to images
in an existing face database      these systems are
very useful in forensics for criminal identification   
and in security for biometric authentication     but
are constrained by the availability and quality of
subject images     in this paper  we propose a
novel system  fida  that uses descriptive nonvisual human input of facial features to perform
face recognition without the need for a reference image for comparison  fida maps images in an existing database to a fourteen dimensional descriptive
feature space using softmax regression  and compares input feature descriptions to images in feature
space  fida clusters database images in feature
space using feature weighted k means clustering   
to offer computational speedup while searching feature space for matching images 

fida formalizes subjective human descriptions
into discrete feature values and associates seven descriptive and seven geometric features to face images  a softmax classifier maps geometric facial
features from images in our database to a descriptive variables  the seven discretized geometric features combine with the seven descriptive features
to form a composite fourteen dimensional feature
set for fida  similar images are clustered in feature space using weighted k means clustering    
user input  in the form of facial descriptions  directly maps to the fourteen dimensional descriptive
feature space  thereafter  the input description is

fichose a large holistic facial feature set to model aspects of facial geometry as well as descriptive facial
information  evaluating the consistency of human
input for different facial features allowed us to qualitatively compare different features  later  while
clustering this information was used to apply large
weights to features humans were consistent at 
tong et al      use semantic relationships for recognizing facial action units au   they tag a list
of aus with their interpretations and use them as
training data for a learning mechanism based on
gabor feature representation and adaboost classification  once trained  they use the classifier to assign semantic relationships to their corpus of data 
we use a similar approach and label a set of training images with semantic feature descriptions  we
then use the labeled images to train a multinomial
softmax classifier to translate numeric geometric
ratios of facial features to descriptors  our system
then uses descriptive semantic inputs to retrieve
images 
we also explored research on the real world application of criminal identification  most of the controversy in the area of face recognition has focused
upon the suggestiveness of the observation of a single subject by an observer  some researchers have
found that single subject identification procedures
result in more false identifications than lineups    
this suggested to us that it is more practical for us
to show a lineup of prospective images in order to
achieve better identification rates  fida displays

we normalize facial geometric features using reference facial geometry obtained from the images in
our database  this is required for accurate identification and recognition because the size of features

descriptive input semantics

our approach draws inspiration from the fact that
humans describe faces using abstract and often subjective feature measures such as the shape of a face 
the color of the skin  hair color etc      these semantic descriptions  supplied by humans are immune to picture quality and other effects that reduce the efficiency of contemporary face recognition
and identification algorithms  we drew upon work
that has been done to try to identify possible facial features that may lead to better recognition   
while coming to our present feature set 
we used the ar database     for our data set

we then classify the discretized features of

the seven descretized geometric features with the
seven descriptive features we obtain a fourteendimensional descriptive feature vector  f  for each

the overall performance of face recognition and
identification systems used in real world applications is assessed in terms of their accuracy  speed 
and storage costs     speed is important for face
recognition systems and is critical for face identification systems  given the possibility of very large
image sets in areas of application  such as criminal
databases  we cluster the database images in feature space  a form of weighted k means clustering

preparing training data

the training images are labeled with tags such as a
long nose  small face  normal ears for classification 
we then extract the numeric values of the geometric ratios that define our geometric facial features

recognizing descriptive user input

we allow the user to input discretized descriptors
for different features which translate to a vector
 u   of discrete variables in the fourteen dimensional descriptive feature space  the euclidean distance of u with the different cluster centroids of the
database is measured and the closest three clusters
are chosen for comparison  the clusters are iteratively searched by rank for the best three image
matches with u  we assign an decreasing reward
to the algorithm as it moves from the top three
matches in each cluster  and across the three clusters  the reward starts at   and each move from a
reported image to the next closest reported image
incurs a cost of      ie  an image match for u
in the second cluster at the third slot implies three
jumps in the first cluster and two in the second
leading to a reward of      if the image match for
to u does not lie in the three closest clusters or is
not amongst the best three matches in one of the
three  we report failure 
finally  we calculate our error and return the
three best matches for the given description u 

the error was obtained by comparing user input across all test images to the results given by
the algorithm  a match at the first position was
given a reward of    at second  of       and at third
of       we term the appearance of a match at a
rank lower than three to be failure  training error showed a consistent increase with a decrease in
training samples  testing error showed irregular
movement  possibly due to the error prone nature
of user input 
we compared the performance of our weights using the k means reward metric described earlier 
the results are mentioned in table    these results
  results
consistently show less error with our weighted kthe absolute testing and training errors for fida means algorithm and justified the feature weights
we chose for fida 
are mentioned in table   
 

fiwe also compared the performance of fida
when users were unable to provide one feature  the
results are mentioned in table    these results are
a qualitative judge of feature quality and were used
to weight the k means algorithm  notable is the
fact that the geometric features do not affect the
error as much as descriptive features do  this is
because of the consistent mis classification of these
features by softmax due to highly inconsistent input data labels  this correlates with the finding
of jain et al     that humans do not prefer spatialgeometric descriptors
