project description
this project is part of an autonomous flight project in the ai lab sponsored by professor
ng  the current project has two main components  the first is to build fixed wing aircraft that
are able to fly autonomously in large formations  the second involves autonomous flight control
of a full sized helicopter  my work this quarter  under the supervision of pieter abbeel  focused
on augmenting the code associated with localization and state estimation  integrating and testing
the sensor systems with an existing kalman filter 

fisensor integration and testing
for the first several weeks  i worked on integrating sensor input and testing the kalman
filter throughput  both the full size helicopter and fixed wing aircraft will use the kalman filter
for localization and state estimation  plans for the helicopter include several sensors for
localization purposes  among them are a gps sensor and an imu sensor  i took code that
parses the raw input from a gps device on a serial port and integrated it with the kalman filter 
the code for parsing the imu sensor data was already written  i then tested that the kalman
filter was working correctly with the physical device  i was able to confirm that the kalman
filter works correctly with both the physical gps and imu sensing devices at a speed of
approximately     state updates per second  this should be sufficiently fast to run the filter in
real time while performing online localization 

learning filter parameters with em
with the sensor code in place and able to collect data  it was possible to move on to
optimizing the parameters for the kalman filter  the parameters were learned using the em
algorithm which  in the kalman filter  can be expressed as running successive forward backward
passes that filter then smooth the sensor data  this produces a maximum likelihood estimation
of the optimal filter parameters  in order to run em  all the intermediate data about the state
distributions from the forward filtering pass must be saved for use in the backward smoothing
pass  for even small data sets  this data became too large to fit into memory  intermediate data
from a   minute flight is nearly   gb   to solve this problem  i designed and implemented an
efficient disk based data structure to store the intermediate data 

fifuture work  beyond em   maximum likelihood estimation
the state predictions from the filtered and smoothed data incorporate all recorded
measurements  since only the filtered data can be used for state estimation  ideally  the filtered
data would match the state predictions that have been filtered and smoothed  currently  the em
formulation attempts to do this by maximizing likelihood  but perhaps an additional procedure
could make improvements  the proposed future work involves minimizing the kl divergence
between the filtered and smoothed state prediction distributions by a numerical gradient search 
starting with the filter parameters obtained by running em  it is unknown if this will improve
performance
