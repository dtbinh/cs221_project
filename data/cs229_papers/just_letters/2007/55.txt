introduction
prediction of protein structure from amino acid  aa  sequence is one of the grand challenges of modern
biochemistry  while ab initio structure prediction is difficult  prediction of local structure is more
tractable if experimentally determined structures of homologous proteins exist  the prediction of local
patches is useful in predicting interaction partners of proteins and nucleic acids 
the high dimensionality of this problem has so far prevented machine learning methods from making
significant inroads  the space of aa sequences grows exponentially    n  and the flexibility of proteins
affords them an infinite conformational space  in this project we will focus on the problem of reducing
the dimensionality of protein structures  we will tackle this problem in the context of predicting local
patches of the dna binding region of helix to helix  hth  proteins  we have chosen this protein family
due to its biological significance and the relative availability of crystallized hth dna complexes 

algorithm
our focus is on reducing the problems dimensionality by encoding hth surfaces using an efficient basis
set  then performing pca on the entire family of hth structures to characterize differences amongst
individual family members  once a significant reduction is achieved  we expect     dimensions   it will
be possible to apply machine learning methods to predict local structure from the aa sequence 
   binding patch extraction
the first step is defining and extracting the region of the
hth responsible for dna binding  all hth proteins employ
an  helical structure to bind dna  picking the helix closest
to the dna molecule is one way of identifying the correct helix  unfortunately  the region within the helix responsible
for dna binding varies between proteins and so does the
angle at which binding occurs  figure     since we want to
figure    helices interact with the hth binding
represent the protein surface from the dnas perspective 
pocket at different angles   helices are in red 
we will spatially register all hth dna complexes to bring
their dna molecules into superimposition  after alignment  the centroid of the dna base closest to the
binding helix will be used as the center of a rectangular region which will define the dna binding surface
patch of the protein 
    dna binding  helix identification
to identify the dna binding helix  the euclidean distance between every atom in the dna molecule and
every atom in all helices is calculated  the helix with at least n residues that have at least   atom within
 of any atom of the dna molecule is selected as a dna binding helix  letting hm be   if the mth helix
binds dna and   if it does not  we have 

hm           pm i j  pk        n
helix
residues
i

residue dna
atoms atoms
 j
k 

fiwhere pijm is the position of atom j in residue i in helix m  and pk is the position of atom a in the dna 
currently n is set to   and  to       this successfully identifies the dna binding  helix  figure    
     d registration
the next step is registration of the hth dna complexes  which
is equivalent to the pairwise registration of  d point clouds 
given the complexity of our surface  optimal methods like
geometric hashing     are too slow  instead we implemented
an algorithm based on local shape descriptors  it works by
computing a handful of distinct local features on the surface 
and then uses those features to perform the alignment instead
of using every point  many such algorithms exist  and we
implemented gelfands et al  method     for our purposes 
gelfands et al  method employs an integral shape descriptor
figure    correctly identified dna binding
due to its noise tolerance  in lieu of differential descriptors such helix is in red  other helices in green 
as curvature which are sensitive to noise  for each point in the
model  a sphere of radius r is formed around the point  and the volume of the surface inside the sphere
is calculated  figure     volume calculations are performed by discretizing the space around the sphere 
and using a ray shooting algorithm     to determine whether each discretized point in space is inside or
outside the surface  volumes of the inside points are summed to approximate the total volume 
since we only want features that define unique points on the surface  we select the most distinct and
rare features  this is done by binning features based on volume  and then picking out features from the
least populated  most unique  bins  features within radius re of each other are removed 
to improve robustness  we also filter features to insure that they are
persistent across multiple scales  and thus unlikely to have arisen by
noise  we do so by computing the descriptors at multiple radii  and
then picking features deemed rare at multiple consecutive scales 
descriptors are calculated as described for the model and data
surfaces  for each feature in the data surface  we search in the model
to find features whose volume is within  of the data surface feature 
figure    shaded region represents
this results in a set of putative matches for each point in the data
surface  we qt cluster this set      and then pick the feature from each volume of integral descriptor  figure
adapted from     
cluster that is least different between the model and data surfaces 
for each feature in the data surface we now have a set of putative matches in the model  to perform
the registration  we use a branch and bound algorithm to find an optimal correspondence  assume that
k   points have already been matched  for each possible kth point  we calculate the global drms of the
resulting correspondence  points that result in a drms above rc are pruned from the search  the first
point to result in a drms below rc is used to form a new correspondence out of k points  this process is
iterated  if all features within a branch are found to increase the drms above rc  we backtrack and
consider earlier points that were not previously considered  once we have run through all features  we
test the putative correspondence by transforming the full model and calculating the resulting crms over
all points  note that we can also perform partial registration by excluding some points from the
correspondence 

fiafter global registration  a post processing step is necessary to bring the two structures into final
alignment  we implemented the iterative closest points  icp  algorithm to perform this local alignment 
the combination of those two methods has proven effective for aligning molecular surfaces  figure    
   surface representation using wavelets
after the structures have been registered  a fixed portion of the
protein surface involved in dna binding is projected onto a
rectangular  d plane  wavelet transforms will then be applied
on this  d representation  the need for a transformation step
before pca is necessitated by the fact that a sufficiently detailed
 d projection of the protein surface is very high dimensional
   k points per protein   rendering direct application of pca
computationally expensive    k x     matrix  
our choice of wavelets was motivated by their decomposition of
signals in both frequency and space domains  given our longfigure    registration of two molecular
term objective of using this representation for protein structure
surfaces   a  pre registration  and  b  postprediction  we sought to exploit the localized nature of protein
registration 
structure  amino acid variations along the protein chain typically
have only localized effects on the protein surface  rendering the effect of aa identity on the wavelet
coefficients more direct if the contribution of each wavelet coefficient is itself localized in space 
    surface projection
for each structure  we defined a fixed rectangular region in space upon which the surface of the dnabinding  helix is projected  the location and orientation of this region were determined as follows 
first  the centroid of the dna base closest to the  helix was computed as the mean position of all its
backbone carbon atoms  the origin was defined to be the centroid  with
y
the y axis running parallel to the long axis of the dna helix  and the x
axis perpendicular to it such that the resulting plane is equidistant from
the dna and the protein  the rectangle was centered at the origin with
dimensions    x    enough to contain the  helix  figure    
this rectangular region was discretized into a    x    grid  and the
distance along the normal axis from each point in the grid to the protein
surface was calculated  the resulting  d array of real numbers is in effect
the native representation of a protein surface patch in our algorithm

    wavelet transform
wavelet transforms were applied on the projected surface patch of every figure    projection of dnahth protein to transform it into spatially localized frequencies at multiple binding helix onto  d plane 
resolutions  the  d least asymmetric daubechies filter of order   was used for the transformation  no
analytic form exists for these transformations  and so they were numerically computed using
mathematica 
daubechies filters are the only locally supported  continuous  and orthogonal wavelet bases  which
makes them ideal for most wavelet analyses  different orders were tried and the  th order appeared to
give best results  figure

   pca of protein surfaces in wavelet space
since our hth proteins of interest come from the same protein family  we expect there to be little
variation at the dna binding surface patch  more specifically  we expect the variations to be localized in
space  and to depend on the underlying amino acid sequence 
    

after the surface patches have been wavelet transformed  we
applied pca to find the major axes of variation within the hth
protein family  we expect these variations to depend in a
localized fashion on the identity of the amino acids that give
rise to the structure in the first place  thus  by transforming
the protein surface patches into their principal vectors  we
reduced their representation into the primary components
that are affected by the identity of the primary sequence

data
a database of hth dna complexes has been manually built and curated  the complexes were obtained
from the protein databank  pdb  and filtered to include only structures that contain a dna molecule
bound to one of the following motifs  dna rna binding   helical bundle   repressor like dna binding
domain  and hmg box  this resulted in an initial database of     complexes  subsequent filtering for
complexes that are only bound to double stranded dna  as well as those that meet homology criteria 
reduced the final set to    complexes  we tested our compression algorithm on those complexes

retained after the pca step decreases the error
                                             
rate  with a high of     error when retaining only

different numbers of wavelet coefficients retained  figure  a   such a consistent trend was not found
however when we averaged across the number of pca coefficients retained  and varied the number of

fiwavelet coefficients retained  figure  b   increasing the number of coefficients retained during the
wavelet transformation may have resulted in instability in the behavior of pca due to increased variance
in the data 
given the experimental inaccuracies inherent in protein structure determination  a resolution of   is
sufficient for our purposes  our final compression consisted of keeping     wavelet coefficients
followed by a pca step where only the top    principal vectors were retained  this represents
approximately      fold compression  with an error level of around      at this error rate features
greater than   were generally indistinguishable from the uncompressed case  figure

future work
we believe that achieving a    dimensional representation for local surface
patches represents a significant reduction in the complexity of protein structure 
most importantly  such a small number of parameters render the problem highly
amenable to machine learning methods  where the relationship between amino
acid sequence and protein structure may be automatically inferred  we will
explore this possibility in the future  as well as the reduction of dna surface
patches and the prediction of dna binding partners of hth proteins
