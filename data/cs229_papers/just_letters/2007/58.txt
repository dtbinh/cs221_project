abstract
the first step to implementing an autopilot system on an unmanned aerial vehicle
 uav  involves first to characterize the uavs dynamics using a mathematical model 
to accomplish this accurately for the particular uav  the process of system
identification  which is the estimation of the parameters of the equation of motion  is
essential  however  experimental data is generally noisy and thus presents a challenging
problem  in this research project  we are presented with several sets of flight test data of
the uav  a quarter scale model of a cessna      and we wish to provide an accurate
estimation of the system model parameters  specifically  we apply and compare several
different machine learning algorithms to the flight data including general least squares 
coordinate descent  recursive estimation with gaussian noise  and learn laggedlinear  it is customary to evaluate a dynamic model by comparing its simulated state
trajectories with experimental state trajectories  as a result  the dynamic models
computed here are evaluated based on how well the simulated model trajectories compare
with the flight data  finally  an algorithm is suggested as a basis for in flight updating of
the system dynamics model in pseudo real time 
  vehicle dynamical model
in order to perform system identification  it is necessary to start first with an intended
model of the system  flight dynamics of fixed wing aircrafts are reasonably well
understood and there exist many literatures on the topic such as     and      as suggested
by      the dynamics in general are characterized by a set of non linear differential
equations in   states  however  under special circumstances and with specific
assumptions  such as in the case of straight and steady flight  these equations of motion
can be decoupled into lateral and longitudinal dynamics involving   states each  as
given by      the lateral direction equations of motion  linearized  decoupled under the
assumption of small angle perturbation and zero cross product term ixz    can be written
in linear state space form as

respectively  for compactness  each of     and     can be rewritten in the form
  general least squares
in this approach  we attempt to find the best estimate of the unknown parameters in a and
b by applying least squares regression to the following objective function
to do this  the data is rearranged into the conventional form

where the state data and unknown parameters are reordered as  and   respectively  in
this form  the pseudo inverse is used to find  
while the model results are fair  it leads to the notion that the proper objective function is
not being considered since the model is evaluated based on its simulated trajectory 
  coordinate descent
since we are evaluating the performance of the dynamical model based on its simulated
trajectory relative to the actual trajectory  a reasonable objective function would be to
minimize the mean squared error between the simulated states and actual states at each
time step  numerically minimizing the cost function for each parameter one at a time and
iterating through the parameters in random permutations  we hope to be able to converge
to a reasonable objective function minimum 
however  initial trials suggest that this is a very computationally expensive algorithm that
does not scale well with number of parameters and trajectory lengths  and therefore is
prohibitively expensive for in flight computation 
  recursive estimation with gaussian noise
a recursive algorithm for the optimal estimation of a stationary state vector assuming
zero mean gaussian noise is presented in      the two recursion equations are

fiwhere k and qk are the optimal state and covariance estimates given k measurements y 
to yk  using a similar rearrangement as in      the unknown parameters are posed as the
estimated state k and the data at time k is reordered as ak  recursive methods are ideal
for in flight computations since it does not require the reconsideration of past data  all
past data information is embodied in the most recent state and covariance estimates 
however since the prior covariances of the data and parameters are unknown  we need to
devise a method to estimate these  the initial estimate on the parameters was chosen to
be all zero with relatively large decoupled covariances to allow for the presented data to
bear more weight than the priors  also  since the covariance of each individual data point
is unknown  the measurement covariance of each state was assumed constant with crossterms assumed to be zero  with these assumptions  the simulation results perform
reasonably well  however  it leads us to the notion that we are not optimally estimating
the proper covariances 
  learn lagged linear
a method to do well on this simulation criterion without the estimation of covariances is
to learn the model parameters by optimizing the following lagged criterion as
suggested by     

however  this is in general a non linear and difficult problem that leads to prohibitively
expensive algorithms such as the em algorithm suggested in      motivated by this  an
algorithm to approximately minimize the lagged criterion is given by     called learnlagged linear  for convenience  it is excerpted here 

a horizon time h of   seconds     data points  was chosen  a comparison of the results
is presented in figure   
  an online learning algorithm using lll
applying online learning concepts to the lll algorithm leads to an algorithm suitable to
serve as a basis for in flight updating of the system dynamics model in pseudo real time 

fithe algorithm alternates between an evaluation step and a least squares step that solves
for the new parameters 
online learning using lll 
   start with the model found by running the lll algorithm on available training data
 mentioned in section    
   simulate the current model on the given new test data 
   compare the simulated state trajectories with the actual measured state data at each
specific time step and calculate the state error 
   at each time step  if the calculated errors in the previous consecutive n time steps are all
above a preset tolerance threshold  reiterate a new model using the lll algorithm using
the following input parameters 
a  if the current time step is less than a lower bound l  then the algorithm uses all of
the training data and the simulated data from all previous time steps for reiteration 
b  if the current time step is larger than the lower bound l  but less than an upper
bound u  then the algorithm uses all available simulated data and part of the
training data for re iteration  the size of the training data used in the re iteration
can be adjusted based on  for example  size of the available simulated data 
c  if the current time step is larger than the upper bound u  then the algorithm uses
all available simulated data for re iteration 
   continue the simulation and repeat steps   through   as necessary 

this algorithm will continually adapt to the new test data and prevent the model and new
measurement data from having diverging state trajectories  the final results of the
algorithm are compared here in figure

fi  summary and future work
in this literature  we have discussed several different methods for accomplishing system
identification of a uav  generalized least squares  coordinate descent  recursive
estimation  and learn lagged linear  considering speed and performance  the learnlagged linear algorithm presents itself as the best candidate for finding the model that
performs well in the simulation criterion  a summary of the results are shown here in

although the online learning algorithm presented in section   performs reasonably well
on the given dataset  testing on more extensive data is recommended to develop robust
criteria that will perform well under a wide range of aircraft states  the algorithm is also
fairly computationally expensive which renders it unsuitable for fully real time updates 
future projects may involve the development of faster algorithms as well as an online
learning algorithm that is robust enough to reliably detect the transitioning from
accelerating flight  to straight and steady flight  to a coordinated banked turn
