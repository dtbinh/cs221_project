introduction

robotic grasping is a fundamental aspect of robotic manipulation  as the robot must first
know how to acquire objects in any given and possibly unknown environment before it can
work around in that place  grasping is an essential skill for manipulators  and almost all
more advanced manipulation tasks rely on this basic skill  once reliable grasping is in place 
endless opportunities will become available  the general problem of grasping is  given a
model of the environment  either known a priori  or in the context here  constructed from
a camera point cloud   to find a grasping point on an object  possibly a given target  in the
environment and to execute a successful grasp of the object at that point 
in the context of the stanford ai robot  stair   where the external environment is
unknown  solving the described problem of grasping requires integrating techniques from
perception  acquiring environment model from camera   grasp point identification  finding
a grasp point on any object   and arm motion planning  to execute a collision free path to
the object   these three aspects have all been solved previously by the stair team        
however  a simple pipeline consisting of just these three components  which is similar to the
current system  is insufficient  even if each part works robustly and successfully produces a
feasible motion of the arm to the found grasp point  a good grasp cannot be guaranteed 
here we define a grasp  which is a particular robot hand configuration  as good when upon
closing the hand synchronously from its configuration  the target object  e g   bowl  can
be lifted up from its support surface  e g   table  without it slipping out of the hand  the
reason the simple pipeline is incapable of producing good grasps most of the time is that
identifying feasible grasp points is different from identifying feasible good grasps  the goal
of this project is to close this problematic gap 
the problem for this project is therefore  given the model of the environment and the
planned hand configuration for grasping  to classify whether this hand configuration will
result in a good grasp or not  more generally  given a set of such configurations  the objective
is to determine the best hand configuration for the robotic arm to execute  to achieve
this  a model of grasping was learned based on features that both intuitively and effectively
distinguish good grasps from bad ones  this approach and its implementation on the stair
platform will be discussed next

approach

the  d point cloud of the environment is given by a swissranger laser scanner  which returns
a grid of         points  as most of these points belong to large objects such as walls or
tables and hence are irrelevant to the target object  it would be inefficient to consider such
points that provide little information  therefore  only a local region of the point cloud near
the arms hand will be used  for the barrett arm on stair    the target platform for
this project  the hand tip shall be defined as   cm in the out direction from the hands
palm  which is approximately the length when the three fingers of the hand are at full extent
outwards  the local region will then be defined to contain any point within   cm of the hand
tip  this means that the local region is roughly two hands length in each direction  which
captures information about the area within the hands grasp and its immediate surroundings 
an important advantage of using the local region is that only around      d points will
need to be processed when computing features  instead of the over        points returned
from the camera  this shortens processing time to within several seconds  an additional
advantage is that for most large objects such as plates and bowls  the edge at which the grasp
points are found usually has a locally planar surface  planar grasps are generally easier  so
only considering the local region reduces the more complex problem of grasping arbitrarily
shaped large objects to the simpler problem of grasping a planar surface on the object  due
to this advantage  and because the camera calibration is not yet precise enough to model
small objects accurately  only large objects will be considered for this project 
features of the grasp that can distinguish between good and bad grasps will be computed
from the grasps hand configuration and its local region of  d points  a classifier will then
be trained based on these features  in the actual grasping pipeline  where a set of candidate
grasps will be given  the features of each grasps local region will be computed  and the
classifier will then predict which grasps are good and score each of the grasps  the candidate
grasp with the highest score will then be executed by stair  algorithm   summarizes the
pipeline for stair grasping  the work of this project is mainly in the second for loop 
algorithm   grasping an object with stair
   acquire  d point cloud of environment using camera  swissranger 
   get candidate grasp points using grasp point identification algorithm    
   for each grasp point in candidate grasp points set do
  
use arm inverse kinematics to generate configuration s  with hand at grasp point
  
use prm path planner to generate path s  to configuration s   if possible     
  
add valid path s  to candidate grasps set
   end for
   for each path in candidate grasps set do
  
extract local point cloud of the hands end configuration
   
compute features using local point cloud and hand configuration  see section   
   
use features to classify and predict if grasp will be good bad
   
score grasp   scoref orcandidategrasp  from classifier 
    end for
    execute grasp   arg max score grasp

features

a total of    features  under   main categories  were most effective on the training data  a
standard classifier was then trained using these features  a logistic regression classifier was
the most accurate  and the value of the sigmoid function is used as the score 

   

local point cloud distribution

the placement of the object in the grasp is crucial to grasping success  if the object is
nonexistent or is unevenly distributed in the grasp  the grasp may be unstable  the first
is measured simply by counting the number of points in the local region point cloud  intuitively  more points means a bigger object to grasp  which generally decreases the difficulty
of grasping it  less likely to miss   just counting this region however is insufficient  as an
object may be near the hand but is not in the grasp  since the region is larger than the
hands grasp   hence the points in the actual grasp region  i e   on the inside region of the
fingers  are also counted  the last region that was counted is a special edge region  defined
as all points in the region not extending further than the out most fingertip  this region
usually defines the edge of the object  hence the given name  see figure   a  for example  
even if there are many points near within the hand  its distribution is also important 
for example  it is preferable to grasp a stick at the middle rather than the tip  as slippage
is easier in the latter case  when considering the local or edge regions as defined above 
this corresponds to the points above and below the hand  see figure   b  for example  
for planar objects  an even distribution      ratio  on both sides is desirable  i e   it is not
grasping a tip corner  counting can be done on points that are above below the center  or
on points that are strictly above below the hand  the latter is more harsh  but can be more
pivotal  hence these two features are computed for each of the local and edge regions

local plane approximation

the orientation of the of a grasp is just as important as its positioning  if the hand is placed
at an incorrect angle  the grasp will be unstable and may miss the object or easily induce
slippage when picking it up  it is desirable to grasp at narrow sides of an object  as the most
force can be applied at these locations to achieve a tight closure on the object  moreover 
grasping on wide sides is extremely undesirable  as these sides may be wider than the hand 
to formalize this  let the hand direction be defined as the direction between the two sides
of the hand  in a pincer grasp   then it is desirable that in this direction  the object is
narrow  in other words  it is desirable that the  approximately locally planar  point cloud
region has a plane normal that is parallel to the hand direction  since the plane normal is
the direction in which the plane is least significant  in general  the more significant the
direction of the plane  the less it is desirable that the hand direction be parallel to this
direction  this can be approximated by taking the singular value decomposition of the  d
point cloud represented as a n   matrix  where n is the number of points  this gives three
singular values with their corresponding orthonormal component directions  the larger the
singular value  the more significant the component is in the point cloud 
an example of these three components can be found in figure   below  as demonstrated
by the black hand  a grasp at the edge of the plate in the first  rather significant  two
components will cause collision into the plate and thus failure  the only hand direction that
is likely to give a good grasp is parallel to the  smallest  third component  the plane normal

the metric used for measuring directional similarity was the absolute value of the dot
product between the hand direction and each component direction  the absolute value was
used as whether the directions are parallel or anti parallel does not matter  a separate metric
that accounted for the singular value of the component was also used  ideally  the directions
should be orthogonal for large singular values  and parallel anti parallel for small singular
values  hence  the difference of the actual absolute dot product value from the ideal value
 given the components singular value  was taken  these two metrics are computed for the
three component directions  using both the local and edge regions  giving    features total

results

the training set comprised of     hand configurations and their respective local region point
clouds acquired from the laser scanner camera  half of these were hand labeled as good 
and the other half bad  these configurations corresponded to potential grasps on   different
objects    from each of   different object classes  plates  bowls  cylindrical cups  wooden
blocks   the features described were computed for these data samples  and    fold crossvalidation was used to evaluate the model learned using logistic regression  the average test
set accuracy was      and the average training set accuracy was      this is on par with
the grasp point identification component of the grasping pipeline 
the errors consisted of     negative errors  false positives  and     positive errors  false
negatives   giving an average error of      on a more positive note  the negative errors
were mostly marginally positive  i e   their scores were just above the margin  indicating low
confidence levels  as most good grasps have high scores  as long as there exists a good grasp
in the candidate set  then marginal negative errors will not be chosen by the pipeline 
the entire grasping pipeline with these features and the learned classifier was tested on
stair    with a     accuracy on    attempts  this is an improvement from a roughly    
accuracy on grasping if the grasp was randomly chosen from the candidate set of grasps 

 

conclusion and future work

using features from the hands local point cloud of candidate grasps  the trained classifier
performed reliably in predicting and selecting a good grasp in both the training set and the
actual grasping pipeline  this result  however  is currently limited to several classes of large
objects  more tests on other object classes are necessary in the future 
one limiting problem is that the grasping pipeline is reliant on inverse kinematics to
provide candidate grasp configurations  which does not use information related to the quality
to the grasp  and often limits the quality of candidates  instead  an efficient search can be
performed around identified potential grasp points  and using an objective related to the
designed features  choose a grasp configuration that performs best on the objective
