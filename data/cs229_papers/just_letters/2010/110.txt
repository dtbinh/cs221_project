information flows on twitter

 cooperate with huang wei chang  te yuan huang as their cs   w project  constructing epidemic model 

  introduction
twitter has become a very popular microblog website and had attracted millions of users
up to       it is generally considered as a social networking website but gradually also
used as a media for people or companies to spread out news or marketing information 
one reason for considering twitter as a media that broadcasts information instead of a
social network is that on twitter the friendship between two users are asymmetric and
according to    only       of the relationships are reciprocal  this is very different from
the online messenging services such as msn or google chat  however  different from the
traditional media like tv or newspapers  a user can easily propagate information she saw
from other users to her followers by retweet  which is an automatic way of duplicating
others posts on the readers twitter board  the retweet function is critical for making the
information available to a large number of users  however  in the online environment  i
know sometimes people see but not really read the content 
therefore  the goal of the project is to predict the infection rate between information
provider and receiver  and study information flow on twitter network  i construct
epidemic models according to the design of twitter  please see figure   for a summary of
our epidemic model  with epidemic model  our prediction function of infection rate can
better capture the nature of information cascade on the twitter network 

figure    the epidemic model

in section    ill talk about the brief analysis of the profile data and  based on this  how i
normalize them  also  the process to get the reply and retweet rate  then the learning
model for predicting the rate in section    and how and why i evaluate the result of the
 

filearning function in section    finally in section    i will summarize our project and
describe a few take way ideas 

figure    data collection for building nyc network

  our dataset
in this project  i collected the dataset ourselves in new york city  bay area  and chicago at
summer quaretr  for our dataset  i are focused on general mobile users who use twitter
on the go  the users involve in the data are common people like you and me  in this
section  i will detail on how i collect the nyc dataset from twitter 
in order to identify mobile users in new york city  i use twitters apis to collect all the
tweets generated by mobile devices and with gps location within the nyc  their
geo location apis allows us to collect tweets that are posted within a pre configured
geographical range  and i further use the name of the twitter client to select the tweets
generated by the twitter clients on mobile phones  such as twitter for iphone and
twitter for android  i collect all these tweets from the    most populated cities in the
united states  including new york city  chicago  bayarea  los angeles  houston  dallas 
san antonio  phoenix  philadelphia and san diego  however  among all the cities i collect
data from  new yorkers seems to use twitter the most and the most frequent  i can collect
around      mb of tweet from nyc each day  for the rest of the cities  its around     mb of tweet per day  therefore  in the rest of the project  i will use the data from nyc
to analyze how information flows on twitters network 
since i are interested in knowing how the messages are propagated between people  i are
also collecting the followee follower relationship of the users in our trace  for each
retweet  i would like to know how the tweet is propagated to the user  first of all  i collect
whom the users following  i e   the users friends in twitters terminology  secondly  since
retweets follows the format  rt  source  content  i parse the content of the retweet to
 

firetrieve the source of the tweet  after i learn the sources  i collect the sources follower  in
figure    i plot out the data i collected and their relationship between each other  in our
dataset  there are         tweets and        of them are retweets  the retweets are
generated by      unique users  whom i called seeds  while the sources of the retweets
are      unique users  whom i called sources  among the      seeds       of them
allowing us to collect their friend list  and among the      sources       of them allowing
us to collect their follower list  after collecting the friends of the seeds and the followers
of the sources  i have roughly         users  or nodes  and           edges in our
network  in other words  this network is very well connected and most of the retweets
can travel from the sources to the seeds within two steps 

  data analysis
the features i used in the prediction function includes the following information of both
sources information providers  and seeds information receiver  
status count

the number of tweets the user has 

followers count how many people follow this user 
friend count
status count
time zone

how many people the user follows 
how many retweets the use made before 
the time zone of the user 

as the logarithm histogram of each feature in figure    i can find out that count of
followers  friends  and status are in normal distribution after taking logarithm  so i
normalize these three by normalized     log     mean log     std log

  learning for rate prediction function
there are two main parameters in our epidemic model  the infection rate  which is the
probability for the user to read a post from whom the user follows  and the contagion rate
 or retweet rate   which is the probability for the user to retweet a post after reading it  as
i have shown in previous sections  the information cascade on the twitter network is
decided by the two parameters 
in stead of fitting the parameters of the network for each edge in the twitter network  i
want to learn functions to predict the rates for a given pair of twitter following
information  using the twitter api  i can obtain the posts by a given user  furthermore  if
a post is a retweet instead of an original post by this user  there will be a mark rt before
it  therefore  i can estimate the overall retweet rate  even more  the retweet posts also
record who is the source  therefore  fix a pair of users  u  v   in which u follows v  i can
compute the retweet rate between them 
to be specific  i select a set of  directed  edges e  in the nyc network  in which for each
edge  u  v  in e  there exists at least one retweet    i use the profile of u and v as the input
 features  and compute the retweet rate of  u  v  as the output of a linear function f 
denote the features of the i th edge in our dataset as x i  and the retweet rate to be r i  
i want to learn the coefficients  of f x   tx so that f x i   is close to r i   i for the
closeness i can use the least square distance  besides  since the rate is the parameter of a
bernuli distribution  i can compute the kullbackleibler divergence  kl divergense  or the
bhattacharyya distance between the distributions as the distance  to sum up  i use the
following three different cost functions for f x i   and r i  

 

fifor the case of using least square distance  i solved it as a linear regression problem using
the package in matlab  for the other two cost functions  i do the optimization using
gradient descent 

  evaluation of the result
to evaluate the learned prediction function  i compute the log likelihood of our data 
from the histogram of post   i have the weight function of loglikelihood be logarithm of
status instead directly using number of status  that is 

besides the aforementioned three models using different cost functions  i also compute
the loglikelihood using the total average retweet rate for comparison  the table below is
the result

  summary
to sum up  during the past several weeks i did the data preparation and preprocessing 
besides  i also investigated the data to figure out what kind of learning model and features
i can use to predict the model parameters  the model parameters and the coefficients of
the prediction functions should be able to reflect some interesting properties of
information cascade on twitter network
