clustering autism cases on social functioning
nelson ray and praveen bommannavar

 

introduction

autism is a highly heterogeneous disorder with wide variability in social functioning  many diagnostic and
neuropsychological tests exist which assess social functioning  but thus far few attempts have been made to
classify distinct social phenotypes in autism  thereby reducing phenotypic heterogeneity and improving efforts
to identify candidate genes  in this project we will use clustering procedures to stratify social phenotypes
based on social functioning data available in the autism genetic resource exchange  agre  dataset  the
next stage in the analysis would be to determine whether candidate genes involved in social functioning are
associated with distinct social phenotypes 

 

iq

in the autism spectrum disorder  asd  literature  iq is consistently cited as one of the primary aspects
of heterogeneity in autism     an overly coarse stratification based solely on iq would roughly identify
low and high functioning groups  we examine the distribution of various iq measures in both the autistic
group and the control group in order to quantify the intelligence based heterogeneity and stratify the autistic
population  there are some missing values for various iq measures  but due to the small number of predictors
in consideration we consider only the complete cases for sample sizes of     for the control group and    
for the autistic group 
in figure   we see the unimodal iq distribution for the control group and bimodal distribution for the
autistic group compared with the fitted density for the autistic group  determined from fitting a mixture of
gaussians with the e m algorithm  the number of components was chosen using the bayesian information
criterion  bic  to balance parsimony with fit and resulted in a two component model       
in figure  a we see the results of pca on all   iq measures  the data were centered but not standardized
because the iq measures were already standardized  all measures are negatively correlated with the first
principal component  so we think of the first principal component as being a measure of general unintelligence 
note that the full scale iq score is highly correlated with the first principal component  as indicated by the
scree plot  the first principal component explains much of the variance  this suggests that using full scale iq
alone is quite informative  the second principal component highlights the contrast between the nonverbal
tests  stanford binet nonverbal and ravens progressive matrices  and the verbal tests  stanford binet
verbal and peabody picture vocabulary test  
in figure  b we fit a mixture of gaussians to the   iq measures  not counting full scale iq  with bic
choosing a two components

figure    bic chooses the bimodal model in  b   providing a mathematical justification for what we see
graphically in  a  
we compare the classifications of the univariate  fsiq only  and   variable models  they agree on
assigning    autistic children to the low functioning group and     to the high functioning group  three
are assigned to different classes  in comparing the congruence of the classifications  we find that the rand
coefficient    is     and the adjusted rand coefficient    is      agreeing with table    we conclude that a full
scale iq score cutoff produces nearly identical groups to a four variable model and prefer it for simplicity 
now that we have confirmed the iq heterogeneity described in the asd literature and understand the
relationships among the various iq measures  we add in social features in hopes of being able to describe
groups like group   is low functioning and measures low on eye contact but high on peer interaction 

 

clustering on social features

we consider responses relating to social functioning drawn from the autism diagnostic interview revised
 adi r   autism diagnostic observation schedule  ados   and social responsiveness scale  srs   typically  questions are coded are on a   to   scale  from behavior not present to extreme severity of specified
behavior   example questions include recognizes when something is unfair  showing and directing attention  and group play with peers  scores on these tests are used in diagnosing asd in children 
we ended up with      observations of autistic and normal children with    social and iq variables of
interest  fewer than    of the entries were missing  so we used median imputation for simplicity 
in figure    we see from the hierarchical clustering with average linkage on the social features that the

table    adjusted rand index between various clusterings 
majority of the healthy individuals with autistic siblings are similar to one another  due to small sample
sizes of other sibling groups  no other apparent conclusions can be drawn 
there are many clustering algorithms and often no one correct technique for the data at hand  therefore 
our strategy is to apply three clustering algorithms  k means  gaussian mixtures  and spectral clustering 
and only decide on a final stratification if there is high congruence between two or more algorithms  that
is  if several orthogonal techniques all agree on the same clustering  then that is pretty good evidence for
the validity of those clusters  we dont use hierarchical clustering here due to the difficulty in cutting the
dendrogram correctly and just use it for insights that can be drawn from the informative visualization 
the data were standardized to put the variables on equal footing  an iq score in the hundreds does not
compare with social responses in the single digits  all clustering was done on only the autistic children since
our final goal is to stratify them based on these variables  bic chose a   component model for the gaussian
mixtures  and a within groups sum of squares plot on k for k means showed an elbow at k     or    we
considered spectral clustering with a radial basis kernel function and   clusters 
from table   we see that the largest corrected for chance version of the rand index between two
clusterings is     and the smallest is      this indicates that the clusterings are reasonably stable  but
our highest confidence is in the clustering returned by either k means or spectral clustering  the k means
clustering returned clusters of size         and      with    variables  it is a bit difficult to qualify the
exact differences between the groups  however  the search for the genetic factors driving the stratification
can proceed with only the clusterings  to shed light on the latent structure underlying the observed social

for parsimony  we chose   factors and employed a varimax rotation to increase correlations between
variables and factors  in the interest of space  we have also omitted variables with small correlations with
the factors  we note that the factors explain     of the total variance  drawing from the codebook for these
psychological tests  we characterize factor   as not recognizing unfairness  not playing appropriately with
children his her age  having trouble keeping up with the flow of a normal conversation  having difficulty
relating to peers  etc      factor   is described by not being able to get his her mind off something once
he she starts thinking about it  factor   is imaginative play with peers  showing and directing attention 
appropriateness of social responses  and group play with peers  factor   is simply highly correlated with
three intelligence measures 
given the descriptions of the factors  it seems like factor   encompasses many antisocial tendencies  factor
  obsessive compulsiveness  factor   sociability and empathy  and factor   intelligence 

 

conclusion

we have examined the relationships among various measures of intelligence and their role in heterogeneity
in asd populations  we have also come up with a reasonably stable stratification of asd groups into
three subgroups that are more homogeneous as measured by social phenotypes  although not sufficient to
characterize the differences between these subgroups  we have attempted to shed light on the underlying
latent variables that drive the social variability 
future work includes a genetic analysis of the subpopulations in order to find potential driving snps 
further qualifying the differences among the subgroups is also desirable
