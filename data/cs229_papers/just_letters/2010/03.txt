introduction

 

most touch devices can convert a scribble on the
touch screen to a series of x and y coordinates with
timestamps  for the scope of this work we only considered the offline part of this data  which is a sequence of coordinates without the timestamp therefore assuming uniform speed  this also makes the
problem less writer specific by ignoring differences in
writing speed  however  since the input is otherwise
unconstrained it is desriable for our features to be
independent of the length  orientation and scale of
the input  we call a series of coordinates generated
without lifting the pen a stroke  each character can
be made from one of more strokes  for cursive handwriting every word can also have arbitary number of
strokes 
since our input is a series of points our features are
defined at these points  at each point we use

touchpad based devices like phones and tablets are
now ubiquitous and growing even more in popularity 
due to their form factors  however  otherwise standard means of input like keyboards are less effective
in these devices  infact using scribbling to recognize
handwriting is a viable alternative  in this project
we investigated a method of recognizing handwritten
characters to allow automatic recognition of characters  we used a gaussian mixture model for modelling
the feature distributions 

 

character features

previous work

most of the published literature in this field is about
a decade old partly because touch input devices were
limited to specialized usage and were not commonly
used  thus limiting the impact of any research in this
area      and     offer a good summary of all the
techniques that have been tried for online and offline
handwriting recognition 

   the horizontal and the vertical components of
the gradient defined between every two consecutive points 
   the sine and the cosine of the angle made by the
gradient with the horizontal axis  this feature
is scale invariant 

among the approaches taken towards handwriting
   the gaussian curvature defined as the angle berecognition one is to first segment the given words
tween the two segments joined by a point  as
into characters and then recognize each of the charcan be seen in figure   it is both scale and rotaacters  the online problem where timestamp is given
tion invariant 
for each point is similar to speech recognition and
thus ideas from that field have been applied to handthese features allow us to capture local details  to
writing recognition mainly by modelleing either the recognize a stroke we need this information defined
words or the characters using markov models      our at several points  thus we define a frame as these
approach is based on that taken by     as a first step  features defined on a window of consecutive points
 

figradient

boundaries between each character in a word is already known  we can also remove the constraint on
segmentation if the handwriting is modelled as a hidden markov process

gaussian mixture model

  we model our features as
in order to find p r fi  c 
a mixture of gaussians  the features can then be
projected on the gaussians which have certain prior
for each character learned during training 

of a fixed length  since using all points on a stroke
may lead to overfitting  as we expect the number of
points to vary with scale and writing style  we only
use a subset of frames defined on a stroke  by using
local extremas on a stroke as the center of these windows we expect to cover the most important features
within each stroke  to formalize  each character se  can contain any number of strokes s 
  and
quence c
each stroke has some features f    f      defined on it 
thus our problem is to find the character that has
the maximum a posteriori probability given a set of
features

where f is all the features in the training set  n is

the number of gaussians and   fi c 
  during
function of features coming from character c 
the testing phase we can then rank the characters by

   

p r c  is the prior of the character or the character
sequence under consideration  for instance  we can
use the frequency of each word in the english language as its prior  for our experiments we assume
each character to be equally likely  thus we try to
maximize

results

we used the ujipenchars  dataset from the uci machine learning repository for our experiments  this
where we simply replaced s by its constituent feais a dateset of about   k samples of handwritten chartures  assuming independence of features and ignoracters from    writers  characters include the both
ing the order between them
upper and lower case english letters  digits     other

ascii characters and    spanish non ascii charac     arg max

in our experiments we found that this approach
we used our approach to distinguish discretely is insufficient to predict a character with very high
written individual characters however our approach accuracy  at best this can be a preprocessing step to
can be extended to cursive writing as well if the a more detailed prediction based on markov models

figure    accuracy increases with window size 
and further restricted by dictionary search on words
or characters  in order to quantify the accuracy of
this approach we choose as a metric our performance
measure as the average position of the actual label in
the sorted list of labels predicted by our algorithm  in
the plots ahead accuracy is the inverse of the average
of this index for all characters 
we used hold out cross validation for these results 
em was initialized using k means to avoid singularities and get faster convergence     in figure a we
show the improvement in accuracy with increasing
features 
in figure   we show the accuracy with increasing
number of gaussians used to model the feature set 
the accuracy increases upto a certain point but past
that it leads to overfitting and the convergence also
suffers  figure   plots the accuracy with window size

increasing features  the first iteration only included
gradient projections  the second included the sines
and cosines and the last also included the curvature 
the number of gaussians were fixed at    and the

in our experiments we ignored the sequence or the
temporal information among the strokes within a
character  using that information could give a good
boost to our results  also using language dictionaries
would limit the search space once we move to word
recognitions
