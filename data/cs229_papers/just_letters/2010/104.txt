extracting latent user preferences using sticky sliders
garrett eastham  stanford university 
machine learning plays a critical role in user modeling applications where
dynamic systems are trained against collected user behavior data to predict future
actions  such as web search  preference elicitation remains a difficult task in the
design of such systems  a task further complicated by users own ambiguous
search criteria and knowledge of a problem domain  a system for preference
extraction has been designed based on previous research in feature discovery
interfaces and a supervised machine learning model is developed to accurately
estimate a users latent decision criteria based on limited interaction data 
abstract query formation and prior work
formal study of query construction and evaluation has consistently revealed that the
modern users search criteria can be quite complex  in many scenarios  the users
decision criteria are ill formed at outset  and in fact  most have little idea about the
particular distinguishing features that will guide their final selection  cognition forces the
mind to create these features during the categorization process  and during an
informational discriminatory task such as search  the human mind subconsciously
constructs such preferences on its own   schyns             further work has shown that
these mental preferences are closely tied with the nature and timing of the information
presented to the user  and  as a result  systems can be built that modify the end users own
decision criteria  for better or worse   pu       slovic      
my previous research project  called heyelroy  involved designing and testing an
interface for semantic feature discovery  the system was designed to take advantage of
the previously mentioned concepts of preference construction by allowing users to
explore and discover features relevant to a problem space in addition to the items of
inquiry in a natural  iterative manner   eastham       this work was built on a previous
study exploring the role of ad hoc concepts in decision making within single and group
based environments  where a correlation was discovered between the confidence of
selection and the number of observed items   features 
creating tangible feature to feature tradeoffs
the heyelroy system has been heavily modified to explore a new interaction paradigm i
call sticky sliders that is used to generate sample data to train a preference matrix
against  figure   shows the primary attribute matrix that users are presented with upon
loading the comparison system  each items attributes are listed vertically in each column
and the comparable features are listed on the left in each row with interactive sliders
under each feature label 

fifigure  

  

the sliders control linear weights on the attributes that effect their contribution to the
overall rank of the column relative to the rest of the compared items  to calculate a
column ranking  the columns attribute values are summed according to their weighted
values and then ranked according to decreasing value 

where ri is the rank of the ith column for an attribute matrix with m features and n items 
initially  the weights w are all set to the same value  arbitrarily set to integer value   
across all features   and the position of the slider determines the value of w  all the way
left corresponds to   and all the way right      
because in an ideal query  all users would want to maximize all attributes in searching for
an item  the movement of sliders is constrained by a real world n x n preference matrix r 
constructed 

in this representation  each row ri represents the tradeoffs corresponding with changes
made to the ith feature weight  the diagonal values are normalized to   because this
corresponds to the resulting trade offs for a single unit of change on the interface sliders 
this trade off matrix is constructed using the average swap distance between features
across all permutations of column orderings and is generated using the algorithm outlined
in figure    thus  as the user engages with the interface  the sliders adjust to the real
world constraints of the problem space  providing a tangible interactive representation 
as shown below in figure

applying sticky sliders to the comparison interaction
while the application of weighted preference matrix r to the constrained slider
interaction intuitively informs the user about the constraints of the problem space  the
more desirable information is the users own preference matrix p  defined similar to r 
that allows a system to know how the individual user values different decision criteria 
as expressed in prior research and literature  these preferences are often unknown prior 
even to the user himself  however  these preferences are expressed latently in how the
user reacts to the modified slider weights  the order in which a user responds to various
changes in features  as well as the magnitude of that response  i e  the new level set by
the user  indicates the particular trade off values within the users own matrix p 

figure  

  

fia critical assumption in the construction of the new comparison system is that replacing
the generalized preference matrix r with the users own ideal p will avoid the reactionary
patterns of behavior and allow a user to naturally explore the item set according to his
own preferences  thus  a machine learning model is trained on the sequence of slide
interaction data to identify points feature to feature reactions and construct a weighted
matrix s such that 
this modifying matrix p is returned to the client side interface upon each slide interaction
and creates a sticking effect on the movement of feature sliders that keeps the explicit
slider levels set by the user from moving with respect to the other values of r 
learning from user actions with feature to feature decay
as the user corrects the weighted preference sliders  they generate a series of k actions 
alternating between various features f   f     fn for n features  this series of actions
 called the actionlist  can be seen visually below  and the existing system keeps track of
these state changes throughout the comparison session  in designing a useful training
model  the primary design goal was that the features closest to each other within this
actionlist are more strongly bound together  i e   users are less willing to make tradeoffs
between features f i  and f j  when cij is small relative to the total size k of the
actionlist   conceptually  this corresponds to users reacting more strongly to a feature
that was modified  indicating an expressed desire to correct the value to a previously set
value 

thus  the final weighed update algorithm makes use of an exponential decay function of
the distance from feature to feature within the action list  giving weighted preference to
closer features  in calculating the user preferences s  a raw preference matrix s is
initialized with empty values zero and is filled by performing a double loop through the
action list and updating the matrix values 

after this loop finishes  each row f i  of s is normalized by calculating the row sum and
dividing each row entry by this sum  where di is the magnitude of change with each
slider interaction  this generates a probability mass distribution of a users expressed
preferences regarding each f i  f j  relationship  however  one must note that this
preference matrix is not  in itself  of the same nature as the trade off matrix r used to
adjust the slide interactions  the final preference matrix s is derived 

fiin the live system  the final preference matrix s is used to return an updated trade off
matrix p  causing the user to adjust their interaction and comparison                   
discussion and future work
as presented here  the weighted decay approach to preference learning is uniquely
situated within this limited domain of comparisons  however  the unique blend of
machine learning and creative interaction design presents an entirely new research
paradigm  especially within the realm of preference extraction  typical approaches to
latent variable discovery automatically assume the need for large datasets and complex
unsupervised learning algorithms to discover hidden structure within user behavior
patterns  however  this simple experiment and system shows that many of these problems
can be alleviated with a more creative approach to interaction design  the online learning
algorithm developed here iterates over the k items in the action list with each slider
update  making an ajax call to a back end server   however  the calculations are not
computationally complex for small numbers of features and solutions  which are
constrained by human cognitive capabilities anyways  
future work will focus on using the preference information generated from these
interactions as additional feature sources in traditional recommendation algorithms in an
attempt to create a more robust query framework  the potential for using creative
interaction patterns such as sticky sliders is incredible and presents a new paradigm in
human computer interaction research  an incredible wealth of information lies in wait for
the innovative interaction designer to begin capturing  and there is no telling what new
improvements these data sources will lead to in both existing and future recommendation
and information retrieval systems
