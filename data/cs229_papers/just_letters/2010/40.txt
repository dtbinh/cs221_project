introduction
the focus of this project is classification 
across human subjects  of single trials of
eeg recorded while subjects viewed
images of human faces and inanimate
objects  the data used in this project
were originally collected in the suppes
brain lab at stanford for use in another
experiment comparing classification
rates to representational dissimilarity
matrices  in preparation   classification
for that experiment was done only
within subject  training and testing on
one subject at a time   used only lda
classification  and was not implemented
by anyone in our project group  our
present goal is to explore a variety of
machine learning techniques with our
dataset in three scenarios  within subject
classification  training and testing on all
subjects together  and training on nine
subjects and testing on the tenth 
our dataset consists of    
channels of scalp eeg recorded at   khz
from    subjects while they viewed
individual images  each trial consisting
of an image shown onscreen for    
ms   the original stimulus set  adapted
from the stimuli used in      consists of
   images grouped into   categories  for
the current analysis  we are using only
the    images from the human face and
inanimate object categories  each
subject viewed each image    times  for
   images per category    categories 
and    subjects  we have a total of
       eeg trials in our dataset  our
dataset has been highpass filtered for dc
offset removal  then lowpass filtered and
downsampled by a factor of    for
smoothing and data reduction  it has also

already undergone ica for removal of
eye artifacts      and has been converted
back to channel space  we have    
channels and    samples  covering
roughly the     ms interval of stimulus
presentation  for each trial  giving a
feature vector of length

initial implementations
one challenge of this project has been
feature reduction and managing data
complexity 
we
explored
both
supervised and unsupervised learning
techniques  and considered different
configurations of training and test sets
 for instance  training and testing on
everyone  training on one person and
testing on another  and training on all
but one and testing on the last  
we first attempted nave bayes
classification and pca on the entire
dataset  using matlabs navebayes
object and princomp function
respectively  these attempts both
resulted in immediate memory errors 
we then attempted to increase and
manage matlab memory  both through
the command line interface and by

filaunching a graphical interface using the
memory manager  we continued to
have memory failure issues 
next  we attempted to reduce the
dataset size  and we used a nave bayes
classifier on individual channels  all
subjects combined  using    fold cross
validation  this resulted in an accuracy
rate for each channel and produced a
working first attempt classifier for the
dataset  using this method  we identified
the best channel      with accuracy of
       and the worst channel      with
accuracy of         we expect that
using more channels simultaneously
 more features  should achieve accuracy
higher than       
in an effort to improve on this
process  we used the same singlechannel iteration method over all
subjects using    fold cross validation
with both a linear and quadratic discriminant analysis classification model
 lda and qda respectively   these
new classification models improved
accuracy slightly over nave bayes  the
best classification accuracy using lda
on a single channel was        again for
channel     we also achieved accuracy
of       using qda for channel    
we then explored within subject
classification using nave bayes and
lda by using one channel at a time 
both models produced accuracy rates
similar to those described above 
in an attempt to reduce data
dimensionality  we decided to select a
subset of samples per channel  to
identify the appropriate range of
samples  we considered the channel that
performed best by itself     for both nb
and lda   and plotted the averages
across all subjects and trials for this
channel alone  for each image category
separately  we then took the absolute
value of the difference between the

averages for faces versus objects  and
picked the range of samples with the
greatest magnitude difference across the
averages  which turned out to be samples
      corresponding to the time range of
       ms after stimulus onset   thus  to
reduce our dataset size further  we used
only samples      for all channels and
re ran the lda and nave bayes
models

using this limited range of
samples  running lda with    fold
cross validation using all channels at
once  within subject for all ten subjects 
we generated an average accuracy of
       using the same process with a
nave bayes model  we generated a
slightly lower accuracy of        for
lda and nave bayes  we have the

fifinally  to do an initial
assessment of the validity of the model
across subjects  we computed the
precision and recall values for all   
subjects independently  subjects who
had higher precision also tended to have
higher recall 

liblinear svm over pca
within subject classification
we proceeded by performing svm
classification using a linear kernel
 implemented using liblinear   as a
solution to our matlab memory issues 
we performed all memory intensive
computations using stanford matlab
resources  cm matlab stanford edu with
  gb memory and a suppes brain lab
machine with   gb memory  both
running    bit matlab   we also
attempted svm classification on smaller
sample subsets  samples       in an
effort to improve efficiency 
we considered performing pca
on all channels  as opposed to using a
sample subset in the classification  we
performed both spatial and temporal
pca  both to improve efficiency and as
a noise reduction technique in an attempt
to improve classification rates  by
spatial pca we mean that we are finding
principal components across the
samples  time points   while temporal
pca refers to finding principal
components across the channels  
data were pre processed to
normalize per channel mean and
variance across all subjects prior to
running pca as a standard step to ensure
that the first principal component
describes the direction of maximum
variance  to further increase efficiency 
                                                                                                                
   to  the  best  of  our  understanding   this  follows  the  
spatial temporal  distinction  made  with  ica   though  there  
appears  to  be  some  debate  on  the  matter

we selected principal components
whose respective eigenvalues  sorted in
descending order  had a normalized
cumulative sum reaching a predetermined threshold  such as      or
       the threshold of     compressed
our data size by a factor of      for
spatial pca and      for temporal pca 
outlining our data sampling
process for classification model training
and testing  we randomly partitioned our
   subject dataset into an     training 
    testing split  to establish a
baseline accuracy rate for comparison to
across subject classification  we first
performed within subject classification 
using svm with    fold cross validation
and attained the following accuracies

ensemble methods
to conduct classification across
subjects  we initially took an ensemble
voting classification method  building  
svm models using individual subjects
spatial pca data 
testing was
performed by converting test subject
data into each other individuals training
model pca space  obtaining   sets of
predicted labels  and taking the majority
vote to produce a final ensemble
classification  as expected for pairwise
test training individuals classification 
svm models produced accuracies near
     for same training and test subjects 
while other pairwise classifications
performed poorly  with mean accuracy
of only        figure     however 
after combining these weak learners and
taking the majority vote of the predicted

filabel  the resulting ensemble classifier
produced satisfactory accuracy levels
between         figure    

these loosvm classifiers
achieve accuracy in   subject channel
space ranging from           subject
spatial pca space from         and 
after removing outliers based on the
previous loosvm accuracy measures

leave one out svm
we then took the approach of building
svm models using liblinear on  
subjects  systematically generating the
models using training examples of raw
channel data and spatial pca for
separate models  and testing on the   th
subject  based on the loosvm  leaveone out svm  accuracies  we observed
two subjects  s   s    who consistently
under performed as test datasets  we
chose to remove these two subjects
datasets from the training model to
produce a   subject loosvm model for
comparison 

as an additional exercise  we
also performed the above classifications
on the smaller sample range  samples       the rates proved to be comparable
to those in figure    so there appeared to
be no added benefit of using only a
subset of the samples in addition to a
subset of principal components 
especially as the pca reduction had
already decreased our processing time
and improved efficiency 
  
temporal pca
finally  we attempted the same
loosvm classification using temporal
rather than spatial pca  with data from
all ten subjects  here we also
experimented with different thresholds
      the spatial pca threshold  and also
     for the number of principal
components to choose  results are
shown below  it appears that spatial
pca produces higher accuracies for

fisome subjects  while temporal pca
works better for others

conclusion
we observed the highest across subject
testing accuracies using the   subject
loosvm classifier in spatial pca
space  with surprisingly comparable
measures achieved using a   subject
ensemble majority vote classifier built
on weak learner pairwise svm
classifiers  these classification methods
approach the accuracy achieved by
within subject
classification 
our
project implies the ability to train
classifier models on training subjects
completely separate from testing
subjects 
we selected training outliers by
training a loosvm model and testing
on individual training subjects  we then
improved overall accuracy by removing
those training subjects whose data tested
relatively poorly  prior to building the
final loosvm model  the relative
success of   subject ensemble majority
vote accuracies  compared to the
individual pairwise accuracies  suggests
underlying diversity between singlesubject svm classifiers 
it is interesting to note that
different subjects datasets classified
better on different attempts described in

this paper  for example  s   the top
classifier in the within subjects scenario 
was also the highest classifying dataset
in spatial pca  but not in the ensemble
method or in temporal pca  in contrast 
s  was among the lower classifying
subjects for within subject classification
 significantly the lowest for this case  
ensemble methods  and spatial pca  but
did slightly better with temporal pca 
our classification results suggest
that to some extent  processing of face
and object categories can be generalized
across human subjects and applied to
new subjects data on even the singletrial level  it would be of further interest
to us to better quantify the nature of the
useful spatial and temporal features that
contribute to successful across subject
classification
