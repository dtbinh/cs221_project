abstract
efforts to achieve mobile robotic localization have relied on probabilistic techniques such as
kalman filtering or monte carlo localization  thrun  et al    these techniques often rely on the
use of expensive lasers to provide accurate input data  while they provide accurate sensing  the
lasers can cost in the range of thousands  in this paper  a method of wifi based localization for
the purpose of inexpensive mobile robotic localization is presented 

 

introduction

recently  there have been many efforts to utilize large scale wi fi network signals for the purpose of
localization  rather than achieving localization for select few robots through odometry and expensive
laser rangefinders  this paper seeks to show whether low cost localization is feasible for any robotic
application where laser information is not available 
the process of localization is divided into three phases  in the first  the robot simultaneously maps
the environment and captures wireless data points from nearby access points  the readings include the
access points mac id  ssid  signal strength  and noise strength  this step utilizes the laser sensors
to create an accurate map of the environment and the robots pose in that map  the first step can
be performed by any robot with an available laser sensor and is not required for the actual wifi based
localization 
next  nearest neighbor lookups are utilized to provide likely poses based on the distance from
capture points  for a given estimated pose  the lookup map provides the closest sensor reading location
and provides a likelihood of the point belonging to that location based on the sensor model chosen 
lastly  the robot is run once again in the same environment  while the motion model remains
the same  the sensor model will come purely from wifi readings  at each predetermined time motion
step  the incoming wireless scans match against the lookup map and update the motion model poses
according to the monte carlo particle filter update 

 
   

theoretical justification
models

the heart of the state and measurement models come from the probabilistic evolution of the bayesian
network  at each time step  t  the current state pose of the robot  xt   only depends on the current
input  ut   and previous position  xt    in addition  the current pose outputs a sensor reading  zt  
the final bayes filter  presented by thrun et  al  follows

figure    signal stength frequency
motion model  p xt  xt    the motion model is distributed according to a normal distribution
with the robot error characteristics incorporated into the variances 
sensor model   it is common practice in literature to approximate the wireless signal intensities as
normal distributions  by assuming a normal distribution for the difference in signal intensity for each
access point  the signals probability of being at a certain point can be approximated by a gaussian
with mean   and variance in signal strength  measured in db       
during training  however  the signal strengths often followed bimodal curves and sometimes even
multimodal distributions as shown in figure    as such  the non normal prior factored into both
data capturing and testing  the signals were fitted to an augmented normal distribution  p z   
d 

e     where d is the measured difference in signal strength  and  and    are chosen by experimental
evaluation  to test for efficacy of different distributions  the signals were also fit to a normalized
laplacian distribution  z  l       where  is also chosen experimentally 

 

testing

the videre erratic mobile robot platform is used throughout this experiment  the robots attached
sick lms    laser rangefinder scans at a high frequency with less than  mm of  sigma  statistical
error  while wifi based localization can be shown to run in underpowered computing environments 
the non parametric nature of nearest neighbor lookup creates a linear dependency on the size of the
dataset  while larger datasets increase accuracy  they also require greater computing power 
the wireless card used for these experiments is based off a realtek     l chipset with support for
a b g network standards 
the william gates basement was chosen as the environment for testing  wide availability of
accesspoints  broad network thoroughput  and presence of large areas and narrow corriders proved
ideal for testing the performance of localization  testing was performed over a total distance of more
than    meters at a speed of   m s 

 
   

results
general

the optimal  value  corresponding to the standard dev  of the db drop in signal strength was chosen
by setting all other variables constant and measuring the average error over a test run  as seen in
figure    values that were too small limited the bandwidth of the wifi measurment update and thus its

 

fieffectiveness  large values had the opposite effect in that the filter included too many false positive
readings

table    mean error
in order to determine an optimal model for the sensor measurements  tests were run comparing
the mean error vs  coefficients for both gaussian and laplacian distributions  given an initial position
estimate  as a matter of comparison  the mean error over the entire run for a motion model of the
odometry was        meters  in general  the laplacian fitting performed consistently with gaussian
fittings  in addition  as shown in figure    the wifi based localization performed remarkably well for
both the laplacian and gauussian models  locations where the error increased are most likely due to
sampling from a different mode of the sensor distribution than the central mode 

   

dataset performance

naturally  the use of nearest neighbor lookups implies greater localization accuracy with larger data
sets  this generally held true in comparison  smaller datasets with greater error meant that there
were a general lack of data points around the vicinty  on the other hand  larger data sets with greater
errors meant that the set contained incorrect readings for some of the sampled points  therefore  the
size of the data set did not matter as much as the uniformity of the captured locations and the mode
of distribution with which the signals were chosen from

global localization

the strength of the wi fi particle filter update comes into play during global localization  in experiments
run with no prior estimation of the robot pose  the nearest neighbor filter was able to bring the robot

conclusion

wifi based localization is an effective method of tracking within an average of around   meter over a
   meter run  the greatest asset is its ability to localize quickly in the case of global localization  it
is pertinent to note that unlike laser localization  wifi lookup maps inherently cannot provide theta
estimation  future improvements would be to utilize lowess methods or gaussian processes in
the sensor measurement update  overall  for applications requiring meter scale precision  wifi based
localization is an ideal low cost alternative to laser based options
