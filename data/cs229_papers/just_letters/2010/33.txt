    abstract  

  
in   the   start up   investing   community    many   think   that   investing   is   an   art   more   than   a   science    investing  
decisions   from   angels   and   venture   capitalists   are   based   many   times   in   intuition    first   impressions     simple   rules  
of   thumb    e g     if   founder   is   a   graduate   student   from   stanford   i   will   invest     herd   mentality    e g     if   kleiner 
perkins  has  invested  in  this  company  i  should  too  despite  the  price    etc   few  investment  decisions  are  based  
on  quantifiable  arguments     in  fact   most  investors  do  not  believe  it  is  possible  to  come  up  with  a  quantitative  
model  for  venture  investing   the  goal  of  this  project  is  to  build  a  quant   vc  robot   that  predicts  success  of  a  
start up   company   based   on   some   measurable   features          we   show   in   section        that   the   robot   built   has  
significantly  higher  hit  rate  than  an  average  venture  capitalitst   

    data  collection  

  
obtaining   a   good   and   large   enough   data   is   one   of   the   biggest   challenges   in   this   project    data   gathering   is  
complex   for   various   reasons    easily   accessible   data   is   skewed    much   more   data   available   on   successful  
companies    data  can  only  be  retrieved  manually   free  online  databases  are  not  complete   and  private  data  like  
is  either  not  available  or  available  via  expensive  subscriptions   

      training  data  set  
  
rather  than  choosing  from  any  available  start up  data   i  imposed  the  following  restrictions  on  the  training  set   
  
   company   must   belong   to   the   semiconductor   industry    the   company   must   be   shipping   integrated  
circuits   or   intellectual   property   directly   dropped   in   integrated   circuits    ics     i   have   excluded   some  
neighboring  industries  such  as  the  electronic  design  automation  industry   eda   that  provides  software  
tools   for   the   design   of   ics    semiconductor   equipment   companies    semiconductor   manufacturing  
companies   etc   although  i  plan  to  lift  this  restriction  in  the  near  future   for  now  it  allows  me  to  have  a  
consistent  set  of  data  with  similar  macroeconomic  expectations     
   the  companies  had  to  be  founded  in        or  later   this  restriction  was  due  to  the  fact  that  there  is  
little  consistent  data  online  for  companies  that  were  founded  earlier   
   the   company   must   have   raised   some   money   from   venture   capitalists   at   some   time   during   their  
lifetime    again    this   restriction   was   also   due   to   the   fact   that   there   is   barely   any   data   accessible   for  
companies  that  are  angel  financing   or  that  died  before  raising  any  venture  money     
   if  the  company  is  still  alive  and  has  not  had  a  liquidity  event   i  have  excluded  it  from  the  data  set   my  
plan  is  to  use  our  model  to  predict  whether  these  companies  will  be  successful   
  
with  these  restrictions  i  have  been  able  to  find  data  on       companies   as  i  created  the  model   i  found  that  
after        companies    the   training   and   test   error   were   similar   so   no   more   companies   were   needed    at   the  
moment   i  have  used  the  following  feature  set   
  
   total  funding  received  
   location  measured  as  distance  of  company  headquarters  to  santa  clara   ca   intel  headquarters   
   year  it  was  founded  
   year  it  exited   either  ipo   acquisition  or  bankruptcy   
   number  of  silicon  valley  tier     venture  investors   i  define  tier     venture  investors  that  are  at  least  
fifteen  years  old  and  have  more  than    b  in  assets  under  management

one  of  the  founders  was  ceo  at  the  time  of  exit  
one  of  the  founders  was  cto  at  the  time  of  exit  
the   ceo   had   a   technical   background    at   least   ms   or   phd   in   a   technical   field   and   had   held   some  
technical  role  in  a  previous  company   
the  ceo  had  been  at  a  start up  before  
one  of  the  founders  holds  a  degree  from  a  top  university

the  quantity  we  are  interested  in  measuring  is  the  return  on  investment   i  have  recorded  the  total  exit  price  for  
each   company    from   that   we   can   create   several   criteria   of   success    return   on   investment   larger   than   some  
threshold   return  compounded  yearly   etc       

      data  collection  process  
  
collecting   the   data   was   an   extremely   manual   and   slow   process   that   has   taken   me   tens   of   hours       although   i  
contacted   several   private   database   holders   and   well known   individual   investors    no   one   wanted   to   provide   me  
access  to  the  data   i  also  worked  with  the  stanford  business  school  library  but  unfortunately  they  also  dont  
have   access   to   data   i   could   use    towards   the   end   of   the   project    i   got   access   to   venturesource      database  
which  has  helped  collect  some  of  the  data   additional  data  was  obtained   
  
   from   free   online   databases   crunchbase       venturebeat      and   semi free   silicontap       the  
maintenance   of   these   databases   is   crowd sourced    i e     the   companies   themselves   provide   the  
information   as  a  result   they  are  fairly  incomplete   not  all  companies  are  there   not  all  data  of  a  given  
company  is  there   etc       
   from  silicon  times  magazine      i  found  a  few  free  numbers  online  of  a  publication  that  tracks  start 
ups   in   the   semiconductor   and   telecom   industries    this   was   extremely   useful   as   it   allowed   me   to  
uncover  many  names  of  failed  companies   
   using  wayback  machine      a  web  archive  that  allowed  me  to  dial  back  in  time  and  view  pages  of  
companies  i  was  interested  in   
   using  results  of  various  other  internet  searches   

    data  analysis  
  
before  proceeding  to  construct  a  model  i  took  a  look  at  the  data   i  define  success  of  a  company   the  ones   as  
a   return   over       for   a   series   a   investor         successes   out   of         data     it   assumes   that   series   a   investment   buys  
     of  the  company  and  that  that  ownership  gets  diluted       by  a  liquidity  event   exact  numbers  on  internal  
round   valuations   are   practically   impossible   to   get   so   we   have   to   make   this   estimate    this   would   help   an  
investor  decide  whether  he  should  invest  in  the  series  a  of  a  company   a  series  a  return  of     is  a  low  return  
rate  over  the  typical       years  lifetime  of  a  fund  but  if  i  increase  it  to       we  would  have  very  few  successes  
 only      out  of       data  points    
  
i   was   able   to   see   some   trends   on   the   data   that   allowed   me   then   to   refine   the   features   i   collected    figure      
shows  a  set  of  bar  plots  analyzing  success  factors

subplot       shows  successes  versus  the  number  of  founders   it  appears  that  one  founder  only  is  not  
as  desirable   perhaps  suggesting  that  one  needs  support  starting  a  company    also  three  founders  is  
not  ideal   perhaps  suggesting  odd  team  dynamics  are  not  desirable

i  uncovered  other  interesting  data  relations  such  as  low  spending  rate  is  desirable   smaller  number  of  investors  
is  desirable  etc   i  used  several  x y  plots  to  see  if  data  was  separable  in  any  features   however   the  data  does  
not  seem  separable  at  first  sight  so  it  was  hard  to  extract  any  information  from  that   

    model    

  
i   built   a   logistic   regression   model   that   classifies   data   into   success failures    whether   a   return   produces   a  

fisignificant   return     due   to   the   space   limitation    i   am   not  showing   other   experiments   such   as   the   return   for   a  
later  investor   
  
i   trained   the   model   with         of   the   data   and   i   measured   the   performance   on          of   the   data   using   the  
feature  set  in  table      i  used  cross validation  on  different       subsets  of  the  data  and  selected  the  one  that  
provided  the  best  test  error   i  tried  several  of  the  features  combination  by  adding  features  one  at  a  time  and  
understanding  the  impact  on  the  overall  model  error   also  based  on  some  of  my  initial  results   i  retook  some  of  
the  data   collected  more  info  on  ceo  and  cto  as  well  as  the  number  of  founders

the  model  suffers  of  high  bias  and  more  features  are  needed  to  generate  lower  error  model   unfortunately   
the  time  involved  in  collecting  these  features  is  large  and  i  was  not  able  to  collect  more  information     
  
i   also   created   a   regression   model   for   the   roi   as   function   of   the   variables   in   table           i   obtained   a   large   residual  
when  i  fit  the  roi  number  directly   based  on  the  residuals  i  obtained   i  realized  that  if  i  fit  the  roi    where  
        i   would   obtain   a   better   fit    with   a   simple   optimization   loop    i   found   that          gave   me   the   most 
normal  like  residuals   i  made  a  qq plot  of  the  residuals  in  figure      as  one  can  see   residuals  follow  a  normal  
distribution  quite  well   the  model  i  obtained  is

i  run  out  of  space  to  show  the  model  for  a  later  stage  investor  but  the  process  is  similar   just  additional  features  
such  as  series  b  amount   time  between  a  and  b  rounds    in  any  case   the  series  a  decision  is  the  most  difficult  
 less  
 features  available

    conclusions  and  future  work  

  
it  is  surprising  that  such  a  simple  model  can  guess  failures  correctly  in       of  the  cases  and  successes  in       of  
the   cases    this   is   without   taking   into   consideration   any   market   factors   such   as   whether   the   company   has   a   key  
technology    differentiated   products    revenue    number   of   employees    competitors    good   macro economic  
conditions   etc       i   suspect   that   taking   this   later   features   into   account   would   greatly   improve   the   model   error   
the  success  rate  of  a  venture  capitalist  is  very  low   only                  i  believe  vc  robot  could  help  assist  bring  
that  rate  up   
  
the  model  still  has  high  bias  and  more  features  are  needed  to  achieve  better  modeling  results     i  plan  to  work  
on   this    additionally   i   plan   to   estimate   revenue   stage   at   the   time   of   financing    this   will   help   with   the   model  
level  accuracy  for  a  late  stage  investor   
  
one  of  the  conclusions  from  simply  collecting  the  data  is  that  if  the  initial  founder  ceo  is  still  the  ceo  at  the  
time  of  a  liquidity  event   the  chances  of  success  are  much  higher   as  a  result  the  most  important  question  an  
investor   must   ask   himself   is   whether   the   founder   can   remain   ceo       to   assist   with   this    i   plan   to   continue   to  
gather   additional   features   that   would   allow   to   build   a   simple   model   to   predict   whether   a   founding   ceo   can  
remain   ceo    i   plan   to   gather   features   that   are   relate   to   the   characteristics   of   the   ceo    education    work   history   
relation  to  founding  team   etc      
  
i  have  just  scratched  the  surface  of  this  exciting  project   however  it  is  exciting  and  i  have  found  many  people  
interested  in  continuing  the  work
