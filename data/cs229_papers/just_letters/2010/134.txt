abstractfinding an available parking spot in big and
crowded city centers has been an important problem for people
who use their own cars for transportation  hence  parking
spot detection has been an interesting problem that has drawn
considerable attention  although parking spot detection using
ground based camera imagery has been studied extensively  doing
the same using aerial images is a relatively unexplored problem 
in this work we present a machine learning based approach for
the latter 

a

i  i ntroduction

utomatic parking spot detection using digital imagery
became an important application area for the last decade
as digital visual information become easily accessible  surveying the literature one sees that researchers have analyzed
the general problem in two particular contexts  in the first one
digital imagery obtained from ground based cameras are used
to classify parking spots in a parking lot and or on a street 
this particular setting has been studied pretty extensively  in
particular      and     are good examples of such work  in
the second context  digital aerial imagery is used to classify
parking spots in a parking lot  again      and     can be given
as examples  in this work we generalize the second context and
present a method to classify both parking lot and street parking
spaces using digital aerial imagery  outline of the developed
method is given below

input  training and test sets of aerial images with labelled
parking spots 
parameters  minimum segment area
generate an luv color space representation of the image 
segmentate the image using the luv color space representation 
   extract features 
   use a binary svm with linear kernel to classify the
parking spots 
  
  

manually  each parking spot is represented by a smaller     
subimage  in figure   we give an example image with the
marked parking spots 

output  prediction results on the test set 
image segmentation was done using the publicly available
mean shift image segmentation implementation edison     
for the last step we used the popular liblinear     package
for the svm  these steps will be explained in further detail
in the following sections 
ii  data acquisition
we used the well known software google earth     to
obtain the aerial imagery used in this work  the location
was randomly chosen to be cambridge  uk  eye altitude and
resolution are     ft and            respectively  seven
images have been used to provide data for both training
and test sets  parking spots on these images were marked

iii  i mage s egmentation
image segmentation is an important part of the algorithm
since many features are extracted from the data obtained
through image segmentation  although there are many algorithms for image segmentation  i e  k means  statistical
region merging  mean shift etc    we found mean shift based
algorithms suit best for the purpose of this work  although
image segmentation algorithms have many tuning parameters 
default values of all parameters except the minimum segment
area work fine in our algorithm  minimum segment area thus
becomes the only tuning parameter of our algorithm that stems
from image segmentation  in figure   we give an an example
segmented image

marked as available are marked in green whereas spots correctly marked as
occupied are marked with red  spots marked in blue are misclassified 

iv  f eature e xtraction
this is arguably the most crucial part of the algorithm  in
the literature  feature extraction is unfortunately overlooked in
the context of parking spot detection  raw pixel information
and shallow statistics thereof  e g  histograms  are almost
exclusively used  this  however  results in poor performance
in many cases  we used a heterogenous set of features incorporating a wide range of information  including geometrical 
optical and statistical information  the full list of the features
are given in table i  in this table  center region of a parking
spot means the l    l   sub image having the same center
with the parking spot image  here l      is the side length
of a parking spot image

feature selection
our intution led us to think that each feature captures
different information and thus is necessary  to validate the
necessity of each individual feature  an exhaustive search for
the best feature combination was performed  best     holdout cross validation accuracy was achieved with the full set of
features 
v  s upport v ector m achine
although we tried many different kernels and solvers  the
best kernel solver combination for this problem was found to
be linear kernel and l  regularized logistic regression  primal  
the cost parameter of the svm and the error tolerance of the
solver is found to have little effect on the performance of
the algorithm  particular values that are found to work well
are c     and          finally  we used the liblinear
software as our implementation of choice 

vi  r esults
we used     hold out cross validation to measure the performance parameters of the algorithm  results for a typical run
are given in figure   and performance metrics are summarized
in tables ii  iii and iv 
sensitivity analysis on minimum segment area parameter
being the only non machine learning parameter of the algorithm  minimum segment area warrants a sensitivity analysis 
as seen in figure    the algorithm is robust with respect to
changes in the parameter  the plot also shows that the chosen
value of     pixel  is indeed a good choice for a reasonable
balance between precision  recall and specificity

first of all  we actually wanted to plot the precision recall
curve of our detector as well  however  liblinear software

critical step  results show that the algorithm works pretty
well compared to similar work in the literature  while working
on the project  we also realized an important possible future
extension that could lead to a new and practical technology
which could make lives of drivers much easier

does not give us the freedom to apply a bias for certain solvers
 probably due to a bug   unfortunately  the solver that works
well in our problem happens to be one of these problematic
solvers 
tables showing the performance metrics indicate that the
algorithm works pretty well compared to similar work in the
literature  thus  future work should probably be concentrated
on expanding the functionality of the detector instead of trying
to squeeze a little more performance out of it  one of the main
possible future additions could be using a three class svm to
automatically classify non parking regions in an image  this
would eliminate the need for a human operator to mark parking
spots in test data  this would make the algorithm much more
useful in real life applications  one way to achieve this would
be extracting road information from the images and using the
distance to road edges as a new feature 
viii  c onclusion
in this work we presented a new algorithm to generalize
automatic parking spot detection to street parking in addition
to parking lots  the main stages of the algorithm are image
segmentation  feature extraction and classification using an
svm with linear kernel  feature extraction being the most
