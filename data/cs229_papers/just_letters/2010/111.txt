abstract
recommendation systems have been used in a variety of domains  ranging from
online joke recommendations to automatic educational course recommendations
 courserank   however  users may want different recommendations for different reasons  in order to help each user select the recommendation that aligns
best with his or her goals and values  a recommendation system can present users
with estimations of various attributes of a particular recommendation  using the
data from the courserank recommendation system  we attempt to construct one
potential value predictor  the estimated grade a student will receive for a given
course  both svms and collaborative filtering techniques performed well  but
neither could provide significantly better grade predictions than a baseline estimate of the average grade for each student 

 

introduction

recommendation systems attack the general problem of recommending items to a user that are
likely to be of interest  this typically requires estimating ratings for a set of items with unknown
ratings based on another set of items with known ratings  the items with the highest expected
ratings are recommended to the user  recommendation systems have been applied to various types
of items including physical goods  movies  research papers  webpages  educational courses  etc      
similarly  the ratings could either be explicitly provided by the user  e g  using a   to   star rating 
or a likert scale  or obtained implicitly by the system  e g  the number of times a webpage was
visited  
recommendation systems are primarily either model based or memory based  a model based system abstracts a probabilistic model that predicts ratings for a given user and item  a memory based
system uses unsupervised learning to cluster either user or item data based on known ratings  an
unknown rating is then approximated with a weighted average of known ratings  the weights are determined by computing the distance between unknown and known items with a reasonable distance
metric  memory based systems have been particularly popular  since they make fewer assumptions
regarding what factors contribute to a rating and are more likely to produce diverse recommendations
than a model based approach 
users may have specific needs for recommendations that are not fully addressed by an overall rating 
in these cases  the user has to evaluate the given set of recommendations in order to find the most
useful ones  in this paper  we explore one particular instance where users can be assisted in this task 
one particular aspect that we focus on is value prediction for more specific item attributes  this is
useful for answering questions such as  how suspenseful is this recommended movie   or how
important is this research paper  
in our system  the exemplar question we try to answer is what grade will i make  for a university
course recommendation  course grades are particularly interesting because they vary by student and
when the course is taken  we use both svm and collaborative filtering based approaches to predict
student grades based on student transcript and schedule data

predicting grades

our data is drawn from the courserank website  which is a course recommendation website run at
stanford  the courserank database contains information on        anonymized student transcripts
and around       courses 
   

svm

we trained an svm to detect a versus non a grades  where doing well in a course corresponds to
receiving an a  we also trained a multi class svm to predict grades across the whole letter grade
spectrum from a  to f   one svm was trained per course 
all svms were trained using a gaussian kernel  the  and  parameters for the kernel were chosen
via a rough grid based search on


 
 
 
 
                 and   
numfeatures numfeatures numfeatures numfeatures
to maximize the    fold cross validation accuracy  the multi class svm was implemented using
multiple svms that compared grades higher than a certain threshold against the grades lower than
the threshold  that is  there is one svm that predicts each of a  vs other grades  a or above vs 
below a  a  or above vs  below a   and so on for each unique grade appearing in the course  the
final predicted grade is then decided by a majority vote among all the individual svms 
given the courserank transcript data  we chose six features that we hypothesized may affect course
grades the students previous course grades  recent gpa by department  last three quarters   major 
concurrent courses  planned weekly workload  and the number of courses previously taken 
these features provide some information on the students experience with related courses and subjects at stanford  whether the course is a requirement or an elective for their major  and how much
time they have to spend on the course  the previous course grades  recent gpa by department 
student major  and concurrent courses were represented by vectors where each index corresponded
to one course  department  or major 
   

collaborative filtering

we consider another model for estimating grades based on the same methods used in the original
recommendation system  here  we make the hypothesis that similar students will make similar
grades  thus  for a student s with course history cs and course c 
  cs   we find students si  s
with  csi  cs       and c  csi  students who have taken some of the same courses as s as well as
course c   then us grade in c can be estimated as a weighted average of the grades gsi  
to determine the relative weights of users  we used cosine similarity and pearsons correlation as
the primary two measures  other measures of similarity such as kendall  spearman  and adjusted
cosine similarity have been explored in     and      but they tend to perform similarly or worse  we
expect our choice of similarity will have little impact on the predicted grades 
for two student  sparse  vectors sa and sb with each element corresponding to the students grade
in a course  we compute the similarity using 
similarity

his or her grade is predicted to be the average course grade  the results are shown in the tables

most important features

we evaluated the contribution of each set of features by training the a vs  non a svm exclusively
on each set and comparing the    fold cross validation accuracies against the baseline statistical
accuracy  table   shows the results 
overall  the top four features in order were previous course history  recent grades by department 
students major  and concurrent courses  weekly workload did not contribute to the accuracy of any
of the selected courses  and the number of taken courses only influenced accuracy in cs    out of
the    courses tested 
however  across different courses  the features that most influenced prediction accuracy varied  for
example  in cs     all of the features except for weekly workload contributed to the prediction rate 
and the students previous course grades were the most significant predictor  on the other hand  in
artstudi    the students major was the most significant predictor  in chem  a  none of the
features contributed to the accuracy  suggesting that different factors may better characterize course
grades in this case 
   

results of collaborative filtering

for cf  we filtered data to remove all courses with fewer than   grades and all students with fewer
than   courses  resulting in       students and       courses  we tested against the entire dataset and
specific classes  for the entire dataset      of the students were randomly separated with   courses
per student removed  each student was compared with the remaining            to compute the
top n most similar students  the results are shown in table   
the primary reason the estimates from cf are not much better than the estimate based on students
gpas is that the dataset is too sparse to find similar users  upon analysis of similar users  we find
that the similarity coefficients are very small  o         we further validate this by noting that
analysis shows the error of the student gpa estimates and the cf estimates are highly correlated 
because the similarity coefficients determine the deviation of the estimate from the average  the cf
estimates generated with small similarity coefficients are very similar to the student gpa estimates 
recognizing that this user based cf approach requires more data to be effective  we experimented
with tuning various cf parameters in a non rigorous manner with minor reductions in the mae

types  the largest contributor for each course is highlighted 

 o        we tried various values of n from all students to   at logarithmic intervals and found
that smaller n tended to reduce the mae  we also looked at the similarity coefficients  as defined
in      the similarities are normalized before computing the weighted average  by increasing the
normalization coefficients  we further reduced the mae  we hypothesize that increasing the weights
favors outliers and skews the estimate away from the average  we also tried removing the influence
of negatively correlated students as both herlocker and yao indicate that this improves error  though
all these adjustments reduced the mae  none significantly improved the estimates 
for comparison with support vector machines  we ran tests on three random courses to compute
the mae for just those courses  here  for the chosen course c  we consider all students s with
c  csi i  we compare each student si with students sj   j    i by computing the similarity
sim csj   csi  c  and then using the weighted average as before to estimate si s grade in c  we used
courses with over    students to run these tests  the mae for these tests did not differ significantly

conclusion and future work

past course history can only go so far in predicting future course grades  a significant percentage of
students in many of the courses had not taken any courses previously  which may partially explain
the low accuracy of the baselines and the svms  in addition  there may be more promising features
that characterize the current quarter if course schedule data were available  such as potential schedule
and deadline conflicts between concurrent courses and student activities  although the concurrent
courses features was intended to help capture some of the effects of schedule conflict  it is flawed in
that most courses do not have a fixed schedule and instead change term by term  thus courses that
have conflicted in the past may not conflict in the future 
it is also possible that the unexpected occurrences throughout the quarter may have greater influence
on grades  for example  a student may just not have studied enough for a final exam  which heavily
influences his or her grade  individual personality factors may also play a part  where doing poorly
 

fion a similar course in the past may drive some students to work harder on a similar course in the
future 
improving the collaborative filtering results would most likely require additional data from the
courserank system  we would hope to find more similarities between students on which to base
our estimations  this may not be possible  though more grades will be added to the system each
year  the relevancy of the older grades will diminish 
an alternative approach to address data sparsity might be to broaden our initial hypothesis  we
could broaden our hypothesis that similar students will perform similarly in courses  instead  given
a student s and course c  we could try to find students that have not only taken the same courses as
s an also taken c  but who have taken similar courses to both c and courses similar to those taken
by s  jun wang  et  all have demonstrated a method similar to this that combines user based and
item based collaborative filtering to overcome sparseness     
finally  it is possible that we see poor performance because the underlying assumption that similar
students in courses from some set ca will receive similar grades in some other set cb may be false 
factors such as concurrent course workload  interest in course  different professors  and others may
instead be responsible for deviations in expected course grades  some of these external factors may
be irrelevant as our analysis of svms indicates  but others may require collection of additional data
before we can significantly improve course grade estimates
