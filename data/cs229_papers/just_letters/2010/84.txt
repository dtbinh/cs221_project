abstract
much work has been done in stock market prediction  in this project we predict a
   swing  either direction  in the next days closing price of s p     from historical
data  we implement our model with support vector machines 
we capture market sensation with three features  namely the volume  the daily momentum indicator and the chicago board options exchange market volatility index 
our model does not work well enough to be of practical use 

 

introduction

we apply machine learning algorithms to predict the magnitude of percentage swings in
standard   poors  s p      index of large publicly traded companies  historically  large
swings have occurred during periods of high volatility and unusually large trading volumes
     if the past is any guide to the future  one might reasonably hope to predict price movements in the near future based on current and past observations of market volatility and
trading volume  and hence profit from it by placing appropriate trades 
we thus have a binary classification problem  on day d  given volatility and volume data
for the past d days  including day d   will the market move by    or more  this is an
example of a supervised learning problem  we are given training examples  historical data  
and we would like to predict the next days outcome  there is a wide variety of machine
learning algorithms to tackle such tasks     and we employ a support vector machine  svm 
in this paper 
we propose to capture volatility  trading volume  and momentum with three datasets 
we will use the vix  vix  as a proxy for market volatility  daily closing volume  vol   and
the commodity research bureaus stock market momentum indicator  mi   we also have
the percentage change in the s p index for each day in this period  pc  
   volume reflects the buying and selling of shares and so is an important factor to analyze
market activity  here we scale it so it is a number between   and   

 

fi   daily momentum indicator published by the commodity research bureau  the daily
momentum indicator is quoted as a value in between   and   and analyzes the price
strength of the s p     stocks  momentum indicators generally work because empirical studies have shown that     stock return is positively autocorrelated  so its precious
path can be used to predict future returns  roughly  mi measures the moving    day
average of the proportion of stocks on the s p     that are moving up 
   chicago board options exchange market volatility index  vix 
also known as the fear index  vix is a measure of the implied volatility of s p    
index call and put options  vix reflects the market expectation of how volatile s p
    might be over the next    days  vix is quoted as a percentage  for instance  if

over the
vix is     it means that one expects s p     index to move up or down    
  
next    days 

 

data

we took vix  vol  and mi data  values at market close  for the period    jan         
nov       roughly    years   we normalized vol to lie in         simply by dividing vol
by its maximum value 
we begin by performing some exploratory data analysis  primarily to search for stable
statistical relationships between pc and each of the three datasets 

figure    histogram of pc vs vix

figure   shows the relationship between pc and vix  and was obtained with a moving
window of size d      days  in particular  vix values  x axis  for the past    days were
 

fiaveraged  and plotted against the next days pc  y axis   the colors indicate the density of
the points  if high volatility is a good predictor of large price swings  one would expect a
high density region  red  in the upper right region of the plot  but we see no such trend 

figure    histogram of pc vs vol

the same analysis on vol and mi produced figure   and figure    once again  keep
in mind that  ideally  we would like a high density region in the upper right region 

figure    histogram of pc vs mi

 

fiwe see that neither vol nor mi produce the desired trend 

 

method

we fixed p c       and performed a       split on our dataset to obtain a training set
 first      days   and test set  last      days   with historical period d       this gives
approximately     training examples  and     test examples  we performed cross validation
and the area under precision recall curves to find optimal values for our svm  which turned
out to be c                          the precision recall curve for our optimized svm is
given in figure   
figure    precision recall

next  we plotted the roc curve  each datapoint corresponds to a choice of d for the
historical period 

 

fifigure    roc curve

to decide how many days of historical data is optimal  we make use of the roc curve 
for simplicity  assume that the profit from a true positive equals the opportunity cost arising
from a false positive  we then find the portion of the roc curve that is tangent to the   
degree line  thus  we fit a quadratic polynomial to the curve  and take the datapoint that
is closest to the required tangent  this gave us d      days 

 

conclusion

with p c       d       c         and                  we obtained a precision of
        and recall of        on the test set  this is disappointing performance  and more
work needs to be done  our timescale might be too coarse  days   and one might look into
using intraday values instead  alternatively  one might construct better features
