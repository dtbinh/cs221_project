i  i ntroduction
bronchopulmonary dysplasia  bpd  is a lung disorder that
affects infants  primarily those born prematurely  defined as
the requirement for oxygen therapy for at least    postnatal
days  bpd occurs in nearly a third of infants with birth weight
under      grams      bpd is associated with far reaching
negative consequences such as further respiratory problems 
cerebral palsy  and cognitive impairment     
unfortunately  bpd is one of the most poorly understood
complications of prematurity  in particular  there is no consensus on the pathogenesis of the disease  among the commonly
hypothesized causes of bpd are ventilator induced injury  lung
immaturity  lung inflammation due to infection  and genetic
predisposition        
previous work on predicting bpd has focused primarily on
correlating eventual bpd diagnosis with laboratory measurements  medicine administrations  and mechanical ventilator
settings  such studies have consistently shown bpd to be
significantly associated with certain abnormal blood gas levels
 e g   low blood ph  as well as aggressive ventilation      
despite the abundance of studies seeking to identify factors
associated with bpd diagnosis  a large gap still exists in the
body of literature on bpd prediction  very little is known
about what characterizes the physiological signals  such as
heart rate and respiratory rate  of infants eventually diagnosed
with bpd  we believe that this area is under explored largely
because it has only recently become possible to obtain finegrained physiological time series data for hospitalized infants 
we were fortunate enough to have access to this type of
data  enabling us to conduct novel research on the relationship
between physiological signals and bpd  this endeavor was
particularly exciting due to its potential to generate important
new medical knowledge 
in our search for physiological signatures for bpd  we
focused specifically on three signals  heart rate  respiratory
rate  and oxygen saturation  we had two main reasons for
choosing these particular signals 
first  it makes sense from a biological perspective that
lung problems would manifest in these three signals  the
lungs serve to introduce oxygen from inhaled air into the
bloodstream and to release carbon dioxide from the blood
as exhaled air  therefore  we would expect infants with poor
lung function to exhibit low oxygen levels  motivating our
use of the oxygen saturation signal  and high carbon dioxide
levels  furthermore  in infants with lung problems  we would
expect to observe altered patterns in the breathing rate and
heart rate  motivating our use of the respiratory rate and heart
rate signals  as the body attempts to respond to the blood gas
imbalance by adjusting the amount of air entering and exiting
as well as the speed with which the blood is circulating 

second  these three signals are recorded noninvasively for
every infant in a neonatal intensive care unit  nicu   consequently  a predictive model for bpd based only on features
of these three signals could easily be adopted by any nicu 
this is not the case for a model with features that rely on
more invasive  expensive  or nonstandard measurements 
for these reasons  we formulated our overall goal as understanding whether and how bpd manifests in an infants
heart rate  respiratory rate  and oxygen saturation signals  the
remainder of this paper describes our efforts toward this goal 
ii  data
we had access to minute interval time series data collected
from monitoring devices attached to premature infants during
their entire stay in stanford hospitals nicu  for these infants 
we also had data on all of the clinical events  such as laboratory
tests and ventilator setting changes  that occurred during their
hospitalization 
of the infants admitted to stanfords nicu between march
     and march       we considered those satisfying the
following criteria  gestational age     weeks  birth weight
      grams  length of life     days  allowing for bpd
diagnosis   and availability of       minutes of monitor data 
of these infants  the thirty with a positive bpd diagnosis
were included in the study  as negative examples  an additional thirty seven infants were chosen at random from those
diagnosed with respiratory distress syndrome  an indicator of
breathing problems at the time of birth  but not bpd 
in this set of infants  low gestational age and low birth
weight were found to be highly predictive of bpd  with areas
under the roc curve  aucs  of      and       respectively 
for this reason  we also created an age weight matched set
of twenty infants  ten with bpd and ten controls   for which
gestational age and birth weight had much lower aucs of
     and       respectively 
iii  i nitial e xploration of f eatures
for each infant  we had a very large quantity of data  including several long physiological time series and information
on tens of thousands of diverse clinical events  as a first step 
we wanted to determine which of the many available pieces of
data would be most useful to us for predicting bpd  we drew
from the bpd literature  our discussions with stanford nicu
clinicians  and our observations from visualizing the data to
identify     potentially interesting features of the first     
minutes of data available for each infant 
around forty of these features were functions of the physiological signals  such as mean  range  standard deviation 
and amount of time below or above threshold values  sixty
more features were related to laboratory measurements  e g

of bpd in previous studies  for each type of measurement  we
included as features the first  mean  minimum  and maximum
values  the range of values  and the number of measurements
taken  given that existing work has shown aggressive ventilation to be correlated with bpd  we also included about
thirty features related to ventilator type and settings  rounding
out the set of features we considered were the numbers of
administrations of over twenty types of medicine 
to determine the predictive value of each feature  we
computed the conservative mean auc  with k      folds  as
proposed by khosla et al  in order to penalize features sensitive
to variations in sampling      the fifteen top performing
features across both the full set and the age weight matched
set are displayed in table i along with their conservative mean
aucs  we observed that these top features fell into three
categories 
 i  six of the features measured the frequency of various
clinical interventions  namely medicine administrations 
blood draws  and ventilator adjustments  ordered by
the nicu doctors  the strong performance of these
intervention frequencies as features suggests that stanford clinicians have a good sense of which infants are
at highest risk for bpd or other complications and
therefore require the most treatment and surveillance 
 ii  seven of the features were functions of measurements
other than the physiological signals  more specifically 
six were related to blood gas values and the other one
was a function of the airway resistance measurement 
which is taken only for infants on a particular type of
ventilator  interestingly  the frequency of blood draws
was generally more predictive of bpd than the actual
measurement values resulting from those draws  assuming that the nicu doctors order more blood draws for
the infants that they deem sicker  this result suggests
that the doctors assessment of an infants health status
is richer in predictive information than the blood gas
levels for that infant 
 iii  the remaining two features were functions of the respiratory rate  we were surprised to find that of the over

as described in section i  our aim in this project was to
shed light on the relationship between physiological signals
and bpd  we found in this initial exploration that most
of the highly predictive features for bpd were related not
directly to physiology but instead to intervention frequencies
and laboratory measurements  based on this result  we decided
to focus our further efforts on finding physiological proxies for
the informative interventions and measurements 

iv  m otivation for p roxy  a pproach
essentially  we decided to examine the relationship between our three physiological signals and the interventions
and measurements corresponding to the features in categories
 i  and  ii  above  more specifically  we hoped to identify
physiological signatures characterizing the time when a given
intervention is ordered  in the case of category  i   or the time
when an infant has a certain measurement value  in the case of
category  ii   our rationale was that because the intervention
frequencies and measurement values were so predictive of
bpd  good physiological proxies for them would likely be
predictive of bpd as well 
in addition to their potential value in bpd prediction 
physiological proxies for the informative features would be
useful in several other ways  in the case of category  i   we
could use physiological signatures for a given intervention
to create a tool reporting whether an infant is exhibiting
physiology which typically precedes that intervention  such
a tool would help nicu doctors decide whether and when a
certain intervention is necessary 
physiological proxies for the blood gas and resistance measurements in category  ii  would be valuable for two reasons
beyond bpd prediction  first  we could incorporate such
proxies into a tool that would let doctors noninvasively obtain
a rough estimate of blood gas levels or resistance for an infant 
this type of tool would reduce the number of invasive blood
draws performed  benefiting both the health of the infants and
the hospitals budget  second  independent of any prediction
application  an understanding of how abnormal measurements
manifest in the physiological signals of premature infants
would constitute valuable medical knowledge 
why did we believe that physiological proxies for our
predictive features would exist at all  in terms of interventions 
stanford nicu clinicians informed us that they decide what
interventions to order based partly on an infants physiological
signals  for example  doctors consider low oxygen saturation
and high respiratory rate as signs that the ventilator is not
working effectively and requires setting increases  in terms of
measurements  we expected that abnormal blood gas values
would be reflected in the physiological signals since the body
sets the heart and respiratory rates based on blood levels of
oxygen and carbon dioxide

a  data
in our first set of experiments  we considered five interventions with predictive frequencies  dextrose administrations 
istat blood gas measurements  note that istat refers to a
type of handheld blood gas meter   and increases in three types
of ventilator settings  we examined the    minute intervals of
our physiological signals preceding these interventions  the
intervals were taken from the first      minutes of monitor
data available for each of the infants in our set  as negative
examples  we wanted to find intervals during which the doctor
considered the infants state and could have ordered the
intervention but did not  for this purpose  we chose    minute
intervals preceding times when the doctor entered electronic
comments about the infant but did not order the intervention
in question during the hour before or after comment entry 
this procedure resulted in sets of                      and
    intervals for the five interventions 
in our second set of experiments  we took the    minute
intervals prior to measurements of blood ph  blood oxygen 
blood carbon dioxide  and airway resistance that occurred
during the first      minutes of monitor data for the infants in
our set  we had                and     intervals  respectively 
corresponding to these four measurements 
b  feature extraction
for each interval  we computed     features based on the
heart rate  respiratory rate  and oxygen saturation signals  we
used five different approaches to obtaining features 
 i  we computed simple functions of the signals  such as
mean  range  and variability 
 ii  we calculated time lagged correlation between each pair
of signals  we believed that correlation might be informative based on our visualization of the data  moreover 
research on other complications of prematurity shows
that sick infants often have impaired autoregulation     
leading to synchronization of physiological signals 
 iii  we used the discrete fourier transform  dft  to obtain
features capturing the frequency contents of each signal 
 iv  we applied the time series topic model  tstm  developed by saria et al       the tstm segments the
physiological signal into regions  words  generated
by the same autoregressive process  indicating similar
short term dynamics  the tstm also learns higherlevel topics corresponding to different distributions
over words  as features  we used both word and topic
frequencies obtained from the tstm 
 v  we learned a two layer belief network using the sparse
restricted boltzmann machine  rbm  algorithm proposed by lee et al        a single example consisted
of the sixty values each of heart rate  respiratory rate 
and oxygen saturation that occurred during one   minute interval  we pre processed the data by applying
pca whitening and then learned a sparse rbm model
with     hidden units  with the resulting hidden unit

probabilities  we trained a second sparse rbm layer with
    hidden units  as features for a given interval  we
used the inferred values of the second layer hidden units
resulting from feeding the intervals signals forward
through the trained model 
we normalized each feature to have mean zero and unit
standard deviation so that the weights learned by classifiers
would be meaningful in comparison to one another 
c  predicting interventions
for each of the five interventions  we trained a penalized logistic regression  plr  classifier using the algorithm proposed
by zhu and hastie       on a training set consisting of     of
the intervals  we performed five fold cross validation to select
the optimal regularization parameter  more specifically  for
each of a range of possible parameter values and for each fold 
we computed the auc of the roc curve for the classifiers
outputted probabilities  using the parameter which maximized
the conservative mean auc over the folds  we trained a plr
classifier on the entire training set and then used this classifier
to make predictions on our test set 
we repeated this procedure three times  once with all     of
our features  once with only the     rbm features  i e   those
of type  v  in section v b   and once with only the    nonrbm features  we separated the features in this way because
we were especially interested to compare the belief networks
with our other feature extraction methods in terms of how
effectively they captured the information in the physiological
signals  the resulting aucs are reported in table ii and will
be discussed in section vi 
d  predicting measurement values
we first tried linear regression to predict measurement
values but found that the amount of error was unacceptably
high for each measurement type  we instead decided to attempt
the simpler task of predicting whether the values fell above
or below a given threshold  we observed that nicu doctors
often mentally represent an infants blood gas values with
ternary  high  normal  or low  or binary  abnormal
or normal  values  thus  we reasoned that a model making
binary predictions of measurement value would be useful to
nicu doctors 
as thresholds separating low from high for blood
ph  oxygen  and carbon dioxide  we used values indicated
as clinically meaningful by stanford physicians  for airway
resistance  since such a value was not available  we took the
roc curve generated for the maximum resistance feature

from section iii and selected the threshold with the best
sensitivity and specificity  i e   the one leading to the point
on the roc curve closest to the upper left corner        
we used the same procedure described in section v c to
train plr classifiers  table iii shows the resulting auc values 
vi  r esults and d iscussion
we found that in each case but one  the non rbm classifier
outperformed its rbm counterpart  furthermore  when we
learned classifiers using the non rbm and rbm features together  we obtained aucs which were not substantially higher
than those for the non rbm classifiers  for the remainder of
this discussion  then  we focus on the non rbm classifiers 
a  predicting interventions
we found that we were unable to accurately predict whether
a given interval preceded a dextrose administration  blood gas
measurement  or ventilator rate increase  to better understand
the problems with our models  we ran the classifiers for these
three interventions on their respective training sets to compute
training aucs 
for dextrose administrations and blood gas measurements 
the training aucs were low       and       respectively   indicating that the classifiers failed to separate even the training
examples well  we believe that the most likely explanation
for this poor performance is that nicu doctors rely primarily
on factors other than the physiological signals in deciding
when to order these two interventions  indeed  one stanford
clinician informed us that he mainly orders istat blood draws
after adjusting the ventilator  and thus his choice of whether
to order the intervention at a given time does not depend
strongly on the infants physiology  in terms of dextrose
administrations  we observed that they generally occurred at
regularly spaced intervals which varied in length for different
infants  suggesting that doctors set a dextrose administration
schedule early on rather than deciding based on the past hours
physiological signals  given that the frequency of dextrose
administrations was predictive of bpd  it would be fruitful to
investigate how nicu doctors set this dextrose schedule 
on the other hand  the ventilator rate increase classifier
had a training auc        much higher than its testing auc 
thus  it appears that the classifier was overfitting  especially
given the relatively small number of examples       for this
intervention 
we were fairly successful in predicting whether an interval
preceded a ventilator setting increase or a ventilator fio 
 fraction of inspired oxygen  increase  we note that the two
classification tasks were similar  since the majority of setting

increases were fio  increases  one of our main goals in
creating these classifiers was to identify physiological signatures useful for bpd prediction  to do so  we examined
the weights that the two classifiers assigned to the features 
 recall that we had normalized feature values so that the
weights would be comparable   we found that all of the highly
weighted features for both classifiers were functions of the
oxygen saturation  os  signal  this result was not surprising
given that nicu clinicians told us that they often adjust the
ventilator in response to desaturation events  i e   periods of
low os   interestingly  the top features for both classifiers
included not only simple functions of the os signal like mean
and variability but also several features obtained from the
signals discrete fourier transform  dft   this observation
suggests that the frequency content of the os signal captures
useful information about desaturation events and therefore has
potential for bpd prediction 
b  predicting measurement values
the classifier for blood ph performed very well  the other
three classifiers were also reasonably successful in differentiating high values from low  as discussed in section iv  these
classifiers could be extremely useful in a nicu  giving doctors
noninvasive real time estimates of an infants blood gas values 
to gain insight into bpd prediction  we examined the
feature weights that our classifiers learned  one general observation was that of our nine total classifiers  eight assigned
very high weight to the mean os feature  this finding raises
the question of why the mean os feature was not among
the most predictive of bpd in our initial feature exploration 
we hypothesized that the answer was our segmentation of the
signal into intervals and that  more specifically  the distribution of mean os values over intervals captures more useful
information than the signals overall mean os  indeed  we
found that the minimum of mean os values over    minute
intervals was more predictive of bpd than either the mean or
the minimum os value over the first      minutes  this result
demonstrates the benefit of focusing on short intervals of the
physiological signals 
besides mean os  the measurement classifiers learned high
weights for other simple os features such as variability  additionally  dft based features of the signals appeared frequently
among the top features for all four classifiers  again suggesting
that the frequency contents of the physiological signals have
promise for predicting bpd 
we made two observations which were particularly interesting from a medical perspective  first  we found that the
most highly weighted feature for the resistance classifier was
a function of the heart rate  hr  signals dft  based on
the sign of the weight  periods of high airway resistance
are characterized by hr signals with more high frequency
components  this result sheds light on the effect of lung
dynamics on heart rate and  more broadly  the interrelation
between the respiratory and circulatory systems of premature
infants  our second interesting observation was that both the
blood ph and blood oxygen classifiers learned high weight

fifor the correlation between the hr and os signals  beyond
suggesting a feature for bpd prediction  this link between
high hr os alignment and low blood ph and blood oxygen
levels provides insight into an unhealthy infants ability  or
lack thereof  to autoregulate his body systems 
vii  c reating a bpd c lassifier
by examining the weights learned by our various classifiers 
we identified sixteen features as potentially useful for bpd
prediction  four simple os features  ten dft features  hr os
correlation  and mean rr  with the addition of the two
physiology based features found to be predictive of bpd in
our initial exploration  we had a set of eighteen features 
rather than classifying infants as bpd or control  we decided to create a model that would classify    minute intervals
as bpd or not  we had several reasons for making this choice 
first  we saw an example in section vi b in which focusing
on    minute intervals led to a more predictive feature for
bpd than working with the entire      minute signal at
once  second  our previous experiments were performed using
   minute intervals  so some of our features  namely those
based on the dft  applied specifically to intervals of that
length  finally  we believed that an interval classifier would
be more valuable to nicu doctors  as it would let them
obtain predictions every hour and thereby gauge changes in
an infants bpd risk over time and with different treatments 
ideally  we would train and test our bpd interval classifier
on data taken from a new set of infants  since we already
used data from our current set to create the intervention and
measurement classifiers  unfortunately  as obtaining data for
new infants requires efforts by multiple people to label and
pre process the data into usable form  we were unable to create
a new data set within the time frame of this project 
instead  we learned a bpd classifier using the same data set
from our previous experiments  we started by segmenting each
infants first      minutes of data into    minute intervals 
then  with the eighteen features described above  we trained
a plr classifier on     randomly chosen intervals  using the
bayesian information criterion to select the optimal value of
the regularization parameter  we ran the resulting classifier
on all of the remaining intervals  to obtain an overall bpd
risk score for a given infant  we computed the proportion of
that infants intervals which were classified as bpd  excluding
from the computation any intervals which were included in the
training set   these scores achieved aucs of      and     
on the full set and age weight matched set  respectively 
viii  c onclusion and f uture w ork
the final product of our project was a physiology based
bpd interval classifier which achieved strong results on our
data set  we would like to train and test this classifier on a
new and larger set of infants to verify whether accurate bpd
prediction is indeed possible with our chosen features 
in addition to developing a bpd classifier  we created nine
intervention and measurement classifiers  several of which
performed well and could be very useful in a nicu  we

also identified informative features related to signal frequency
content and hr os correlation  a valuable finding not just for
predicting bpd but also for understanding it biologically 
there are a number of directions in which we would like
to extend this work  for one  given our observation that
segmenting a signal into intervals can yield more predictive
features  we would like to repeat our experiments using
different interval lengths to determine which one is optimal 
we are also interested in further exploring the relationship
between cross signal correlation and bpd by developing more
sophisticated measures of correlation tailored to our specific
application  in terms of learning algorithms  we would like to
check whether svms can outperform our plr classifiers 
finally  we are interested in characterizing the differences
between bpd and control infants in terms of response to
interventions  particularly ventilator adjustments  our hypothesis is that interventions cause more dramatic changes in the
physiological signals of a bpd infant than a control  since
bpd infants are less able to autoregulate effectively  in a
preliminary experiment  we examined intervals extending from
   minutes before to    minutes after an intervention  using
as features the differences in simple functions of the signals
before and after the intervention  we attempted to classify the
intervals as bpd or control  our classifiers performed poorly 
so we would like to try to improve them by identifying features
that better capture response characteristics
