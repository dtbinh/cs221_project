abstractthis work presents a novel technique to perform
audience privacy protection in video lectures  the main contribution of this work is a heuristic based iterative clustering
procedure that isolates the lecturer from audience members  this
iterative process provides the labelling required to identify and
blur audience members 

i  i ntroduction
in this work we present a solution to the problem of
protecting audience privacy in video lectures  this technique
consists of first performing robust face detection and tracking 
and using this as input to an iterative clustering process that
is optimized to accurately isolate the lecturer from audience
members 
section ii provides a detailed description of the problem 
section iii provides a summary of related work  section iv
consists of an overview of the face detection  tracking  and
clustering algorithms we employ in this work  section v
outlines our proposed design  while section vi presents our
initial results  we evaluate these results in section vii and
conclude in section viii with a discussion on how to improve
our proposed design 
ii  p roblem d escription
this work is motivated by the class x system at stanford
university  class x is an online archive of video lectures of
stanford electrical engineering courses  in order to make
this valuable video archive available to the public without
restriction  it is necessary to protect the identity of any students
who may appear in the videos 
formally  this requires that all students appearing in a
given video are identified and blurred  we assume no prior
information on the identity of the lecturer  hence  the problem
requires that the lecturer be identified  isolated from student
appearances  and not be erroneously blurred 
it is also important to note that the video lecture may be
captured with either a still or moving camera  as a result  the
ideal solution should be invariant to how the input video is
captured 
iii  r elevant l iterature
a survey of the literature reveals some relevant work in the
area of privacy protection in video surveillance  much of this
work is motivated by the proliferation of video surveillance
systems  and the resulting need to protect an individuals
privacy 

while offering solutions for scenarios under which all
identified faces must be obscured  the literature does not offer
techniques that can discriminate between faces and refrain
from obscuring a particular target  e g   the lecturer  
in     wang  suwandy  and yau describe present a technique
that uses a modified adaboost face detector and kernel based
mean shift combined with active contour to track faces  this
approach is able adapt to changes in the scale of faces 
subsequently  each detected face is blurred using a  x  median
filter 
in      senior offers a set of five design principles for the
design of privacy protection systems  the most important and
practical principle for our scenario is the authors suggestion
that such systems bias towards false positives for optimal
privacy protection  the logic behind this principle is that a
single detection failure can compromise the identity of an
individual and thereby render the privacy protection scheme
useless 
iv  background
a  face detection
many algorithms cast face detection as a binary classify
problem  one technique is to is detecting faces by color 
a common ml algorithm used in this method is principal
components analysis  pca       the disadvantage of this
technique is that it is not very robust under varying lighting
conditions and that it may not work for all skin colors 
detecting faces by motion is commonly used in real time
videos  since faces are usually moving  calculating the moving
area by background subtracting will get the face segment  with
the interference of other moving objects  a face can be detected
by detecting a blinking pattern in the moving segments     
viola   jones weak classifier cascade is a breakthrough in
face detection      instead of using pixel values as features 
they use a new image representation called integral image
that allows for faster and more robust feature evaluation  to
improve performance  it selects a small number of important
features by using the adaboost procedure  finally  it uses
a cascade of successively more complex classifiers to study
on promising regions of the images  which yields significant
improvement in the speed of face detection  this technique is
now the most commonly used algorithm for face detection  it
is also implemented in opencv 

fib  tracking
background subtraction and color based filtering are two
simple approaches that may be used in face tracking  another
approach is model based face tracking  which uses a model
describing the appearance  shape and motion of faces to aid
in estimation  upon face detection  a model is laid over the
face so that the system can perform tracking 
mean shift  which shifts each data point to the average of
neighboring data points  is also a commonly used technique
in face tracking      ensemble tracking is a face tracking
algorithm based on mean shift  it uses an ensemble of weak
classifiers to create a confidence map in the new frame
according to the faces in the previous frame  and uses mean
shift to find the peak of a confidence map near the faces old
positions     

to our iterative clustering procedure  after this procedure  we
obscure all identified audience faces to produce the privacy
protected output video 
b  implementation details
we now present the detailed implementation with respect
to each stage of our technique as depicted in figure   

c  clustering
clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique  in this technique  the input is an unlabeled training set
and the objective is to produce a given number of cohesive
clusters 
one simple and popular clustering algorithm is the k means
algorithm  this algorithm is initialized  using some heuristic 
to k means  or centroids   the algorithm then assigns all input
vectors to the closest centroid and proceeds to recalculate the
means  after sufficient iterations  the centroids converge

a  design overview
as described above  our proposed system processes an
unprotected video stream in order to identify and obscure all
audience members  the high level system overview is depicted
in figure   

fig    

high level system overview 

given an unprotected input video  we iteratively perform
face detection followed by tracking  in a single pass through
the video  this set of detected and tracked faces is the input

fig    

detailed system design 

   face detection and tracking  we perform face detection using the opencv implementation of viola and jones
technique  meanwhile  tracking is performed using the mean
shift approach based on skin tone 
due to the fact that most of the false positives come from
background  it makes sense to identify some area of interest
for every frame and do a face detection only on that area 
suppose we have a frame set as background  our approach
was to locate a bounding box on current frame that identifies
the region with the greatest change from the background  the
difference between two frames is given by the absolute value
of differences in the pixel values of the frames  parameterized
by threshold   
while these are two seperate modules  they are are intricately connected  we perform face detection at a parameterized interval  subsequent to background subtraction as a preprocessing step   in order to ensure that all faces are detected 
we then track all detected faces  both forward and backwards 
we track backwards only in case the number of faces detected
on a particular instance of the face detector increases  the
faces detected from the video are grouped by the tracks that
they belong to 

fi   iterative clustering  in      huang  wang  and shao
present a promising iterative clustering scheme to seperate
different individuals into clusters  we adapt this scheme to
our scenario by postulating that the largest clusters will be the
lecturer  based on this heuristic  we are able to discriminate
between audience faces and the lecturers face  in this stage 
we consider each detected face individually for the purposes
of determining our clusters 
we assume that the professors face appears most often in
the video  so most faces detected  i e  images fed to iterative
clustering  are the professors face  using this heuristic  we
assume that when running k means  the professors faces will
always be in the larger clusters while students faces and other
noises will be in the smaller clusters  given the students faces
are in the smaller clusters  we eliminate the students faces by
iteratively running k means and excluding the smallest cluster 
the stopping criterion is a threshold parameter  in our
algorithm  this is called diff  we stop when the difference in
the mean between the two large clusters and the small cluster
is below a threshold parameter  figure   outlines this algorithm

classification  we can apply any desired technique to obscure
the audience faces 
for illustrative purposes we will apply a simple block color
replacement  in practice  this stage may be adapted based on
the level of privacy protection that is desired 
vi  r esults
in the process of developing and evaluating our technique 
we used two sample video sequences from the class x system 
we refer to them as them fb  and fb  
as a first step towards implementing our proposed design 
we simplified the problem to only operate on a still camera
video source  this allows us to to localize the region with
people by performing background subtraction 
as a preliminary step  we tried basic face detection algorithms with different thresholds against the sample video 
we used the opencv library to read the input video frame
by frame  we then perform frontal face detection on each
individual frame using the opencv implemention of the
viola jones technique  each frame is then an output video
with rectangles indicaiting faces recognized  figure   below
is a representative frame output

iterative clustering
  algorithm pseudocode 

   obscuring audience faces  the output of the previous
stage is a binary tag corresponding to whether a detected
face corresponds to audience or lecturer  based on this binary

fig    

initial face detection output is noisy 

the face detector is able to recognize faces of different
orientations up to a cetain angle  as we can conclude from
the figure above  the output contains considerable noise  this
is unacceptable  figure   demonstrates the limited ability of
the face detector to detect side faces 

fig     frontal face detection is accurate while side face detection at extreme
poses fails 

we tried two approaches for background substraction  the
first approach is to use the very first frame as the background
reference  the second approach is to update background frame
every n frames  the second approach yields much better
results  we also tried different value of n  if n is too large  we
skip a large number of frames  if n is too small  we are actually
comparing frames that are really similar to one another  figure
  is an ideal output 

fifig    

output after background subtraction to determine bounding box 

after performing face detection as described above using
background subtraction  we perform mean shift tracking both
forward and backwards over each interval  figure   is a
representative tracking sequence  the side faces present in
this output  in contrast to figure    are a result of tracking 
without tracking  such faces cannot be captured due to the face
orientation  this becomes the input to our iterative clustering
process  as described above  

fig    

output of tracker 

figure   is representative of our clustering output 

fig     

protected output for frame in fb  sequence 

we evaluate the performance with respect to precision  p 
and recall  r  statistics  we measure accuracy using the fscore  we define these measures with respect to true positives
 tp   false positives  fp   true negatives  tn   and false
negatives  fn  
tp
tp   fp
tp
r 
tp   fn
 p r
f score  
p  r
p  

it is worth noting that in this context  the recall  r  measure
is more appropriate  this is because the system performance
is ultimately dependant upon the degree of privacy protection
the technique achieves  this measure directly calculates the
fraction of audience faces blurred 
b  analysis

finally  we show the protected output for a random frame
in both the fb  and fb  sequences 

fig    

due to time constraints  we perform this detailed analysis
on the fb  sequence  in order to perform this analysis  we
first determined the ground truth for this input sequence to
the clustering process  and compare it with the output set of
the clustering stage 
we perform this analysis for frame intervals            
    for each interval  we analyze the results for the following
clustering stopping thresholds                  we summarize
the results in figure        and    

protected output for frame in fb  sequence 

vii  e valuation
a  methodology
in order to evaluate our results  we focus on optimizing
the two key parameters in our technique  the first of these is
the frame interval between successive background subtractions
and face detections  the second parameter we optimize is the
stopping threshold  diff  that we use to terminate the iterative
clustering procedure 

fig     

precision vs  threshold for varying intervals

to summarize  our best precision is with an interval of   
and a threshold of     our best recall result is with a interval

of    and threshold of     finally our best f score is with an
interval of    and a threshold of    
moreover  the general trend in all three measures is that as
the interval size increases  the performance metric decreases 
this suggests that the increased window for tracking is resulting in significant noise 
viii  c onclusion
based on the analysis above  we can conclude that the
performance of our technique is limited by the quality of the
detected set of faces  when there is minimal noise  i e   nonfaces like blackboard   we can get good recall results 
in the future  we would revisit the design of the face
detection and tracking stages  we might also investigate using
features such as the skin tone for our clustering process
