introduction
magnetic resonance imaging  mri  is one of imaging machine that has a low
throughput outcome  a single patient can take approximately    minutes to an hour of
measurement depending on the part of the body being measured  the lengthy process
bottlenecked the income generated by a single machine  and increasing discomforts for patients
as well 
there is a huge motivation to increase the throughput of mri machine output by cutting
down the number of image sample below nyquist threshold  hence dramatically decreasing the
measurement time and increasing the number of patients that can use the mri machine 
unfortunately  the reduction of number of image sampling will increase the difficulty and cost in
image reconstruction process considerably  for example  a brute force image reconstruction
could take weeks to reconstruct and image with     sampling 
compressed sensing  cs  is a recently introduced theory for the recovery of sparse
signals from limited amount of measurement data  there are many novel solutions to solve such
reconstruction  this paper will discuss the matching pursuit family technique such as matching
pursuit  orthogonal matching pursuit  regularized orthogonal matching pursuit  compressive
sampling matching pursuit and subspace pursuit in classifying the image  matching pursuit
family is a general  greedy  sparse function approximation scheme with the squared error loss 
which iteratively adds new functions  i e  basis functions  to the linear expansion  if we take as
  where is the input part of
dictionary of functions the functions     of the form  
training example  then the linear expansion has essentially the same form as support vector
machine     our goal is to use matching pursuit algorithm to determine which parts of the
pixel contains an image and which parts do not  while maintaining image quality and time cost 
we finally discuss the optimum algorithm for solving the problem 
 

problem formulation
in mri  the measurement can be represented by a linear combination of vector sets in
such that

is the measured fourier transformed signal in the k space domain 
is the target sparse reconstructed image  such that 

is the

in cs  the problem arises as we decrease the number of measurement data significantly 
such that
  therefore the dimensionality of full row rank
becomes an underdeterministic problem with multiple solutions  moreover  the solution estimation difficulty is
increasing exponentially as the dimension scale is increased  the problem is further increased by
inefficient implementation of matching pursuit family algorithm to solve larger dimension scale 

fisuch as an image  fortunately  if the signal
solution may be unique 

is sparse with k non zero feature or element  the

 

matching pursuit family algorithm
there are several matching pursuit family algorithms that will be studied here  matching
pursuit  mp       orthogonal matching pursuit  omp       regularized orthogonal matching
pursuit  romp       compressive sampling matching pursuit  cosamp      and subspace
pursuit  sp       only mp algorithm is shown 
   

matching pursuit
mallat and zhang proposed a scheme to recover a sparse signal by using a method called
matching pursuit 

where  is the approximation of after k th iteration  and is the residual and is orthogonal to
   let
be the coefficients of the k chosen vectors from normalized   let
be the k th
chosen vector  the algorithm will choose
with the largest magnitude element from the proxy
with the following 


 
 
 
we want to minimize the next residual by maximizing the proxy

inverse problem
given a dictionary and a measurement   we want to reconstruct the sparse signal  
such that it contains only k number of non zero elements  the purpose of this experiment
is to compare the accuracy of the reconstructed signal to the true solution and the run time
of each algorithms to finish the computation  furthermore  the behavior of the run time
will be used to predict the feasibility of the algorithms in large scale problem

the current algorithms implementation is still inefficient for solving the inverse problem 
as shown in the figure  as the number of dimension is increased  the running time will be
increased as well  the bottleneck of the implementation occurs at the computation of the
 
 
projection 
  at this point romp algorithm will be dropped from comparison
study 
in the next section  we will discuss a novel way to solve the bottleneck problem using
fixed point iteration called richardson iteration  which arguably faster than newtons method  to
achieve the theoretical computation cost 
 

richardson iteration
suppose we want to solve 


let



be an orthonormal tall matrix and let the linear equation be 
 
 

joining the above equations yields

richardson iteration implementation on cosamp and sp

ficompared to previous figures in section    the new implementation of cosamp and sp
with richardson iteration now scale well as the dimension of the problem becomes large 
cosamp and sp performances are also better than mp and omp performances 
 

 d fft implementation and large scale problem
at this point  we will further increase the magnitude of dimension to     by     pixels to
mimic the original mri image dimension  at this point  we will drop mp and omp from
discussion as it is shown that cosamp and sp performed better compared to mp and omp as
the dimension is increased 

 

image reconstruction comparison
we will introduce lustigs scheme     for mri image reconstruction comparison

lustigs reconstruction

fiqualitatively  all   reconstruced images are comparable  we will provide quantitative
comparison based on the peak signal to noise ratio  psnr  to compare reconstruction quality
and computation run time to compare the cost 

as the number of acceleration is increased  the reconstructed quality of cosamp is
decreasing much more than sp  it is also more costly in the experiments compared to sp  while
sp are generally perform better than lustigs scheme and cosamp 
 

conclusion
for overall  cosamp does not provide better reconstruction compared to the results from
sp  under certain conditions  sp generally provide us with better run time and accuracy
compared to the algorithms implemented by lustig and cosamp  therefore  sp is the best
choice among the studied algorithms in this project
