abstract 
this study proposes distinct new features in the pzt sensor signals to separate the effects of damage  edge
cracks  and non damage  temperature and applied loads  conditions in the metallic structures  experiments
conducted on thin rectangular aluminum specimens show that the specific combination of signal feature and
machine learning algorithm can reduce the false negatives to less than      while the false positives lie well
within      the proposed methodology is also tested for scalability by applying the learning algorithm to
different geometry and different damage type 

each smart layer has four pzt transducers 
which can act as both actuators and sensors  the
signals are generated in a pulse echo mode
where one smart layer sends the excitation
pulse while the other one records the received
waveform  the basic experimental setup for
static loading and the test coupon with attached
smart layers are shown in fig    

introduction 
active structural health monitoring  shm 
employs the concept of anomaly detection in a
structure based on the propagation of lamb waves 
these waves are generated using the principle of
piezoelectricity
by
piezoceramic
 pzt 
transducers  the pzt sensor signals  representing
the propagation of lamb waves  may undergo
change in their characteristics  phase  amplitude
or spectral content  while propagating through the
structure  these changes can either be caused by
intrinsic factors such as fatigue cracks  surface
corrosion  delaminations or extrinsic factors such
as changes in environmental temperature  changes
in loading and boundary conditions  the key
challenge in the shm is to address the problem of
false positives  wherein the system mistakenly
attributes the changes in the operational and
environmental conditions to the presence of
defects inside the material  the objective of this
study is to develop a classification model based
on the machine learning approach that can reduce
the problem of false positives and false negatives
to a considerable extent

in this study  the signals representing the
propagation of lamb waves in a structure are
generated and collected from two separate smart
layers attached on the surface of the test coupons

the data collected at elevated temperatures and
at different load levels are classified as nondamaged data whereas the rest of the signals
are considered as damaged data  the training
set has     non damaged and     damaged
signals whereas the test set has     nondamaged and     damaged signals  new and
unique features from the signal data are
identified based on the hypothesis that damaged
conditions will cause only localized changes in
the signal in time domain and vice versa for
non damaged conditions  the performance
measures for each of these features are studied
with different classification algorithms to select
only a few set of features  this subset of
features along with the best classification
algorithms are finally tested on new geometry
and new damage type for the scalability and
baseline transfer approach

domain whereas for figures  a  and  b  the changes w r t the
baseline signal can be observed in the entire time domain 

the pzt sensor signals are collected from the test
coupons at different levels of elevated
temperatures  static loads and induced damages 
the temperature data ranging from   c to   c
is collected in a controlled environmental
chamber  the static load data is collected by
loading the test coupons in mts machine and
recording the data at different load levels  the
experiments are repeated thrice for consistency in
data collection  the damage conditions are
simulated by introducing edge cracks of varying
lengths on the coupons at different locations  the
training data for the damage condition is collected
from the coupons with straight edged cracks at the
center of the specimen  the damage data
corresponding to the test set is obtained from
coupon with cracks starting at different location
and propagating along different direction as
shown in fig    

feature selection 
the following sets of features are identified
based on the aforementioned hypothesis 
feature i    ii  signal scatter amplitudes 
the feature type i and type ii consists of the
whole and sub section of scatter signals
respectively  scatter signal is the difference
between the recorded sensor signals under
different experimental conditions and the
baseline sensor signals  representing the pristine
and undamaged state of the structure 

 

fifeature type iii   iv   v   vi    vii  uniformly
discretized signal vector  the signal data is
discretized into uniformly spaced intervals  bins 
in the time domain  each bin is assigned with a
characteristic number based on the behavior of the
signal at different time intervals  feature type iii
is the norm of the scatter signal within each bin 
feature type iv is the maximum of peak to peak
amplitude difference between the sensor signals 
collected at different experimental conditions  and
the corresponding baseline signals within each bin
 shown in fig      feature type v is the maximum
phase shift between the peaks of the sensor
signals and the corresponding baseline signals
within each bin respectively 

feature type viii  singular values of stft
magnitudes time frequency matrix  the timefrequency analysis of the scatter signal for a
given actuator sensor pair is carried out using
the short time fourier transformation  it is
hypothesized that the changes in the spectral
content of the signal over the time may help in
separating out the damage characteristics hidden
in the signal from the non damage
characteristics  the spectral content of the
scatter signal  stft magnitude  is then
decomposed using singular value decomposition
 svd  to obtain its lower rank approximation 
fig    represents the percentage errors in
classifying damage data in the test set with
different number of singular values as the
classifying feature

feature type vi is the combination of feature
types iv and v whereas feature type vii is the
combination of feature type iv and average of the
phase shifts in each bin  fig    shows the effect of
changing the number of bins on the prediction of
false negatives corresponding to the test set data 
the optimal number of bins considered in this
study is    based on the sensitivity analysis 

feature type viii is the first three singular
values of the spectral content of the scatter
signal  the later singular values are relatively
smaller and hence have lower significance for
learning models as is shown in fig

fig    shows the plot of percentage errors in

algorithms used in this study are bayesian

mean and covariance for the damage and nondamage sets  and support vector machines

fichosen such that their small variation does not
affect the output of these algorithms 
 a 

however there are specific feature and
algorithm combinations where the false
negatives are at par or lower than the false
positives  the feature type v  max phase shift
    bins   shows greater accuracy in classifying
the damage vs  non damage data for all the
algorithms as compared to other features 
physically this behavior can be attributed to the
type of damage we are observing in our train
and test data  the edge cracks result in the phase
delay of the damage signals occurring only at
specific time of interest as shown in fig   c  the
effect of discretizing the time and considering
the maximum of the phase shifts in each bin as
the feature vector enhances the probability of
classifying this type of damage data 
additionally one more feature  type viii  is
identified which works well with gda  this
feature  first three singular values of stft 
achieves classification between damage and
non damage signals within an error of

can be inferred from figs    and   that the best

it can be seen from fig    that the percentage error
in classifying the non damage data  falsepositives  is within     for all the features and
for all the algorithms  the percentage errors in
classifying the damaged signals  falsenegatives  are extremely high for almost all the
features  it needs to be mentioned here that false
negatives should be as low as possible for the
practical viability of any classification algorithm

obstructing the direct path of the wave
propagation from actuators to sensors  the
prominent effect of this damage type is
reduction in signal amplitudes without having
significant contribution to the localized phase
changes in the sensor signals

conclusions 
testing scalability 
the present study identifies best feature and
learning algorithm combinations to classify the
pzt sensor signals as damaged or nondamaged for metallic structures  the damage
represented by edge cracks in metals can be
classified with very high accuracy  low test and
training
set
errors  
however
further
investigation is required to make this method
work for different type of damages 

table   summarizes the performance of best
feature and algorithm combinations for different
test cases  the study thus far has resulted in
classification models that can classify between the
damaged and non damaged signals within an error
bound of     in both the training and test set
data  the model is then tested for scalability 
wherein the signals collected on new geometry
and new damage type  as shown in fig     are
classified as either damaged or non damaged 
surprisingly the learning model b tracks both
the damaged and non damaged signals quite
accurately  the learning model a however does
not work with new damage type indicating that
this feature is sensitive to the type of damages
