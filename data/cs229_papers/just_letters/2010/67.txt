abstract
machine learning applications have been suggested for
many tasks  we have investigated the suitability of applying
machine learning to the problem of art identification  which
we believe to be a new  but promising field  our approach
focuses on classifying works of seven different artists  by
using a multi class svm with state of the art features  our
results indicate that machine learning has good potential to
classify art works  we conclude this paper by analyzing our
results

   introduction
   method
as machine learning algorithms have advanced over the
last decade there has been an increased interest in applying
them to a variety of computer vision problems  we have
identified art identification as a relevant and challenging activity that could benefit from machine learning algorithms 

the goal of this project was to classify a set of paintings 
by labeling them with a predicted artists name  this section
first describes our methodology for obtaining training and
testing data before exhibiting our selection of features and
the deployed classification algorithm 

research on automated art identification is very sparse 
and only recently has there been an increased interest in
applying machine learning to the context of paintings  in
      johnson et al      presented an algorithm for verifying the authenticity of a particular painting  by considering
very high resolution images of van gogh paintings  in
this paper  we want to examine how machine learning can
be applied to the more general problem of identifying an
artists painting  we believe that this can have interesting
applications for art historians and scientists  helping them
to understand in how far different artists works are similar 
what some objective characteristics of an artists paintings
are  and how machines might be used to authenticate
paintings 

     data collection
we focused on a set of paintings from seven different
artists  cezanne  dali  durer  monet  picasso  rembrandt
and van gogh  the main reason for choosing these artists
were due to their prolificacy as we anticipated to require a
large number of training examples for successful classification  moreover  we tried to include pairs of artists from
both similar  e g  cezanne  monet  as well as different
genres  e g  durer  dali  
to acquire the large number of data we created a script
that searches for each artists painting on google images
and downloads it  even though our initial approach was
to only include high resolution images     mp   we
quickly shifted towards data with less resolution  vga 
as we did not notice a notable decrease in the algorithms
classification rate 

in the next section we describe our approach to the problem  in particular  we outline how we obtained our data 
what features in the paintings we considered and which
classification algorithms we employed  we conclude by
presenting and analyzing the results obtained 

in total  we acquired around     images per artist  with
 

fia total of over      training examples  figure   illustrates
a small subset of images that were used for classification 

     feature selection and kernels
our initial choice for the features were the pixels of
the images and the color histograms  in particular  we
normalized each image to    x    pixels when using the
pixel features  and shrank the color space to    bit colors
to reduce the number of features when using the color
histograms  furthermore  a linear kernel was used for
training with a svm 
as we will show in the next section  the accuracy of the
basic features was not good enough  we therefore then
studied more advanced features  inspired by the work of
xiao et al  on scene categorization      the features we
considered include gist     hog x      dense sift    
lbp  local binary patterns      sparse sift histograms   
    ssim     tiny images  which is similar to the pixel
features mentioned above       line features      texton
histograms      color histograms  geometric probability
map      and geometry specific histograms      several
different kernels were used for each set of features  including a   kernel  linear kernel  histogram intersection kernel
and radial basis function kernel  the performance for different combinations of feature sets and kernels were evaluated  finally  weighted by the performance of different
feature sets  the features were combined to further improve
the accuracy 

     classification algorithm
in order to quickly implement an initial algorithm and
get a better understanding of what features were most
helpful  we initially used a naive bayes classifier to assign
predicted labels to our testing data  after an initial iteration 
we decided to use svm for classification  in particular  we
used the liblinear library       using a soft margin with
a cost parameter of   and with the kernels mentioned in the
previous section 
for both the basic features and the advanced features we
initially only considered the two class problem  i e  the task
of classifying two different artists   encouraged by the performance of the advanced features  we later also considered
the multi class problem  i e  the task of classifying paintings to one of several artists  for this case we employed a
one vs all svm  implemented by xiao et al  in     

   results
before presenting the results obtained with the advanced
features  we begin by giving the results for the initial basic
features 

figure    error rates obtained using the color histogram features
in    bit color space 

figure    error rates for the svm  using the pixel features of normalized    x    images 

     basic features
we picked several training sizes  from    up to    
images for each class  van gogh and dali   we first
used a naive bayes classifier on the color histogram
features  then switched to an svm and applied it to both
the color histogram features as well as the pixel features 
furthermore  we used    fold cross validation to calculate
the average error rate for both naive bayes and the svm 
besides training with the original    bit color pixels  we
also reduced the color space to    bits so that the feature
space be smaller 
figure   illustrates the result obtained by naive bayes
and by the svm on the color histogram features  using
   bit color space   while figure   illustrates the result
obtained for the svm on the pixel features 
the results in figure   and   demonstrate that the basic features can achieve at most around        accuracy
for a training set of     images  figure   suggests that

fifigure    the confusion matrix and the accuracy per class by training with combined weighted features for the multi class problem
with     training examples per class 

figure    classification rate for the van gogh picasso svm  for
increasing size of training data  and for different features  the
legend on the top left lists the first couple highest scoring features 

the model might be overfitted as the error rate increases for
larger training sets  implying that the number of features
might be too large and that it may be insufficient to hope
achieving higher accuracy only by increasing the size of the
training set  more advanced features should be introduced 

     advanced features
we first only considered the two class problem  the
following table lists the results we obtained using an svm
as described in the previous section  and using a weighted
combination of all advanced features that yielded the best
performance

monet dali

picasso cezanne

versus all svm for each class and let the classifier with the
highest output assign the label  figure   displays the confusion matrix and the accuracy obtained per class  while figure   presents the results for the multi class problem  once
again  the highest scoring feature was hog x  with a classification rate of around      while using a combination
of all features weighted by the performances of each set of
features resulted in an accuracy of       

   analysis
the results we obtained for both the two class and the
multi class problem are very promising  in particular  the
overall accuracy for the multi class problem with seven different artists was         which is most likely higher than
most peoples performance  moreover  it is interesting how

figure     graphically displays the result obtained for
the van gogh picasso problem  under varying training
set size and for different features  in this example  the
hog x  features gave the best performance  with a
classification rate of about     with     training images 
after training several two class svms  we decided to
approach the multi class problem  in particular  instead of
having only two classes of artists  the multi class problems
goal was to assign training images to one of seven different
classes  to solve the multi class problem we trained a one 

figure    classification rate for the multi class problem  where a
legend of the highest scoring features is shown on the top left 

fiwell the advanced features worked in the domain of art identification  while their performance for scene recognition
 the domain they were originally used for  is much lower
 around           also  the graphical representation of the
results obtained indicate that the performance is highly dependent on the number of training examples  in particular 
the graph for the multi class problem  figure    depicts a
monotonic increase in accuracy for increasing training size 
so one can hope for even higher accuracy with more than
    training images per class 

     similarity between artists

 a  hog x 

 b  ssim

 c  dense sift

 d  hog x 

 e  ssim

 f  dense sift

as pointed out in the introduction we think that the machine learning approach to art identification might be able
to capture the similarities between different artists in an objective way  to analyze this problem we set out to compute
similarities between a subset of the seven artists  in particular  we focused on cezanne  dali  monet  picasso and
van gogh and built a total of ten two class svms for all
pairs from this subset  we then used the functional margin
as the notion of similarity between two classes  where the
functional margin is defined as usual as
min y  i    t x i    b 
i

a higher functional margin implies that the two classes
are more easily separated and thus   by our definition less similar to each other than two classes with a lower
functional margin  after computing the margins for each
pair we used hierarchical clustering and depicted the result
by a dendrogram  as shown in figure   
the dendrogram arguably captures some intuitive notion
of similarity  for example  monet and cezanne   both attributed to  post  impressionism   are deemed most similar 
however  baring in mind that picasso is considered a cubist

figure    visualization of three different features on two images 
picassos for the first   figures and van goghs for the last   

painter  the close relationship between picasso and the impressionists is rather surprising 
while the validity of the distance tree might be disputable  it does reveal some interesting relationships  we
believe that it would be worthwhile spending more time analyzing these similarities 

     feature performance

figure    hierarchical clustering performed on the distance tree
obtained from all pairs svms and using the functional margin as
a measure of distance 

we think that an analysis of the performance of various
feature set is able to tell us more about the styles for
each artist  from figure    hog x      ssim     geo
texton  texton histograms for   geometric class  ground 
vertical  porous  and sky       and dense sift    have the
top performance  we first compare hog x   ssim  and
dense sift by visualizing the top     keypoints with the

fihighest histograms for each feature set  as shown in figure
   the blue arrows give the most significant keypoints for
hog x  and their orientation gradient histograms  the
blue circles illustrate the keypoints for ssim with radius
proportional the histogram  and the green blocks show the
keypoints for dense sift in which the gradient vectors are
drawn for each of the  x  grids 
in figure    it turns out that in the portrait images  fig 
  c    dense sift is not good at capturing the inside figure 
in the landscape images  figure   f   dense sift can capture trees  one of the most important elements  but not the
sun  this suggests that dense sift may be more suitable to
classify artists who have more landscape paintings  ssim
is better  although still capturing many irrelevant areas  on
the other hand  hog x  demonstrates the most balanced
keypoints on both types of images  therefore  hog x  has
the best performance  however  if an artist can be classified
more accurately with dense sift  then this might be an indication that the artist prefers landscape images to portrait
images 

   conclusion
we demonstrated a successful application of machine
learning to artist identification  by using the combination of
various computer vision features  we were able to achieve
       accuracy in identifying images from a pool of seven
artists  the results also helped us learn about the similarity
between different artists  by comparing the performance of
different features  we moreover found out that hog x  has
the best performance in general since it can capture more
balanced keypoints over the images  finally  we argued that
the performances of the different features might imply the
preferences and styles of the artists
