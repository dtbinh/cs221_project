fiber reinforced composites have been widely
used in aerospace applications due to their functional properties such as high strength to weight
ratios  but many challenges are yet to be overcome in order to have more condence on the performance of composites structures  particularly 
composites have dierent failures types and modes
that make the damage prediction and propagation
a very challenging subject  the current work will
focus on developing structural health monitoring
 shm  techniques for inspection to reduce maintenance costs and increase aircraft safety by understanding and identifying damage types  the steps
in implementing a successful structural health
monitoring system are to     locate damage    
identify damage type     quantify damage and   
estimate remaining life  stanfords structures and
composites lab has developed structural health
monitoring techniques based on ultrasonic lamb
wave     propagation via the use of piezoelectric
sensor networks  using the sensor network in its active sensing mode  damage in a composite structure
can be monitored  but the current state of the art
detection methods can only detect changes in sensor signal but do not distinguish among damage
types or quantify the damage  knowing the type
of damage and quantifying it would provide the inputs needed for physics based prognostic models
 lifetime estimation  which would predict the remaining life of the structure for its safe use 

paths correspond to dierent combinations of the
  signal generating sensor and the   signal receiving sensors attached to the composite structure 
can be processed using dierent signal processing
techniques and dierent features parameters can
be extracted in the time and frequency domain 
the objectives of the current work are     to nd
which features are more sensitive to dierent damage types  delamination or matrix micro cracks 
and    to learn the relationship between these features and matrix micro crack density  we will compare dierent learning algorithms as well as dierent combinations of features  to nd the features
and algorithm that yield the best results

across which the signal can be measured 

the svm classication was implemented using the
sv m light source package provided by thorsten
joachims      it implements a fast optimization
algorithm to solve both the classication and regression problem  the software supports various
other features and the details can be found on
 http   svmlight joachims org   we patched the
source code writtein in c language with matlab
using the matlab mex interface to sv m light
provided by anton schwaighofer      this provided
us the seamless capability to perfom the svmclassication on our data set from matlab user
interface  the classication was performed using a
linear kernel  polynomial and sigmoid tanh kernels 
the test error measured by          hold out
validation using the linear kernel was found to be
the least 

non dimensionalized with the corresponding values
of the baseline signal  dierent learning algorithms
were employed to learn on the training data  and
their performance was measured on the test data 

classification algorithms
five dierent algorithm in supervised and unsupervised category were used and their performance
measured on the data set  they are described as
follows

unsupervised learning algorithms

mixture of gaussians

logistic regression

to test the performance of unsupervised learning
algorithm on our data set  we implemented the mixture of gaussian method to classify our examples 
to test the performance of unsupervised learning algorithm on our data set  we implemented the
mixture of gaussians method to classify our examples  to t mixture of two gaussian distributions 
a matlab function gmdistribution in statistics
toolbox was used  gmdistribution gives us the
model parameters  j   j and j for j        once
we have model parameters  probabilities of latent
parameter z for a given feature vector can be computed using the following relation 

first model we implemented was logistic regression 
as described in the lecture notes     with learning

test the performance of the algorithm  in which the
data set s was randomly split into strain      of
the data  and scv  the remaining      
naive bayes
the naive bayes algorithm was implemented using
the discretized set of features  the feature is discretized into     bins  the choice based on fig

maximization of recall  in shm  missed alarms are
more important than false alarms 
feature selection
table   gives the test error for ten best combinations
of feature set for all the algorithms considered 
the features set consists of continuous real number
valued variables  to discretize the feature set the
interval of variation of each feature was divided into
equal bins of dierent sizes 
conclusions and future work
we started out with a train data set containing
  features  hold out cross validation         was the present study focuses on applying machine

study will help us in    identifying the set of fea  extracted using time domain and frequency domain
tures that yield the least test error and    it would analysis  the study had two stages  we rst imhelp in identifying other features which would be plemented the algorithms with a   feature set  the
more informational for the classication problem test and training errors were very close  indicatat hand  table   gives the test error  i e  estimate ing that there could be high bias in the models 
of generalization error  for ten best combinations this suggested using a higher dimensional feature
of feature set for the four supervised learning algo  set  three new features were added and the alrithms 
gorithms were tested for the     dierent possible
using the results from the above feature selection combinations of features  the addition of new feastudy we conducted a physics based analysis of the tures improved the performance of the algorithms
problem and introduced three additional features from approximately      test error to      test erinto the input variable  the added set of features ror  gaussian discriminant analysis with dierent
is listed in table    hence increasing the size of the covariance matrices yielded the least error of     
feature vector to nine 
  and maximum recall  gda assumes that the
the correlation of the individual features to de  data is normally distributed  since it had the best
lamination is measured  mutual information was performance it can be concluded that the data is
scored based on kulleback liebler divergence  the normally distributed with respect to damage types 
mutual information scores for the nine features for the best feature combinations consisted of both
dierent bin numbers is shown in fig     prelimi  time domain and frequency domain features which
nary physics based studies on this data concluded indicates that for a successful classication both
that time of flight  x    should be highly corre  time domain and frequency domain analysis must
lated to delamination  with this background infor  be considered  in this study the experimental data
mation in hand  a bin size of     bins was selected for three dierent layups was merged into one set
because it produces the highest mutual information of data  therefore ignoring lamb wave propagation
score for x   
sensitivity to laminate conguration  in the future
to assess the algorithms  the error that they yield when more data is acquired for each separate layup 
on the test data set is measured while using the the classication algorithms could be implemented
whole set of   features  the resulting training and to each layup separately  this will reduce variabiltest errors are shown in fig     with the added ity in the data compared to this study  and lower
features  there are             dierent combina  classication errors  better performance  would be
tions of the features  fig    shows the test error expected  this work has proved that classication
obtained for the     dierent combinations for each algorithms can distinguish between delamination
of the algorithms being considered  table   gives and matrix cracks  with this information in hand
