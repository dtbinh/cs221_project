abstract
classification of splice junctions is a critical component in the identification of new rna isoforms in genetic
annotations  current high throughput experimental techniques are unable to reliably identify splice junctions
with high confidence  we propose to use a support vector machine  svm  based model to improve the
specificity of such experiments  compared to existing schemes  our model performs competitively despite its
simplicity  various parameters such as the length of the sequence feature vector and the distance between
nucleotides were tuned to optimal values  overall  it was shown that the svm is a capable tool for identification
of splice junctions based on their contextual genomic signals 
  introduction
proteins are an important class of molecules in living organisms and are a part of almost all biochemical
processes  a central part in the production of proteins within a cell is the formation of messenger ribonucleic
acid  mrna  from the deoxyribonucleic acid  dna  sequence  formation and regulation of mrna is not a well
understood process  hence  we aim to apply machine learning techniques to model the splicing step of the
process  a brief overview of splicing and why it is possible to model is given below 
in the formation of a protein  dna first transcribes to pre mrna  which is essentially the same sequence as the
original dna segment  next  a number of post processing steps are applied to the pre mrna by various
enzymes and complexes to form the final mrna  the mrna is then transported to the cytoplasm and
translated to a protein  one of the most important steps in the post processing is known as rna splicing  in
this step  large parts of the pre mrna are removed by a specialized complex called the spliceosome  these
removed segments are known as introns and the remaining segments are called exons  only exons can
potentially code for a protein as they are not removed  the location of the removal is known as a splice
junction  a splice junction in mammals usually begins with gt and ends with ag  for practical reasons  we only
consider splice sites with this highly conserved gt ag sequence 

figure     splice junction illustration
in this project  the contextual dna sequence around each splice junction  apart from the gt ag  is used to
learn whether a given splice junction is real or not  we initially considered many of algorithms presented in
class  however  we eventually settled on an svm due to its simple implementation and high classification
accuracy  section   will discuss why the identification of splice junctions is an important and interesting
problem 
there is a long history of splice junction identification models  a prominent one is genscan  burge and
karlin        which used a maximal dependence decomposition  mdd  model to build a tree of the most
page  

fiinformative features  yeo  yeo        generalized this to a maximum entropy model  later there were several
attempts to use svms  baten              and neural networks  wang        to classify splice sites  currently
we are comparing our model with yeos model as that is the most popular model 
  motivation
a key aspect in the splicing process is that introns are much longer than exons  average   k vs    
nucleotides   hence  the spliceosome must be able to recognise the precise junction locations from a
comparatively long sequence  the precise location is important as a single base shift would change the entire
protein structure  this suggests that there is a strong genomic signal near the splice junctions  apart from the
gt ag  that defines its location  the genomic signal is also confirmed by much experimental and biological
evidence 
traditionally  the detection of splice junctions from dna sequence was used as a part of gene finding models
 burge and karlin        with the recent advances of high throughput sequencing  there is great interest in
high throughput sequencing of rna  known as rna seq   one issue with the rna seq protocol is that the
reads generated are fairly short and frequently cannot be aligned reliably to the genome as a split read  as a
result  it is hard to reliably call junctions by simply aligning rna seq reads to the genome  we would like to use
machine learning combined with the contextual sequences to improve the reliability of rna seq alignments 
  method
rna seq reads from a wild type mouse cerebrum are aligned to the genome with splicemap  au       
junctions with more than three non redundant reads are labelled as true junctions  positive examples   this
has been experimentally shown to be a good criteria in the paper  negative examples are generated from other
sequences which contain gt ag and are near the true junction  these sequences are the most likely to be
mistaken as a splice site  the eventual goal is to apply this model to the junctions with less than or equal to
three non redundant reads in order to improve specificity of the overall alignment 
contextual sequences extracted from the   donor  and   acceptor  sites of the splice junctions are used as
features  for each end  we varied the length from the exon and the intron  with the canonical gt ag sequence
excluded  in order to determine the optimal sequence length for identifying splice sites  see figure   below for
illustration 

figure     contextual sequences
in addition to looking at the   and   sequences individually  we also concatenated the   and   sequences that
correspond to the same splice site  further  we fixed the exon length at both ends to its optimal value and
tuned the intron length to optimize the combined sequence length 
each of the four nucleotides a  c  t and g was represented by real vectors  a            c            t
   and        g   respectively  that is  each l nt training example is converted to a length  l real vector so
that it can be directly inputted into a standard svm package  assuming equal distances  a   c   t   g  
   yields acceptable results  however  it was found that altering the nucleotide vectors slightly improved
accuracy 
we initially trained an svm model using the liblinear library  http   www csie ntu edu tw  cjlin liblinear   
liblinear implements an svm with a linear kernel  which allows for fast training on large data sets  we set
liblinear to solve support vector classification with l  regularized logistic regression  we further trained an
svm model with a gaussian kernel by using the libsvm library  http   www csie ntu edu tw  cjlin libsvm    the
page  

fitraining time of the gaussian kernel on    k examples takes about    minutes  compared to    seconds on
the linear kernel 
in order to assess significance of appending paired donor and acceptor sites  we compared the roc curve
generated from training with appended sequences from the same splice sites versus random permuted
pairings of    donor  and    acceptor  sequences 
  results
using data from gene yeos paper  yeo         we compared our algorithm to a linear svm and their model 
our algorithm appears to perform very similarly to their maximum entropy model  mem  algorithm with the  prime data and is competitive with the   prime data  figure

the rest of our results used the rna seq data from the previously mentioned wild type mouse cerebrum 
simple cross validation with     training and     test is used to evaluate the models performance 

figure     pairing of donor and acceptor sites
in figure    we see that appending sequences from the donor and acceptor of the same splice site tells us
slightly more information than if the two sites were randomly paired

figure       and   feature length versus accuracy
based on our results learning from   and   separately  figure     we concluded that including   bp from the  
exon and   bp from the   exon should provide adequate information  in figure    we concatenated the   and
  sites  the   intron was set to a fixed length  as the length of the   intron was varied  as shown in figure   
accuracy increased as the length of the   intron increased  however  little improvement was observed after
including    bp from the   intron  the different curves in figure   corresponds to a different length of the  
intron  we also observed increased accuracy with increases in the length of the   intron  an acceptable
outcome was observed after inclusion of    bp from the   intron 

figure     concatenated sequence accuracy
the distance between nucleotides is not expected to be symmetric since g c bonds are slightly stronger than
a t bonds  however  it is not clear how this would should relate to the nucleotide vectors  hence  we
systematically tried some combinations nucleotide vectors  shown in figure    the alternative nucleotide
vectors provide better classification performance

  conclusion
overall  an svm model was implemented for classification of splice junctions  it has been shown to perform
competitively compared to current models  the pairing of   and   sites was shown to provide additional
information for classification  the optimal feature length for classification was examined  finally  a non uniform
distance between nucleotides was demonstrated to improve classification accuracy  this model will be used as
part of the pipeline to improve specificity of split read alignments
