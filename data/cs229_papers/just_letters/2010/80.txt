learning the genetic causes for schizophrenia through copy number variations
xin gao  shan liu

   introduction
schizophrenia is a mental disorder that causes lifelong disability  the most common
symptoms are auditory hallucinations  paranoia  and delusions  at least    of americans have
this illness      factors that cause schizophrenia are both genetic and non genetic  research has
shown that gene plays a significant role in schizophrenia through studies on twins  however  the
genetic aberrations associated with schizophrenia have been hard to pin down  a large number
of genome scan projects have reported linkage in three chromosomal regions  but none of these
regions has produced strong support for linkage in the majority of the projects      unlike some
diseases that can be caused by a single defective gene such as huntingtons disease 
schizophrenia is much more complex and elusive        
instead of a single disease causing gene  research has shown promises in dna copy number
variation  cnv   the old belief was that a person has two copies of each gene in a genome  one
from the father and one from the mother   however  recent discoveries revealed that large
segments of dna can vary in copy number  i e  some people are missing a genedeletion  and
some have three or more copiesduplication   scientists believe dna copy number may be a
common underlying factor in genetic disease       

   objective
to evaluate dna copy number variations in schizophrenia patients to look for insights into
genetic risk factors for this disease 

   preprocessing of data
we worked on a database which consists of       cases of schizophrenia patients and      
controls        in total   each with copy number intensity measured by affymetrix technology
using         probes for each person on    chromosomes  each probe is identified with a
unique index number that is matched to a unique chromosome location  the data contains all the
cnv information for each person identified by these probes  locations where the cn is other
than    
due to the potential inaccuracy of copy number measurement  we first ignored the reported
variations when the length of the region is smaller than   probes  then we combined some
adjacent variations into one larger variation region if those adjacent variations are really close to
each other  such that the normal region in between can be treated as the inaccuracy of

 

fimeasurement  we labeled normal copy number     as    duplication    or    as    and deletion   
or    as    
in matlab  we designed a feature matrix x as a       by         sparse matrix with each
column containing the copy number variation label       or     at each probe position from   to
         we also made a vector y of       dimensions with   indicating for case and   for
control 

   result
    nave bayes

first  we implemented the nave bayes classifier on a modified data set  this problem is
similar to a spam filter in text classification  we modified the input data in the following way 
the input xijs are discrete valued  if a patient i has cnv in the jth position probe  we set xij     
otherwise xij     i       m        j      n           the yis are binary indicator for case or
control  we assumed the cnvs are conditionally independent given case or control  this
assumption resolved the scarcity of training data problem  since the dimension of our feature is
much greater than the number of data  n    m   we implemented nave bayes using laplace
smoothing and    fold cross validation  the estimated generalization error  averaged over     is
        the averaged accuracy is         we identified the top     probe locations that may be
particularly indicative of a patient having schizophrenia in chromosome            and     these
locations are listed by their ranking order in table

    support vector machine

second  we ran liblinear svm on the processed data as described above  and used   fold cross validation  the averaged accuracy on cross validation is         which is very high
and slightly better than the nave bayes method  by plotting the magnitude of model
parameter
  we have figure   below  the locations that correspond to the largest positive
magnitudes of w are on chromosome        and    the locations that correspond to the largest
negative magnitudes are around positions of chromosome     the positive magnitudes show that
copy number duplication    or    around the region tends to cause schizophrenia  and negative

 

fimagnitudes show that copy number deletion    or    around the region tends to have similar
effects 
we can also observe that there are several vertical lines of blue dots in some regions  which
may indicate that many probes around the region are redundant in predicting schizophrenia

fi    principal component analysis

the input feature  probe locations  has more than         dimensions  we examined how
well the data can be represented using a reduced number of dimensions by applying principal
component analysis  first we plotted the data mapped onto the two most significant principal
component space  the result showed a large overlap between the cases and controls and they
cannot be separated at all

we then tried to compress the data using additional principal components vectors  and then
run svm on the data with reduced dimensions  the accuracy of the svm for     principal
components vectors is        this result showed the case and control cannot be separated using
a small number of principal components  which implied that the most significant variances
between the data do not come from the differences between case and control  in another words 
the positions of copy number variation that most likely causing schizophrenia would only cause
a tiny portion of all the variations between people  the copy number values that cause the most
significant variations between people may come from their racial and demographic differences 

   discussion
we evaluated dna copy number variations in a schizophrenia patient database to look for
insights into genetic risk factors for this disease using supervised machine learning methods  in
particular nave bayes and support vector machine  we identified two regions on chromosome
               to              and chromosome               to             with cnv that
are most likely to be associated with schizophrenia 
our training errors from both nave bayes and svm are low  which relieved some of our
initial concerns on the assumption of cnv being conditionally independent given case or control 
given the large input feature set        by           we found most of the locations with cnv

 

fiare irrelevant to the disease  the small numbers of dna specimens  which may not be enough
for our high dimensional feature was resolved 
besides trying to accurately predict whether a person has schizophrenia by applying a
machine learning algorithm on his her cnv information  it is more meaningful to understand
which positions on the dna actually cause the schizophrenia  using nave bayes and svm  we
identified some of the most significant chromosome locations in prediction  to check for internal
validity of the study  we investigated the differences in the identified cnv locations between the
two methods  the results showed concordance in the top regions being locations on chromosome
   and    svm is able to identify more diverse locations than nave bayes  which is not
surprising due to the extra information on duplication or deletion utilized in svm  but lacked in
nave bayes  to check for external validity of the study  we compared our results with literature
in the field         at least one genome wide association study of schizophrenia indentified two
locations on chromosome         we could not check whether the exact locations matched our
results due to different labeling method in the paper  the next step is to seek help from a genetics
expert to interpret our findings 
one major limitation of our study is generalizability of the results  the excellent testing
accuracy from our study may not achieve the same prediction power when applied to other data
sets  there are many potential confounders such as characteristics of the case and control in this
study and the testing environment  we could not guarantee generalizability until testing our
prediction algorithm on a new data set
