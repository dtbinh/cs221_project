   introduction  
fragile  x  and  turners  syndrome  are  genetic  disorders  that  affect  a  persons  
development  and  cause  changes  in  brain  structure   though  both  of  them  affect  the  x  
chromosomes   turners  syndrome  is  common  only  among  girls   we  are  using  data  from  the  
center  for  integrated  brain  sciences  research   cibsr   covering  brain  images   behavioral  scores  
and  demographics   the  brain  imaging  data  have  been  preprocessed  using  freesurfer   a  
software  toolkit  that  uses  mri  data  to  reproduce  the  brains  cortical  surface     machine  learning  
techniques  have  been  applied  to  raw  data  with  varying  degrees  of  success   but  this  is  the  first  
time  they  are  being  used  on  freesurfer  data  for  these  diseases   

   problem  statement  
a  typical  question  is  what  brain  structure  changes  characterize  the  different  
populations   the  problem  is  complicated  by  the  fact  that  brain  structure  size  depends  on  head  
size   and  also  normally  changes  during  childhood  and  adolescence   the  brain  region  results  
were  computed  with  freesurfer   and  the  datasets  include  many  more  individual  brain  regions  
than  have  yet  been  studied   
among  the  datasets  are      subjects  scanned  at  two  time  points   thus  longitudinal  
growth  changes  can  be  measured  in  these  subjects   not  much  is  known  yet  about  how  
longitudinal  changes  in  brain  structure  may  correlate  with  changes  in  behavioral  
measurements     
  

in  this  project  we  tried  to  answer  the  following  questions   

   can  we  tell  a  turners  subject  from  control  and  a  fragile  x  patient  from  control   
   can  we  separate  fragile  x  and  control  subjects   girls  only   from  one  another  and  from  
controls     
   can  we  classify  a  particular  subject  as  having  fragile  x   turners  or  other  developmental  
delay  or  a  healthy  control   

fi   general  approach  
we  used  svm  based  algorithms   primarily  those  found  in  the  liblinear  and  libsvm  
library   the  algorithms  included  l  regularized  l  loss  svm   l  regularized  l  loss  svm   l  
regularized  l  loss  svm  and  l  regularized  logistic  regression  and  gaussian  kernel  svm   for  
multivariate  classification   we  used  the  multiclass  option  in  liblinear  and  the  gaussian kernel  
multi class  classification  algorithm  from  libsvm   
  

   turners  syndrome  classification  
the  turners  dataset  contained      data  points  after  cleaning  the  missing  data   each  data  
point  had       features   we  ran  rankfeatures  using  kl  divergence   tsanalysis   written  by  paul  
mazaika  from  cibsr   and  l   regularized  svm  to  come  up  with       most  relevant  features   we  
used  these  features  to  run  a  backward  search  on  the  dataset  to  get  the  best  set  of  features  on  
the  basis  of  minimum  generalization  error   similarly   we  ran  a  forward  search  on  the  dataset  
using  the  complete  set  of         features   to  compute  the  generalization  error   we  ran    fold  
cross validation  a  thousand  times  in  order  to  deal  with  noise

   fragile  x  classification  

the  fragile  x  dataset  contained       data  points       from  time  point     and      from  time  
point      we  only  ran  our  algorithms  on  time  point     data   each  data  point  had       features        
of  which  were  common  with  turners  syndrome   we  used  these       features  to  run  backward  
and  forward  searches   we  came  up  with  the  following  best  set  of  features  on  the  basis  of  the  
generalization  error   here  also   we  ran    fold  cross  validation        times  using  the  best  set  of  
features  and  plotted  the  learning  curves  as  shown  in  figure

   fragile  x  vs  turners  
we  used  the  data  points  involving  girls  only  to  see  if  we  could  do  multiclass  classification  
on  fragile  x   turners  and  controls   the  generalization  error  rates  we  got  were           forward  
search  and           backward  search  when  using    fold  cross  validation  with        repetitions   
when  using  the  libsvm  gaussian  kernel  for  multiclass  we  managed  get  generalization  errors  of  
         for  backward  search  and           for  forward  search  using    fold  cross validation  with  
    repetitions   

fi   further  work  
we  could  try  to  regress  out  the  intra cranial  volume   icv   and or  the  age  to  cut  down  
variance   analyzing  the  residuals  of  the  features  between  the  two  time  points  would  probably  
give  us  some  insight  into  changes  in  behavior   we  could  also  try  using  some  unsupervised  
learning  algorithms  to  check  what  structure  the  data  has
