short term electricity demand forecasting using independent component analysis
jeff chern  matthew ho  edwin tay
introduction
utilities providers like pacific gas   electric  pg e  have a vested interest in being able to effectively
forecast electricity demand  this allows the utility to manage the supply side of the electricity wholesale market
more efficiently  as well as influence the demand side using dynamic pricing schemes 
load forecasting is usually done at the aggregate level  however  with more and more households installing
smart meters  and with that  an increase in the availability of data   being able to forecast at the individual
customer level is becoming of interest as well 
we worked from a data set containing usage history for    high income customers from a           study
performed by the california energy commission 
our goal was to investigate the use of ica  independent component analysis  for time series forecasting 
particularly on this data set  we compare those results with results from arima  a standard algorithm for
conducting load forecasting 
multiplicative seasonal arima model
there is a variety of univariate methods that can be applied to online time series analysis  in particular  one
method that has been popular for use in predicting short term electricity load  and appears in many papers as a
benchmark approach  is multiplicative seasonal arima modeling    
the multiplicative seasonal arima model  for a series xt  with one seasonal pattern can be written as
 

   



  

   



 

 



  



 

  and is the number of periods in a seasonal cycle  the model is
where is the lag operator  
often expressed as
 
   
    it is multiplicative in the sense that the amplitude of the
seasonal adjustment is proportional to the amplitude of the actual series  as compared to additive seasonal
adjustment which is independent of the amplitude of the actual series  
independent component analysis
independent component analysis  ica  is a statistical method used to find a linear representation of nongaussian data so that the components are as independent as possible  such a representation would then capture
only the essential structure of the data in these independent components    
we conjecture that there is a common set of activities amongst all the customers that will be reflected to various
degrees in the usage patterns of each of the individual customers 
the purpose of ica will then be to discover these underlying components 

fimethodology
preprocessing
the data was presented to us in a mysql database  we wrote scripts to organize and import the data into
matlab for further analysis 
some customers had associated metadata about their geographic region  so we hand selected    customers from
the bay area that had sufficient overlapping date ranges  we chose a single   week slice from all of these
customers  as the existing literature and our observations showed that weekend behaviors differed significantly
from that of weekdays  we chose to focus on only the weekdays  monday through friday  for our predictions 
finally  the original data was presented to us at a granularity of    data points a day  corresponding to   
minute time intervals  we modified this to    minute time intervals to improve running time 
error metric
 

 

 

 

in load forecasting  the utility company is interested in the peak demand so that it can anticipate the actual
infrastructure needed  which is why we have included the max ape as a metric as well 
sarima
by examining the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots of customer electricity usage  we tried out
several different values for the parameters  p d q  x  p d q  as shown in figure

figure    mean and maximum absolute percentage error for different combinations of arima parameters 
other combinations of  p d q  x  p d q   e g          x             and         x              resulted in failure to fit
the parameters in the sarima training phase for customer      moreover  these stability and convergence
issues were even more severe for the other customers  which constrained us to use arima        x           
and arima        x            for the rest of our predictions 
ica
we treat the electricity usage series of each customer as an observation  and run ica to obtain the time series
for each independent component  we then attempt to predict the next days usage pattern of each component
using sarima  and combine the components to give each customers usage pattern for the next day using the
mixing matrix  this algorithm based off popescu    

fialgorithm 
for each sliding window of   days  
   arrange the customer data as follows 

 

   run ica on

and the components

to obtain a mixing matrix

 

   predict  next day  on the components  via sarima  to obtain

   use the mixing matrix

 

 

 

 

to obtain the predictions in the original domain  compute

where n     is the number of customers and m     is the number of components we chose

fifigure   shows the ape distribution across forecasted days for each customer  errors were computed for both
the sarima and ica forecasting approaches and are displayed in pairs for each customer  we see that in
general  the ica ape is higher  but with a lower spread than the sarima apes  however  for customers
whose usage patterns are more erratic  customers      and       ica appears to provide more reliable results 
figure   shows plots of the forecasts for each day for customer       chosen as ica forecasts seem the most
reasonable  in general  neither sarima or ica tracks the peaks well  although sarima seems to do a slightly
better job 
conclusion
overall  performing ica on the time series for each consumer and predicting on the resulting components
resulted in poorer forecasts than predicting on the original time series 
we think these are some contributing factors 
   the data used for ica was too short  only   weeks   this might have resulted in longer term trends not
showing up 
   we did not include external influences likely to have an impact on the electricity usage  e g  weather and
income levels 
   we did not vary the sarima seasonality to account for the particular periodicity of an ica component 
although applying ica did not result in better forecasts in general  the fact that it better handles more erratic
customers suggests that if the three factors listed above were addressed  ica could be useful as a preprocessing
