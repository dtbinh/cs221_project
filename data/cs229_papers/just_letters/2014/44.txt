abstract

keystroke dynamics based authentication
 kda  related work was also conducted for mobile phones  most of this research was based on
decreasing errors for user authentication and they
were conducted on handheld phones which didnt
provide sensor information 

we aim to predict individuals age  gender
and number of fingers they used to type based on
their typing on mobile phones  although similar
work has been done predict a users information 
it has been based on either content of the text or
typing style on keyboards instead of analyzing the
users movement patterns  we created our own
dataset by building an ios application we called
typeguess  which allowed us to collect data in person  we then generated    features to observe  we
did feature analysis for each classifier and followed
it with model selection  finally we were able to
select top features and the best working models for
classifying age  gender and number of fingers used
to type  best results achieved were respectively
                    on balanced accuracy 

 

different from the previous work on kda
our project was focused on predicting actual information about the users based on the keystroke
dynamics and phone sensor information  with our
project typeguess we aim to predict individuals
typing style  number of fingers   age and gender as
they type 

 
 

introduction

dataset

background
   

personal identifiers are a subset of of information that alone or combined with certain information can identify a unique individual  most of
the current pids are either biometric such as fingerprint or based on assigned numbers such as ssn  a
promising area of research is discovering human behavior that can be used for personal identification
such as stepping behavior  the use of technology
is starting be tested as a personal identifier as well 
the field looking into computer keyboard usage is
keystroke dynamics 
keystroke dynamics use manner and
rhythm which individuals types on keyboards as
personal identifier  most of this research was based
on static keyboards and used keyboard strokes 
duration and latency as features 

data collection

we created a mobile application to collect
the data  the application presents three paragraphs and we ask the user to type the text on
the screen as fast and as accurate as possible into
the input box  over the term of this quarter we
have collected data in person using our mobile data
collector application  the data collection is done in
person using iphone s as our data collection device 
we decided that we should keep the type of collection device constant and we shouldnt use a device
that certain users would be over adapted to  so we
decide to use iphone   we stored keystroke data
with additional accelerometer and gyro vectors  we
also gathered subjects following personal information  phone size  use of autocorrect  age  gender

we used balanced accuracy as our standard
to choose the best features  this is because since
after collecting a data point  it is sent to our our data was skewed  more young than old  more
python server where we store it for analysis  the two fingers than one finger   simply computing the
data was stored in json format  and passed in to total accuracy gave us misleading results 
a python program which extracts the features to a
feature matrix for each subject

data processing

   

generating features

we currently have    different features 
these features can be categorized under   main different groups  time  content accuracy  key presses 
special keys  accelerometer and gyroscope  we selected top   features for each of our classifiers and
used those for model selection  we tried to run
pca but it didnt really help to our app besides
better visuals for graphing  selecting best features
we ran each of them one by one with all possible
models  below you can find top features for each
classifier with the balanced accuracy they returned
when the models were run only with the selected
feature  we ran all features alone using     left out
cv with   different classifiers  we selected the top
  for each 

we collected age  gender  number of fingers
used  regular phone used  size of phone  autocorrect  and mother tongue as possible predictable values  later we decided the concentrate only on age 
gender and number of fingers used 
thinking about different possible features we
can extract from key logs and some online research
based on other studies we came up with    different
features to used  these features include 
 speed based features such as total completion
time  average time between keys
 accuracy based features such as total keys
pressed  number of backspaces used  edit distance to original text

number of thumbs turned out to be the easiest value to predict correctly  it is also highly correlated with age  older people tend to use   finger
more often than younger people   this also explains why average time is up there as a top feature  the most useful feature for this prediction
turned out to be fastest time between keys  this is
the average of the top    fastest key press combinations  it is likely that when typing with one finger  it is difficult to type two keys simultaneously
at a fast speed  while it is easy and more common
while typing with two fingers  also we found that
the gyroscope data was different for one finger typists  our suspicion is that holding the phone with
one hand leads to different holding angles  and thus
these features were useful 

   

finally  predicting age was our top priority
for this project  we expected that older people
would take a significantly longer time to type in
the text  our results confirmed this  as the top four
features are related to typing speed  with just average time between keys  and shift time  time taken
to press shift   we were able to capture most of the
observable differences between the age classes  and
achieve acceptable high accuracy scores 
we decided to classify ages between two
groups  older and younger than     in order to
pick this threshold we took into account both the
accuracies of each model with different age thresholds  furthermore  we also tried to balance it by
trying to keep the groups  older and younger than
    with similar number of training examples

model selection

for selecting optimal models  we ran each
model in the following list with our top features
for each classifier  interestingly enough  our three
different y variables were each predicted best with
a different model 
these are the ones we tested 
 kmeans with   clusters
 quadratic discriminant analysis
 linear discriminant analysis
 decision tree classifier  depth of  
 k nearest neighbors classifier
 edit distance user input  shown text        

 support vector machine classifiers  with several kernels 

 gyrometer x coordinates       

 gaussian naive bayes

 number of backspaces       

 logistic regression

 total keys pressed       

in the next table you can see the scores we
got from each model  these scores were obtained
by running the models with the best parameters we
could find  and using the top five features for each
y  as you can see  each prediction was optimized
with a different model

qda
    
    
    
feature here was edit distance  the number of modlda
    
    
    
ifications to the persons input required for it to be
svc  quadr      
    
    
equal to the prompt text   it turns out that males
tend to make more mistakes while typing  or they
simply make less backspaces to correct input  an      unsupervised learning
other useful feature was the x direction gyroscope
although all our data was labelled  we
reading  according to our findings  females tend to
hold the phone at a slightly higher angle  it could thought we might attempt to run some unsuperbe related to the persons height  or maybe the way vised learning algorithms on our dataset  specifiin which the male pose tends to differ from the fe  cally  we ran k means clustering and affinity prop 

fi 

agation  k means clustering with   clusters resulted in satisfactory results  around      accuracy
for predicting age and      accuracy for predicting
number of fingers  although we could get some use
from these results  they were inferior to most of the
supervised algorithms that we ran  affinity propagation  like several other clustering algorithms  is
meant for finding many more than two clusters  so
it was not fit for our two bucket classification problem  the results we managed to get here were unsatisfactory  so we stuck with our best supervised
models

after selecting most of our features and just
before implementing model selection we wanted to
check the effect of pca so we also ran many models
with pca as well  though the difference in accuracy was negligible  for some models pca had a
small positive effect  while for others it had a small
negative effect  as we talked in class pca is much
suitable for visualization or optimization in large
datasets  we also attempted using adaboost  but
this didnt really improve our performace either

conclusion and future work

overall  our work indicates that it is possible
to predict a persons information based on mobile
typing dynamics  we believe that our current work
can serve as a stepping stone 
we believe that keystroke dynamics combined with sensor information has potential to predict significant amount of personal information  in
order to move this research forward there is a huge
need for more data  the data needs to be more
diverse and more detailed  currently we have typing info of less than three minutes  this can be
significantly expanded by logging keystrokes during daily uses  additionally its possible to extract
even more features using latent feature models  a
different approach to this problem might be using
deep learning if high amounts of user data is acquired
