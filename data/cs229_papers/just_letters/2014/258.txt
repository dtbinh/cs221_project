permeability prediction of   d binary segmented images using neural networks
nattavadee srisutthiyakorn
abstract    d digital rock image have recently
become an important piece of information about
the hydrocarbon reservoir properties  the goal of
this project is to explore and employ machine
learning as a tool to better understand the   d
digital rocks from geometric measurement and
features extracted from the image 
introduction
this project applies machine learning to   d binary
segmented images of the fontainebleau and berea
sandstone  with the intention of finding a robust
alternative way to estimate transport properties
such as permeability  the permeability is one of the
key to understand the nature of hydrocarbon
reservoir and estimate its production capability 
conventionally  permeability is obtained from
laboratory measurement of a rock core  which can
take up to months to be completed 
recent technology in high resolution x ray
tomography have led to the increase in digital rock
database    d binary segmentation is applied after
scanning  for single phase fluid flow  the latticeboltzmann method is the established method for
solving absolute permeability  the latticeboltzmann method approximates the navier stokes
equations at the pore scale  the calculation can be
computationally expensive for large digital rock
images  the calculation assumes no flow boundary
conditions  and that the permeability depends only
on pore geometry  in our calculations  the pressure

gradient is only along the x axis so that      the
lattice boltzmann is implemented in c   that is
wrapped in matlab with the inputs being the   d or
  d images and the size of the voxel  the lattice
boltzmann flow simulation has been demonstrated
to be a robust method for flow simulation in complex
structures by comparison with laboratory
measurement  kheem        
on the other hand  geometric measurements
and   d   d patterns are computationally
inexpensive even at the larger scale  and it can
provide insight about the structure of the pores and
perhaps how the structure relates to the flow
properties  in this project  machine learning is
applied to understand the relationship between
geometry and extracted features of rock images to
permeability  in the hope to improve accuracy and

reduce computational

data includes   d binary segmented images    
images of size    voxels from fontainebleau
sandstone and      images of size     voxels from
berea sandstone  from the digital rock physics
benchmarks paper  figure     numerical simulation
of lattice boltzmann permeability of each image was
computed to be used as the target in supervised
learning  raw inputs are binary segmented   d
images where at each voxel  the value   represents
solid and   represents pore  each type of feature is
extracted from   multi scales   a  original images   b 
 x upscaled images  figure     and  c    x upscaled
images  the upscaling is done by averaging the value
in each voxel in specified ranges  then  if the average
is higher than the specified threshold for pore  the
value of new pixel is assigned to be pore  upscaling
ensures that the convolution of the   d and   d
patterns are also from global scale

sandstone  right   the white color represents grains and black

three types of features are 
    minkowski functionals
minkowski functionals encompass standard
geometric measurements for a binary segmentation
image  for d dimensional space  there are d  
associated minkowski measurements  vogel

      d pattern distribution
  d pattern distribution can be derived from the
convolution between the pattern and the image  for
  d  patterns derived from the cross shape template
as in figure   has been employed  there are  
adjacent pixels to the center in order to form the
template  thus  there are         combinations of
pattern  figure     after convolution  the number of
times that the pattern appears in the image can be
obtained directly by counting the pixel that has the
value equals to the number of pixels in the pattern
 figure     if inputs are from   multi scales  original 
 x upscale    x upscale  then the total number of  d pattern is           features 

into      d images and the pattern distribution can
be added from every   d images to form the pattern
distribution 
      d pattern distribution
for   d pattern  there are   adjacent pixels to
the center of the   d the cross shape template 
resulting in         combinations of pattern  if inputs
are from   multi scales then the total number of   d
pattern

methodology
data is divided into       ratio for training  testing
and validation set  for   groups of data  if one group
is selected to be the test set and the rest to be
training sets  then the calculation is only   fold  yet 
in multilayer neural network validation set is
required to stop the training early  in order to
prevent over fitting  hence  there are the total   fold combination of cross validation  figure     after
   fold calculation  the mean square error are
calculated from the average of    cases  for each
type of model  i have varied the number of nodes
          and hidden layers    to    
randomly assign data to five groups

in the image

  x  x   pixels  then the   d images can be sliced

    multilayer neural network  mnn 
multilayer neural network with feed forward and
multilayer neural network with back propagation 
bayesian regularization are employed in this study
to estimate the permeability  there are four steps for
neural network design      create a network     
configure the network      train the network  and    
validate the network  there are a few concerns in
network configuration such as how to divide data for
training  testing  and validating the network  or what
would be an appropriate number of nodes in a
hidden layer  these questions are vital for deriving
and
constructing
a
better
network 

fifor network construction  tan sigmoid function  
  tanh x   and positive linear function  or rectified
linear   a   max   x   are tested in the hidden layers 
and a linear function is used in the output layers  the
number of nodes and the number of hidden layers
are tested to obtain the optimal network structure
using the feed forward neural net  training is
performed through feed forward and through backpropagation with bayesian regularization using
gradient descent algorithm  bayesian regularization
can be used to help achieve the goal of improved
generalization  this can be accomplished by
modifying the previous performance function by
adding another term that includes the mean of the
sum of squares of the network weights and biases 
levenberg marquardt algorithm is the combination
of gauss newton and steepest descent algorithm 
the combination prevents the case that the hessian
matrix is not invertible  if       levenbergmarquardt is equivalent to gauss newton and if    
  the equation approaches steepest descent 

the performance can be regularized to prevent over
fitting as followed
         





  

  

 
 
             



with this performance function  it is possible to
minimize both mean square errors and mean square
weights  the function therefore forces the network
to have a smaller weight and bias  leading to
smoother output

the table   and   summarize the case with the best
test performance  mean square error for feedforward and regularized mean square error for
bayesian regularization  for each model 
figure   shows both training and test mse for each
model and for different network architecture from
the feed forward neural net  where x axis represents
the number of nodes           and y axis represents
the number of hidden layer  there is no unique
network architecture for digital rock images as
different type of feature has different optimum
neurons and hidden layers  although there is not a
unique answer  there are two observable trends
from the feed forward test mse      cnns with multiscale favor larger network with more number node
nodes in hidden layers and     mnn and   d cnn
with only original images favor small and simple
network  this may be due to the number of features
supplied to the network is small 
cnn with   d convolution with multi scale
 original   x upscale    x upscale  shows the best
testing result overall from both feed forward and
bayesian regularization  the highest test mse is from
minkowski functional at original scale is as expected
since it only contains   features 
the regression plots between the predicted data
and target of features are shown in figure    the
prediction is generally in agreement with the target
permeability

discussion
obtaining features in multi scale helps improve the
fit tremendously  this may be due to features from
larger scale help the network to capture global
structure of the   d   d images  the convolution in
larger scale gives better understanding of how the
pore space connects in larger scale 
this study shows that   d cnn performs better
than
geometric
measurement
 minkowski
functionals   as the cost of acquiring   d digital
images is lower than that of   d images    d cnn
then offers a good alternative when it is not possible
to obtain the   d images for predicting the
permeability 
the test mse is as good as the train mse in
bayesian
regularization
because
of
the
generalization  in some cases  the test mse is lower
and this may indicate that the network is overly
smooth or underfit 
as seen from the number of iterations  multilayer
neural network with bayesian regularization takes
longer time to train than the feed forward network
so this may not be practical to use when there is a
need to quickly approximate the permeability  in the
future  i plan to test the network architecture on
bayesian regularization network to see whether the
optimum network architecture  number of nodes
and number of hidden layers  matches that of feedforward network or not 

using positive linear function  or rectified linear  in
transfer function helps improving the fit in bayesian
regularization compared to the tan sigmoid 
conclusion
the result of using machine learning to predict
permeability is promising  especially for the case of
  d cnn in multi scale  pixel based convolution
helps linking between   d structures of rock to   d
properties of permeability  this property will be
useful for when only   d data of the rock can be
obtained  in the future  i aim to expand the work to
cover other lithologies such as shale and carbonate 
there is also the need to optimize the network
further to get faster and reliable computation
