   introduction
the smart grid will be the power grid of the future  it will offer a two way communication flow  between consumers and
providers  to ensure energy is distributed in the most efficient way  with the advance of the internet and technology in
general  we have the ability to improve the traditional power grid and turn it into an intelligent  automated and distributed
energy delivery network that will be able to assess the state of the grid in real time and adopt an appropriate mode of
operation      a key component of an efficient smart grid operation will be the accurate prediction of future supply and
demand trends  interest in developing accurate prediction models for energy demand has increased in recent years 
demand forecasting can be subdivided into three approaches  averaging models  statistical models and artificial
intelligence models  averaging models are simple models based on computing linear combinations of averages from similar
days  these models are usually used by utilities and independent service operators  isos   statistical models use
regression analysis and time series analysis  artificial intelligence  ai  models use techniques such as artificial neural
networks  pattern matching  expert systems  etc         effective and accurate prediction of energy demand is vital for the
efficient and proper operation of the smart grid  the main goal of this project is to attempt to improve the current energy
demand predicting techniques used by iso new england  iso ne  by exploring various statistical and ai models 
    data and preprocessing
the data used for this project is publicly available from the independent system operator for new england  iso ne       the
selected dataset contains information pertaining to energy demand and pricing for the years      and      for the boston
area  the original dataset consists of    columns  for the purpose of the project  only the data pertaining to energy demand
is used and the rest   which is related to pricing  is removed  in addition  the column representing time in the format
month day year  is removed and replaced with two new columns  one for the month     january        december   and
one for the day of week     monday      sunday    the assumption is that energy usage will vary from month to month and
also throughout the week  also  energy usage throughout the year will exhibit different patterns based on the season  to
account for this behavior an additional column is added representing the season      winter     spring    summer    fall  
based on recent weather patterns in new england  the winter season is modeled to start in january and end in march and
the fall season to start in october and end in december   the final format of the data consists of   columns and       rows 
table   shows a breakdown of the available columns 
table    explanation of columns in the data set

to get some intuition about the data  the actual energy demand is plotted as a time series for the whole year  figure

the energy demand seems to suddenly drop to   at t       the rest of the data for that particular point turns out to be
also    this is the only missing data in the dataset and the value for that point is generated by calculating the average for  
points before that particular value and   points after the value  figure    shows the resulting time series

the same process is applied to the data for the year      
ii  method
   features selection
initially only four features are selected  month  day of week  hour and dew point  for particular models the season feature
is added to evaluate its effect on the performance of the model  the target variable is the actual energy demand at a given
point in time  the day ahead demand  refer to table   for definition  is used to compare the models generated in this
project to the model used by iso ne 
   model evaluation
the dataset is split in two  data containing      observations for      and data containing      observations for      
the data from      is used to train and evaluate the various models using    fold cross validation  the models are scored
based on average percentage error calculated by expressing the test error as a percentage of the actual value and
calculating the average error across all    folds 
the model in each group that scores the highest is then trained on all the data from      and applied to the data for     
to test how the model performs on a large and unseen dataset  training on data from      and testing it on      might
sound backwards  but it shouldnt matter when it comes to evaluating models 
   models and model selection
three main groups of models are evaluated against the iso ne model  linear regression  linear regression with additive
constant for each season  weighted linear regression and feed forward neural networks  nn  

fi    linear regression
seven linear regression models were evaluated on the      dataset  the models are listed below starting with the simplest
model that also has the worst performance  figure   shows the comparison between the performances of the different
models  none of the models outperform the iso ne model  m  is the best performing model among the group but also the
most complex and runs the risk of over fitting  m  is simpler and its performance is lagging by less than a percent         
m  is chosen as the best performing model from the linear regression group

    linear regression with additive constant for each season
in this test  the same seven linear regression models are used except now a constant is added to each model to account for
the difference in season  figure   shows the performance of each model  the added constant does not improve the
performance of the high performing models m   m  and m  but it improves the performance of the rest of the models 
m   m  by around     this model also does not perform better than the existing iso ne model

fi    weighted linear regression
next  locally weighted linear regression  lwr  is applied to the      dataset  the equation used is listed in

figure    average cross validation error for lwr with different values for the bandwidth parameter
the performance of the lwr model comes close to the performance of the iso ne model but it still does not surpass it 
    feedforward neural network
in the final test  a feedforward neural network  fnn  is applied to the data  different numbers of hidden layers are used to
select the best performing model  as the number of hidden layers increases  the accuracy of the model improves  also as
the number of hidden layers increases  the training takes longer and the risk of overfitting increases  a fnn with     hidden
layers is chosen as the best performing model in this group  the fnn models also has an error rate close to the error rate of
the iso ne model but it does not outperform it

table    comparison between the models that performed the best in each group
based on the evaluation method used in this project  the best performing model across each group is locally weighted
linear regression with bandwidth parameter        the algorithm has the best accuracy performance but since it is a nonparametric learning algorithm  it runs very slow on large datasets

table    comparison between the models that performed the best when tested on new data
when the models were run on the new and unseen      dataset  lwr again had the best performance  it didnt
outperform the original iso ne model but its accuracy is only       below the iso ne model 
iii  conclusion and future work
in this project  the performance of four groups of models is evaluated against the current model iso ne uses to predict the
energy demand for boston area  none of the algorithms explored in this project outperformed the existing iso ne model
but locally weighted linear regression comes close  forwardfeed neural network model with     hidden layers has the
second best performance 
in the future  more features should be added to try and improve the performance of the models  features that should be
looked into are daily temperature averages  also non linear regression models should be explored
