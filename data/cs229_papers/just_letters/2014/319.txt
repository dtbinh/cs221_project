deciphering   why   different   sequences   are  
preferred   under   different   contexts   is  
critical   to   understanding   how   nearby  
genes   are   regulated   so   precisely    here   i  
investigate   this   question   using   two  
perspectives       first    i   ask   if   there   are  
sequence   features   that   are   predictive   of  
different   contexts       using   a   logistic  
regression   model   to   identify   sequence  
preferences   when   met    is   recruited   to  
sequences   with   cbf    and   met      three  
factor  model   compared  to  when  just  cbf   
is   present    two   factor   model     i   confirmed  
a   previous   observation   that   the   presence  
of   an   aat   motif   that   is   predictive   of   the  
three   factor   model       using   this   aat   motif  
to   label   three   factor   binding   sites    i   tried  
to   identify   other   features   that   were  
predictive   of   this   motif   within   their  
genomic   context    such   as   distance   to  
other   proteins   binding   dna    distance   to  
nearest  gene   etc      here   i   look   at   different  
methods   to   predict   sequence   preferences  
between   two   contexts   with   the   broad   goal  
of   understanding   how   cofactors   affect   the  
binding   preferences   of   a   protein       i   go  
further   by   identifying   other   features   that  
are   predictive   of   this   three factor   model  
within  its  genomic  context       
  
    introduction  
transcription   factors    or   dna   binding  
proteins    regulate   genes   by   binding  
regulatory   elements   to   turn   genes   on   or  
off       understanding   why   a   transcription  
factor   gets   recruited   to   a   regulatory  
sequence   can   help   elucidate   how   genes  
are   regulated   so   precisely       delving  
deeper   into   how   the   genome   regulates  
this   process   in   a   spatiotemporal   fashion  
can   shed   insights   into   key   moments   in  

  

development   as   well   as   how   cellular  
processes  become  dysfunctional       
  
to   understand   this   problem    i   have  
chosen   a   simple    well studied   example     
met    is   a   protein   that   activates  
transcription   of   genes   involved   in   the  
sulfuric  
metabolic  
network  
in  
saccharomyces  cerevisiae       met    lacks   the  
ability   to   bind   dna   directly       it   is  
recruited   to   dna   through   cofactors    cbf    
and  met   met     that  target  its  binding  
to   the   correct   locations   on   dna       a   third  
cofactor       met      stabilizes   this   complex  
of  proteins            
  
my   first   goal   is   to   investigate   the  
sequence   specificity   of   met    recruitment  
in  the  presence  of  two  or  three  cofactors         
  
figure   a  and   b     here  are  illustrations  
of   two   factor   and   three   factor   models   of  
cbf    binding   dna          cbf    binds   dna   and  
recruits   met    and   met         met     acts   to  
stabilize  the  complexs  interactions     
  

  
    two  factor       
three  factor  
  
  
understanding  the  sequence  specificity  of  
met    recruitment   using   experimental  
assays   can   add   to   our   knowledge   of   the  
sequence   binding   preferences   of   this  
factor   within   its   genomic   context       the  
presence   of   other   factors   binding   nearby  
and  the  distance  to  the  nearest  gene  could  
help   predict   the   functional   importance   of  
a   cbf    binding   site       this   led   me   to   my  
second  goal  where  i  attempted  to    
  
    data  acquisition  
i   two  factor  or  three  factor  model    
to   answer   this   first   question    i   found  
published   experimental   data   that  
measures   the   recruitment   of   met    to  
       dna   sequences         bps   long    that

by   testing   the   binding   affinity   of

preferences   for   different   complexes

     models  and  metrics  
to   answer   my   first   question   discerning  
cbf s   sequence   preferences   between   the  
three   or   two   factor   model    i   asked   which  
nucleotides   in   which   positions   found  
within   a   sequence   are   most   predictive   of  
sequences  favoring  the  three  factor  model  
using   a   logistic   regression   model   with   an

a   gt   in   positions           in   the   three  
factor   model       in   addition    an   aat   motif  
in   positions         is   more   prevalent   in   the  
three   factor   model   and   has   been  
experimentally   shown   to   affect   cbf s  
recruitment  of  met   to  dna          
  
using  the  fact  that  aat  appears  predictive  
of   models   requiring   more   specificity    we  
can   label   cbf    sites   found   in   the   yeast  
genome   as   either   being   three   factor  
binding   sites   or   not       here   i   assume   that  
sites   containing   the   aat   motif   are  
indicative   of   sites   that   are   more  
functional   than   sites   that   lack   that   motif       
i   assume   this   because   sites   that   show  
more   sequence   specificity   might   be   more  
functionally   important   in   regulating  
particular   sets   of   genes   at   precise  
timepoints

    discussion    
identifying   rules   as   to   why   proteins  
prefer  to  bind  certain  sites  under  varying  
conditions   can   help   identify   how   genes  

  

are   regulated       this   valuable   information  
can  then  be  used  to  understand  how  cells  
regulate   genes   during   development   and  
how   regulation   of   these   genes   can   be  
disrupted  during  illness  or  disease       
  
trying  
to  
distinguish  
sequence  
preferences  between  two  contexts  is  not  a  
novel   idea       there   are   a   variety   of   tools  
that   attempt   to   accomplish   this   goal             
however    many   of   these   tools   struggle   to  
to   distinguish   subtle   differences   between  
the   same   protein   binding   under   slightly  
different  conditions       
  
here   i   attempted   to   implement   my   own  
models   to   distinguish   between   the  
binding   preferences   of   cbf    with   differing  
cofactors  present       this  dataset  provided  
an   opportunity   to   detect   subtle   binding  
site   preferences   between   the   two  
contexts     identifying  the  aat  motif  that  
has  been  shown  to  be  present  in  the  three  
factor   model   in   previous   literature        
indicated   that   straightforward   logistic  
regression   could   pick   up   these  
differences       one   interesting   result   was  
that   the   svm   model   mean   cv   score  
seemed   unaffected   by   increasing   training  
example   size       this   could   be   due   to   the  
fact  that  the  data  is  easily  separable  even  
with   smaller   training   sizes       one   thing   to  
note   is   that   the   models   treat   these  
nucleotide   positions   independently       it  
might   be   worthwhile   to   throw   in   terms  
that   incorporate   dependency   between  
adjacent   nucleotides       however    doing   so  
might  lead  to  over fitting       
  
attempting   to   understand   how   other  
genomic   features   could   predict   the  
presence  of  this  aat  motif  proved  to  be  
less  fruitful     the  fact  that  the  labels  were  
unbalanced    more   negatives   than  
positives    likely   made   this   problem  
harder          in   addition    cbf    sites   within  
their  genomic  contexts  are  more  likely  to  
be   false   positives    not   real   cbf    binding  
sites    and   this   increases   the   noisiness   of  
the  dataset

    conclusion  
using   logistic   regression   and   svm    i   was  
able   to   identify   sequence   preferences  
when   met    is   recruited   to   sequences   with  
cbf    and   met      three   factor   model   
compared   to   when   just   cbf    is   present  
 two   factor   model        more   specifically    i  
identified   the   presence   of   an   aat   motif  
that   was   predictive   of   the   three   factor  
model  
that  
has  
been  
shown  
experimentally  imporatant        using  this  
aat   motif   to   label   three factor   binding  
sites   within   the   genome    i   hoped   to  
identify   features   that   were   predictive   of  
this   motif   but   was   unsuccessful   in   this  
pursuit     
  
    future  directions  
future   models   attempting   to   distinguish  
cbf    binding   preferences   may   consider  
the   dependency   between   adjacent  
nucleotides       in   attempting   to   identify  
functional   three   factor   cbf    binding   sites  
within   their   genomic   context    i   could  
spend   more   time   refining   the   features  
before   including   them   in   the   model       for  
example    i   could   alter   the   false   positive  
rate   when   calling   cbf    or   met     binding  
sites       in   addition    i   could   include   the  
expression  magnitude  of  the  nearest  gene  
as   a   feature       most   importantly    i   will  
switch  to  a  metric  that  handles  classes  of
