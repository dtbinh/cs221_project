abstractin this paper  we explore the potential for
simple statistical techniques in predicting music as a computer algorithm listens to music  we reduce a collection of
midi files to a progression of note pitches and intensities
on a single octave and run k means clustering on the
results  we then track statistical patterns in transitions
between clusters to begin to build a model that attempts
to predict the next cluster given all musical information
before a point in time  we find that sequence matching
works better than an svm for predicting the next notes 
this is likely because the svm model is highly local to the
given point in time  future work on this topic should take
account of instrument data and make a more naturally
global prediction model

b  our work
early on in our research  we realized that there
are several genres of music that do not rely on the
western musical structure of chords  for instance 
instead of chords  classical indian music uses a
movable seven note scale called ragas which differs
from the scale system used in western music  we
wanted our system to be comprehensive enough to
be able to map all genres of music regardless of the
scale system 
as a result  we chose to apply a form of unsui  i ntroduction
pervised learning to break the music down into its
a  motivation
defining motifs  in the case of western music  these
usic is a fascinating art form  it is defined motifs would be chords  we then wanted to predict
as the ordering of tones or sounds in succes  transitions between those motifs  we decided to use
sion  in combination  and in temporal relationships k means clustering to find the motifs of the music
to produce a composition having unity and continu  and then apply the svm algorithm to predict the
next motif 
ity 
if we break down this definition  we find that
music is understood as a pattern or progression c  literature review
time series analysis and prediction is the target
of sounds that sound harmonious when played
together  many of these patterns are ubiquitous of significant research effort  although music predicthroughout contemporary western music as chord tion and generation is relatively less well studied

b  supervised learning

the classification problem then becomes the following  given the labels of the previous five bars
seen  what is the label of the next bar  we chose to
perform the classification using a multiclass svm 
and we compared this method to an ad hoc sequence
matching technique as well as a simple method
which makes predictions by repeating the label of
the current bar 
iii  m odels
alternatively  another model that we chose to employ was a markov model which predicted the label
we modeled the problem in two parts  the first is  cluster  of the next bar  given the current bar  the
an unsupervised clustering problem  and the second algorithm estimated the probability of transitioning
is a supervised classification problem 
from one cluster to another empirically  given all of
the transitions that it had seen so far  this model
saw limited success and we did not follow up on it 
a  unsupervised learning
we used a collection of    pop songs scraped
from midiworld com  originally performed by the
artists green day  taylor swift  the beatles and
the foo fighters  the midi format essentially provides the start and stop times of various instruments
and their volumes 

we extracted musical bars of equal width from all
of the songs in our corpus of midi files  each bar
was represented as a    dimensional feature vector
where each element represented the presence of the
corresponding note  we clustered all of these bar
vectors using the k means algorithm  this process
served to label each bar with a general notion of a
motif  we then used these cluster numbers as the
labels for our classification problem 
in our analysis of the model  we found that the
optimal bar width is most likely to be four beats 
this result follows from the assumption that we are
training the algorithm on pop songs  which most
likely have a    time signature 
to select the best value of k  we ran k means
multiple times with different values of k and then
graphed the average silhouette value for each value
of k  we then selected the value of k that resulted in
the highest average silhouette value  the silhouette
value for a given data point is a representation of
how well the clustering algorithm performed with
respect to that point  we can find the silhouette value
for any point by using

c  features and preprocessing
to perform clustering  we parsed the midi files
into time segments of equal size  four beats per
bar  to make the information more manageable  we
discarded information regarding choice of instrument and the notes octave in order to focus on
pitch and chord  because there are    notes in an
octave  including sharps and flats  this normalization
produced    dimensional vectors representing the
intensity of each chord  these sequences of   dimensional vectors were later used throughoutout
the project 
for the classification part of the project  we
needed to classify the previous five bars of music 
this data was a k         dimensional binary
vector  each of the five groups of   dimensions
represented the label of one of the previous five bars

our experiments with our models show that support vector machines fed the previous   clusters do
not seem to do significantly better than a baseline
model in which after any given time we predict
that the next cluster will be the same as the current
one  sequence matching  in other words  seeking
the longest sequence of previously heard clusters

that matches the current cluster  seems to have a
slight predictive edge over always predicting the
same cluster as the previous one 
there are various factors that may be limiting
the quality of the predictions  one factor is that
clusters may not land in zones that have emotional
meaning  for instance  given that we were testing on
pop music  we could have employed some simple
assumptions about what chords had significance in
pop music to select good clusters in advance 
however  since the intention for our model was to be
culturally agnostic we let the clusters arise in a to

incorporating instrument use  i e  timbre  may yield
more interesting results 
the relative success of sequence matching approaches also suggests that a greater integration of
search like algorithmic approaches with our conventional statistics based approach may be useful  in
particular  examining our decomposition of a song
as seen in figure    it is visually obvious that there
are highly repetitive sequences of notes  rather than
repeated sequences of clusters  an approach that
decomposes a midi file into repeated motifs in a
pre processing step may have greater success and
more explicit predictive power 
vi  c onclusion

confusion matrix for the sequence matching algorithm 

in our explorations  the most effective method for
predicting the next cluster that music will lie in is to
use sequence matching  which outperforms predicting no change as well as the multiclass svm  our
sequence matching algorithm outperformed more
naive predictions by a small margin  suggesting that
there is more to be desired in feature extraction  it
remains to be seen what the clusters found actually
mean  the framework for analysis of midi files that
we employ here is quite customizable  moreover 
it seems to be a ripe area to employ prediction
algorithms  in contrast with full mp  files  analysis
of midi files gives us direct access to the discrete
notes of the songs and allows for relatively easy
integration of more complex pre processing procedures

tally unsupervised manner  perhaps the assumption
that there exist universal clusters is too reductive  it
may that be the most optimal choice is a somewhat
more complex model in which we find important
clusters in various well known genres of music and
identify the genre before we predict the cluster 
it may also be possible that our feature mapping
loses too much information of human significance 
for instance  our model has no access to information about instrument use  and cannot distinguish
between  say  a flute solo and a bass backing 

we have found an effective technique to try and
predict motifs and motif progression  however there
is still a lot of work that can be done to try and
expand on what we have already found  firstly we
make an assumption that the tempo of the song
is constant and that the key signature of the song
is always      however  there are still examples of
songs that do not follow the classic common time
signature  and for several songs  the tempo of the
song may change as the song is played  we could try
to use additional supervised learning techniques to
model these assumptions to account for the different
types of music  another area we can try to improve
in is the off beat notes that often appear before
the beginning of the first complete bar of the song 
these off beats occur in many songs as they build

fistanford university   cs   

up to the official beginning of the song  again
we could use a supervised learning algorithm to
try and predict the first beat of the song and then
use that to generate our bars  also  as discussed
in the discussion section  we realized that  due to
the high percentage of recurring motifs  the learning
algorithms learnt to generally select the same motif
for the next progression  to account for this  we
could use regularization to decrease the effect of
the recurring motifs on the trainer
