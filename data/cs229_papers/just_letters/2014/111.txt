introduction

dental caries  or tooth decay cavity  is a dental disease caused by bacterial infection  of people
from different age groups  preschooler children requires more attention since caries has become
the most common chronic childhood diseases  more importantly  a skewed distribution of the
diseases has been observed in europe  us and singapore among the children or preschoolers 
which indicate a small portion of the population endures a big portion of caries incidences 
therefore  there is still the need to improve on the current caries control to identify the high risk
individuals and prevent resurgence in children in developed countries like singapore  our project
will study on the data such as questionnaire responses  oral examination and biological tests of
certain preschoolers from singapore and use suitable learning methods to predict whether they
have carries now and whether they are likely to get dental caries in the future 
the final target of this project is to give a reasonable prediction on preschoolers dental caries rate
based on the chosen statistical learning model and to reduce the feature space in order to improve
the utility of the models in the clinic context

in the data file provided by prof hsu  there are in total      children entries  rows  and   
features  columns   the features is summarized in the following table

table    summary of the input and outcome variables
the questionnaire includes information from demographic background  socioeconomic status  oral
health history  fluoride applications  utilization of dental care services  systemic diseases and
regular medication  and parents attitude towards caries  clinical examination and biologic tests
were administered to collect data on several clinical and biologic risk factors such as plaque
amount  baseline caries existence  saliva flow rate  saliva buffering capacity  level of lactobacilli
 lb   level of mutans  ms   and plaque ph 
in general  the questionnaire requires least amount of monetary input  the biologic tests incur the
most cost and prolonged period of data collection  the oral examination lies in between

some attributes of the collected data are missing because of the missing fields in the collected
questionnaires  in final project  we simply remove the entries with empty data 

  

model

we construct the learning models based on   types of data space  prediction  full blown  
prediction  screening   and community screening  prediction  screening  and prediction  fullblown  are utilized to predict the incremental caries existence  i e  number of new caries forming
in next year  the difference between prediction screening and prediction full blown lies in the use
of expensive and long waiting biological tests data  community screening is used to predict
baseline caries existence by employing the data only in questionnaire  it serves to identify highrisk children in a community setting since it is costly and time consuming to perform the oral
examination directly 
the summary of the data space is presented in table

table    summary of model constructed
in addition to the initial model construction  we develop models with reduced feature space via
feature selection  it will not only have influence on the model performance  but also improve the
model utility in clinical trials 

  

method

we build up   methods for the outcome variables  baseline year caries existence and incremental
caries existence  for each of the above model  the five methods are svm  linear kernel  

fisvm gaussian kernel   svm  polynomial kernel   logistic regression and lda  we construct
these models because they are most frequently used methods for categorical prediction  we
compare and contrast linear  e g  svm  linear kernel   vs gaussian  e g  svm  rbf kernel   
based on the comparison  we get insight into the data and explore how to select different models
based on the property of the data  we use matlab to implement the methods  data is split out into
training and testing set      for training and     for testing   for feature selection  we use
wrapper method with aid of forward search

table    community screening performance

fioverall  prediction  full blown  has best accuracy with prediction  screening  coming after 
community screening model has worst performance in the end  such results showcase that high
cost features like oral examination  clinical exam as in the table  and biologic tests play more
dominant role in determining the outcomes  moreover  we find that linear learning models such as
logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis have a relatively better performance than
non linear models  our conjecture is that the data set tends to be easily over fitted by using a highdimensional classification method  svm using gaussian kernel   the best classification comes
from lda  which has        classification error 
we included the receiver operating characteristics  roc  graph for the above   data spaces in
figure    

figure      roc curve for each of the learning algorithms for each model
from the roc curve  we can see that it is a tight fight among svm linear kennel   lda and
logistics regression in prediction full blown  and prediction screening   and they are well
above the svm polynomial  and svm rbf gaussian   however  as we delete the features from
oral examination and biologic tests in the community screening model  the advantage diminishes 
the reason behind is that inappropriate feature space will distort the power of the good learning
algorithms since the oral examination and biologic tests links more directly to the outcome of
caries 

   

feature selection results and reduced models results

to fully explore the performance of the statistical models and reduce the workload of clinicians
by shrinking the feature space  we perform feature selection using lda for prediction full blown 
prediction screening and community screening  we selected lda since it performs almost as
good as logistic regression and its time efficient  the selected features for each model are listed
in the following 
for the prediction full blown model  we selected  singapore nationality  advise of diet and
caries  lb level  ms bacteria level  average ph of saliva and baseline caries existence  for
prediction screening  we only select main reasons of tooth decay  heatiness and baseline year
caries existence  for the community screening model  we select race of indian  children taken
care by child care service and parents awareness of childrens caries 
the performance after the feature selection is listed in table

fitable    reduced model performance
the roc comparison of data spaces before and after feature selection is shown in figure
     

figure      roc curve for before and after feature selection
we observe that the performance of reduced model is slightly inferior for high true positive region
in prediction full blown model  even though the performance is similar  however  for other two
cases  the performance is indeed inferior in the other two models  the problem can be related to
the feature selection method we employed  since we only use wrapper method with forward
search  it will stop early if the algorithm finds an addition feature which does not improve on its
performance  however  there might exist a set of features  does not include current selected
features  that has better performance but is neglected because of the non exhaustive search 
therefore  the performances are inferior to the full models  even though in theory  the feature
selection would improve the overall performance when the subsets of features were exhaustively
searched 

  

conclusion 

in this project  various statistics models with employment of different machine learning
algorithms are developed and compared with each other  in addition  we figure out different subset
of features for each model  which contribute to strike a balance between model performance and
clinical utility  nevertheless  there is much more opportunities in future to further develop this
caries risk assessment model  a summary of further development is followed 
 extending our model to different outcome variables  i e  number of caries  position of
caries surfaces  etc 
 optimizing the feature selection process  i e  use backward genetic search and
incorporate a penalty cost for number of features selected to avoid the increasing
number of features selected in the backward genetic search 
 determination of optimal sample size to reduce the amount of effort in collecting
ample amout of data which are very costly in research settings
