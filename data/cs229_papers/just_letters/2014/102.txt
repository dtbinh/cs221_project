i  introduction
orem ipsum dolor sit amet  consectetur adipiscing elit  increasing dependence of the functionality and performance of computing system on the characteristics of the memory subsystem calls for further study on various memory technologies  conventional memory
technologies  such as sram  dram and flash  suffer from the formidable device scaling
challenges  which makes researchers pay more attention to the emerging memories  resistive
ramdom access memory  rram  is considered as one of the promising emerging memory candidates due to its simple structure  low switching voltage     v   fast switching speed      ns  
excellent scalability      nm  and good compatibility with the current cmos technology

however  a purely passive rram array suffers from intrinsic drawbacks such as parasitic leakage paths in un selected cells and series resistance of the interconnects  they only limit the
signal swing  which annihilates the advantage of the high density of the crossbar  d structures
by adding large sensing circuits and lowering the memory array efficiency  but also reduce the
maximum allowable array size  to resolve these issues  selection devices like diodes or transistors in series with the memory cell has been investigated  among all those selection devices 
two terminal selection device  selector  are more attractive due to larger cell size     f    of threeterminal transistors in series with rrams   t r  array  thus  in this project  we focus on diode
type of two terminal selection device rram   s r  array  exploring the characteristics of diodes
influences on  s r array programming performance 
we hope to estimate the array performance from selector characteristics before fabrication and
simulation which will waste painful time and cost if the selector is not a good choice for that
rram  despite the popularity of applying machine learning in different fields  few researchers 
either in machine learning or semiconductor domains  have used machine learning algorithms to
predict devices effects in circuit system  here  we presented a new methodology to use features
extracted from the diodes characteristics to predict  s r array performances  saving the time
and cost  crossbar  s r arrays  fig     are analyzed to give an insight for  d rram array  fig 
   

 the present work benefited from inputs of yilong geng  shahar kvatinsky  prof  shimeng yu and prof  h   s  philip
wong  who provided valuable comments and assistance to the undertaking of the project

ii  methodology
ii a features
a typical characteristics of diode selectors is shown in fig    a   we extract features of the curves
from numeric modeling equation     of selector characteristics 
i   is  e v vs   ss  ir  e v vr   sr

   

where is   ir is the saturation current  vs   vr is the dependence factor of current on voltage  and
ss   sr is the dependence factor of current on voltage 
the equation is derived from normal diode equation      a diode selector work like two reverseddirection diodes in parallel shown as fig   b   we can change is   vs   ss   ir   vr   and sr to
generate various of diode selector characteristics  fig

we take is   vs   ss for the rram set progress  fig     as the methodology demonstration  which
we can adopt similarly on ir   vr   and sr of the reset part   we call programming rram to
low resistance state  lrs  as set process  and to high resistance state  hrs  as reset process  
the ranges of features that we use to generate random feature values are shown in table

ii b targets
using a rram compact model and different selector characteristics  we generate hspice circuit
netlists of  s r crossbar array to simulate the minimum programming voltage of one  s r cell 
and  s r array worst case write margin and write margin  fig      those three numbers are key
parameters we care in memory systems  which are our targets

ii c processing
we simulate one  s r cell for vmin and  x      bits   s r array for write margin and energy
with      random generated diode selectors  for each target  we randomly choose     samples
as the training set and the remained     samples as the testing set 
different regression algorithms  linear  near neighbor  support vector regression and decision tree  are used to find out better regression methods on each data pattern

results and discussion

we optimize different algorithms to give the smallest error  for example in ada boost  the
least testing error is achieved at parameter n estimators  the number of decision trees       and
learning rate  boosting parameter       fig     
among various algorithms  ada boost gives best regression error  table

it is reasonable that decision tree and ada boost  a series of decision tree  provide better
regression  which are piece wise constant functions  matching the data pattern in  fig     
for     samples of the testing set  simulation result and prediction result from ada boost are
shown in fig     we can see ada boost gives a good prediction on the minimum programming
voltage  vmin  
similarly  we can use the approach to analyze data of  s r array write margin and write
energy   x  bits array as an example in fig       better regression algorithms can be achieved 

iv  summary and future work
a methodology to predict  s r array performance is provided  we extract key parameters  is   vs  
ss   ir   vr   and sr   of diodes selector as features  various of selector characteristics are adopted
into hspice simulation in which the target parameters  vmin  write margin and write energy 
are measured  the experiment proves that using machine learning algorithms  like ada boost

or nearest neighbor   we can successfully predict  s r array performance without fabrication
and simulation 
the long term goal of regression analysis is to predict larger array simulation by using smaller
array simulation results since fabrication cost will increase exponentially along with array size
and simulation will also take extremely long time  as example  with     samples from smaller
arrays  we can use one machine learning algorithm to predict larger array      x      of     
selector curves within  min much smaller than                hours     days
