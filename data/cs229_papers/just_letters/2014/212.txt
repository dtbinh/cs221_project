project      it includes     transcription factors 
along with the set of genes that each is expected to
bind to and regulate  and some transcription factors
appear with multiple gene sets 

introduction
a  background
proper regulation of mrna levels is essential to
nearly all cellular processes  transcription factors
are responsible for regulating levels of mrna  by
binding to a specific dna sequence via a dnabinding domain  transcription factors can promote or
block the recruitment of rna polymerase  an
enzyme responsible for transcription  effectively
controlling when and how much of a gene is
expressed      predicting the binding sites of
transcription factors is an important area of research 
as identifying these regulatory sites can shed light
on the mechanisms that regulate specific genes  a
variety of algorithms have been developed in order
to predict transcription factor binding sites  tfbss 
a priori      these techniques have the potential to
identify novel transcription factor binding motifs 
however  in some cases  the transcription factor
responsible for binding a given motif is unknown 
here  we address this issue using gene set
composition to predict which transcription factors
bind common binding motifs  this approach differs
from other work in the field  as previous efforts
have mainly focused on predicting targets of known
transcription factors 

ii  expression data
rna seq is a recent technique used to
quantify gene expression by directly sequencing
rna molecules from a cell sample  the sequenced
rna is converted to a library of cdna fragments
and mapped to specific genes in the genome  and the
number of reads for a gene can be used to quantify
gene expression      fragments per kilobase of exon
per million reads mapped  fpkm  measurements
are often used to quantify gene expression because
they allow for normalization of reads by gene
length  fpkm is defined as the following 
  
         
    
    
where      number of reads that align to a gene 
      effective length of a gene  and n   number of
reads sequenced     
our dataset contains rna seq fpkm measurements
from    human individuals across    different tissue
types      each tissue sample contains f
pkm measurements for        genes  the data was
retrieved from arrayexpress under accession
number e mtab          

b  data
i  gene sets
a common way of determining which
transcription factor regulates a given gene is to look
for characteristic dna binding motifs within the
promoter of the gene      in general  each
transcription factor has a motif around    base pairs
in length to which it preferentially binds     
therefore  it is possible to sequence genes and
group them based on which transcription factor
site s  their promoters contain  one of our datasets
is a list of transcription factor gene sets compiled
from the chip enrichment analysis system
 chea   the broad institute msigdb database  and
the encyclopedia of dna elements  encode 

methods
i  data preprocessing
a  expression data
in the original table  genes were labeled
using the ensembl gene id convention  these
identifiers are not directly compatible with other
bioinformatics resources  so biomart was used to
generate a mapping of ensembl ids to official
hgnc gene symbols      when a gene symbol
appeared more than once in the table  gene
expression was summed across the rows to produce
a single entry  finally  fpkm values were log

b  gene set filtering

ii  assessing
the
relationship
between
transcription factor and gene set expression
in order to determine whether gene
expression data could be used to predict
transcription factors that regulate common binding
motifs  we first tested the assumption that
transcription factors and their gene targets have
correlated expression profiles  for each gene set  we
computed the sum of the euclidean distance of the
tf from each gene in the gene set as shown

ii  classification of transcription factors using the
tfclass hierarchy
to make the number of response classes in
the data more tractable for machine learning  the
transcription factors were organized separately into
superclasses and classes using the tfclass
hierarchy  table     this framework orders
transcription factors based on their mode of
interaction with dna      the tfclass hierarchy
 sept       version  was downloaded in the  obo
ontology format      the superclass and class of
each transcription factor from the gene set data was

after this filtering  four superclasses           and

each of the        features is a gene that
appears at least once in any transcription factor gene
set  the presence of a given gene in the gene set of
a transcription factor is represented by a   at that
index  and its absence is represented by

results
it has been proposed previously that
transcription factors exhibit similar expression to
that of the targets they regulate      after an
unsuccessful attempt to use elastic net regression to
predict transcription factors using gene expression 
we decided to test the validity of this statement in
our data  to do this  we calculated the euclidean
distance of the transcription factor to every gene in
superclass training error

   

 
 

                     

  

   

let y be the n x k indicator response matrix  with
elements                    then the elastic net
penalized negative log likelihood function becomes
          

    

figure    distribution of bootstrap p values measuring
similarity of transcription factor and gene set
expression  out of     gene sets tested      had a significant
p value  threshold of        this indicates that some
transcription factors show similar expression to that of their
gene sets across tissues  but it is not a valid assumption for the
entire data set

b  glmnet model
we decided that multinomial logistic
regression was the most appropriate machine
learning method for this problem because the data
contains more than two classes and has binary rather
than continuous numerical features  because there
are many fewer gene set examples than individual
genes  the dataset is prone to overfitting  to best
address this  we chose multinomial elastic net
regression as implemented in the glmnet r
package because it allows for variable selection via
regularization with combined l  and l  norm
penalization       after the model was trained on
all of the data     fold cross validation was
performed to obtain the test error equations for the
multinomial model are shown here as described in
the glmnet documentation

identification of transcription factors that
bind genes with common binding motifs can provide
insight into the regulatory mechanisms of these
genes  our results show that gene set composition is
a better predictor of transcription factor classes
compared to expression data  furthermore  our
model is better able to predict transcription factor
superclass than class  which is unsurprising because
there are fewer training examples per class
compared to superclass 
although gene set composition shows some
promise for transcription factor prediction  there is
still a need for improvement of our model  the    
and     differences between test and training errors
for superclass and classes respectively suggests that
our model is overfitting the data despite the use of
l  and l  norm penalized logistic regression  other
alternatives for feature selection may better
eliminate overfitting  in the future  we could use l 
norm penalization  lasso regression  or l  norm
penalization  ridge regression  instead of elastic net 
which has both l  and l  norm penalization 
feature selection via forward search  backwards
search  or filter feature selection with mutual

the gene set  then  we computed a bootstrap p value
for each gene set to determine whether the distance
was greater than that of a randomly selected set  we
found that only     of the gene sets had significant
bootstrap p values  figure     which suggested that
predicting transcription factors using gene
expression could have limitations for our dataset 
in light of these findings  we took an
alternative approach to predicting transcription
factors by using gene set composition as features for
a multinomial elastic net regression model  we
performed two regression analyses using the
transcription factor superclass and the transcription
factor class as the response variables  figure    
cross validation was used to determine the optimal
lambda value for each regression  the regression

fiinformation scoring may also yield better test errors 
in addition to correcting for overfitting in the
model  there is also a need for further granularity of
response variables  although it is interesting to
predict transcription factor class for a set of genes
with a common binding motif  in order for these
results to be biologically useful  prediction at the
family  subfamily  or even genus level is needed 
additional data describing the transcription factors
that regulate genes with common binding motifs is
necessary in order to predict transcription factors at
a finer granularity  and it is also needed to ensure
that there are training examples of transcription
factors in each superclass and class so that all x
superclasses and all x classes can be predicted  with
additional data and improved measures to reduce
overfitting  our approach could be a useful tool for
identifying unknown transcription factors with a set
of known gene targets

future
previous research has indicated that transcription
factors may regulate genes that have similar
functional roles      therefore  another approach to
predicting transcription factors using gene sets
would be to use gene ontology  go  terms as
features in a multinomial logistic regression model 
go terms classify genes by cellular component 
molecular function  and biological process  and are
organized in a hierarchy with increasing specificity
      this hierarchical structure is useful in this
context because it would allow for different levels
of detail to be tested in the features  in the future  an
approach along these lines could further improve
our ability to predict which transcription factor
binds to a given gene set
