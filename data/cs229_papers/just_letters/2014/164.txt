identifyingelephantvocalizations

introduction

the asianelephant has been worshipped forcenturies and plays an important roleinasian culture andreligion it
is also a key biological species in the tropical forests of asia  in the wild  this majestic animal is threatened by
extinction   mainly duetorapidlygrowing human populations  wild elephant populationsaremostly small  isolated
andunableto joinas ancient migratoryroutesare cutoff by humansettlements  these facts haveled the world
wildlifefund  wwf to establishtheelephantas aflagship priority species andhasdeterminedthat theirsurvival
cannotbeguaranteedbyconservingtheirhabitatalone 
being able to identify elephant vocalizations is  a crucial part of  understanding their communication patterns 
which can then better inform decision  makers about how  to better conserve this iconic species   thus  for this
project  we aimedto identifyand labela set of knownasian elephantvocalizations we used audio recordingsof
elephant sounds to build a series of classifiers with different models and features  to attempt to capture the
differencesinthesecalls 

dataset

our original  dataset belongs to  the linguistics data consortium  ldc  at the university of pennsylvania 
specifically we used datasetldc    s  asianelephantvocalizations     whichconsistsof    hours ofaudio
recordings of  vocalizations made by asian elephants  in the uda  walawe national  park  sri lanka  these
recordings feature several types ofelephantsoundsthat havesome socialmeaning  collectedover an   month
period from primarily adult femaleandjuvenileelephants theraw recordingsfeatureslongstretches oftimeduring
which novocalizations can be heard  but about    hoursofthemhavealready beenannotatedwithinformationon
elephantcalls individuals etc 
as for the elephant vocalizations themselves  researchers for this data set have identified    different calls

featuresandpreprocessing

before featureextraction afair amount of workwent into preparing the data  the dataset cameas acollectionof
flac files with the  raw recordings  which had elephant  calls  interspersed  additionally  the annotations for the
recordings whentheyhadthem wereinaseparatetextfileintextgridformat 
inorder to preparethedata wehadtofirstusepraat    alinguistics softwareusedinacademiafor thesekindsof 
projects and thatreads in soundfiles andtextgrid files  using thisprogram we werecapable ofisolatingseveral 
shortrecordingsthateachcontainedanelephantcall 
after this  the files were culled for strange call labels  some annotations of the recordings  had errors like
unmentionedelephantcalls andextremelyshortrecordings wherenotenoughdata could beextracted from them  
as an end result  we obtained a set of       recordings with   differentelephantcalls crm and crm  were

having these recordings   we then proceededtoextracttwo separatefeature setsin an effort tocompare how
each performed  for  the extraction of the features themselves  we employed the opensmile toolkit      a very
flexibleandpowerfulfeatureextractorforsignalprocessingoftenusedinspeechrecognitiontasks 

statsfeatureset
inorder to classifysounds correctly  some temporalinformationmust be includedinthefeatures forthis wetook
after the approach of previous workinthefieldof emotiondetectionfromspeech inparticulartheworkofjurafsky 
et al     whereslices ofaudiowhere sampledandmeasurementslikefrequency energy etc whereused topredict
certain attributes and emotions from speakers  given that the vocalizations are not as complex as a humans  it
seemedreasonabletosimplifythetaskanduseamoreconstrainedsetoffeatures 
we focused on extractingthefollowing from our elephant recordings voicingprobability ameasureof given 
a sound recording  how probable it is that it contains vocalizations  voice quality  a feature used  for human
speech recognition  that measures the quality of the fundamental frequency of the soundrecording frequency 
raw frequency and  smoothed frequency  the fundamental frequency of the audiorecording with thresholding 
without andwithsomesmoothing energyand log energy  ameasurement ofhowmuchenergywaspresentin
the fundamentalfrequencyand agood proxy for intensity of sound as well asitslogvalue jitterandjitterdelta
 a  measurement of the differences  between consecutive period lengths in  sound waves     anditschange over
consecutive sound waves shimmer and shimmerdelta  similar tojitter  but measures the differencesbetween
consecutivesoundwaveamplitudesanditschangealongthewaves  
furthermore  for each of these features  we extracteda seriesof measurements  which were  average value 
maximum minimum  range  nonzero mean  standard deviation skewnessand kurtosis thusthisdataset yielded
an  dimensionalvectoroffeaturesperelephantrecording 

mfccfeatureset
the second featureset weusedwas modelledafteranothermore commonlyusedapproach to feature extraction
for speech recognition  this consists of using mel frequency cepstral coefficients  mfcc   which are a
timefrequencydomainmeasurementofsignals    
put simply thesefeaturesare values thatrepresentthespectrumofthelogofthespectrumofthesoundsignal
and are very useful in detecting  phones  one important and useful property of  mfcc coefficients is  that  as  a
product of the process to extract them  each coefficient tends to  end up being uncorrelated to  the others  for
speech recognition  the    first  mfcc coefficients are generally used   and we emulate that approach here   in
addition  to these    values  mfcc features are often paired with a  log energy measurement  for a total of   
values  plus delta and doubledeltavalues of each  howthey changeover time  the results isa   dimensional
vectorthatcapturesalotofusefulinformationaboutthesoundsignalforthetimeslicetowhichitcorresponds 
for our approach  wewound extracting these mfccvectorsforevery   ms of soundintherecordings witha 
smoothingof  ms  thisresulted in a large seriesoftimeslicemeasurementsforeachrecording becausenot all 
the recording were the  same length  we decided to compress some of this  information down in an  effort to
normalize the data  thus   regardless of the length  of the recording  we separated its mfcc vectors into  
chronological sections andaveraged them this ledto us having     features representing the mfccaverages

modelsandalgorithms

in our efforts to  obtain the best possible results in our  classification task we used three different models on the 
featuresetswehavejustdescribed thesemodelswere 





fionevsmanylogisticregression 
since logistic regressionis a binaryclassificationmodel wepreparedthedatabyfirstdeterminingwhich typeof
sound we wanted the algorithm to identify and editing our labels vectorby making the value be  when the label
equaled the sound type we were focusing  on and zero for all others  then  we ran logistic regression on our
databaseforeachtypeofsound 

softmaxregression
after identifying each sound  type individually  we implemented a more general multinomial classification
algorithm wethenransoftmaxregressionwithweightdecayonthe  classesofourdatabase

took     of eachclasssrecordings as part of the trainsetinordertoensureallclasseswere representedinboth

onevsmanylogisticregression 
the effect of the significantskew inour databecamevery clearwhile using the logisticregressionalgorithm it
achieved its best  result for  the growl class  but all others would be  nowhere as efficient   a more complete and
balanceddatasetwouldhelpimprovethesuccessofthisalgorithm 

softmaxregression
for  the  softmax regression model  the weight decay and learning rate were determinant in achieving better 
results  when using a smaller learning rate  the algorithm would converge quickly at a local minimum withhigh
trainingandtestingerrorswhileusingalargerlearningrateledtomoreaccuratepredictions 

neuralnet
for  our neural net  we initially ran  it using the
mfcc feature set withouroriginalimplementationof
the model  results were  poor  and very inconsistent 
with the best run  of the algorithm giving a     test
accuracy  after improving the  implementation 
however  we ran the network once more  using no
regularization andahidden layer of sizeh    welet 
the net runfor      iterationsand got verypromising
results  witha trainingset accuracy of       a test
set accuracy of        thelearning curveshownon

inspite of the overall positive performance of the neuralnet  thereare classes wedont everpredictandour
performanceon eachclass diminisheswiththenumberofexamples we have foreach one giventhat the training
set has a similar composition of classes  these results however should not comeas asurprise the influence of
having such a skewed dataset is going to be  naturally   that our network willlearn to predict the more populous
classes accurately  and for the  less represented ones  it issimply memorizingthemfromthetraining set  but not
