   introduction
the regulation of air pollutant levels is rapidly becoming one of the most important tasks for the
governments of developing countries  especially china  among the pollutant index  fine
particulate matter  pm     is a significant one because it is a big concern to people s health when
its level in the air is relatively high  pm    refers to tiny particles in the air that reduce visibility
and cause the air to appear hazy when levels are elevated 
however  the relationships between the concentration of these particles and meteorological and
traffic factors are poorly understood  to shed some light on these connections  some of these
advanced techniques have been introduced into air quality research  these studies utilized
selected techniques  such as support vector machine  svm  and neural network  to predict
ambient air pollutant levels based on mostly weather and sometimes traffic variables 
this project attempted to apply some machine learning techniques to predict pm    levels based
on a dataset consisting of daily weather and traffic parameters in beijing  china  due to the
uncertainty of the specific number pm    level  i simplified the problem to be a binary
classification one  that is to classify the pm    level into  high         ug m   and  low     
    ug m    the value is chosen based on the air quality level standard in china  which set    
ug m  to be mild level pollution 

   data overview
in order to identify and forecast key parameters affecting air quality and propose appropriate
preventive strategies and policies  it is essential to systematically collect data characterizing air
quality 
the data includes two parts  training data set and test data set  training data set has    
observation points and the test data has    points  each point represents the meteorological and
traffic condition of a specific day in beijing city  the total data set covers    days in      and
    days in       
the data comes from china meteorological data sharing service system  beijing transportation
research center and us embassy in beijing  
as mentioned before  the output data was labeled as one or zero  one refers to high pollution
level and zero refers to low pollution level  the total number labeled as zero is      while the
remaining     points are labeled as   

fi   feature selection
a variety of meteorological  traffic and industrial parameters affect the air pollution level  after
taking consideration of the data availability and importance  this project used the following five
features 
x    temperature
temperature affect air quality because of temperate inversion  the warm air above cooler air acts
like a lid  suppressing vertical mixing and trapping the cooler air at the surface  as pollutants
from vehicles  fireplaces  and industry are emitted into the air  the inversion traps these pollutants
near the ground 
x    wind speed
wind speed plays a big role in diluting pollutants  generally  strong winds disperse pollutants 
whereas light winds generally result in stagnant conditions allowing pollutants to build up over
an area 
x    relative humidity
humidity could affect the diffusion of contaminant 
x    traffic index
the large number of cars on the road cause high level of air pollution and traffic jam may
increase the pollutants concentration from vehicles  the definition of traffic index is a index
reflecting the smooth status of traffic  the index range is from   to       represents smooth and
   represents sever traffic jam 
x    air quality of previous day
the air pollution level is influenced by the condition of the previous day to some extent  if the
air pollution level of the previous day is high  the pollutants may stay and affect the following
day 

   method
this prediction is a binary classification problem  so the following three supervised learning
algorithms were used 
   logistic regression  fitglm
the output is a generalized linear model  for this model  the prediction value is range for   to
   in order to get the label  the values were converted to zero  if    value       and one  if
value       
   naive bayes classification  fitcnb
the output is a classification naive bayes classifier 
   support vector machines  fitcsvm

fithe output is a classification svm classifier  for this model  it was proved that linear kernel
function gave the best prediction results for this problem 
the models are all from matlab library 

   result analysis
   error analysis
the total data size is      the overall test error for glm is         which is the same as it for
bayes  svm has the lowest test error        
after changing the data size and repeat training the model  we got the test error curve as shown
in figure

the figure   shows that in this problem  the test error of bayes classifier doesnt change much
with data size  however glm and svm have large test error change with data size  further
more  the test error for svm has the decline trend if the data size increases further 
   prediction performance analysis
classification based predictions for test examples can be evaluated using a variety of measures 
the most straightforward measure is accuracy  which is the percentage of the examples that are
correctly predicted  however  this measure may not be sufficient  this projected chose the
measures in table    since they are well understood and have been used extensively in areas such
as information retrieval and computational biology  where prediction is a common task

precision  p

for each class  measures how
many of the predicted members
are actually true members 

recall  r 

tp  tp   fn 

for each class  measures how
many of the true members are

f measure

 pr  p r 

measures the trade off between p
and r for each class 

tp   no  of true positives  fp   no  of false positives  tn   no  of true negatives  fn   no  of false negatives 

therefore  the prediction performance for there different models could be evaluated as the summary in

after training the whole training set  svm has the highest f measure while naive bayes has the
lowest  this initial result shows that svm has the overall best performance for predicting the air
pollution level in this problem 

   discussion
the primary goal of the project was the prediction of air pollution level in beijing city with the
ground data set  the best algorithm  svm  gave the       precision        recall and       fmeasure value  it is relatively accurate and is an acceptable result for practical use  however 
compared with results from some literatures  the predicting performance  f measure value  for
this data set is not very good  also  the advantage of svm are not shown obviously  it would be
better to try other svm models rather than the one from matlab 
on the other hand  the data set in this project is not large enough  air quality is a long term
formed problem and it is better to use a large data data covering a variety of years and locations 

fifurthermore  beside the meteorological and traffic factors  industrial parameters such as power
plant emissions also play significant roles in air pollution  this project did use these features
because they are not public available in china  in order to get better prediction results  the data
should include more industrial condition features if possible
