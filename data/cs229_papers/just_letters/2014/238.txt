introduction

        check in sets

in many cities  there is a small number of streets with a
lot of restaurants  being in a street like this is a doubleedged sword for the individual restaurant  on one side  it
is valuable because it gets them the attention of potential
customers for free  on the other hand  the restaurants are
competing for customers with similar needs and the offerings
are not free of overlap 
when a new business opens in a cluster  this delicate
balance between businesses is disturbed  the goal of this
project is to model the impact of a new business on the existing businesses  our hypothesis is that the new business
has an impact on the perception of customers of existing
businesses  with increased competition  customers have to
reevaluate existing businesses taking into account the new
options  we use customer ratings as a proxy for the value
of a business and to observe this reevaluation 
our project is not the first one that is concerned with
the dynamics of clusters  there is a large corpus of existing
work            but to our knowledge no project considered
to study the interaction of two businesses in a cluster by
mining a large dataset

         users
         tips
           reviews
because of the large number of reviews  most of the data
mining projects on this dataset are concerned with the text
of the reviews  to study the interaction between two businesses  however  we the two most interesting aspects are the
attributes of a business and the rating over time 
two data points that are missing from the dataset are the
opening and the closing date of a business  to compensate
for the lack of information  we use a simple heuristic  we
assume that the business opened on the date of the first comment and we assume that it has been closed on the date of
the last comment if the last comment more than   months
older than the newest comment in the dataset  we argue
that this is a reasonable choice because our project requires
us to look at businesses with a reasonable number of ratings and in these cases the opening closing date should be
reasonably close to the date of the first and the last review 
also we believe first review as the opening date is a good estimate for our models since this is the point where customers
have actually started rating the restaurant 

main objectives
we identify two main components of our machine learning
project 
   business clustering

  

   impact of a new business on a cluster

   

 propose and test impact models
 use machine learning techniques to predict the
impact

the dataset

yelp is a website where users review businesses like restaurants  we use the yelp data that has been released as part
of the yelp dataset challenge     the dataset contains data
from several cities and there is a rich set of attributes for
each business 

   

running average of ratings

clustering

we checked different clustering algorithms and for the
same number of clusters  k means based on the geographic
locations of businesses had the best result  the result of two
clustering algorithms results are shown in figure    as we
can see dbscan is not giving a good result  since in a city

        businesses
         business attributes
 

preprocessing

the running average of ratings plays an important role
when predicting the correlation of two businesses  the raw
user ratings are highly noisy and relatively sparse  e g 
many places are not visited often during the week  so there
are holes on week days  figure   depicts an example of a
moving average using a gaussian kernel for a business over
time  we chose    days as our moving average period so
it would track the reviews closely almost all the time for
each business and also its not too big and gives us a smooth
changing average over the time  in addition  we filter out
businesses with a low number of ratings 

 selecting relevant features for use of the models

fithe first feature vector that we considered  was constructed
as follows  the first element is the geographical distance 
the second elelement is the difference in the price range and
every feature following the first two elements is either   or
   and corresponds to an attribute in the dataset  value
assignment of the features is as follows

    the two businesses have the same  if attribute is
discrete  or strongly overlapping  if the attribute is
continuous  values for the corresponding attribute

moving average of ratings for a specific

     the two businesses have the different  if attribute
is discrete  or non overlapping  if the attribute is continuous  values for the corresponding attribute

there are so many businesses acting like bridges that connect
two big clusters together  this is the main reason that in
the business clustering problem dbscan is not performing
as good as k means 

the second set of features is similar to the first one but
instead of considering the difference between the attributes
of the businesses  we concatenate the list of attributes from
the two businesses 

  

figure   

all the analysis in the project was based on using the pairwise features outlined above for predicting pairwise metrics
to be defined in what follows  specifically  in this section we
introduce   different metrics which we will henceforth call
pairwise impact metrics 
before we move onto detailing the metrics  it is important to note a one thing we have followed regardless of the
metric used  relating only businesses within a reasonable
distance  we have calculated all the metrics for pairs inside
the same cluster since our scope is restricted to businesses
that may have pairwise relationships due to their geographical closeness  this way  we hoped to eliminate the dominance of relationships with more global causes  such as a
general increasing trend to prefer mediterranean food over
indian food  or frozen yogurt shops over ice cream shops 

k means and dbscan clustering

as we previously described in the introduction  we are interested to look at clusters of businesses  the first step in
our project is thus to find a good way of clustering businesses  we found that using zip codes to group businesses is
ineffective as groups of businesses often span zip code boundaries  we experimented with multiple clustering methods
and ended up using k means clustering with the geographical location as features because we are interested to observe
interaction between businesses that are physically close to
each other  using k means we are taking the advantage
of clustering close businesses together and also putting far
businesses that are not influencing each other into different
clusters  in this case we can assume that the businesses in
two different clusters are independent  and only businesses
in one cluster influence each others behaviors  we will have
a brief overview on the different clustering techniques used
and a benchmark that reasons which one works the best in
the case of our study

hypothesis   opening of a new business has an impact
on the mean of ratings of the businesses nearby 
proxy   calculate the mean ratings of the nearby businesses
before and after a new business opens  and get a comparative metric 
expected results   the change in the conditional means of
the existing businesses may be predicted using the attributes
of the existing businesses and the new business 

 type of the business  restaurant  lounge  etc 

the mean ratings were calculated as follows 

since the motivation is predicting the impact of the businesses within a cluster  it is natural to consider pairwise
metrics when constructing the features for the models  to
this end  we constructed features out of the pairwise comparison of the attributes of the businesses in the dataset 
some of the business attributes in the dataset are 

 price range            
ebef ore  b   

we tried two different sets of features  in both cases  we
assign a feature vector to each pair of businesses in a cluster

for this analysis  we needed a date of opening for the

was determined as ebef ore  eaf ter

hypothesis   opening of a new business has an impact
on the trends of ratings of the businesses nearby 
proxy   fit separate lines for the ratings of a business both
before and after a new business opens in the neighborhood 
calculate a metric based on the difference in the slopes of
the two lines 
expected results   the change in the trends of the existing
businesses with respect to the launching of a new business
in the neighborhood may be predicted using the attributes
of the existing businesses and the new business 
first  we estimated the opening date of the businesses as
explained in the previous subsection  then  for each pair
of businesses we fit two lines for the ratings of the older
business around the origin  the estimated opening date of
the newer business  within a specified time window  imposing that the lines touch at the origin   specifically  we are
solving the following least squares problem 


xbef ore
 

 
xaf ter

 
 



  

  

  

hypothesis   the exact opening date is not known and
since prediction is noisy  the trend analysis might fail  the
general trends of the existing businesses around a rough estimate of the opening time of a new business may reflect
 with less noise compared to the trend analysis  the impact
of the new business on them 
proxy   fit a single line for the ratings of a business around
the estimated opening date of a newly opened business in
the neighborhood  determine if the business has an increasing or a decreasing trend based on the slope of the line 
expected results   the general trends of the existing businesses around the launching date of a new business in the
neighborhood may be predicted using the attributes of the
existing businesses and the new business 
the method to apply was very similar to that for the trend
analysis  with the distinction being that for general trend
analysis we fitted a single line for the whole time window
and calculated a single slope  mathematically  we calculated
the least square solution to the following equation

with everything except for s is as defined in the previous
subsection  s is the slope to the fitted line for the whole
time window  
the pairwise impact metric in general trend analysis was
determined to be the slope of the fitted line s  

correlation analysis
the correlation coefficient is a measure of linear association between two variables  a high positive correlation indicates that two variables are perfectly related in a positive
linear sense  and a high negative correlation indicates that
two variables are perfectly related in a negative linear sense 
and zero means that they are not related at all  this show
that studying the business correlation give us a very good
intuition on how businesses are effecting each other

older business before  after  the newer business opens  s 
 s    is the slope of the line fitted to the ratings of the older
business before  after  the newer business opens  and c is the
common intercept for the two lines  one thing to note here
is that the elements of xbef ore and xaf ter are shifted such
that the last element of xbef ore is   and the first element of
xaf ter is   
the pairwise impact metric was determined to be the difference in the angles of the two slopes

results

the main tools for our study was python to preprocess
and analyze the data and the scikit package     to perform
the machine learning tasks  we found that the previously
presented two sets of features performed very similarly  this
indicates that the difference in attributes gives us enough
information for the predictions that we studied  thus  we
are only presenting the results for the first feature set 
we did two types of experiments   a  classification of positive vs  negative values for all the metrics and  b  classification of significant vs  insignificant values  absolute value
bigger than a certain threshold  for all models  converting the metrics to binary features was exacly the same for
all the metrics due to their conceptual correspondance  we
also adjusted the thresholds to have an even distribution of
the class labels in order to avoid bias in the classification
accuracy 
for every model except correlation analysis  we also considered different lengths of periods to fit the model  we
found that there were only minor differences between a period of    days and    days 
table   contains the mean training score and the    fold
cross validation score for predictions in a single cluster  we
used support vector classifier  svm  with c     and a gaussian kernel and logistic regression with l  norm regularization for all the tests  the cluster consists of     businesses
which corresponds to       pairings 
we also collected results for linear  polynomial and sigmoid kernels for svm classifier but we omitted them here
due to their poor performance

reflects a pairwise relationship over a long period of time 
proxy   compute the correlation of ratings over time 
expected results   the correlation can be predicted using
the attributes of the businesses within reasonable distance 
after choosing one cluster  we analyzed the correlation of
ratings between different businesses inside the cluster  to
do so  we first applied a gaussian filter to the time series of
ratings to smooth out local fluctuations in ratings  the correlation coefficient between the ratings were then calculated
as 
e xy

e x    e y

discussion

out of the   different pairwise impact metrics that we
have made effort to predict  we were most successful with
the correlation metric        cv accuracy with both classifiers for both classification experiments   one thing that we
have noted is that svm performed significantly superior to
logistic regression for the conditional mean analysis  trend
analysis  and general trend analysis  whereas it was outperformed slightly in the correlation analysis  we have speculated that this might be due to possible effective noise
level from the first   metrics being significantly higher than

where rt is the filtered rating  in this step we discarded
all businesses with a low number of ratings because they
potentially would not provide not enough signal to get a
good estimate for the correlation 
as figure   shows  there are a quite a few cases with
strong correlation 
 

fithat from the correlation metric  svm is able to fit better with the presence of noise due to its possibly higher
vc dimension compared to that of logistic regression with
l  regularization  overfitting behavior of svm compared to
logistic regression classifier is also evident in the first   rows
of table     however  given higher signal to noise ratio
 hence cleaner data   which we believe is present in the correlation metric  it loses its comparative advantage against
logistic regression 
following up from this idea  we have gone back to the
calculating the first three metrics and chose different values for the opening dates for the new businesses around the
previously estimated values  in quite a few cases  we have
observed considerable changes in the values for the metrics
 data not shown  however on average        of the pairwise
metric values in the cluster of interest have shown considerable variation  with the majority of the pairwise values
effected at different levels   this observation supports our
suspicions about the discrepancies in the classification accuracies 
one last thing worth mentioning is that  for the correlation analysis  the training accuracies were quite close to
the    fold cv accuracies      difference for logistic regression and     difference for svm  last row of table    
this fact suggests that the relationships between businesses
within cluster are predicted across disjoint subpopulations
inside the cluster  this is important in answering the practical question of whether the correlation between any two
novel businesses may be predicted by using a precalculated
predicted model 

  

whether a cluster is heterogeneous  for example the great
mall  
since we have used very common business attributes like geographic distance  open hours  business types  and similar
common features for our studies  we have the advantage to
do the same experiments on similar datasets  in the future 
it would be interesting to see if similar or even better observations can be made on different datasets  where more
information on the businesses is available  in addition it
would be interesting to look interactions between businesses
other than the opening of a new business 

   

conclusion

we tried to predict the interaction of two businesses with
multiple models  the quality of our predictions turned out
to be relatively low for most models  possible reasons are 
 the rating data is noisy and sparse at the same time 
most businesses dont have ratings every day and the
variance of the ratings for a given time period is high 
 the training score of svm is high in general but the
cross validation score is low in a lot of cases which may
be a hint that svm is overfitting 
 for the conditional mean analysis and the trend analysis  we assume that the opening date of the business
is close to the first review submitted for the business 
this might not always be the case 
we achieved good results when predicting correlation and
this shows that our approach has merit  we also observed
that svm generally outperformed logistic regression in cases
other than correlation analysis

future work

we have already performed different types of clustering
on the data and chose the best one based on the geographical location of the businesses  it would be interesting to
perform other types of clustering techniques based on the
features distance metrics described in the features section 
and study how the correlated businesses are geographically
located  this would allow us to analyze the structure of a
cluster  e g  whether a given cluster consists of many similar businesses  for example chinatown in san francisco  or
