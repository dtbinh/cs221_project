problem introduction

the origins and underlying mechanisms of cancer are widely unknown  it has become clear that
to truly understand and manipulate cancer  one must understand how genes interact with each other and
the environment  the mechanisms behind protein creation or the creation of any biological matter are
extremely complicated  sometimes a gene may encode a protein that activates another gene  physically
and dynamically monitoring all these interactions is impossible at the moment  thus data analysts often
create models of gene regulatory networks given gene expression data in order to point experimentalists
in the right direction  often the data sets that are used are very skinny in the sense that there will be
data for     patients and for each patient there will be data on the order of        genes  clearly this is
not a lot of data for each gene especially considering that gene expression data can be quite noisy  a data
analyst must address these challenges 
in particular  we focus on a dataset of gene expression data in acute myeloid leukemia
 aml   furthermore  we focus on the presence or absence of   certain proteins npm  and flt  itd 
which are good prognosticators for patient outcome  we would be further along in understanding the
origins of certain cancers if we could somehow pinpoint which genes or which gene interactions cause the
existence of the npm  and flt  itd proteins 

 

dataset

we were given a dataset from andrew gentles  a bioinformatics researcher at the stanford
university lab for integrative cancer biology  this data is gene expression data for acute myeloid
leukemia or aml  the data is derived from a gene expression microarray profiling     cases of de novo
aml across expression levels with        genes  comparisons of cases with double and single cebpa
mutations versus those with wild type cebpa   the data set also comes with binary classification entries
for the presence of nmp  and flt  itd expression in each observations

features and processing

we initially could not discriminate among the        genes in terms of what would be better
predictors for the expression of nmp  or flt  without any domain knowledge  in terms of traditional
data processing  we reduced the dimension of this data set    by using pca  this did not prove to be very

figood for classification purposes  we also tried lasso methods which will be explained in the following
section  the most important pre processing we did is that we calculated the mutual information between
genes and created an adjacency matrix out of this  this is done via aracne  which is a software
developed by computational biologists at columbia university  the idea is essentially that if two genes
have high mutual information  then they are likely to be connected  if we were to describe the interactions
of genes with a graph   mutual information is used as a well behaved indicator of non linear
dependencies that cannot be caught by other metrics such as the pearson correlation  spearman   or
kendall   it is possible and often likely that two genes have an interesting relationship and yet have
a correlation of zero   we also investigated implementation of the more novel and dynamic metric of
distance correlation  however that endeavor proved too computationally expensive and drawn out to
complete within the quarter 

 

models and techniques

pca  since we have nearly        genes in our data set  we try to see if can reduce our data to a smaller 
more tractable subset  this method by nature eliminates the effect of one gene on a binary output
 presence of npm  or flt  protein   however  it is still a good initial tool to see if one can predict a
binary output when the dimension of the data is smaller than the number of patients  i e  avoiding this
issue of a skinny dataset   we reduce our         dimension data set to a    dimensional space 
logistic regression  we use this modality as a primary classifier algorithm 
lasso  we implemented the   penalized regression method to generate a sparse regression of only the
most significant genes in our feature space so as to generate a more interpretable model that does not
suffer with over fitting due to the large excess of explanatory variables in relation to the number of
observations  implementations of the combined   elastic net were also tested  but they proved unstable
for dimensionality reduction and did not produce large increases in classification success 
enriched lasso  the enriched lasso extension is an attempt to bypass some limitations of the lasso 
namely that the algorithm is prone to random exclusion of one of two similarly valued genes  it is
somewhat hard to verify the statistical significance of the parameters chosen by lasso  the enriched
method works by finding t statistics of genes differentially expressed about classes  and then correcting
these for false discovery rate  fdr   the resulting q value is then utilized as an additional weighting
parameter for individual genes in the lasso  we use the heuristic of applying a weight of  log   to the ith
respective gene in the lasso formulation 

aracne model  we utilize the aracne algorithm to
calculate pair wise mutual information of genes  the
algorithm imparts further insight into our network by
applying the data processing inequality  dpi  on the
network graph to infer the most likely path of
information flow by removing false candidate
interactions  i e   triplet cycles are severed by ranking to
elucidate more meaningful topological structure  the
figure to the right displays the dpi procedure 

ficalculating total number of paths  given an adjacency matrix a in which the i jth entry
corresponds to the weighted connection between gene i and gene j we can find the number of   step path
lengths between node i and node j by simply calculating a    in particular 
 
a   
  

 
 
  

  
  
 

we can see that there is one   step path length from node   to node    first one goes to from node   to
node    then one can go from node   to node    fortunately  we can measure this by simply looking at the
      entry of a    the value here will be non zero and effected by the strength of the connections
between each path step  for example if we replaced each non zero entry here with a one  the       entry of
a   would be    however in our case the       entry of a   will be four tenths 
this matrix a   is simply the number of   step path lengths  what about the number of   step path
lengths  or     does a    step path length really matter  it would make sense that the greater number of
steps the less we care about the connection  thus we make our own metric atotal   and atotal is defined as
        

 
 
 
         
 
 
  

we then examine the nodes with the most connections by summing up the entries in the column
corresponding to a certain node 
eigenvector centrality  we also use an algorithm similar to page rank  given an adjacency matrix a 
we can find the most connected nodes by finding the eigenvector of matrix a corresponding to the largest
eigenvalue in a  by the perron frobenius theorem  this eigenvector has only non zero entries and each
entry in the vector corresponds to the entrys importance  it turns out that the method mentioned before
and this method give us very similar results and so we will only show the plots for one method in the
results section 

 

results and discussion

pca  we reduced the size of the dataset to dimension    using traditional pca  when we trained a
logistic regression classifier on this data we could only predict with accuracy of     
lasso  given the lasso data  we found that there was one gene whose coefficient was always
significantly higher than the others  we trained logistic regression just on the hypothetical loc      
gene and were able to get a testing error of      the unmodified lasso reduced our feature space to    
significant genes with    classification error while the enriched lasso reduces the feature space to a
mere    genes  but at the cost of a     classification error

visually  there are obvious differences between the networks of a nmp  expresser and non expresser 
namely  the expresser exhibits signs or rampant connectivity with the principal genes at the center of the
force directed network and as hubs of the organic network  the non expresser displays stark delineations
between sub networkslikely a sign of natural segregation rather than the unnaturally high amount of
cross talk in our expresser network

we did an eigenvector centrality analysis  above figure  on the graphs generated by aracne  the
results were interesting  although the flt  eigenvectors did not change much when flt  was absent and
when flt  was present  in the case npm   we found some interesting variations  one can see in the data
above that in the presence of npm  a few genes became more connected than they were in the absence
npm   in the case of npm   the genes that became more connected were ccdc    cyp w    ccl

conclusion

we initially started out with low hanging fruit by applying linear techniques  one particularly
fruitful method we tried was lasso  we found that one gene was highly predictive of the presence of the
nmp  protein  in fact  if we constructed a logistic regression model using simply that one gene 
hypothetical loc        we were able to have an     percent prediction rate  in addition  we
constructed a theoretical graph corresponding to connections of genes  we did this by measuring mutual
information in gene expression data  we constructed graphs corresponding to the presence of nmp  and
graphs corresponding to the absence of nmp   we then used an algorithm similar to pagerank to find the
most highly connected genes  we found that a few genes became suddenly highly connected in the
presence of nmp   these genes are ccdc    cyp w    ccl    these genes along with hypothetical
loc       are genes we would recommend to explore experimentally  of course  the former of these
suggestions is only a good recommendation if the graph based on the mutual information graph is
relatively close to accurate  on synthetic graphs the aracne algorithms has proved to be quite successful 
thus at this point we are relatively optimistic on our recommendations 
future
if there was more time to pursue this project more seriously  we would look into differences
between the genetic networks such as unique gene paths  in this project we simply studied how the
central nodes changed  secondly we would acquire more data on different types of cancer to better
understand the differences between these graphs  we would also try a more robust metric than mutual
information  namely distance correlation  but that was going to take us      hours on the campus
servers   finding a metric that somehow is more suited for biological relationships would be ideal  for
example maybe its the case the in biology there is a common type of relationship between genes that are
interacting  if we could create a metric suited for that  then we could do a much better job in find genes
that are connected
