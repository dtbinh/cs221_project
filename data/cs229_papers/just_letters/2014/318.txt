abstract
current  d audio technology used for virtual and augmented reality systems
lack the immersive qualities of real acoustic spaces  this limitation is rooted in
an inability to easily measure individualized head related transfer functions
 hrtfs  in a commercial setting  this study shows how the iterative construct
of a joint maximization em algorithm can be applied to derive a novel method
for cheap  portable hrtf estimation that eliminates both head tracking and or
prior source location knowledge from the process 

 

introduction

in natural listening environments  humans use a unique set of acoustic cues to localize incoming sounds  these
localization cues  collectively represented by a head related transfer function  hrtf   describe the acoustic
transformations caused by interactions of a sound wave with a listeners head  shoulders  and outer ears  in virtual
audio applications  an individually measured hrtf is essential because it is used to give headphone based sounds a
realistic virtual spatial origin and immersive realism  accordingly  if the hrtf is non individualized or poorly
estimated  it has the tendency to cause unwanted distortions and undesirable artifacts in the sounds perceived
location when presented over headphones     
traditionally  hrtfs are measured acoustically  based on binaural  two ear  recordings of a known test stimuli
that are played from loudspeakers in  d space  in general  the hrtf is a  d continuous function defined over the
unit sphere in  d space  and a measurement for a given loudspeaker location represents a sample hrtf  it thus
follows that a full representation of an hrtf obtained via conventional discrete acoustic measurements  requires an
effective interpolation of collected sample hrtfs throughout all of space  fortunately  with the development of a
spherical harmonic  sh  based hrtf interpolation technique      a continuous individualized hrtf can be
estimated using many spatially distributed samples 
while intepolation of a continuous hrtf is possible from discrete hrtf measurements  it requires knowledge of
each sample hrtfs location  in typical laboratory setups  this information is provided by knowing a priori a
loudspeakers location relative to a listeners fixed head position  or tracking a listeners moving head while keeping
the loudspeakers fixed  unfortunately  even though simple head tracking technology has recently become more cost
effective  it still presents a significant financial investment for the average potential consumer of virtual audio 
a potential solution to this problem would be to try to estimate a continuous hrtf without head tracking or
loudspeaker arrays  consider a sample hrtf collected without knowledge of the spatial origin of the recorded
stimulus  this observation has some interesting consequences for hrtf estimation in context of machine learning
paradigms because viewing this location as a latent variable converts hrtf estimation into an unsupervised
learning problem  here  the goal of estimating an hrtf could be approached as a two step iterative machine
learning algorithm      binaural source localization based on knowledge of the underlying continuous hrtf and test
stimulus  and     continuous hrtf interpolation from knowledge of several sample hrtfs and their locations 
figure   below illustrates the chicken versus egg nature of this two step estimation problem 

fifigure    chicken versus egg problem for hrtf estimation

this study presents a novel method for hrtf estimation derived from expectation maximization  em  theory  by
collecting sample hrtf measurements on individuals varying their head rotation angle relative to a single fixed
speaker without explicit knowledge of the source location  the goal is to achieve an accurate estimate of an
individuals hrtf by eliminating any sort of head tracking or prior source location knowledge from the process 

 

data collection

datasets of binaural recordings containing approximately     non redundant measurements  evenly distributed over
 d space  were used in place of real time measurements for the purpose of developing and refining the em
algorithm  twelve separate datasets were collected in all  representing sets of binaural recordings collected for
twelve different human subjects  let       represent a clean binaural recording at a given location        clean
refers to the fact that these binaural recordings were collected in a quiet anechoic chamber  as a pre processing step
before initialization of the algorithm  the collection of binaural recordings were converted to sample hrtfs        
computed as                     where  was the source signal used in the recordings  both       and  were
considered in the frequency domain so that a      could be obtained through simple division 

 

joint maximization formulation

em is a prevailing methodology for maximum likelihood parameter estimation in models with hidden or unobserved
 

dependencies  to formalize the hrtf estimation problem in context of em  let                   denote a space
of  unlabeled sample hrtfs  and consider that if a set of known sound source location labels
 

                  for  existed  finding the continuous hrtf parameters   would become the standard
continuous hrtf interpolation procedure  likewise  having complete prior knowledge of the continuous hrtf   
and  would trivialize the labeling of each recording  becoming binaural source localization  the proposed
technique is an attempt at estimating the continuous hrtf   having a dataset   but no knowledge of   hence the
hrtfs collected are blind to location 
for this application  it is useful to begin the formulation of an em as a coordinate ascent process  with this  the
algorithm becomes a joint maximization procedure that iteratively maximizes a function        where  is the
parameter described above  and         is an arbitrary distribution over the unobserved variables  given the support
                       the iterative procedure is carried out in two alternating maximization steps on function 
      and proceeds as follows  repeating until convergence

where with this standard coordinate ascent view  the resulting algorithm is maximizing  in a process akin to
maximizing a tight lower bound to the true likelihood surface     
in this study  a broader view of the traditional em algorithm is adopted  in which focus is placed on the strategy and
overall success of the individual m steps rather than successful attainment of the optimal joint distribution    this
choice makes the formulation of the algorithm more amenable to the existing body of work on hrtf interpolation
and binaural source localization  as practical constructs established from within existing research can be used to
approximate each m step  this is the topic of the proceeding section 

 

em derived approach

to complete the formulation of the em derived approach  consider that m step   and the process of continuous
hrtf interpolation share a common objective  find a    continuous hrtf representation  which optimizes the
probability of a source location corresponding to a given sample hrtf  accordingly  it is logical to assume that an
effective hrtf interpolation strategy provides a sufficient proxy to the closed form solution for the update of
parameter   under this assumption  m step   can be viewed as a module that performs some sort of hrtf
interpolation procedure given the information from m step    using similar logic and considering a greedy
distribution          constrained so as to assign zero probability to all but one value of      so that

       both m step   and binaural localization models function as

 

the machinery for identifying a  that maximizes          as such  the joint maximization of  can be recast
according to the module convention outlined above as

where        is either the initial     or the updated    from a previous iteration of module    and              
represents the resulting maximized function from m step    note that the initial   represents the average
continuous hrtf from an existing database 
the function                     computes the similarity between the spectra of        at      with        thus for each
       the localizer tries to find a      that maximizes their similarity  note that with this modular formulation  any
binaural localization algorithm can be substituted and tested in module   as long as it follows the same general
construct as given above

a vector of   for all  from module    remember    has an  dependence  from module     thus the alternative
view is not an attempt to eliminate an  dependence  but rather  it is motivated by the discussion of the results  the
basis functions contained in y are indexed according to their order  a constant that determines the rate of spatial
change of the basis function over the sphere  and this is presumed to have an effect on the interpolation scheme  and
therefore the proceeding localization   again  with this design  other hrtf interpolation schemes can be substituted
and tested in module   without forcing a re derivation of the entire construct  note that it is assumed that     is a
suitable approximation for the result of m step   

 

results and discussion

twelve separate ground truth hrtfs representing twelve individual subjects by proxy were used for each
experiment  these hrtfs were custom measured on real human participants  the metrics used to define the success
of the algorithm are expressed according to the purpose assigned to each module  moreover  the purpose of the
binaural localizer in module   is to find a      that maximizes the similarity of the spectra under comparison  which
is analogous to minimizing the localization error for each given        this localization error across all subjects  for
sets of random locations not contained in the training set  is measured with average angular error and is given in
figure  a below as a function of the number of measurements  number of discrete binaural recordings  used in
estimating the continuous hrtf parameter

figure     a  average angular error  simulated localization with final c estimate  vs  number of training locations
 b  spectral distortion vs number of training locations as a function of sh interpolation order

the results of figure  a indicate that the average angular error in the simulated localization  over unseen sample
locations  decreases rapidly over small measurement set sizes  this means that the localization benefit obtained
from a small measurement set size is well generalizable over all relevant locations  and that it is likely unnecessary
to consider any measurement set sizes over     as the localization benefit for those sizes appears negligible 
to evaluate the performance of module    consider that a continuous hrtf that is sufficiently interpolated yields
minimal spectral distortion when compared to the sample hrtf from which it is constructed  figure  b above
highlights how the choice of order in the continuous hrtf interpolation  module    affects spectral distortion 
again is given as a function of the number of measurements used in the parameter estimation  the results show that
for a small measurement set size      locations   a high    th order  representation produces a less distorted
estimation of ground truth  since the higher orders in the spherical harmonic interpolation strategy represent a
projection onto a basis with a large frequency over space  it is plausible that when given a sizable measurement set
size        higher orders begin over fitting the data  all things considered  the lower   th  order representation
appears to benefit most from the design of the algorithm and presents an interesting point of discussion  as romigh
et  al     find that a  th order sh representation achieved localization accuracy at a level of performance comparable

fito a fully individualized hrtf  despite the fact that a low order representation induces a significant amount of both
spectral and spatial smoothing  the spectral smoothing present in a  th order estimate can be visualized in figure  

figure     th order hrtf magnitudes  in db  plotted as a function of angle along the median plane

 comparison between   different subjects for   different measurement set sizes 
figure   shows the dramatic progression of the estimation procedure as more locations are used in formation of the
estimation  each time the algorithm is run  it starts with the same initial guess for    the database average   given on
the far left and as is shown  does begin to capture the important features of an individuals ground truth   th order
hrtf that was custom measured in an anechoic facility  as a final point  its important to recognize that the results
presented here were exploratory in scope and that these insights into ideal measurement set sizes and interpolation
order  will serve to help guide the algorithm towards a more refined design 

 

conclusion and future work

this study used the iterative construct of a joint maximization em algorithm to derive a novel method for hrtf
estimation that eliminates both head tracking and or prior positional source location knowledge from the process 
keeping to the practical problem  assumptions were made which generalized each m step into a more modular form
and did in fact eliminate some of the rigor built into the strict em formulation  however  the overall method was
successful in its estimation of a continuous hrtf across a database of twelve subjects  as both the simulated
average angular error on testing data and the spectral distortion improved over the course of iteration  to ensure
robustness for measurements taken in everyday listening environments  the eventual objective   the necessary next
steps involve consideration of non anechoic and noisy recordings to see how the proposed method handles more
realistic input data  furthermore  note that currently  the testing locations are evenly distributed over  d space 
randomizing or perhaps developing realistic paths  representing the motions of a person using the technique  would
present an interesting follow up study  as well  finally  it is essential to begin formulating a plan for perceptual
testing of the estimated continuous hrtf structures  to ensure that the metrics defined function as suitable
maximum likelihood estimators
