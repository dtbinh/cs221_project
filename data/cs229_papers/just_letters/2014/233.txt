introduction

a lot of work has been done on automatic genre classification for music  there are various sources of
difficulties in this task  which have made human tagging of music tracks still far better than automated
systems  much of the work on music classification has focused on using supervised learning to
classifying music into broad genres like hip hop  rock  jazz  and classical  more recent
work has focused on automatically tagging songs with descriptive tags like cheerful and
melancholic for automatic playlist creation and song recommendation programs     
one big issue with studying music files is that many of the elements that humans use to construct and
deconstruct music  such as pitch  timbre  melody  tempo  vocal qualities  and rhythm  are not easily
extracted from music files  thus there has been an evolution of the features used to classify songs  one
of the most common low level features to use are mel frequency cepstral coefficients  mfccs  which
are transformations of the sound frequencies in the audio files  researchers have been successful to
some extent in genre classification using these types of features and supervised machine learning 
the aim of this project is to investigate the substructures of genres within popular music  rock  hip
hop  pop  etc   first music subgenres  ex  blues rock  will be created using unsupervised learning on
audio features that capture timbre  rhythm  and tempo  then these subgenres or clusters will be further
explored by examining the types of songs present in each  finally  the relationships between subgenres
will be explored  unlike other projects in genre classification  the purpose of this project is not to
classify music into human curated genres  but instead to find new genres and relationships by using
unsupervised machine learning 
 

dataset

the data used for this project comes from the musiclef      multimodal music data set      this is a
collection of music features such as mfccs  block level features  and ps   features for     
popular songs by     artists  the dataset also includes expert curated tags for each song in the dataset 
in order to evaluate and draw conclusions from the resulting clustering of songs  genre information
was added to this data set for each artist from wikipedia  for the purposes of this project  every song
by the same artist is associated with the same set of genres  however  expert tags are associated
directly with songs not artists 
 

features and preprocessing

i used three sets of features to obtain clusters from  block level features  blfs   ps   features and
mfcc features  to evaluate these clusters i used expert tags from the musiclef dataset and genre tags
scraped from wikipedia 
the blfs are a set of features found to perform well when using supervised learning to classify songs
     blfs include spectral pattern  sp   delta spectral pattern  dsp   variance delta spectral pattern
 vdsp   logarithmic fluctuation pattern  lfp   correlation pattern  cp  and spectral contrast
pattern  scp   respectively  these features reflect the timbre  onsets  strength of onsets  rhythmic
structure  harmonic relations  and tone ness      the authors who came up with blfs also created a
similarity measure which can be calculated between two songs based on these component audio
features  the weight of each component in this similarity measure was optimized to best classify a
music dataset using knn  in light of this  i chose to use the pairwise similarity measures between each
song as features 

fithe ps   features consist of  fluctuation patterns  fps   onset patterns  ops   and onset coefficients
 ocs   these roughly measure patterns of loudness and tempo      the authors who created this
feature extraction method also created a similarity measure  this measure is a combination of the three
novel feature distances and mfcc distances between two songs  the weight of each feature distance
in the similarity measure was chosen to optimize classification of songs using knn  i chose to use this
pairwise distance measure which roughly models the difference in loudness patterns  tempo and timbre
 because of the added mfcc distance component  
mfcc features were also used by finding pairwise euclidian distances between mfcc representations
of songs and using this distance matrix to perform k means  in summary  i used similarity scores based
on blfs  ps    and mfcc features to cluster songs 
 

models

k means clustering was used to divide the      songs into clusters of various sizes  i applied k means
to the blf pairwise similarity scores and the ps   similarity scores separately and then together  i ran
k means with k ranging from   to      since the aim of this project is to understand structure within
larger genres  i did not choose a k that was too small  choosing a k that was too large would create
small clusters of very similar songs  as opposed to subgenres  similar analysis was performed for
various choices of k but the presented results will be from k means run with k       clusters from the
blf similarity scores and ps   scores when k      provide interesting genre insights without creating
an unwieldy number of genres 
once the songs were clustered  the clusters were examined by looking at the distribution of genres 
artists  and tags within each cluster in conjunction with looking at the distances between clusters 
 

results

clustering was performed over mfcc  blf  and ps   similarity matrices  for every combination of k
and similarity matrix  i created a heat map to visualize the clusters  figure   and     the heat maps are
made by ordering songs by assigned cluster along the x and y axes  and then plotting the pairwise
similarity scores using colors to represent similarity  red is used to signify songs that are similar and
yellow represents songs that are very dissimilar  i used these visualizations to narrow down which
cluster assignments to further investigate 
the most promising clusterings resulted from running k means separately on the blf similarity matrix
and the ps   similarity matrix for k       clustering blf   and clustering ps    respectively   these
heat maps are shown in figures   and

fiafter determining cluster assignments for each song  i used expert tags  genre tags  and artists to
inspect these clusters  table   in the appendix shows a summary of what types of songs were found in
each cluster  i have listed the top five most common tags  genres  and artists found in each cluster 
each of the clusters the blf   clustering and ps   clustering is given a name that corresponds to the
subgenre that cluster represents  this name was created by combining the top two expert tags
associated with each cluster and the top two wikipedia genres associated with each cluster 
next  i found the sum for each cluster of the squared distances between each point and its assigned
centroid  i also determined the closest and farthest cluster  based on centroid location  for each cluster 
all of this is summarized in tables   and

discussion

using artists  genres  and tags to examine the clusters created using k means  we can see that the audio
features are capturing music qualities  first  table   clearly shows that this algorithm combined with
these features are able to correctly separate artists into clusters  more importantly  the clusters clearly
have different distributions of tags and genres  although  figures   and   show that the genres arent
perfectly and clearly delineated  this is to be expected given that a songs musical influences are usually
varied and numerous 
still  we can see that songs in the same cluster are more similar than songs in other clusters  we can
also see certain genres are extremely dissimilar  for example  in figure    cluster   fast hardalternative punk rock is very different from cluster    melancholic rock pop  but very similar to
cluster    energy pop hard rock  similarly in figure    cluster   chaotic hard  punk alternative

firock is very different from cluster   beat repetitive hip hop rhythm and blues and cluster   soft
romantic pop rhythm and blues 
from table    we see that cluster    soft romantic rhythm and blues soul and cluster   chaotic
hard  punk alternative rock are the most prevalent clusters in the farthest cluster column  from
this  we can conclude that perhaps these clusters are very different from many other musical genres 
graphs   through   give further insight into the qualities of music in different genres  for example 
graph   shows that virtually every cluster has many songs associated with the rhythm and blues
genre  which is to be expected given the profound influence of rhythm and blues on modern popular
music  however  graph   shows that heavy metal songs are overwhelmingly found in cluster  
because heavy metal has very distinct characteristics  similarly  songs tagged as catchy can be
found in every single cluster  but songs tagged as aggressive are also overwhelmingly found in
cluster    thus  this type of analysis helps identify what genres are influential in many types of music
versus specialized genres  we can also learn what types of tags are indicative of certain subgenres and
what descriptions are vague and easily applicable to many genres 
graphs         number of songs in rhythm and blues genre per cluster in blf       number of songs
classified as heavy metal per cluster blf       number of songs tagged with catchy in blf       number
of songs classified as aggressive per cluster in blf

conclusion and future work

one future direction of interest is to explore the evolution of genres throughout the   th century  to do
this  first i would like to augment this data set with more features and more songs  specifically  i
would like to add data about the year a song was written  the year a song was recorded  the artists
place of origin  and genre information by song as opposed to artist  in addition  an ideal data set would
have all of these features with more songs for each year 
given this augmented data set  similar analysis could be done to find relationships between artist
birthplace and song year and subgenre  further  i would like to create clusters similar to those created
in this project but within time periods  then  i would examine the closest clusters between time periods
in order to model the evolution of genres and subgenres  this could also give insight into how past
genres are combined to create new genres with multiple influences 
the question of discovering hidden relationships between music genres across time is not only a topic
of interest  but it also has potential commercial applications  this exploration could potentially lead to
using machine learning to determine artist influences  which is directly applicable to playlist creation
and song recommendation
