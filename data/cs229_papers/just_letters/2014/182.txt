abstract
to solve the issue of galaxy morphological classification according to a classification scheme modelled
off of the hubble sequence  we implement a pipeline of various machine learning algorithms including
support vector machines  svms  and gaussian discriminant analysis  gda   we derived a set of
features that we felt would best distinguish between the five classes of galaxies and used a forward
search to find the optimal subset  ultimately we found that the svm performed significantly better than
the gda model at every step in the pipeline 
  introduction
in       edward hubble developed a
classification scheme to divide galaxies into
distinct categories based upon morphological
features  this system  which would eventually
become known as the hubble sequence  consists
of   major categories of galaxies  elliptical 
lenticular  barred spiral  and spiral  as
technology has advanced and the sheer volume
of data produced by telescopes have increased 
a large number of galaxies have remained
unclassified  creating a bottleneck in
astronomical research  to address this issue 
projects like galaxy zoo have attempted to
crowdsource the classification process 
however  this introduces a high degree of human
error since the average participant in these
projects does not have a background in
astronomy  moreover  some of the features
depicted are virtually impossible to detect
insofar as the image quality and angle at which
the pictures can be taken are limited  to solve
this problem  we have implemented various
machine learning algorithms using a pipeline
approach to include only the most relevant
features at each step in the classification
process  a few papers have been published on
this topic  using various features and machine
learning techniques  our implementation looks
to build off of these implementations and test a

number of new parameters  additionally  we are
looking to test the efficacy of gaussian
discriminant analysis  which has to our
knowledge not been applied to this problem 

figure    this depicts a few classic example galaxies in
the four major categories of the hubble sequence

  dataset
the dataset consists of     images of galaxies
along with their correct classification in the
hubble classification scheme  the images were
found by searching nasas high energy
astrophysics science archive research center
 heasarc  for galaxies that were given a new
general catalogue identification or index
catalogue identification      this qualification
was included because in order to be given an
identification in these catalogues  these galaxies
were sure to have at least relatively clear

fipictures and have a definite classification  the
first     galaxies from the resulting list were
selected to be our data  the images were
obtained by following the links from heasarc to
digitized sky survey images of each galaxy
provided by skyview  the correct classifications
for these galaxies were then discovered by
following the link to the strasbourg astronomical
data center         
  preprocessing and features
before we extracted any features from the
images  we preprocessed the images to
normalize our training and test data  first  we
filtered out all the background noise  primarily
additional stars  by and blacking out everything
outside of the polygon defined by the contour
with the largest arc length in the picture  once
the stars had been removed  the picture was
centered on the cluster of pixels with the highest
mean intensity in the middle fifth column and
row of the picture  which correlated with the
center of the galaxy  lastly the color images were
converted to greyscale and black and white 

figure    this depicts the chain of events that occur in
the preprocessing stage 

for both of our models we relied on a set of  
image features that took advantage of the three
major morphological features used to
distinguish galaxies in the hubble sequence 
bars  rings  and spiral arms  there is one last
thing to note before discussing the features 
some of the pictures collected have been taken
at such an angle that their morphological
features are not discernable  this has been
commonly adopted into a fifth category known
as edge galaxies 

the first of our features was the number of times
the brightness oscillated moving from the center
of the galaxy to the edge totaled over each
cardinal direction  we defined an oscillation as a
change of at least     in mean brightness
between two adjacent   x   pixel regions  we
determined that should be useful for deciding
between non spiral  elliptical  lenticular  edge 
and spiral galaxies since spiral arms will cause
oscillations 
the next feature we calculated was the absolute
value of the brightness change moving from the
center of the galaxy to the edge  this feature was
selected to assist in separating barred spiral and
spiral galaxies since thicker spiral arms will have
a steeper intensity gradient  this complements
the first feature by giving more weight to larger
oscillations 
our third feature  rotational symmetry  was
chosen to distinguish non spiral galaxies from
spiral galaxies  to extract this feature  we
rotated the galaxy     degrees about its center 
we determined that this feature would be
helpful since elliptical galaxies should have a very
high degree of symmetry  while spirals would
have a large number of pixels in their spiral arms
that would not overlap  furthermore  an ideal
barred spiral would fall somewhere in the middle
of this spectrum due to the symmetry of the bar
that characterizes these galaxies 
the ellipticity of the brightest    percent area of
the galaxy  was calculated by analyzing a new
black and white image  derived from the
greyscale image  with a threshold at     of the
maximum brightness turned to black and white 
fitting an ellipse around the remaining pixels 
this defining feature of elliptical and lenticular
galaxies segregated it from the spirals 
moreover  the barred center of barred spirals
decides between barred spiral galaxies and non 

fibarred spiral galaxies since the center of barred
spiral galaxies will have high ellipticity as
opposed to the circular centers of non spiral
galaxies 
the next feature considered was the convexity of
the bounding polygon of the galaxy  since nonspiral galaxies will be bounded by an ellipse
whereas spiral galaxies will often have
concavities in between their arms 
the mean brightness of the galaxy  within the
bounding polygon was also added to the feature
set to distinguish spiral galaxies from barred
spiral galaxies  because barred spirals have
overall lower mean brightness since they have
longer arms that stretch further from the center
of the galaxy 
additionally  the ratio of white to black pixels
inside the bounding rectangle of the galaxy in the
black and white image was selected  we
predicted that this feature would primarily serve
as way to separate spiral galaxies and edge
galaxies from the rest since they will have lower
ratios of white to black pixels 
the ratio of the perimeter of the bounding
polygon of the galaxy to the bounding ellipse of
the galaxy was also used  spiral galaxies will have
highest polygon perimeter since they are
elliptical with many concavities  barred spiral
galaxies will be next since they generally have a
large concavity  and elliptical and lenticular
galaxies will have the highest ratio of all 
the last feature we employed was the rbulge
which is defined as the ratio of the shortest
radius at which the brightness has dropped to
    maximum brightness to the shortest radius
to the edge of the galaxy      spiral galaxies and
specifically barred spiral galaxies will drop in
brightness quicker as gaps between arms allow
the brightness to dip down abruptly 

after implementing forward search  we
narrowed were able to determine which
parameters were most useful at each step in the
classification process for both models

  models
the models that we used were gaussian
discriminate analysis and support vector
machines  gaussian discriminate analysis was
selected as our experimental model in this
project  if features are gaussian distributed this
the result of gda would have a very low error
and perhaps an undiscovered optimal model to
use for machine learning galaxy classification 
support vector machines were used as a
reference model since we had seen many
implementations that had succeeded with very
low error      the previous success of an svm
implementation with various sets of parameters
indicated that the training examples were
linearly separable 
lastly  we decided to take a fragmented
approach to classifying the galaxies to better
examine the utility of each of the morphological
features at each stage in the process

  discussion
in order to prevent overfitting and the use of
parameters that were not relevant for a specific
classification type  we used forward search
feature selection to find the best features to use
for each classification  this usually resulted in    features  of these  the mean brightness of the
galaxy and the ellipticity of the center of the
galaxy were the two parameters that seemed to
be the most useful 
our results clearly show that support vector
machines are superior to gaussian discriminant
analysis for galaxy classification with our

parameters  gaussian discriminant analysis had
very little success  usually obtaining training
error in the range of    percent  this shows that
the parameters cannot be well modeled as
gaussian with the morphological features that
were used  even after adjusting the amount of
features as well as the size of k in our kfold cross
validation from    to both   and     the gda
failed to find a fit that was comparable to that of
the svm  additionally  the fit of the support
vector machine shows that the features we
selected here were also linearly separable 

fi  future
normalizing and preprocessing our images more
would be an important step forward in our work 
yet a major undertaking  a common obstacle in
the algorithm came from the fact that galaxies
that are not directly perpendicular to the earth
are seen at an inclination  thus  the images
contain galaxies at various inclinations  circular
spiral galaxies seen at an inclination will appear
elliptical  since a number of our parameters
depend upon analyzing the ellipticity of the
galaxy  the height and width of the galaxy  and
the density of pixels in an area and these
parameters assume that the galaxy is seen
directly perpendicular  they are thrown off by
these inclined galaxies  in order to solve this
problem  the perpendicular view of these
inclined galaxies would need to be projected
from their images  this is a complicated
procedure since it is difficult to tell if a galaxy is
inclined  simply naturally very elliptic  or a barred
spiral galaxy with only two short arms 
another problem that often arose was that the
brightness and the size of galaxies in the images
were not consistent  some of the elliptical
galaxies took up the entire image without
including any of the dark space around the
galaxy  while other images had an expanse of
space around the galaxy  our features that
worked with the borders of the galaxy were hard
to implement when the borders of the galaxy
were sometimes not found to be included in the
picture  preprocessing that works to normalize
the maximum and minimum brightness in the
images and the size of the galaxy within the
image would serve to remedy this problem 
lastly  despite having tested the applications of
nine different parameters in separating the
types of galaxies  there are a number of others

that could perhaps be useful if we were to
implement them  some of these include spectral
signature and light color  implemented by n  ball
in robust machine learning applied to
astronomical data sets       and photometric 
texture  and spectral data available from galaxy
zoo  implemented a  gauci et al  in machine
learning for galaxy morphology classification
