abstract

one of the biggest challenges of instructing robots in natural language  is the conversion of goals into executable
instructions      a core problem in this area is to train the robot to identify the specific actions  verbs  that help fulfil
the goal using the objects  nouns  at its disposal  this project presents a new algorithm  which we call extracto 
to extract noun verb noun relationships from unstructured text  extracto is built on the coupled pattern learner
framework       presented by the creators of the never ending language learner  nell  project  extracto gives a
    precision in identifying suitable action verbs  given two nouns  we have extended this to create the extractocategorize algorithm that extracts actions for the categories of the respective nouns instead of the nouns themselves 
this increases extraction precision to      since this is a first of its kind method created purely for this purpose
 noun verb noun extraction   we have benchmarked it against related algorithms that extract semantic relationships
from unstructured text  existing algorithms reach precision levels of                     which is in line with extractos
performance 

 

introduction

robots are advancing rapidly in their behavioural functionality allowing them to perform sophisticated tasks 
however  their ability to take natural language instructions is still in its infancy  parsing  semantic intrepretation and dialogue management are typically performed
only on a limited set of primitives  thus limiting the set
of instructions that could be given to a robot  this limits
a robots applicability in unconstrained natural environments  like households and offices      
in this project  we are only addressing the problem of
semantic interpretation of human instructions  specifically  our extracto algorithm provides a method to extract potential actions  verbs  that could be performed
given two household objects  nouns   for example  given
the nouns coffee and cup  extracto identifies the
action  verb  pour indicating that coffee should be
poured in a cup  and not stored or roasted  a human
instruction i want coffee or get me a cup of coffee is
a goal for the robot  but does not specifically instruct the
robot what to do with the cup and the coffee  the extracto method helps address this particular problem  in
addition  given an action  verb   extracto identifies the
most suitable objects  nouns  to perform the task  for
example  given an action  verb  introduce  extracto
identifies a series of suitable noun pairs  one of which is
friend and host which means a friend is to be intro  a asbhat stanford edu
  b kiyer stanford edu
  c vrahul stanford edu

the rest of our report is structured as follows  in section    we take you through a short summary of past work
done in this area  next  in section   and    we explain
our data sources and processing steps  section   gives a
detailed explanation about extracto and its extension to
extracto categorize  this is followed by a summary of
our key results in section    to conclude we present our
ideas on future potential in section    our acknowledgements in section   and references in section   

 

related work

fundamentally  there are three approaches to extracting
semantic word relationships      supervised      unsupervised and     bootstrap learning starting with very small
seed instances  a supervised approach would involve labelling entities in a text corpus  and then training classifiers to capture relations between pairs of entities in a
sentence or a combination of sentences            this is
expensive and the resulting classification algorithm would
be biased towards the particular corpus  unsupervised
approaches extract abundantly many strings  for subsequent relation extraction  from large amounts of text  but
it would be difficult to map extracted relations to a particular knowledge base          the third approach starts
with a small set of seed instances  which generate more
instances which in turn generate even more instances iteratively                 this approach helps us overcome
the shortcomings of the first two approaches  and hence
we chose this 

fithere have been several past attempts to extract semantic relationships using the third approach  starting with a seed set   but none have been specifically
aimed at extracting noun verb noun relationships which
we are targeting  some of the most relevant studies are indicated here  carlson et al        present a
framework for semi supervised learning in a similar context  nell   specifically  their coupled pattern learner
 cpl  methodology lays out the broad framework of
how one can extract word relationships given an ontology and a text corpus  the cpls precision ranges from
    to      for a variety of relationships  for example  x is a building  y is a conference  company p
produces product q etc    averaging a precision of     
pantel et al  present an algorithm     that is designed
to harvest is a  protein  biopolymer   part of  oxygen  air  relations along with succession  ford  nixon  
reaction  boron  flourine  and production  kidney  kidney
stones  pairs  they achieve a precision of     on newsarticles text and     precision on a chemistry textbook 
similar to our extracto algorithm  the three core steps of
their algorithm are pattern induction  ranking selection
and instance extraction 

 

data sources

the set of seed instances     in number  were constructed manually from our teams understanding of regular kitchen and home behaviour of humans  this comprises noun verb noun relations like cup drink coffee 

nouns  instead of the nouns themselves  for example 
categories of coffee would include beverage and liquid among others  as shown in figure     these are
sourced recursively from the hypernym relations given
by princeton wordnet      

fig    coffee categories  hypernyms  from wordnet    

 

features and pre processing

the noun verb noun triads are the equivalent of features for this method  these are extracted using the
syntactic tree output from the stanford parser      and
the parts of speech tagger from the natural language
toolkit  nltk  python libraries  also  the nltk lemmatizer       looking up princeton wordnet  is used to
lemmatise nouns and get to their tense less root forms 
for example  poured  pouring and pours are all converted to pour

coffee

cup

unstructured data about relevant nouns  say  coffee  were obtained by crawling the respective pages
on the domains 
en wikipedia org  wikihow com 
simple wikipedia org  thefreedictionary com  yourdictionary com  the crawlers  spider programs  were built
using the python library scrapy  in addition  full
books and novels of relevant topics from project gutenberg were taken  some examples include the ladies
book of etiquette  and manual of politeness by florence
hartley  etiquette by emily post and manners and
rules of good society or solecisms to be avoided  in
extracto categorize  we use categories of the respective

fig    extracting features from unstructured text

 

models

as a quick proof of concept  we did a traditional bag ofwords exercise  we split unstructured data into buckets  roughly  paragraphs   and estimated the probability
of a verb  say  pour  occurring given two nouns  say 
cupand coffee   the verb relation is considered valid
if the probability of the specific verb occurring  given the
two nouns is greater than      after we observed promising results using the bag of words approach  we implemented and refined our extracto algorithm 

fiitively   the precision of results predicted increases when
larger seed sets are used  figure    

fig    increasing relations and precision with every
iteration
fig    a sample syntactic tree     

at the very core  the extracto algorithm identifies actions  verbs  that fit with the seed nouns from unstructured text  and then finds some more new nouns that fit
with the newly found actions  verbs   the noun verbnoun relations are ranked and then best few are added
to the seed set as inputs to the next iteration  this way 
extracto predicts more and more noun verb noun triads
iteratively 
table   extracto method   pseudocode
input  seed set of relationships  unstructured text corpus
output  predicted set of noun verb noun relationships
repeat full sequence till no new triads generated
for each noun noun pair in the seed set
identify verbs suited to respective noun noun pair
extract new noun noun pairs with newly obtained verbs
rank the set of triads obtained
update seed set with highest ranked triads
promote the highest ranked triads to seed set

a major step of extracto is the identification of semantically related nouns and verbs from unstructured data 
we parse each sentence using the stanford parser     
to obtain a syntactic tree relationship similar to figure
   for example  noun subject  nsubj  and objective
 dobj  relations are very clear associations between verbs
and nouns  in the second step of identifying more nouns
that fit the extracted action  verb   we use the ntlk
pos tagger to capture the full list of nouns in the respective sentences  since the most relevant of these outputs
are taken and added as feed to the next iteration  every iteration produces more relationships with increased
accuracy  as shown in the figure    further  and intu 

fig    increasing precision with larger seed set sizes

in order to improve the precision of extracted relationships  we have implemented a novel extension to the
extracto method  we call it extracto categorize  we
could substantially improve relationship capture by looking for the nouns category instead of the noun itself in
the unstructured text corpus  for example  we are looking for the relevant verbs  like pour  when we try to
connect coffee and cup  instead of searching for coffee and cup  we are more likely to find a relationship  in
any unstructured text  if we search for any beverageand
any container  so  even if the text contains sentences
which leads to links like milk pour glass  beer pourmug  wine pour chalice or tea pour cup  the pour
action  verb  will get captured for coffee and cup 

 

results and discussion

the success metric we have chosen is precision  which we
define as the number of correct relationships extracted 
among all the relationships finally produced by extracto 
the correct relationships were manually identified and
accepted as correct if an internet search of the three words
together resulted in the intended action being the first
result 

fitable   incorrect relationships predicted by
extracto categorize

p recision  

n umber of relevant results extracted
t otal number of results extracted
   

extracto led to the following results  precision of predicting verbs given nouns was      and precision of predicting nouns given verbs was      some good example
relations extracted are shown in table    and some wrong
ones extracted are shown in table   
we extended the extracto algorithm and implemented
the extracto categorize method to improve the precision
of predicting verbs given nouns  with this extension  the
precision improved from     to      some of the new
relations obtained after this extension are shown in tables
   useful results  and    incorrect results

conclusion and potential for future
work

we believe our extracto and extracto categorize algorithms provide a quick and robust mechanism to predict
word relationships from unstructured text data  this is a
key step in taking natural language instructions to robots 
to the next level  although no other algorithm addresses
the requirement at this level of specificity  our     precision is found to be in line with other broader and related
algorithms that extract word relationships from unstructured data

the immediate next step on this would be the representation of all predicted relationships in a network   graph
of relationships  that would be easily understood by a
robot  a cost function estimate would help determine
the most suitable action  verb  given a host of potential
options  in the future  extracto could be extended to obtain relationships for other areas outside the household as
well  extensions include hospital assistance  sports training  office spaces and laboratories   for this to be successful  we will need to create a mechanism for automatically
choosing the websites to crawl  and the books to read
