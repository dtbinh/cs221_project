e commerce sales prediction using listing keywords

introduction

small online retailers usually set themselves apart from brick and mortar stores  traditional
brand names  and giant online retailers by offering goods at exceptional value  in addition to
price  they compete for shoppers attention via descriptive listing titles  whose effectiveness as
search keywords can help drive sales  in this study  machine learning techniques will be applied
to online retail data to measure the link between keywords and sales volumes

data description

the dataset used in the study is a data sample of     dress sale listings on the ali express
online platform  provided by the uci machine learning repository  bache and lichman       
it contains sales numbers and    product attributes for the merchandise  the sales numbers are
snapshots taken from the listing in fall      and represent the sold volumes in the   months
prior to the snapshot date  the product attributes include style  price  shape  and design
categories  additionally  listing titles and descriptions are collected using a web crawler tool on
the urls provided  the texts are appended to the corresponding dress item 
for this study  a binary label for the dataset is created  based on the average sales volume   
denotes a popular item with high volume sales  and   denotes otherwise  selecting a threshold of
    for the average sales volume yields a       split between the hot or not sellers  i e  an item
that is sold on average at least once a day in the last   months is considered to be a high sales
item for a small online retailer  the modeling experiments for this binary classification problem
discussed in the later section are meant to assess the effect of keywords on predicting sales
performance 

   

textual feature creation

words are parsed from the texts downloaded from the dress webpages  the uses of the words
are tallied up and the most common words  e g  free shipping  fashion        minus the stop
words  e g  the  a  and  constitute the bag of     words in this study  ahn and spangler       
unlike literature and news articles  sale listing title and descriptions are short and succinct to
capture shoppers attention span  how many times a word is used in a listing is not as relevant
in this domain as what words are used  thus  a textual feature is created for each word as a
binary variable denoting the presence of the word in the listing 

   

feature selection

correlation analysis is performed on the dataset to see which words are highly correlated with
the high sales item listings and how they correlate with each other  yu et al         to avoid
collinearity  words that convey redundant information are removed  the remaining salescorrelated words become candidate predictor variables for a model scenario later 
aikaike information criterion  aic  is also used to perform feature selection  it provides a
systematic way of selecting features that minimizes information loss by balancing the tradeoff
between goodness of fit and model complexity  kaya and karsligil        it serves as a
regularization technique that penalizes models with poor fit and models with too many
parameters  feature sets determined from forward search  backward search  and bidirectional
search using aic respectively are examined for statistical significance using p value  statistically

 

fiinsignificant features are removed from each set  and the resulting variables are experimented as
separate model scenarios

model experiments

there are   scenarios to experiment using original data with  i  no textual features  ii  all
textual features  iii  correlated textual features  iv  textual features from forward search  v 
textual features from backward search  and vi  textual features from bidirectional search  the
first scenario serves as a baseline for comparison with additional textual information on sales
prediction  data is pre processed for the    fold cross validation to be conducted during the
model training and testing process  the dataset is randomly split  such that each run uses    
for training and     for testing  logistic regression and support vector machine are standard
models used for binary classification problems and are explored for this study  culotta       
the multiple model approach provides additional validation of the effect of keywords on sales
prediction 
the logistic regression model fit outputs predicted probabilities of the samples having positive
labels  and probability of     or more is considered a prediction of the item as being popular
and having high sales  the svm model classifies samples according to where they fall with
respect to the support vector decision boundary  initial tests show that svm models trained
with the common gaussian kernel are overfitting the data and do not generalize well  after
experimenting with different kernels  the linear kernel delivers the most reasonably close train
and test errors and is thus chosen for the svm model  it suggests that a linear decision
boundary is appropriate for the set of e commerce sales data used in this study

fiprediction accuracy and sales prediction precision are the metrics used to evaluate the
effectiveness of the features and models in identifying the high sales item listings  prediction
accuracy is calculated as the percentage of predictions being correct out of all predictions made 
sales prediction precision is calculated as the percentage of high sales  i e  positive  predictions
being correct out of all high sales  i e  positive  predictions made  prediction accuracy and
precision of the holdout sets are respectively averaged from the    cross validation runs for each
model type in each scenario 

 

result evaluation

the first scenario sets up the baseline metrics for other scenarios with textual features to
measure up against  the second scenario demonstrates an overfitting situation  in which all
textual features are being thrown into the model  including irrelevant features  i e  nonessential
words  into the model actually deteriorates the models ability to detect high sales listings from
those that are not

figure    table of prediction results by scenario
the models in scenarios iii through vi contain heuristically selected textual features and have
been found to outperform the baseline scenario in almost all result categories  the performance
lifts in prediction accuracy and sales prediction precision over random behavior and baseline
scenario reinforce the notion that certain keywords can be effective indicators of popular online
listings with high sales volumes 

 

conclusion

in this study  a set of online retail sales data is examined to assess the impact of listing
keywords on predicting sales performance  textual features are created from the e commerce
dataset  and candidate predictor variables are selected based on correlation and aic analyses 
 

fiscenarios are constructed to measure the lift in predictive power of including appropriate
textual features into models to classify sales popularity  experiment results suggest that
incorporating certain keywords boosts classifier accuracy and sales prediction precision 
additional a b testing can be carried out to further investigate whether keywords actually
drive higher sales by setting up variant listings with identical content except the exclusion of
keywords in the control group 
other variants to this study can be explored in the future  instead of employing greedy
heuristics in feature selection  models can be optimized by adding regularization directly to the
objective functions  different classifier models like naive bayes and decision tree ensemble
methods that do make many assumptions on the underlying data distribution can also be
investigated  furthermore  the existing system design can be tested on more sales datasets to
refine its methodology and prove its validity
