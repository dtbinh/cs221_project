abstract
accelerometer and gyrometer data were collected from   construction workers during regular work days in order to distinguish between different activities  these activities   hammering  sawing  sweeping and drilling   were
collected with a smart watch attached to the workers dominant hand  with
a sampling rate of   hz  the dataset was divided into training and test set
with two different partitions         and        training test   a preprocessing stage was first performed in order to minimize three main sources of
problems   noise  gravity influence  and outliers  then     features  including time and frequency domain  were extracted from a window of    samples
     seconds   five different algorithms were tested in order to verify their
performances  the tests were conducted using the two different partitions
of training and testing  a feature selection algorithm was performed in
order to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and evaluate the
models performance  finally  a last test was conducted by comparing the
performance of each algorithm using both sensors data and using only accelerometr data  the best performance measured by the number of correctly
classified activities was     
   introduction
we have seen in the last few years a significant increase in the wearables
industry  many new devices are coming to market every year  and the main
reason is because the price of sensors such as accelerometers and gyrometers are getting cheaper every year due to the smart phone industry push 
therefore  the possibility of collecting continuous data and perform further
analysis can be a powerful tool in many different applications  nowadays
we are seeing many applications of wearable devices in fitness and health
industry  however  no application was found by the author  until this date 

fiwhere wearable devices are being used to classify work related activities of
construction workers  by being able to better quantify direct work   job
hours spent doing activities related to work   and indirect work   activities
not related to work  e g  waiting and preparing material   general contractors can bid projects with more confidence  increase their profit margin  find
bottlenecks on workflow and so on  in this paper  a first step was taken towards the goal of increasing and understanding productivity in construction
sites  we evaluate different machine learning algorithms that aim to classify
construction activities such as hammering  sawing  sweeping  and drilling
based on accelerometer and gyrometer data 
   previous work
there has been a large variety of works trying to identify user activities
based on accelerometers and gyrometers  a high number of papers are focused on fitness by classifying activities such as walking  running  cycling
etc  some examples are found in     and      however  in a much smaller
number  papers focused in different applications can also be found  in     
accelerometer data is used to identify posture orientation  periods of activity and rest and when important events happen with patients such as fall 
    uses accelerometer data to identify user traits such as sex  height  and
weight  in      accelerometers are used to identify anomalies in an helicopter
transmission system  this adds a new layer of information that is crucial
for making sure the system is in good conditions  in      accelerometer and
microphone data are used to track the progress of maintenance or assembly
tasks in a workshop  in      a wiimote is used to detect a dictionary of    basic hand gestures  in addition to the referenced works  commercial systems
are available  with open apis  where users can develop applications on top
of the classifiers  however  they are limited in the number of activities it
can recognize  the lack of research in applying machine learning techniques
to construction environments motivated this work 
   data set and preprocessing
data from a  d accelerometer and  d gyrometer was collected using the
gearlive smart watch from samsung with sampling rate of   hz  previous research has shown that frequencies between       hz are enough to
capture human movements      an app running on the watch  and phone 
was developed in order to collect data and send it to a paired phone via
bluetooth  the app running on the phone was responsible to send the data
 

fito a webserver where it could be accessed  the data was collected from
  subjects in three different days and labeled during each activity  this
data set comprises of approximately    daily repetitions of each movement
done by each subject  this provided us with a total of approximately    
repetitions of each movement 
after collecting the data  signal processing techniques were performed in
order to minimize noise  gravity influence and outliers  thus  two different
type of filters were used  first a third order butterworth with cutoff of   hz
was used to remove high frequency noise and then a third order elliptic filter
with an edge frequency of    hz was used to remove gravitys influence     
   feature extraction and feature selection
raw data coming from accelerometers and gyrometers very rarely can be
used directly  thus  after a preprocessing step  features were extracted from
the raw data within a time frame  in order to characterize users physical
activity  in      a survey of the most common activities used in contextrecognition is presented 
for this work  a total of    features  time and frequency domain  were
extracted with a     overlap window of    samples  among this    features     were related to accelerometer and    to gyrometer  common
time domain based metrics such as mean  variance  percentiles  max  min 
correlation coefficients  rotation angle  and signal magnitude area were extracted  partially from each of the three axes  partially from the magnitude 
frequency domain features such as spectral energy and entropy was computed for both  magnitude and axes 
a feature selection algorithm     was used in order to evaluate the potential of reducing the dimensionality of the feature set with respect to
the models accuracy  this algorithm performs a forward backward search
where it alternately adds features to the feature vector with the current
best quality and remove features based on a minimal threshold gain  thus
examining subsets of combinations that have not been considered before  
a map showing the four different classes and all features is shown in figure

and quadratic discriminant analysis  qda   for each algorithm  two different partitions between training and test data were performed        and
        within each partition  accelerometer only and accelerometer and
gyrometer data were used in order to evaluate the effect of the gyrometer
sensor with the accuracy of the different models  subsets of the feature set
were also evaluated

the diagonal elements are the percentage of correct classified activities and
the off diagonal are the misclassification percentage 
   conclusions and future work
the results show that from the five models we tested the one that provided the best results was qda       followed by mlr       and lda
         also the performance of all models were increased when they were
trained with more data  in addition  the number of features used degrade
the performance of all models differently  finally  the addition of the gyrometer did not considerably improve the accuracy thus not justifying its
use due to added cost and higher computational effort 
some attempts can be made to improve models accuracy  the first one
is increasing the dataset size and adding more workers so the classifiers can
become more general  next  adding new features such as wavelets coeffients 
time between peaks in a window  and performing data segmentation has
shown to help improve accuracy 
this project will keep being developed as a part of a bigger tool that
is currently being develop by the company the author works  thus the
next steps will be testing new algorithms such as hidden markov models 
also more classes will be added  the final goal is being able to classify
activities as being direct work  e g hammering   indirect work  e g  material
preparation   and no work  e g  lunch time   lastly  we want to understand
 

fithe relation between workers  e g  worker   is not working because he she
depends on workers   finalizing his her job
