this document is the final project report for the cs     machine learning course
at stanford university  the project aims to quantify the qualitative description of
different bird species using machine learning techniques and use it as an effective
tool for bird species identification from images 

 

introduction

identification of bird species is a challenging task often resulting in ambiguous labels  even professional bird watchers sometimes disagree on the species given an image of a bird  it is a difficult
problem that pushes the limits of the visual abilities for both humans and computers  although different bird species share the same basic set of parts  different bird species can vary dramatically in
shape and appearance  intraclass variance is high due to variation in lighting and background and
extreme variation in pose  e g   flying birds  swimming birds  and perched birds that are partially
occluded by branches  
our project aims to employ the power of machine learning to help amateur bird watchers identify
bird species from the images they capture 

 

dataset

caltech and ucsd have gathered data to produce the caltech ucsd birds           cub          dataset      the dataset contains        images of     bird species  the list of species
names was obtained using an online field guide  images were harvested using flickr image search
and then filtered by showing each image to multiple users of mechanical turk

features

a vocabulary of    attribute groupings and     binary attributes  e g   the attribute group belly
color contains    different color choices  was selected based on an online tool for bird species
identification  all attributes are visual in nature  with most pertaining to a color  pattern  or shape
of a particular part  some examples of attributes are 
 has back color  red
 has bill shape  cone
 has wing shape  pointed wings

 

algorithms

we realized that the essence of the project was to understand the intricacies of different machine
learning algorithms and to learn which algorithm gives good results for which use case  with this
philosophy  we wrote our own implementations of knn and naive bayes in matlab  an added
advantage of not using any library was that we could tweak whatever parameters we wanted to 
looking at the results of these two algorithms  we got a baseline for future techniques that could
be implemented using available libraries 
we observed that libraries like scikit learn allowed us to tweak different aspects of an algorithm 
but maybe not to the extent of our own implementation of the algorithm  we faced an inherent
trade off between tweaking ability and the number of algorithms that could be implemented and
tested in the time frame of the project  we chose trying out numerous algorithms using the scikit
learn library     in python 
   naive bayes
   support vector machines
   k nearest neighbors
   linear discriminant analysis  lda 
   decision trees
   random forests
   one versus rest classifiers with logistic regression
based on the results obtained  we chose the best three techniques to improvise on  we used various
feature selection and feature reduction techniques to see if we can improve the accuracy further  we
started with changing kernels for svm   linear and radial basis functions  next  we did feature
reduction using pca and applied svm  logistic regression and lda on the reduced features  we
 

fithen used feature selection techniques like l  based method  removing features with low variance 
univariate feature selection and tree based feature selection  a slight improvement gave us hope
and we decided to play with it more  we used pca for feature reduction followed by feature
selection to obtain a new feature data  on this data  we implemented lda  logistic regression
and svm  this improved the accuracy further 
in the end  we tried including the certainty values of features into our model  that is  we converted
the original binary feature data into   discrete values between   and   based on the certainty  on
running algorithms on this data  no significant change was observed 

 

results

we trained and tested our algorithms on the complete data set to start with  later we randomly
separated the data set into training data and test data so that we had samples from each class 
    of the data was used as training data and     was used as test data  the following figures
and tables show the results we observed on implementing algorithms as mentioned in the above
section 
figure   shows the training versus testing accuracy for different learning methods that we implemented  figure   shows the testing accuracy using different techniques on three of the learning
methods   lda  svm and logistic regression

discussion

we initially observed low accuracy with basic implementation of naive bayes and knn in matlab  we then observed improved accuracy with library implementations of svm  lda and logistic regression  feature selection and feature reduction improved the accuracy to      we
believe such an accuracy for a     class classification problem is fairly decent

future work
   we implemented neural networks and when we ran it on our machine for just   hidden
neurons  it went out of memory and could not complete  so  we can try to run neural
networks on high performance computing machines 
   computer vision algorithms can be used for automatic feature extraction 
   we can develop an android ios application that identifies a bird in real time on clicking its
