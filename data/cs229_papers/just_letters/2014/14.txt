abstract
wearable technology presents a uniquely
convenient and portable way to record
physiological data from users  which could be
used to monitor health or recreational activities 
with increasing amounts of such data  it would
be useful to automatically categorize a users
activity based on this data  our paper utilizes
machine learning to classify user activity  and
we compare the strengths and weaknesses of
supervised and unsupervised learning
approaches using lda  svm and random
forest classifiers  and k means clustering
classifiers  respectively  we then discuss which
of these algorithms show the best performance
for general activity recognition 
   introduction
as wearable tech becomes increasingly
prevalent  vast amounts of additional data will be
generated and made available to better
understand the activities users are performing in
real time  wearable tech is also uniquely
convenient because of its ability to receive
information from an individual user in essentially
real time without the need for external
infrastructure  using this knowledge  targeted
marketing or predictions can be made about
what a user might want to do next based on
mood associated with physiological markers 
the task at hand is to understand the
relationship between the biometric data
collected from wearable technology and the
activities users are engaged in 
in this paper  we discuss the use of
different machine learning techniques for
determining a users activity from a dataset that
was collected for the physiological data
modeling contest at icml in       this dataset
maps participant characteristics  such as age
and gender  to physiological data that was

collected over time during a known activity 
using a training set annotated with codes
indicating the type of activity the user was
engaged in during the measurements  we train
multiclass classifiers to identify the type of
activity the participant was performing based on
physiological markers  the scope of this study
follows the guidelines of the pdmc contest
which focused on the ability to distinguish
between sleeping  watching tv  and all other
activities 
   review of previous work
wearable sensor technology has been
investigated as an effective way to regularly
monitor individual health  researchers at mit
have used wearable technology to build a
mobile  personal profile that records vital signs 
motor activity  and sleep patterns so that users
can look at these health indicators on a real time
basis      and some research has been done to
use machine learning to map emotional state to
features from physiological data      wearable
accelerometers have been used to quantify and
classify motor ability in recovering stroke victims
     and accelerometers have been used in
elderly care to recognize when someone has
fallen     
especially in these health related
applications  it is easy to see that any activity
classification algorithms must be very accurate
and robust in the face of a changing user  most
machine learning applications rely on learning
from heavily annotated data run through svm
classifiers  and since data is often not so readily
categorized  our project aims to see how
unsupervised learning algorithms compare to
supervised approaches 
   dataset  features  and preprocessing
we obtained our data from a set that was
collected for the physiological data modeling
contest at icml in       this dataset was
collected from participants wearing bodymedia
wearable technology and includes details of
participant age  handedness  and gender  as
well as physiological markers including galvanic
skin response  heat flux  body temperature  skin
temperature  and accelerometer measurements 

 

fithe physiological data that each sensor records
is specified in table    data was collected from
   users across several sessions  with
measurements taken each minute  over    k
training examples were made  of which
approximately    k were annotated

figure    correlations between biometric sensors and
select training data distributions 

figure   shows the correlations for each of
the nine sensors for which we can see that the
physiological data are not always independent of
one another  indeed  features like average skin

temperature and heat flux are naturally
correlated  which is accounted for during feature
selection for some of our algorithms  figure  
also shows sample data distributions which were
transformed as needed during pre processing 
the data was pre processed by first
removing outliers and incomplete entries 
transformations were applied to reduce spread
and skew in the data  new binary features  such
as a walking field from pedometer data  were
created to use in model training  activity
annotations were reclassified into either
sleeping  watching tv  or other  as outlined in
the pdmc contest 
   implemented algorithms
we aimed to compare the efficacy of
supervised versus unsupervised learning
algorithms by implementing linear discriminant
analysis  lda   support vector machines  svm 
with different kernels  and the random forest
model for supervised models  and a k means
clustering approach for the unsupervised model 
here  we discuss the method behind each
approach and the results that were produced 
      linear discriminant analysis  lda 
linear discriminant analysis reduces the
feature dimension  and separates data points
into classes based on the reduced feature
subspace  this reduced features space is
computed through maximizing the separation
between multiple classes  because the
algorithm requires this information about the
classes  lda is a supervised learning algorithm 
the main steps of the algorithm start with
computing the means of the feature vectors and
computing the within class scatter matrix  sw 
using these means  the between class scatter
matrix  sb  is then computed using the sample
sizes and means of all the classes in the training
data  to incorporate the effects from both within
and between class variations  the algorithm
  
computes the eigenvalues for the matrix  sw sb 
the eigenvalues play an important role in
determining the new features subspace  as the
eigenvalues with lower values contain less
information about the distribution of the data  a

 

finumber of eigenvalues are chosen to construct
the new features space  and a matrix  w  is
computed to transform the samples into the new
subspace  the final objective function  d  for the
algorithm is to maximize 
   
       
 
  
for our classification of activities  we need
to distinguish between three classes  sleep  tv 
and other  we use lda to reduce the number of
features to    and classify the activities based on
this new subspace  as shown in figure   below 
the confusion matrix  as well as the precision 
recall  and f scores for this algorithm are
shown in table

points that lie closest to the decision boundary 
the algorithm aims to maximize this distance to
better separate the classes  the objective
function that achieves this is the following 




  

   

 
max                  
 
      
    
      
this function arises from the primal form 
which maximizes the functional margin  or
essentially how far the closest sample point is
from the boundary  to make this problem easier
to solve  we work with the dual form of the
objective  shown above  in most cases   will be
zero  in the few cases of the support vectors  the
 will be nonzero  the kernel in the equation
allows for feature mapping and nonlinear
decision boundaries 
initially  we trained svms using     of the
training data using the default parameters in the
r package e     and altered the kernel function
type  linear  radial  polynomial and sigmoidal  in
order to determine which kernel provided
optimal classification  the radial kernel function
was found to provide the best performance  and
the sigmoidal kernel the worst  which is
highlighted in table    using the radial kernel 
training and test errors were measured as a
function of the number of training examples 
ranging from   k to    k examples  figure    
increasing the number of training examples
resulted in small improvements in both reducing
measured training and test errors  this suggests
that we should further optimize our choice of
features rather than increase our training set
size  the confusion matrix and precision  recall 
and f scores are shown for the radial kernel in
table    based on these results  we can
conclude that our svm model provides more
accurate classification than lda  with almost a
doubled f score for the tv class  which is the
most frequently misclassified activity 

     support vector machines  svm 
support vector machines is a supervised
learning algorithm that classifies objects based
on the support vectors of a dataset  or the data

     random forest
random forest fits decision trees to
randomly selected samples of data from the
training set and features  and makes predictions

for new data by averaging the predictions from
all trees  we applied a random forest model of
     trees  which showed slightly improved
performance compared to our svm model 
improved f scores were measured for all three
classes of activity compared to our svm model 
the confusion matrix and precision  recall  and
f scores are shown in table   
     k means clustering
k means is an unsupervised algorithm that
clusters data based on how close they are to a
determined cluster centroid  it essentially relies
on the closeness of data that describes one
class  and distance between separate classes of
data  we thought that k means applied to
activity recognition would be useful to compare
to supervised learning algorithms as well as
useful because it has the advantage of not
requiring annotated data  which for wearable
technology would make data collection easier 
in order to apply k means to activity
recognition based on sensor data  we take the
set of training data and sample three sensor
data examples randomly to create three initial k
means  which are also our initial centroids 
these are three vectors of length nine to
account for each sensor value  we then go
 i 
through all of the sensor data  x and calculate
which of these three means it is closest to as
determined by the squared error to create
cluster of data points  one cluster for each of the
centroids  we then update the value of the
centroids based on minimizing the error between
the centroid and the cluster sensor data that is
assigned to them  this is the objective function
of the k means algorithm and is described in the
equation below  where d is the function to be
minimized  xi the nine dimensional data points in
the training set  and cj the current centroids 



  

     

  

 

     

we then run these steps for forming
clusters and updating centroids repetitively until
the values of the centroids stop changing or
have only changed a trivial amount  then we

sensor 

can say that this algorithm has reached
convergence and that a local optimum has been
reached  k means does not guarantee that a
global optimum has been reached because that
optimum is dependent on the initial random
choice of centroids  k means also works best for
clusters of data that are well separated  but in
the case of physiological data  there is often a
lot of overlap 
we applied k means to the separation of
three activities  sleeping  watching tv  and
other  k means with k   was applied to cluster
the three activities in a nine dimensional space 
the k means clusters and centroids are shown
in fig    along with the actual class distributions 
the error of k means prediction was       
 taken as an average over three runs

   conclusions and future work
this project demonstrated how machine
learning can be applied to a variety of specific
activity related diagnostics  our work shows that
supervised learning algorithms provide the most
accurate recognition  with the random forest
algorithm having the most promising f scores 
which indicate accuracy based on precision and
recall  our unsupervised algorithm could not
separate the data as well as the supervised
approaches  however  work could be done to
further improve this approach  which would
make it easier to handle large amounts of
individual data supplied by wearable tech  to
improve the accuracy of our models  additional
pre processing could be done  including
normalizing the biometric sensors for each
individual and training models based on an data
that precludes variation across individual
participants  neural networks and timedependent approaches like conditional random
fields could be implemented to provide more
accurate predictions using knowledge of
previous activity annotations 
one could imagine how activity recognition
could be applied to individual healthcare  say fall
detection for the elderly or general fitness  as
well as how this recognition could be applied to
personal entertainment and recreation
