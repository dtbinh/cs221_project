we present this paper in order to suggest a new tool for political science in respect
to identifying unstable countries and their root indicators that could suggest areas
for political intervention  with more than     accuracy  we were able to predict
severely unstable political states based on countries with a fragile states index
 fsi  score of        in addition  we were able to determine the features that best
indicate a countrys instability through the use of filter feature selection 

 

introduction

everyday  political leaders around the world make decisions about international intervention  by
being able to detect trends within a nation and respond with the right political  economic  and developmental sanctions  they can avoid the use of military intervention and prevent conflict or total
governmental collapse  our motivation is to be able to capture and interpret these trends on a grand
scale and build a model that can indicate the fragility of a nation  as well as identify the crucial
indicators that attribute to its instability  currently  there are organizations that rank countries based
on their political instability  but these systems use targeted quantitative and qualitative data  and are
annual reviews rather than instantaneous predictions      we hope that by applying data mining
to a quantitative representation of country trends  we can create accurate  real time predictions of
a countrys fragility  and eventually scale to include trending news  legislative updates  and other
qualitative resources for more accurate inferences 

 
   

dataset
label   fragile states index  fsi 

we obtained our high risk classifier data from the fragile states index  fsi  which is released annually from the fund for world peace     each country is given a score based on social  economic 
political and military indicators from a variety of quantitative and qualitative sources where a low
score indicates high stability  i e  finland is     and a high score indicates low stability  i e  somalia
is       in order to conduct tests with binary classification  we categorized an unstable state as that
having an fsi score above      we chose this particular ranking system because it is a popular standard in political science and the product of two reputable organizations  foreign policy magazine
and the fund for peace    
   

data   world bank

we obtained all our data from the world bank database  which contains over      indicators for
each country with an fsi score      we have      features for our     countries with fsi scores
over   years                  our feature categories include

features and preprocessing

due to the nature of data collection in the social science field and the sheer size of our feature space 
our data set was extremely sparse  knowing this  we built and tested each model with an additional
two variations on our data     a version that corrected for the missing values by assuming linear
growth in between existing values     a version which contained the change in value from the
previous year  surprisingly  we found that the original  unmodified data set with missing values
actually had the greatest success in failed state prediction

k means

we initially began our investigation using k means due to its ability to separate data into k groups
with the hope that k means would be able to group based on stability using all features  we performed k means with cluster sizes             and     and also used correlation thresholds to improve our clusters  our best result  shown below  contained   clusters and used only the    highest
correlated features

next  we decided to use svm because of its advantage in a high dimensional feature space  in
addition to obtaining training test performance results  we created an roc curve for our our positive
classification  high risk nations

smo

we then used a variant of svm  smo in order to see if we could improve the accuracy specifically
for our positive class  with smo  we also modeled the predictive power by plotting training test
errors over an accumulation of years

smo regression

because of our success with smo  as discussed later   we decided to try smo regression to model
a non binary prediction of the fsi scores  below is the classifier error of our smo regression  with
the x axis as the actual fsi score and the y axis as the predicted fsi score  for this example  we
trained on all data from           and tested on data from

because we have over      features  we decided to run filter feature selection  we used a
correlation based feature selector with forward search in order to eliminate repetitive features on
each year and determined those that have the strongest predictive power      we display the results
of the highest correlated indicators in the table below with their respective frequencies  number of
years they were selected

discussion
k means

we found that although k means is effective in separating countries that are stable and sustainable
 fsi        it cannot make the necessary distinctions for countries that are classified as warning
and above  fsi        while countries with fsi      cluster nicely together  as seen in figure    
the other clusters contain countries whose fsi scores range from    to      this is expected  as
many extremely stable nations are very similar in the indicators provided by the world bank  while
the more unstable countries differ from each other only in a few indicators  as we are primarily
interested in classifying extremely unstable states as opposed to extremely stable ones  our k means
result is not very helpful  we clearly need an algorithm that puts more weight on the subset of
indicators that are more commonly linked to unstable states 
   

svm

svm was relatively efficient in categorizing countries as either stable or highly unstable  with high
testing accuracy           regardless of the size of the training set  however  there is one particular
phenomenon that is troubling about the svm algorithm  despite the high accuracy  as seen above 
the roc curve for svm is linear  from this  we know that the svm algorithm has a high false
negative rate  in which some of the most unstable countries were labeled stable  in all trials  nigeria
and syria were labeled stable despite having some of the most unstable  highest  fsi scores  this is
particularly concerning because they represent potential threats that would be overlooked 
   

smo

smo also had a high test accuracy           and could reasonably classify countries as stable or
unstable  although the accuracy was not quite as good as svm  the predictive power of instability
was better for highly unstable states  additionally  the roc curve for smo indicated that this
algorithm had a lower false negative rate  which allows it to more accurately label the highly unstable
states that we are targeting  with a comparable testing accuracy and a better roc curve  smo was
a more appropriate algorithm to run with our data set than svm

smo regression

we looked further in to the   outliers  bottom   points with negative fsi scores  and found they
corresponded to the us  india  and china  from right to left   although the us would have been
correctly labeled as a low risk country  china and india may have biased indicators that account
for the high error margin  as we know from filter feature selection  all of the most correlated
indicators are social or economic  india and china are outliers in these sectors  having extremely
high economic statistics and limited social indicator data 
   

feature filter selection

the indicators selected by our feature filter selection could be used to suggest political actions that
could improve a countrys stability  for example  public health expenditure  immunization  and
mortality rates are shown to be significant indicators  it is possible that addressing these concerns
directly through a focus in health programmes and related funding could have some impact in alleviating dissatisfaction leading to instability and conflict 

 

conclusions

when utilizing svm and smo to simply recognize extremely unstable countries for a given year 
we realized that while svm had better accuracy  it also resulted in a high false negative rate  given
the application of the results  the categorization of an extremely unstable state as stable results in
potentially dire consequences  as a result  we used the smo algorithm  which resulted in similar
accuracy and a lower false negative rate 
we then ran smo regression to see if we could predict country stability with a higher granularity
than binary classification  through this process  we realized the bias our algorithms and data contain 
particularly  while social factors correlate most closely with a countrys stability  many countries
lack this data  which allows other factors to have greater influence in the labeling of that country 
in particular  china and india lacked a lot of the social information needed to make an accurate
prediction of their stability and thus the algorithm depended heavily on their economic statistics 
which mirrors those of extremely stable countries 
lastly  we decided to run filter feature selection to determine the features that were most predictive
of a failed state  we discovered that health care related features and female education were strong
indicators of a politically fragile country  this finding further confirmed the biases of our data set
and algorithm  which we had begun to suspect when running smo regression 

 

future directions

a major drawback with our data is that we are using the results from possibly semi biased fsi scores
in order to train and test our data  so if we had another   months  we would work on better predicting
the scores based on more opinions than just the fsi  another source of error is the sparsely filled
data matrix from the world bank  as shown from our smo regression  if we had social data for
all countries along with the financial data  the data would appear less biased  in addition  we would
try to extend our work to continually adjust our predictions of a countrys risk based on major events
occurring in each country
